        "content": "(CNN)Right now, there's a shortage of truck drivers in the US and worldwide, exacerbated by the e-commerce boom brought on by the pandemic. One solution to the problem is autonomous trucks, and several companies are in a race to be the first to launch one. Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world's largest truck manufacturers -- Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen's trucking business, in Europe -- to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.

The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route -- from Tucson to Dallas -- the truck drove itself. Read More\"Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we're testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn't touching the wheel,\" said Cheng Lu, TuSimple's president and CEO. The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn't need to sleep. \"In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,\" said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple's trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. Picking up the watermelons still required the human touch.Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won't be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company's own software. \"We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,\" said Lu. As a result, TuSimple's trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls \"virtual railroads,\" and nowhere else. This swarm of robots gets smarter the more it worksAccording to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation's trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads. Happier drivers?The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that's still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \"If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you're adding five cents per mile. But you're saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year -- or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,\" he said. Read: A robotic 'Ironhand' could protect factory workers from injuriesThat doesn't mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the \"middle mile,\" rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. \"A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day -- that's not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,\" said Lu. TuSimple's autonomous fleet.Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \"Take Phoenix to El Paso: that's a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it's more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don't want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,\" said Lu.No distractions Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.

TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark. Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. \"The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking. They're not trying to port an autonomy system built for passenger vehicles in dense urban environments to trucking or to build a virtual driver which can both drive passenger vehicles and class-8 trucks. These are different skills and different systems altogether,\" he said. Removing the human element on long trucking routes has other benefits. The company says its trucks react 15 times faster than human drivers, and can see farther down the road, even at night. \"In the US every year there are about 5,000 fatalities involving trucks, and most are due to human error,\" said Lu. \"The truck doesn't get tired, doesn't watch a movie or look at a phone. It doesn't get distracted.\"",

There are sensors on each fingertip which switch on the motor when a user grabs an object. A remote control or app can be used to adjust the strength and sensitivity of the grip.Wester says applications include assembly on the production line in the automotive industry, using tools in construction and lifting heavy objects in warehouses.Each Ironhand system costs around \u20ac6,000 ($7,275). The device also collects data that allows the company to assess the wearer's risk of developing strain injuries.  According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, work-related neck and upper limb disorders are the most common occupational disease in Europe, costing national economies up to 2% of their gross national product.From NASA to General Motors The glove was originally intended for workers in a very different setting to the factory floor. NASA developed an early version of the technology, called \"Robo-Glove,\" to help astronauts grasp objects and carry out work in space. The Ironhand system being used for assembling parts in the automobile industry. Bioservo licensed the design in 2016 and then partnered with auto manufacturer General Motors (GM) to develop the glove for its workers. Why online supermarket Ocado wants to take the human touch out of groceries\"Ergonomics is really the field of trying to fit the jobs to the workers, instead of the workers having to conform and adapt to the job,\" says Stephen Krajcarski, a senior manager with GM's ergonomics team.\"By using tools such as the Ironhand we are really trying to mitigate any potential concerns or physical demands that may eventually cause a medical concern for that individual operator.\"  Krajcarski says GM has helped Bioservo to test and improve the Ironhand by piloting it in a variety of jobs at its manufacturing plants. He says some workers have found it easy to use but adds that it's not suitable for all situations.The Ironhand is just one of the exoskeletons GM is looking into. According to market research firm ABI Research, the exoskeleton market will grow from $392 million in 2020 to $6.8 billion in 2030.\"If you look at exoskeletons, this is just one of the tools that are out there,\" says Krajcarski. \"But this is an exciting technology.\"This story has been updated to correct the cost of the Ironhand system.",

Some have found that they love working from home and never want to step foot in an office again. Others are itching to go back -- missing the in-person collaboration and socializing with peers. And some want a little bit of both worlds.  That has prompted many workers to rethink or even switch careers and make some other big changes. Here's a look at how the pandemic reshaped people's careers in ways they never expected: Read MoreMoving cross country to start a new lifeAfter her job went fully remote, Chelsea Pruitt decided to move from California to Alabama. Chelsea Pruitt, 31, has lived in California for nearly her entire life. Now, she's headed to Alabama. Prior to the pandemic, Pruitt had thought about moving, but it wasn't until she started working remotely that the decision became a lot easier to make. \"I feel like my chapter in life in San Francisco is changing,\" she said. \"My perspective on things is changing. The things I want out of life  are changing.\"Pruitt started working for long-term housing rental company Zeus Living in January 2020, right before the pandemic hit the US. At the time, she was going into the office five days a week. But once the pandemic began to shut things down in March, she started working remotely full time. That was just what Pruitt needed to make her decision. She had visited a co-worker in Birmingham, Alabama, a few times and decided that was the place she wanted to live.\"I love the vibe of the city, the change, and I loved [that] it's more leisurely, slow and less stressful and obviously a lot more affordable [than San Francisco], which I am really excited about.\"The high cost of living in San Francisco meant she always had to have roommates. \"In San Francisco, I don't see myself being able to own a home unless I am married and have a dual income,\" she said. But since her pay will remain the same after the move to Birmingham and the cost of living will be significantly less, she'll be able to save more, and hopefully buy a home of her own and pay down her student loans.\"I am looking forward to that mental relief knowing that my cost of living is lower and I can save more,\" she said.Finally taking the leapCarlos Ortiz started his own consulting business during the pandemic. Carlos Ortiz had been working as an inspector with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 19 years before the pandemic hit. He had been considering leaving his job for a few years, but was nervous about making such a big change.  A lot of my friends are entrepreneurs and business people and I've never worked in the private industry ... so I decided, let me give it a shot\" Carlos Ortiz\"I started re-evaluating life and opportunities,\" Ortiz, 48, said of that time. \"[But] I was very comfortable getting a paycheck every two weeks.\"But in April 2020, when businesses were shutting their offices down across the country, he realized he wanted more control over his life -- especially when it came to his work. So he began planning the launch of his own business.\"A lot of my friends are entrepreneurs and business people and I've never worked in the private industry ... so I decided, let me give it a shot,\" he said.At the start of 2021, he quit his full-time job and launched a consulting business to advise companies on how to comply with government regulations. To help provide some financial cushion as he launched the new venture, Ortiz had been saving up unused leave, which he got paid out for when he left his job.At first, \"it was very scary,\" he said. Now, he's making slightly less than he was at his old job, but he's only working 20 hours a week. Ortiz said he also has more control over his schedule, and since most of his business is done over the phone and on video calls, he's been able to work from anywhere. So far, he's worked from Geneva, Switzerland, San Antonio and Anchorage, Alaska.\"I am getting back into my art and reading a lot more ... and exercising a lot more. And I am doing my chores as I've always done, but now I am just not exhausted.\"Enjoying the hybrid lifeAfter working from home for two years, John Pearson missed the collaboration and socialization that happens in the office.John Pearson used to have a hard deadline of 6:00 a.m. in order to be out of his driveway and on his way to work each morning.\"Otherwise, the commute goes from an hour to something much worse,\" said Pearson, 55, who is a senior vice president at PTC, an industrial software company in Boston. But for the past two years, his commute has been a quick walk down the hall to his home office. I can get through more complex problem solving much faster in a room with two or three people and a whiteboard than I can through Zoom\" John PearsonAt first, he said he was more productive and less distracted when working from home. But now that he has periodically started going into the office, he realizes there are some advantages to in-person work. \"I can get through more complex problem solving much faster in a room with two or three people and a whiteboard than I can through Zoom,\" he said.He also realized he missed talking to people in the office about simple things, like their kids or what they've been watching on TV. \"When you are jumping from 30-minute call to 30-minute call on video, you just don't do that as much.\"His company plans to offer a flexible model to its employees -- something Pearson prefers. His goal is to be in the office two to three days a week. And as much as he didn't like the commute, he started to realize the role it played. \"It really is a firm break in which you walk away and you close your laptop.\"The WFH convertRashmi Bhankhede used to prefer being in the office five days a week. Now she hopes to work remotely full-time.Rashmi Bhankhede never really liked the idea of working from home. \"Before the pandemic...I definitely preferred working face-to-face in this open-office environment,\" she said. \"I thought it was the most productive way for everyone.\" As a senior manager of software engineering at Capital One, she manages two teams. She used to want her teams to come into the office to collaborate, discuss projects, hold feedback sessions and interact on a more social level. But the pandemic has changed her approach. It doesn't matter where you are. If you have good processes to connect with your peers and [direct] reports, working remote can be very productive\"  Rashmi Bhankhede After two years of working from home, she's hoping to make remote work permanent. Capital One has said it will be on a hybrid schedule when it reopens its offices. \"It doesn't matter where you are. If you have good processes to connect with your peers and [direct] reports, working remote can be very productive,\" said Bhankhede, 43.She added that the flexibility helps her manage her time better and that her team has become closer -- even though they haven't seen each other in person for two years. To better define the boundary between work and her personal life, Bhankhede gets dressed in her work clothes every morning and changes at the end of the day, followed by a relaxing activity like a walk. Working from home has also meant spending more time with her two sons and learning new hobbies since she no longer has to commute. \"I started growing peppers and tomatoes and cucumbers ... and got back into sewing,\" she said. \"I am still not good at it.\"Turning a hobby into a new career Cody Irion went back to school and switched careers during the pandemic.The pandemic hit right as Cody Irion's busy season was about to start. In 2020, he owned a horse transportation business in North Carolina. Typically, April through August were his most lucrative months, but when stay-at-home orders started sweeping the US, he quickly decided to close his business, sell the equipment and go back to school to get a degree in computer science. \"I had the choice of going into a massive amount of debt to keep going or change careers,\" said Irion, 35. \"I had started learning software development as a hobby and I really enjoyed it, so I didn't hesitate.\" He enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and since the majority of his classes have been virtual, he didn't have to move closer to campus until his final year, saving him a lot of money. He also believes he had more internship opportunities last summer since so many companies were still operating remotely.Irion is set to graduate this May and already has a job lined up at a financial services company. \"I had never even considered software engineering before I started it as a hobby because I grew up in Southern Illinois with race horses,\" he said. \"I knew nothing about the industry other than I liked computers and I started learning it and realized I was pretty good at it.\" Turning a side business into a full-time job Mabel Frias (pictured on the left with her sister) left her full-time job during the pandemic to fully commit to her side business, Luna Magic. Mabel Frias had been juggling two jobs at the beginning of the pandemic, but eventually had to make a decision: stay with the security and safety of her full-time job or pursue a riskier life as an entrepreneur. In March 2020, Frias was a little more than a year into working what she described as her \"dream job\" as director of digital merchandising at lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty. Meanwhile, she was also trying to grow Luna Magic, a beauty brand she launched with her sister in 2019.But as the pandemic forced many workers to do their jobs remotely, Luna Magic started gaining more traction and demanding more of her time. \"Because we were in a Zoom culture, people still wanted from the face up to look good. You still wanted to have a level of presentation while you are on the screen,\" Frias, 35, said. While working two jobs meant long hours during the week and weekends, Frias was nervous about leaving her full-time job and the financial security it brought. So she set certain benchmarks for Luna Magic to hit, including partnerships and business opportunities, before she could feel comfortable walking away. \"Part of the challenges a lot of entrepreneurs have is they jump to soon,\" she said. \"I don't like to have economic anxiety. I am also a mother and practical about these things.\"Soon enough, the company was meeting her goals. In 2020, Walmart.com started selling the company's products, which includes makeup and other cosmetics. And in 2021, Walmart and Target started carrying products in some stores, as well as online. \"I had to trust myself. I liked the idea of growing something from scratch,\" she said. In 2020, Frias applied to be on ABC's Shark Tank and was accepted. The show, which features entrepreneurs pitching their businesses to a panel of investors, aired in January 2021 -- the same day Frias quit her job. \"I love the magic of creating something out of nothing. I saw our company as we get to bring even more beauty into the world at a moment when people are looking for it,\" Frias said.Just graduated and can't wait to work in personRachel Zipfel started her new job working  fully remote, but hopes to eventually be in the office five days a week.Rachel Zipfel finished her college courses in the same place she started her first full-time job: in a room at her parents' house. Zipfel, 23, graduated from the University of Missouri, St. Louis in August 2021 with a degree in marketing. But because of the pandemic, her classes were remote for nearly her last two years of college. She's now working remotely for a digital marketing agency and has met her colleagues roughly five times in person. She feels like working from home has made it harder to get acclimated to the working world. When she first started, she found it challenging to learn the ropes. \"If you are trying to ask someone a question, you don't know what they are doing on the other side of the computer, so what could be a five-minute question in person [could turn] into maybe two hours of waiting for an answer,\" she said.Zipfel started going into the office about once a week in January, and said she feels more productive. She hopes to eventually be there five days a week. \"I've noticed a world of difference,\" she said. \"There are none of the distractions that are at home. It's so much easier to get work done. If the person is there that I need to talk to I can get my question answered in five seconds versus two hours. I love being in the office and I cant wait for it to be back open again.\"Quit a job that wanted him back in the office When Ryan Bernsten found out his employer wanted him to come back into the office, he found a new job.Ryan Bernsten had only been working at his new job as a copywriter for a few weeks in March 2020 when he was sent home to work remotely.At the time, he was worried about how it would work. \"Work from home? What would that even look like? I am going to miss out on all the social interaction -- I am new here,\" he recalled. If they aren't going to validate that I enjoy working from home, that I am better at home, and I enjoy my lifestyle at home, I need to find a job that will,\"Ryan BernstenBut eventually he adapted. Now two years later, he prefers remote work. Working from home, he said, enables him to be more productive and have a better work-life balance. So when he learned he was going to be required to return to the office a few days a week, he started looking for a new job that allowed him to stay remote. \"If they aren't going to validate that I enjoy working from home, that I am better at home, and I enjoy my lifestyle at home, I need to find a job that will,\" he said.  It took him less than a month to get a new, fully remote job.\"I never ever have to go back to the office,\" Bernsten, 29, said. \"You get to see people at their best. If we fly to San Francisco for a meeting, the adrenaline is there, we are excited to see people, we're going to make it count. But you don't have to see people every day ... when they have a cold, are in a bad mood or in a fight with their partner.\"  And not only did he get added flexibility, he also got a higher salary. \"I don't believe everyone needs to work from home,\" he said. \"But some people work better from home. I never wake up dreading work because I am in the comfort of my home.\" Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how long Mabel Frias worked at her previous employer.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Burger King is trying to suspend its operations in Russia, but that's proving difficult. A business partner controlling 800 restaurants has \"refused\" to close them, the company said.The burger chain, owned by Restaurant Brands International (QSR), has a joint venture partnership with businessman Alexander Kolobov in Russia. RBI controls just 15% of its Russian Burger King business, and Kolobov is responsible for the \"day-to-day operations and oversight\" of its locations in the country.That means Burger King can't just snap its fingers and close up shop. \"We started the process to dispose [of] our ownership stake in the business,\" said David Shear, president of RBI's international operations, in an open letter. \"While we would like to do this immediately, it is clear that it will take some time to do so based on the terms of our existing joint venture agreement.\"A Burger King restaurant at a St. Petersburg shopping center. McDonald's (MCD), by contrast, owns more than 80% of its restaurants in Russia outright. That made exiting the country significantly easier.Read MoreShear said that RBI has \"demanded\" that the joint venture immediately close the Burger Kings, but Kolobov has \"refused to do so.\" Burger King entered Russia about a decade ago, operating the joint venture with Kolobov, Investment Capital Ukraine and VTB Capital, a Russian bank that has been hit with sanctions.Shear explained that a \"complicated legal process\" is preventing it from shutting down the partnership and businesses. McDonald's transformed Russia ... now it's abandoning the country\"There are no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,\" Shear said. \"No serious investor in any industry in the world would agree to a long-term business relationship with flimsy termination clauses.\"Last week, Burger King pulled corporate support from its businesses in Russia, including suspending operations, marketing and supply chain assistance.This issue highlights the problems some Western companies and banks face in pulling out of Russia, complicated by joint ventures or partnerships that they don't have complete control over. For example, a Papa Johns (PZZA) franchisee in Russia refused to close about 200 locations even after the pizza chain suspended corporate support for it.",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.The White House spent much of Friday frustrated by an Axios report that it believes was based on a fabricated letter purportedly written by Ukraine's top national security official. The Axios story, written by reporter Zachary Basu, said that Oleksiy Danilov had asked the US earlier this month \"to go beyond traditional military aid and provide the country with the funding, training and weaponry to support a long-term resistance movement.\" But Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova later told Axios that she believed the letter was \"falsified.\" And officials at the National Security Council also told Axios they have no record of receiving such a letter from Danilov.Here's what I have gathered after talking to a senior administration official familiar with the matter: White House and CIA officials told Axios off the record on Thursday that they had no record of receiving Danilov's supposed letter and that they could not confirm its authenticity. In other words, they tried to wave Basu away from it. When Basu published his report anyway, the White House connected the outlet with Markarova so that she could relay that she believed it to be inauthentic. Markarova did so on Friday. Meanwhile, the White House repeatedly asked Axios to retract its story \u2014 all to no avail. \"We were appalled that Axios apparently did not have time to verify with Ukrainian officials whether or not this letter was a fake, but made sure to reach out to a former Trump official with no knowledge of the situation for a 'gotcha' quote,\" the senior admin official told me. \"And then we were even more appalled it stayed up all day despite our repeated asks to take the story down when became obvious the letter was a fake \u2014 which Axios should have dug up before publishing in the first place.\"Read MoreShortly after I contacted Axios for comment Friday evening, the outlet updated its story. Axios changed the headline \u2014 which initially read \"Scoop: Ukraine sought long-term resistance funding\" \u2014 to \"Ukraine's ambassador disputes letter asking U.S. for resistance support.\" The new story, which included Markarova saying the document appeared \"falsified,\" cited a \"former senior Ukrainian official close to Danilov\" who told Axios \"that they had received the letter from Danilov's office, and that it was also distributed to Ukrainian American groups and think tank experts in Washington.\" But crucially, the source also told Axios that he or she could not confirm the letter was officially transmitted to the US government \u2014 essentially the crux of the initial story.Notably, at that point, the article didn't include a correction or retraction, despite it seemingly having no real legs to stand on. Later in the evening, a proper correction was ultimately appended to the top of the story. It read, in part, \"This corrects an original version of this story that stated the Ukrainian government 'asked' for additional assistance from the U.S. government, when Axios was unable to confirm the letter was actually sent.\" Still, given that Axios is now conceding it was \"unable to confirm\" the main point of its initial story, it is surprising that a more forceful correction or full retraction wasn't issued.NSC spokesperson Emily Horne went on the record about the whole episode. In a statement to me, she said, \"We told Axios that we had not received this letter and were unable to verify its authenticity. There's a lot of disinformation and misinformation being pushed around about Ukraine right now. This is a moment where taking the extra time to verify reporting is even more essential than usual.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)In 2018, Kohl's was a bright spot in the beleaguered department store sector.Sales were growing, Kohl's (KSS) stock price was booming and new CEO Michelle Gass was earning widespread praise for her creative approach, including partnering with Amazon (AMZN) to offer free Amazon returns at Kohl's stores.Out of the three largest US department store chains \u2014 Kohl's, Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) \u2014 Kohl's looked to be in the strongest position.Not anymore. Kohl's is in turmoil today. The chain's sales are lower than before the pandemic, despite strong consumer spending and as its rivals enjoy big gains. Activist investors are circling Kohl's and demanding leadership changes. A sale of the company could be on the horizon.Read More\"We see a company that's lost its way,\" said Jonathan Duskin, managing partner at Macellum Advisors, an activist investment firm that has become Kohl's third largest shareholder.Kohl's is under heavy pressure from investors and retail rivals.Macellum and a group of activist investors took a stake in Kohl's last year. The group reached a settlement with Kohl's in April, but Macellum has recently revived its effort to overhaul Kohl's because of continued stock price weakness and market share losses.Kohl's \"should be doing better than Macy's, not worse,\" Duskin said. \"We see a lot of initiatives that sound okay, but never really result in growth.\"In a statement, a Kohl's spokesperson blasted Macellum, saying the firm was \"using a misinformed, shifting and hollow narrative\" to push for changes that would not improve Kohl's and result in \"poorly qualified and inexperienced\" board directors.The spokesperson said Kohl's has made \"substantial progress in transforming our business and positioning the Company for long-term success.\"\"We are already delivering results,\" the spokesperson added, pointing to the company's record earnings in 2021, operating profit margins  reached two years ahead of schedule and an increase in the company's quarterly dividend.Kohl's is attempting yet another makeover to turn things around, but its  success is far from guaranteed.Fighting the tideWith more than 1,100 US stores and around $19 billion in annual sales, Kohl's is the largest department store chain in the United States.The department store sector has been in structural decline for years against pressure from Amazon, growing big-box chains including Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), and discount clothing stores like TJMaxx. Companies such as Sears, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Barney's and others have filed for bankruptcy in recent years. Department stores including Kohl's have been undercut on prices by discount players from the bottom, and prestige by luxury stores at the top, said John Fisher, a senior lecturer at Boston College's Carroll School of Management and former CEO of Saucony running shoes.\"It's hard to be unique,\" Fisher said. \"I think Kohl's is caught right now by death in the middle.\"Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass has been considered one of the most innovative executives in retail.Kohl's has lost around 17% of its market share since 2011, primarily to off-price retailers such as TJMaxx (TJX), as well as Amazon, according to UBS.\"[F]orces like consumers' migration to online and preference for value have contributed to this erosion,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a recent report. \"This will likely continue after the pandemic.\"Since Gass, a former top deputy to Howard Schultz at Starbucks (SBUX), took over as Kohl's CEO in 2018, the company has attempted a handful of approaches to draw customers and stave off competitors.In addition to the returns partnership with Amazon, Kohl's expanded its athleisure clothing business with brands such as Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA). Kohl's also shrunk the size of a handful of stores and leased out the extra space to Aldi and Planet Fitness, made a bigger play for Millennials with new brands such as PopSugar and, more recently, opened Sephora beauty stores inside Kohl's.These strategies have not led to major improvements. Kohl's has improved its athleisure business and other areas, but its women's clothing business has slumped. In 2018, sales inched up 0.7% from the prior year. In 2019, they dropped 1.2% before plunging 20% in 2020 due to store closures and Covid-19 restrictions.Last year, after stores reopened and shoppers refreshed their wardrobes, sales bounced back 23%  \u2014 but that was still below pre-pandemic levels.Competition has become more cutthroat in the four years since Gass took over, and \"a lot of Kohl's stores feel tired,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData. \"It has been very easy for customers to switch away from Kohl's to others offering something better.\"And brand partnerships with Amazon and Sephora do not address core issues, he added. \"Kohl's needs to look to improving its own brand rather than relying on others to lift it.\"A sale looming?Over the last few months, activist investors have been pressing for changes at Kohl's. One firm, Engine Capital, urged Kohl's to spin off its e-commerce business from its stores or find a buyer to take the company private. \"Even the most patient long-term shareholders cannot be expected to endure the punishing underperformance and perpetual value disconnect seen at Kohl's,\" Engine Capital said in December. A month later, Macellum Advisors said it would nominate a slate of new board members at Kohl's because Kohl's board and leadership \"spent another year materially mismanaging the business.\" Private equity firms  also made buyout offers for Kohl's, which the company rejected.To fight off pressure, Kohl's last week laid out plans for a \"complete reinvention of our business model and our brand\" at an investor day. JCPenney and Tide tried to get rid of coupons. It was a disasterKohl's said it would add Sephora mini-shops to roughly 75% of its 1,100 US stores, open 100 new locations at half the size of its traditional outlets in the next four years and increase its popular Kohl's Cash rewards program to 7.5% on purchases, up from 5%. Kohl's also unveiled new strategies to grow online, including self-service for pickup orders and returns.\"We're evolving our position from a department store to a more focused lifestyle concept centered around the active and casual lifestyle,\" Gass said in a presentation.But to Duskin at Macellum Advisors, the plan was \"disappointing.\"He believes the strategy won't meaningfully change how consumers see Kohl's \u2014 and he says it's time for a new board and, possibly, a new CEO. Kohl's has not fully taken advantage of its stores being located away from traditional malls, which are losing foot traffic, he said, and he  questions whether the investment in Sephora is worth the cost.Kohl's said last week that it has engaged with more than 20 potential buyers for the company, a sign of wide interest. Hudson's Bay Co., the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, also is considering a bid, Axios reported Wednesday.Kohl's board has an \"ongoing dialogue with potential bidders\" and will measure any offers against its own \"compelling standalone plan,\" a spokesperson said.Duskin expects Kohl's to accept a buyout offer, he said. \"This company can easily be turned around.\"",

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Budweiser's slogan, the \"King of Beers,\" is as recognizable as its Clydesdales. But it wasn't always those exact words.Let's start from the beginning: German immigrant Adolphus Busch arrived in the United States in 1857. A few years later, he married Lilly Anheuser and began working at his father-in-law's brewery. The brewery, renamed Anheuser-Busch in 1879, pioneered the pasteurization technology that allowed Budweiser to be shipped across the United States without spoiling, according to its website. Budweiser, which traces its name back to the Czech Republic town of Budweis, became the first nationally distributed beer. During this period, draught kegs and glass bottles were the only packaging formats available to brewers. Budweiser was primarily sold bottled, so the original slogan was actually the \"King of Bottled Beer.\"A \"King of Bottled Beer\" cardboard sign from the 1930s.\"By specifically mentioning bottles in the 'King of Bottled Beer' slogan, Budweiser communicated the overall strength of the brand as well a defining feature separating Budweiser from some of its competitors,\" a spokesperson for Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) told CNN Business. The slogan was tweaked to \"King of All Bottled Beers\" as competition grew. Then prohibition happened, banning the production, importation, sale and transportation of alcohol in the US from 1920 to 1933. Read MoreThe company survived by making alternative products, such as soft drinks and \"near-beer,\" which had a very low (and legal) alcohol content. After the ban was lifted, the slogan \"King of Bottled Beer\" returned and Anheuser-Busch once again began brewing its signature brand. A bottle of Budweiser beer.The slogan was changed to the \"King of Beers\" in the mid-twentieth century as aluminum cans became a more popular form of packaging. It's still in use today and is featured predominately on Budweiser labels. The slogan hasn't been technically true for a while, however. Budweiser was the country's top-selling beer until 2001, when it relinquished that crown to its sister brand, Bud Light. Shifting consumer tastes to lower-calorie options, such as spiked seltzer, as well as the increasing popularity of premium liquors, has also dented Bud's popularity.",

        "content": "New Delhi (CNN Business)Indian businesswoman Swati Daga first bought bitcoin in 2017, when the cryptocurrency was trading well under $3,000. Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls. \"The elders in my family told me not to throw my money away,\" said Daga, who runs a food business near New Delhi.But the 33-year-old hasn't regretted her decision \u2014 bitcoin's value has increased 15 times since then \u2014 and she continues to invest as much as 10% of her savings in cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum. \"I find stock markets boring,\" she told CNN Business, adding that she enjoys the \"thrill\" and \"recklessness\" that comes with investing in volatile currencies.  She is not the only one.  Read MoreIndia has seen a huge boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia's third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even flirted with banning them. Entrepreneurs in the industry told CNN Business that the country has the potential to become a crypto superpower, since it is one of the hottest internet markets in the world, with 750 million users, and hundreds of millions more yet to come online for the first time. India ranked second behind only Vietnam last year in a list of countries seeing the fastest growth in cryptocurrency adoption, according to a report published in October by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.While the government does not keep estimates of how many people trade cryptocurrencies, industry experts have suggested that the country may now have more than 20 million crypto investors. The growth is driven by younger investors \u2014 mostly under the age of 35 \u2014 and many of them are coming from smaller cities and towns, founders of two of India's biggest crypto exchanges told CNN Business. According to Sumit Gupta, CEO and co-founder of exchange CoinDCX, many Indian millennials have started \"their investing journey with crypto.\"While 20 years ago, their parents chose to invest in gold, these youngsters \"are more interested in having bitcoin as part of their portfolio,\" Gupta told CNN Business, referring to the fact that traditionally Indians chose to park their money in gold or savings accounts. Buying gold is both an investment and a cultural habit in India, which is one of the largest markets for the precious metal, according to the World Gold Council. It also considered auspicious by Hindus and Jains, and plays a fundamental role in many religious ceremonies.Mumbai-based CoinDCX became India's first crypto unicorn last year, achieving a valuation of $1.1 billion after raising money from investors such as Coinbase Ventures and B Capital Group. The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34. The CoinDCX app is seen on a phone screen in West Bengal, India, in August 2021.Data shared by rival firm WazirX tell a similar story. WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a \"phenomenal year\" for crypto trading in India. The company was acquired by Binance, one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, in 2019.Over 65% of its users are under the age of 35, according to a recent company report, and it has seen a \"700% increase in the number of participants from smaller cities like Guwahati, Karnal, Bareilly, thereby signaling the growing interest from rural and semi-urban areas.\" Pritish Kumawat, a crypto trader from a small town in the western state of Rajasthan, said that he now finds conversations about cryptocurrencies in almost every tea shop in his area. Often, the most engaged participants are college students, he said, adding that bitcoin's massive spike last year has fueled the frenzy in India. In November, bitcoin was trading at a record high of $68,990, but it has since fallen to around $43,000. In addition to bitcoin, meme currencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu are also popular among Indians, the WazirX report added. Apart from investors from smaller towns, both companies saw an increase of more than 1000% in the number of women users on their platforms, albeit on a small base.Gupta said that participation of crypto by Indian women has seen \"a massive upside\" in the past 18 months and is \"fairly high, fairly healthy, relative to equity markets.\" The company's data shows that 15% of their overall users are women \u2014 which is the global trend as well.On-again, off-again relationshipThe excitement over crypto is rising in India despite the country's on-again, off-again relationship with digital currencies. The central bank has long expressed concerns that cryptocurrencies can be used for money laundering and to finance terrorism. A cryptically worded proposal posted on the Indian parliament website last year even suggested the government was exploring plans to \"prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India.\"This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced it would impose a 30% tax on income from virtual digital assets, which many industry experts took as a sign that crypto trading won't be banned after all. The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months. \"Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction. It gives much-needed clarity and confidence to the industry,\" Gupta said at the time of the announcement.Siddharth Menon, the co-founder of WazirX, told CNN Business that following the announcement, his platform saw daily sign-ups jump by over 50%. He also noticed rising interest among Indian developers and other professionals in joining the crypto industry. WazirX's website is shown in New York, USA, in April 2021.\"I'm getting LinkedIn messages\" from senior executives in India, who are now more optimistic about the business, he said. In the past, Indian exchanges have struggled to hire and retain experienced people due to the lack of clear regulations. But the Indian government soon put a damper on the mood, by clarifying that the cryptocurrencies are not yet legal in the country.\"I am not doing anything to legalize it or ban it or not legalize it,\" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in parliament a few days after announcing the tax rate. \"Banning or not banning will come subsequently ... But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.\" \"I think the government is not entirely sure what it wants to do from a policy perspective,\" said Anirudh Rastogi, founder of tech law firm Ikigaw Law, which works with crypto exchanges in India.\"It knows where it wants to land broadly. It wants to find the right balance where it is not disconnected from the global progress in blockchain and other tech, but it wants to also address concerns regarding cryptocurrency.\"Rastogi added that the \"extraordinarily high\" tax on crypto is a short-term fix, which will also acts as a deterrent to many investors. \"This rate is typically used to tax activities that are not considered economically productive, such as lottery,\" he said. \"So this could be an indication that the government wants to make revenue, but it does not see crypto trading as economically productive.\"For equities, India applies a 15% short-term capital gains tax if shares are sold in less than a year, and 10% if sold after a year.Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon. India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a \"superpower in the next five to 10 years,\" in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \"What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,\" he added.",

        "content": "As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.Adar Poonawalla \u2014 the CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker \u2014 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into his Indian manufacturing facility and committed to make millions of doses of a then-unproven coronavirus vaccine. That vaccine, created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (AZN), was still in clinical trials at the time. Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \"It was a calculated risk,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business. \"But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, chose to commit to making a vaccine while it was still in clinical trials.To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet's most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. Read MoreAs the world gave its money \u2014 and trust \u2014 to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. \"It was a calculated risk. But I didn't see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I'd regret not committing one way or another.\"SII CEO Adar Poonawalla, on committing his company to make millions of doses of a then-unproven Covid vaccineBut soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. His company's ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He's also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations \u2014 the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. From horse breeders to vaccine makersIt's easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company \u2014 which was founded by Poonawalla's father, Cyrus, 55 years ago \u2014 produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world's babies depend on vaccines made at SII. The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world's preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.Cyrus Poonawalla is now India's seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. More than $250 million came from the company's own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would \"just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,\" Poonawalla said.Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on materials including chemicals and glass vials to prepare for vaccine production.A business studies graduate of London's University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \"The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,\" said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. India's Covid-19 tsunamiBut Poonawalla's plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. At that point, only 2% percent of India's 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country's national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.A brutal second wave of Covid-19 hit India in spring 2021.\"I've always been a patriot for my country ... and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,\" Poonawalla said. \"There was no two ways about that.\"The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa's disease control body, for example, warned India's hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. At the start of 2021, \"very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,\" the spokesperson said, adding that it was \"natural\" that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \"Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,\" said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.Being held to accountWhile Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling \u2014 chief among them, India's massive outbreak \u2014 his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. They point out Poonawalla hasn't delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn't been transparent about how he's been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.\"There isn't much accountability for where the money he raised went,\" Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren't impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. SII declined to comment on the amount it has made from its vaccine production so far. Poonawalla called it \"very unreasonable and naive\" for people to expect companies not to profit from these efforts.The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII's problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company's Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.He also insists he was realistic about his goals. \"We always underpromise,\" Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. Still, he's been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India's Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a \"philanthropic gesture\" \u2014 leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.\"AstraZeneca has pledged that it won't make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,\" Aisola said. According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a \"very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world\" for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October \u2014 about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It's also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)In the Swiss municipality of Arbedo-Castione, a 70-meter crane stands tall. Six arms protrude from the top, hoisting giant blocks into the sky. But these aren't building blocks, and the crane isn't being used for construction. The steel tower is a giant mechanical energy storage system, designed by American-Swiss startup Energy Vault, that relies on gravity and 35-ton bricks to store and release energy. When power demand is low, the crane uses surplus electricity from the Swiss grid to raise the bricks and stack them at the top. When power demand rises, the bricks are lowered, releasing kinetic energy back to the grid. It might sound like a school science project, but this form of energy storage could be vital as the world transitions to clean energy.35-ton blocks, made of recycled or locally sourced materials, are raised to the top of the crane where they store energy.\"There's a big push to get renewables deployed,\" Robert Piconi, founder of Energy Vault, tells CNN Business, adding that companies are under increasing pressure from governments, investors and employees to decarbonize.Read MoreBut relying on renewables for consistent power is impossible without energy storage, he says. Unlike a fossil fuel power station, which can operate night and day, wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that if a cloud blocks the sun or there's a lull in the wind, electricity generation drops.To compete with fossil fuels, you need to \"make renewables predictable,\" says Piconi, which means storing excess energy and being able to dispatch it when required. Battery alternativesOne solution to this problem is lithium-ion batteries, which are already linked up to power grids worldwide. They can be charged using electricity generated from wind and solar and release that energy on demand. The technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades, says Dan Shreve, global head of energy storage at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consultancy firm. For the most part, they have been used for short-term energy storage (up to six hours), he says, and as decarbonization ramps up, demand for more durable storage will rise.Another drawback is that lithium is a limited resource, found only in certain parts of the world, and mining it can harm the environment. While the cost of batteries has plummeted over the last decade, prices started to soar in 2021 as lithium demand outstripped supply. For these reasons, Piconi says that while batteries are great for electric cars or computer electronics, they're not \"ideal for large utility-scale trade.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, Energy Vault decided to base its technology on a method developed over 100 years ago, which is widely used to store renewable energy: pumped storage hydropower. During off-peak periods, a turbine pumps water from a reservoir on low ground to one on higher ground, and during periods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down through the turbine, generating electrical energy. Piconi says Energy Vault relies on gravity in the same way, but \"instead of using water, we're using these composite blocks.\" By doing it this way, he says the company is not dependent on topography and doesn't have to dig out reservoirs or create dams, which can have negative effects on the environment. \"Simple and elegant\"Since Energy Vault established its successful prototype in Switzerland in 2020, the company has pivoted from the tower model design, which could reach up to 200 meters in height, to 20-story modular buildings it calls \"Energy Vault Resiliency Centers.\" Piconi says the company received feedback from potential clients that the tower was \"too tall\" and might not comply with international building codes.Energy Vault pivoted its design from giant cranes to vast energy storage buildings, as shown in this rendering.The resiliency centers will use the same bricks, made from soil and waste products, and the buildings will be around 100 meters tall. Bricks will move up and down inside the building on trolleys, controlled by an artificial intelligence system that identifies optimal times for charging or discharging energy, depending on supply and demand.The centers will vary in footprint, possibly covering between 1.5 and 20 acres depending on the storage capacity, he adds. But they are likely to be installed in places where space isn't an issue, such as near existing wind or solar plants. Energy Vault's technology is \"simple and elegant,\" says Shreve, but he questions whether the devices can compete with lithium-ion batteries on price. Even so, the market is hungry for battery alternatives. While other startups \u2014 such as UK-based Gravitricity, which drops weights down disused mineshafts \u2014 are also exploring gravity-based energy storage, none yet match the scale of Energy Vault.In February, Energy Vault listed on the New York stock exchange, raising approximately $235 million. It recently announced that actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had joined the company's strategic advisory board. Energy Vault's resiliency centers will be linked up to nearby wind or solar farms, as shown in this rendering. Credit: Energy Vault\nThis year, Energy Vault will start building resiliency centers for DG fuels, which wants a continuous supply of renewable energy to create green hydrogen fuel for the aviation industry. It has also signed deals worth up to $880 million with companies including Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, metal smelting company Korea Zinc, and mining giant BHP. With this backing, Piconi is confident Energy Vault can help to accelerate the energy transition.So far, customers have signed up to projects that equate to 2.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage \u2014 a significant addition to the 17 gigawatt hours of battery storage that Wood Mackenzie estimates is currently in operation in the United States. \"In terms of impact, that's pretty massive,\" says Piconi.",

        "content": "(CNN Business)The wearables market skyrocketed over the last three years, and consumers are projected to spend nearly a $100 billion on devices ranging from smartwatches to smart patches in 2022.Now, one tech startup wants to take wearables to another market: cows. Bangalore-based Stellapps is a farm-to-consumer digital platform that uses technology to track milk on its journey through the supply chain. \"We have a device which is like a Fitbit for cattle,\" says Ranjith Mukundan, co-founder and CEO of Stellapps. The company's \"mooON\" device \"goes around the animal's leg, and [tracks] their activity levels,\" he says.When cows are sick, they move less, and when they are ovulating, they move more, says Mukundan. Stellapps combines information from the step trackers with data that farmers and vets enter into a smartphone app, which issues reminders for routine protocols such as vaccinations and artificial insemination. Healthier cows produce more milk, and by tracking and better managing their animals, farmers can increase yields, says Mukundan.Read MoreBut Stellapps isn't just creating step counters: the mooON device is one small part of a much bigger initiative to transform the world's largest dairy industry with smart tech.Farmers bring milk to village collection centers where it is weighed, analyzed and priced. This is also where farmers receive payment for their milk. Digitizing dairyFounded in 2011, Stellapps' technology is currently used by nearly three million dairy farmers across 36,000 villages in India, accounting for over 13.5 million liters of milk daily, according to Mukundan.In October 2021, the company raised $18 million, led by Dutch animal nutrition company Nutreco, which joined existing investors including the Gates Foundation and Blume Ventures. In India, farmers typically deliver milk to collection points in nearby villages. Here, Stellapps uses an ultrasonic analyzer to measure the nutritional content of the milk \u2014 allowing standardized price-setting and giving farmers updates on their cows' health and nutritional needs. The company measures the volume of milk collected with a digital scale and transfers payments directly to farmers' bank accounts via its \"mooPay\" platform.Milk of similar quality is then combined in digitally tagged 40-liter cannisters and sent to a larger, centralized cold storage unit. At the unit, volume sensors monitor the milk to prevent it from being watered down or stolen, says Mukundan. From there, the milk is taken to a processing plant to be pasteurized and packaged, or converted into products like cheese or yogurt. Mukundan says Stellapps can bring traceability into India's dairy industry, enabling the company to \"vouch for every glass of milk.\" India is the world's largest dairy producer, and companies like Stellapps hope to make it more efficient with technology. A fragmented industryIndia is home to the world's large milk industry, producing 199 million metric tons in 2021.But dairy hasn't always been a staple in India, which relied on milk imports until 1970, when a rural development program called \"Operation Flood\" overhauled the industry.This made milk more affordable, providing a good source of protein, as well as reducing poverty in rural communities, says Thanammal Ravichandran, a dairy economist, and program manager for dairy at food producers ABT Foods. The program also turned India into a \"milk-exporting country.\"An Indian startup could revolutionize ocean farming with its 'sea combine harvester'But despite its size, India's dairy industry is still fragmented and largely unindustrialized, says Ravichandran. Around 80% of dairy animals in India belong to smallholders who own only two to three cows. In contrast, the average size of a dairy herd in the United States was 296 cows in 2020. On the small Indian farms, productivity is often low, Ravichandran adds. On average, dairy cows in India produced five liters per day in 2019, compared to more than 30 liters daily for the United States' top dairy cows.Stellapps is not the only Indian startup looking to modernize the industry through smart technology. Like Stellapps, Prompt has created cow pedometers to monitor health and breeding cycles, and Ravichandran points to Farmtree by Inhof Technologies, which uses data to work out the efficiency and value of small farms, and Herdman by Vetware, which offers a subscription model to track data for more than one million animals. \"Data can help to transform the industry,\" she says. The step tracker is tamper-proof, and Stellapps says it could help insurers identify and monitor cows.An expanding platformStellapps does not charge farmers for its technology and advisory services. Instead, it monetizes its product through the cooperatives that purchase the milk and additional service providers, like insurance and animal nutrition companies.Mukundan says the company is eyeing the retail end of the supply chain, too. It's developing a portal that maps the origin and journey of milk, which he believes will appeal to quality-conscious consumers.By bringing more dairy farms onto the platform, Mukundan hopes he can improve life for farmers while making India's milk products tastier and more nutritious. \"Consumers are willing to pay more so that when they give it to their kids at home, they're absolutely confident that it's the best milk possible,\" he says.",

In the shade of the awning, customers eat standing up. They're perhaps unaware that the paper plates they're using are made of palm leaves.   The plates are produced by Bollant Industries, a local company that makes eco-friendly and disposable products and packaging from the fallen leaves of areca, a species of palm, as well as recycled paper.\"I call myself a waste person, because I really love waste,\" CEO Srikanth Bolla says. \"I want to recycle all the waste that I can in this world\"Now aged 30, Bolla, who has been blind since birth, founded the company in 2012 to pioneer sustainability and to provide jobs for people with disabilities. His company currently employs around 400 people, a quarter of whom have disabilities, Bolla says. \"Our core vision is to employ as many people as possible who are at the margins of society,\" Bolla says.\n\n\nStaff operate hand presses to transform used paper into colorful plates. Credit: CNNRead MoreHis efforts have attracted attention: In 2021, the World Economic Forum named Bolla one of its Young Global Leaders and a Bollywood biopic about him starring actor Rajkummar Rao is in the works.Valued at $65 million, with funding from investors including Indian industrialist Ratan Tata, Bollant Industries operates seven manufacturing plants, producing hundreds of tons of products each month, ranging from tableware to packaging. It's part of a wider shift in India, as the country transitions away from single-use plastic to embrace more sustainable alternatives. Eliminating single-use plasticsOn Indian Independence Day in 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to phase out single-use plastic. That ban, targeting plastics that have \"low utility and high littering potential,\" is slated to take effect this summer. It will prohibit the manufacture and import of plastic ear buds, plastic flags, and lightweight plastic bags and cutlery, among other items.India's plastic waste problem has grown in recent times. The country's Central Pollution Control Board says that per capita plastic waste generation in India has almost doubled in the last five years. According to the United Nations Development Program in India, the country generates 15 million metric tons of plastic waste each year. Kavala Krishnaiah, whose legs are not fully formed due to polio, makes disposable plates and bowls at Bollant Industries' manufacturing unit.Critics of the single-use plastics ban, however, cite a poor recycling infrastructure, relative lack of plastic alternatives, and enforcement challenges as potential barriers to success. This dairy-tech startup has created a step counter for cows Priti Mahesh, the chief program coordinator at Toxics Link, an environmental research and advocacy NGO in Delhi, says, \"Yes, there's a ban, but has there been any concrete measure to identify alternatives [to plastic]? And what is done to enforce this ban on the ground will be a question.\"For Bolla, an outright ban on single-use plastics is not the best solution. He says that subsidies are needed to encourage manufacturers to develop new alternatives. \"Plastic is such a versatile, flexible material,\" he says, \"So we should shift to making plastic using biodegradable polymers. This is the only way we can tackle plastic pollution.\"\"We are ready for the big shift\"To make its plastic alternative products, Bollant purchases fallen areca leaves collected by farmers in the neighboring state of Karnataka and acquires used paper from local paper mills. At its manufacturing unit, staff operate hand presses to transform the leaves into cutlery and tableware, and the used paper into colorful plates. Bollant sells its products to around 200 small and medium enterprises, like Prahalad Tiffin Point, across India. Bolla says he hopes to export his line of products to the US and Europe in the future.\n\n\nBollant Industries uses recycled paper to make cardboard sheets. Credit: CNNBollant is not the only Indian company innovating in this space. Delhi-based Ecoware converts agricultural waste like sugarcane residue into compostable tableware, and Biogreen in Bangalore manufactures biodegradable bags derived from corn starch.These startups are part of an expanding market. According to market research firm Valuates Reports, India is expected to be the fastest-growing market for biodegradable plastics, anticipated to grow to almost $9 billion globally by the end of 2025.Bollant Industries is currently expanding its range and developing a biodegradable product which can be used, instead of plastic, to coat and waterproof paper products. \"We are ready for the big shift,\" says Bolla.",

The robots \u2014 named Tom, Dick and Harry \u2014 were developed by Small Robot Company to rid land of unwanted weeds with minimal use of chemicals and heavy machinery. The startup has been working on its autonomous weed killers since 2017, and this April launched Tom, its first commercial robot which is now operational on three UK farms. The other robots are still in the prototype stage, undergoing testing. Small Robot says robot Tom can scan 20 hectares (49 acres) a day, collecting data which is then used by Dick, a \"crop-care\" robot, to zap weeds. Then it's robot Harry's turn to plant seeds in the weed-free soil. Using the full system, once it is up and running, farmers could reduce costs by 40% and chemical usage by up to 95%, the company says. Read MoreAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization six million metric tons of pesticides were traded globally in 2018, valued at $38 billion.\"Our system allows farmers to wean their depleted, damaged soils off a diet of chemicals,\" says Ben Scott-Robinson, Small Robot's co-founder and CEO. Zapping weeds Small Robot says it has raised over \u00a37 million ($9.9 million). Scott-Robinson says the company hopes to launch its full system of robots by 2023, which will be offered as a service at a rate of around \u00a3400 ($568) per hectare. The monitoring robot is placed at a farm first and the weeding and planting robots delivered only when the data shows they're needed.The robot zapping weeds with electricity.To develop the zapping technology, Small Robot partnered with another UK-based startup, RootWave. This supplement can reduce methane in cows and make farmers money\"It creates a current that goes through the roots of the plant through the soil and then back up, which completely destroys the weed,\" says Scott-Robinson. \"We can go to each individual plant that is threatening the crop plants and take it out.\" \"It's not as fast as it would be if you went out to spray the entire field,\" he says. \"But you have to bear in mind we only have to go into the parts of the field where the weeds are.\" Plants that are neutral or beneficial to the crops are left untouched.Small Robot calls this \"per plant farming\" \u2014 a type of precise agriculture where every plant is accounted for and monitored.A business case For Kit Franklin, an agricultural engineering lecturer from Harper Adams University, efficiency remains a hurdle. \"There is no doubt in my mind that the electrical system works,\" he tells CNN Business. \"But you can cover hundreds of hectares a day with a large-scale sprayer ... If we want to go into this really precise weed killing system, we have to realize that there is an output reduction that is very hard to overcome.\"But Franklin believes farmers will adopt the technology if they can see a business case.This 'snake robot' can fix pipelines on the ocean floor\"There's a realization that farming in an environmentally friendly way is also a way of farming in an efficient way,\" he says. \"Using less inputs, where and when we need them, is going to save us money and it's going to be good for the environment and the perception of farmers.\"As well as reducing the use of chemicals, Small Robot wants to improve soil quality and biodiversity.\"If you treat a living environment like an industrial process, then you are ignoring the complexity of it,\" Scott-Robinson says. \"We have to change farming now, otherwise there won't be anything to farm.\"",

        "content": "Abu Dhabi (CNN Business)Traffic congestion is a problem for cities around the world, with some looking to electric scooters to ease gridlock, and others to AI-enabled traffic lights. But one company believes the solution is to build a network of driverless high-speed pods that ride around cities suspended from a steel track.In June, Belarus-based uSky Transport opened a 400-meter test line in Sharjah, which borders Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.From the outside, the electrically powered pods are glossy white while the interiors are designed to feel like a first-class airline suite, including mood lighting, lounge music and floor-to-ceiling windows. With two padded armchairs and two foldable seats, the vehicle being tested can carry up to four passengers.The interior of the uSky pod currently being tested in Sharjah, UAE.A fully implemented city-wide network could support 10,000 passengers per hour, uSky says, with vehicles currently able to travel up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour \u2014 although for safety reasons, they can't reach their top speed on the test track.The company says its objective is to free up roads and ground space that could be used for greenery, walkways and public leisure spaces. \"The ground level is completely over-saturated, and people are tired of traffic jams. People are tired of emissions,\" says Oleg Zaretskiy, uSky Transport's CEO. This supplement can reduce methane in cows and make farmers moneyRead MoreAccording to uSky, while one kilometer of subway can cost up to $150 million to construct, this system costs around $10 million. And by using less structural materials, it reduces carbon emissions.The company has also developed a similar technology to transport cargo containers, carrying up to 48 tons at a top speed of 90 kilometers (56 miles) per hour.Making a difference in mobilityTransport pods that travel above the ground \u2014 often referred to as \"sky pods\" \u2014 are sometimes compared to monorails or cable cars. But they offer greater flexibility, says Stephanie Haag, associate partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\"In a cable car, you have one car and it always drives at the same speed,\" she says. \"[In sky pods] you can use many different cabins on that particular infrastructure,\" such as ones tailored for shorter trips in urban areas or for longer distances.The uSky pod is being tested at the Sharjah Research Technology and Innovation Park.Although she cautions that it would require careful planning to avoid congestion in a busy city-wide network, Haag believes it could still be a widely adopted solution if the promises of improved mobility and sustainability are kept.Plans for future expansionLater this year, uSky plans to build a 2.4 kilometer (1.5 mile) line in Sharjah, allowing it to run the passenger pod at higher speeds and demonstrate how passenger and cargo pods can be integrated into the same network.According to Hussain Al Mahmoudi, CEO of Sharjah Research Technology and Innovation Park, where uSky's test lines are located, the hope is for sky pods to boost the emirate's strategy of becoming a sustainable, futuristic hub.uSky says an AI-powered camera helps avoid potential collisions with other pods on the track.With the test line up and running, uSky has also received initial approval to build a line around the coastal town of Khor Fakkan, to the east of the emirate. Neighboring emirate Dubai is also exploring driverless pods that would operate above city traffic and other global companies, such as Virgin Hyperloop, are reportedly developing high-tech transport pods for the region. Zaretskiy says uSky is also looking beyond the UAE. \"We can see that the most promising areas for us [are in the] Middle East [and] Asia -- places where there is natural growth of population ... such as India and Pakistan,\" he says.A robot is killing weeds by zapping them with electricity Haag adds that pods are more suited to countries where public transportation is under-developed and there is increasing demand for mobility solutions. Still, Zaretskiy says uSky Transport has received inquiries from countries including the United States and Canada.The company hopes to finalize its first commercial contract by the end of the year in Sharjah, Zaretskiy adds, meaning uSky pods could be up and running over traffic by 2024.",

        "content": "London (CNN Business)City dwellers are used to switching between apps to decide the best way to get from A to B. Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter?It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \"Whim's sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,\" CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business.According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for 24% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, most of which come from passenger vehicles. If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. Car competitionRead MoreHe admits this isn't an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. \"The car represents freedom of mobility,\" says Hietanen \u2014 even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a \"freedom insurance.\"To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). The app was launched in Helsinki but is now available in several European and Asian cities.Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs \u20ac62 ($73) in Helsinki \u2014 where the app is most established \u2014 for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from \u20ac55 ($65) per day.While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that's not true of everywhere. If a city \"does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place\" then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London.She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. MaaS movementOther providers include Citymapper, which launched a travel pass for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an all-in-one mobility app in Israel last year. Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as BP (BP), Mitsubishi (MBFJF) and Toyota Financial Services. It's available in several European cities and in Tokyo, and has racked up 18 million trips globally since launch. But the business has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says Hietanen; with fewer people traveling, revenues are lower, stalling the company's expansion into other cities.According to Whim, public transport and micromobility are the most popular ways to travel using the app. Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat recently reported that the company had spent \u20ac50 million ($59 million) on failed expansion ventures. Hietanen says the money was spent on integrating multiple transportation providers, establishing market readiness in several countries, and developing the complex technology that underpins the app. \"We've known from the beginning that the investment needed to create this would be substantial,\" he says, adding that the company has recently secured further investment. Greener travelThough the industry is in its infancy, Hietanen is confident the demand will be there. A recent report from the International Transport Forum (ITF) says that mobility services will be vital in meeting the needs of a growing world population and fast-paced urbanization. But for growth to happen, \"people must choose it over other travel options\" such as private motor vehicles.This is already happening, says Hietanen. According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. \"People want the more sustainable solution,\" he says, \"but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.\"",

        "content": "(CNN Business)For centuries, humans have explored the Earth's mountains, jungles and deserts. But despite covering more than 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the sea floor; just over 20% of the ocean bed has been mapped.  Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species -- all part of what's known as the \"blue economy,\" projected to be worth $3 trillion by 2030.Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. A five-year-old startup called Seatrec is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing \"the naturally occurring temperature difference\" of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. Greener and cheaperRead MoreThe power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec's own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite.Seatrec's float uses differences in ocean temperature to power itself.As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot's generator.\"They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,\" Chao said.This underwater concrete attracts marine life and gets stronger at the same timeA basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec's energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said.But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable -- Seatrec's energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. Picking up the paceNew technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. \"One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,\" said McMichael-Phillips. \"Unlike mapping the Earth's surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we're pretty much limited to using sonar systems.\" How 3D printing could help save Hong Kong's coralLaunched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. Some companies, such as XOCEAN, are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock's own cloud platform.Bedrock Ocean Exploration uses an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers.The challenge aheadEven with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. This vegan 'tech-style' startup wants to make clothes using algae Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec's floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean. The company has raised $2 million in seed funding to scale up production of its energy harvesting system.But this is a drop in the ocean of the capital needed to fully survey the ocean, which is estimated to be \"somewhere between $3 to $5 billion,\" according to McMichael-Phillips -- \"pretty much the same order of magnitude as the cost of sending a mission to Mars.\"Bedrock's DiMare believes it's time we start investing in our own planet.\"If we want to keep Earth as a place that humans can live,\" he said, \"we have got to get a lot smarter about what's going on in the ocean.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)How will the promise of a second Cold War impact the portrayal of Russia in movies and television? To see a glimpse of what could be in the future it's worth looking to the past, and what Americans were watching in the 1980s, during the years immediately preceding the Berlin Wall coming down and the Soviet Union crumbling.There was no one kind of Cold War movie during that period, but a variety that tugged at different threads. The plots ranged from traditional spy fare and stock, go-to villains to Soviet invasions of the US to hopeful demonstrations of Russians and Americans finding common ground, even if their countries didn't. Others focused on the threat of nuclear annihilation, a concern exemplified by earlier movies like \"Failsafe\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\" but brought to vivid life -- and directly into living rooms -- in the '80s.That last bracket included \"The Day After,\" a 1983 TV movie considered so provocative that the Reagan administration appealed to ABC not to broadcast it. Shown with limited commercial interruption because of the content, the movie drew a massive audience -- a cultural moment captured, fittingly, in the FX series \"The Americans,\" which dealt with Soviet spies operating within the US. \"Testament,\" released the same year, offered a lower-key but no less devastating view of nuclear war's aftermath, while \"War Games\" provided a more Hollywood-friendly spin.Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell and Charlie Sheen in the 1984 film 'Red Dawn.'That period also included \"Red Dawn,\" in which teenagers defend the US homeland from invading forces; and \"Amerika,\" an ABC miniseries that imagined a future America under Soviet-occupied control.Read MoreDespite Cold War apprehensions, there were plenty of broadly entertaining films built against that backdrop. \"Rocky IV\" actually sees the title character win over the Russian crowd against towering Soviet champion Ivan Drago, while another Sylvester Stallone franchise, \"Rambo III,\" had the trained killing machine team up with brave Afghans against the Soviets. With its spies-among-us hook, \"No Way Out\" was in a way an early version of \"The Americans,\" while Chevy Chase and Dan Akyroyd co-starred in the 1985 comedy \"Spies Like Us.\"Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in the 1985 film 'Spies Like Us'As for the notion of cross-national partnerships, examples range from \"Red Heat,\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, to \"Gorky Park,\" with William Hurt as a Russian detective seeking to solve a trio of murders while navigating a cesspool of corruption, and for a time partnering with an American cop.As Emma Piper-Burket wrote in a 2017 article for Rogerebert.com, while many '80s films incorporated Russians and Americans cooperating despite the political climate, \"After the dissolution of the USSR, however, Hollywood quickly resumed perpetuating its familiar trope of Russian bad guys.\"More recent series like \"The Americans\" and \"Homeland\" have offered a more nuanced view of Russian characters. During their heday, retired Gen. Michael Hayden (who had consulted on the latter) told the Washington Post that in the past, \"There was a theoretical certainty \u2014  Marxism bad, totalitarianism bad. The Russians didn't need much explaining.\"Keri Russell and  Matthew Rhys played Russian spys in 'The Americans.'The question is where the Russian image goes from here. Michael Kackman, an associate professor of television at Notre Dame whose specialties include Cold War American culture, expressed hope that the stories of individual Russians wouldn't be lost in the rush toward broad-strokes portrayals.\"Part of the tricky thing is in American popular culture Russians are imaginary people, or at least were during most of the Cold War,\" Kackman told CNN. If the goal is greater understanding, he added, it's important to remember \"that Russia isn't just Putin, and to try to be reasonably empathetic\" about people living within that system.One of the more memorable demonstrations of that mindset in the 1980s came not from film or TV, but Sting's song \"Russians,\" which capsulized a vision of the path to peace with the lyric, \"I hope the Russians love their children too.\" The musician recently issued a new version of the song as \"a plea for our common humanity. For the brave Ukrainians fighting against this brutal tyranny and also the many Russians who are protesting this outrage despite the threat of arrest and imprisonment.\"Because it can take years for an idea to become a movie or TV show, it's difficult to say now where recent events will lead. But if the '80s are any indication -- and the content landscape has grown exponentially in the decades since --  it won't fit in just one basket.The world is complicated, and we are too,\" Kackman said. \"All of those representations are in circulation together.\"",

Well, none of it was true.\"Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, killing hundreds of people and forcing millions of others to flee the country. As of Sunday, there were more than 3 million refugees, including at least 1.5 million children, according to the International Organization for Migration. Most of them have fled to nearby countries, including Romania, Moldova, and Poland. Millions more are internally displaced within Ukraine.The title of the original song by The Clash references World War II. The BBC World Service would use \"This is London calling\" in its broadcasts during the war. Its lyrics reference the political instability in Britain and across the world at the time of its 1979 release.Read MoreA video for the cover song, posted to Free Ukraine's YouTube channel Saturday, had thousands of views by Sunday afternoon. The video features the band performing spliced with footage from protests and Russian attacks on the country.The video was even shared by The Clash on Twitter.Beton said on Instagram the cover was crafted to \"raise money to support our country around the world with the help of punk rock.\" They were asked to remake the song by the Free Ukraine Resistance Movement and delivered upon the request in just three days. The movement partners with governments and nongovernmental organizations to protect \"the territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" according to its website.Zelensky: 'I'm ready for negotiations' with Putin, but if they fail, it could mean 'a third World War'The band has also used its own social media to condemn Russia's invasion and document their resistance. On Instagram, they posted a picture of themselves with the caption: \"We're punk-hardcore band Beton from Ukraine. And instead of playing gigs we're volunteering for our army, working on-air all nights long, taking care of refugees and hiding families in shelters.

(CNN)We are past International Women's Day, but let's still hear it for the women who are doing the hard things. For starters, there's Olena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, who is being hailed for her role in defending her war-torn nation and also those who continue to champion Equal Pay Day, which was celebrated this week. Lots has been written about disparities experienced by women in Hollywood (where aging is basically a sin), but this week I'm going to amplify some of the projects starring them.Besides, with gas prices where they have been, don't you just want to stay home and watch or listen to something entertaining? Of course you do. \nThree things to watchRead More'Life & Beth'(From left) Michael Cera and Amy Schumer are shown in a scene from \"Life & Beth.\"Rethinking one's life is a theme that resonates as we (hopefully) emerge from the pandemic.In this series, Amy Schumer plays Beth, a woman who looks to live her best life.She is making good money, has a long-term relationship with a great guy and is living well in Manhattan. Then life shifts and she's forced to revisit her old life, with plenty of flashbacks to her teen years that have her grappling with who she has become and who she really wants to be. Schumer gives us a warm and sweet comedy as only she can \u2014 with her irreverent wit.\"Life & Beth\" started streaming on Hulu Friday.'DMZ'Rosario Dawson stars as Alma in \"DMZ.\" Given how divided this nation is feeling these days, this one might hit a little close to home.Rosario Dawson stars as a medic who gets caught up in the second American Civil War in this limited series, based on the 2005 Vertigo comic books written by Brian Wood, with artwork from Riccardo Burchielli and Wood.Benjamin Bratt costars with Dawson in this comic adaptation.And \"DMZ\" really is a limited series, as it runs only four hours.It's streaming on HBO Max, which is owned by CNN's parent company.'The Julia Child Challenge'Julia Child is shown on the set of her first cooking show, \"The French Chef.\" No single woman may have had more of an impact on how Americans cook than Julia Child.And the fact that she came into her success in her 50s is just a chef's kiss. (Bonus: CNN has a great documentary about her.)Food Network has produced a competition in which a group of Julia Child superfans try and win a three-month all-expenses-paid trip to the famed cooking school Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. Can you say \"ooh la la\"?\"The Julia Child Challenge\" is streaming on Discovery+.

Something to sip on (From left) Roger Frappier looks on as Jane Campion accepts the best picture award for \"The Power of the Dog\" during the 27th Annual Critics Choice Awards at LA's Fairmont Century Plaza on March 13.Speaking of women (and in case you haven't noticed we have been), director Jane Campion found herself having to apologize to tennis superstars and newly minted Hollywood producers Venus and Serena Williams.During her acceptance speech at the recent Critics Choice Awards, Campion said \"Venus and Serena, you're such marvels. However, you don't play against the guys, like I have to.\"First, that's wrong, as the sisters have played in mixed doubles matches with men. Second, the \"I have it much tougher than you\" stance feels pretty tone deaf when talking about two Black women who rose from a world devoid of privilege in Compton, California, to achieve all that they have.Campion has since apologized for her \"thoughtless comment.\" It's a good reminder that we don't need women pitting themselves against each other, as the world already does that enough. \nWhat did you like about today's newsletter?

        "content": "(CNN)If there were awards for most-annoying characters, \"WeCrashed\" would have a mantle full of them. As is, this meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun.Add Leto's Adam Neumann to the list of fast-talking hustlers who built vast empires, only to see them come, well, crashing down. In this case, the house of cards is WeWork, which went from a single coworking space to a global operation worth billions before its inevitable downfall.Neumann bills himself as a \"serial entrepreneur,\" a fancy way of saying he's determined to get rich and keep throwing out ideas until one strikes gold. The problem, as the eight-episode Apple TV+ series illustrates in exhaustive detail, is that his commitment to sell, sell, sell obscures a hollow shell, covered up by the wild parties he throws and cult-like devotion he seeks to engender.Beginning in 2019, \"WeCrashed\" flashes back a dozen years to chart Neumann's rise, along with his courtship and marriage to Rebekah (Hathaway), who's his match in terms of the evangelical zeal that she brings to the enterprise. Indeed, as depicted she coins the idea that WeWork is \"not a business. It's a feeling,\" talking with laughable earnestness about \"the soul of the company.\"Still, there's a tired, repetitive quality to the way the episodes unfold, with Neumann spouting mantras like \"Built to grow\" and buying market share while the company hemorrhages money. The trick is staying one step ahead of his board, finding new deep-pocketed investors that he can beguile, never mind what the balance sheet says.Read MoreLeto disappears into the role, from Neumann's Israeli accent to walking around barefoot, able to go from charming people to warning a competitor \"I am going to crush you\" with a smile on his face.Hathaway similarly lowers her voice while turning up the intensity as Rebekah, who, faced with a dispute over her children's school, simply decides to start her own. When a friend asks, \"Is Adam for real?,\" her assurance that he is, based on the available evidence, feels like equal parts complicity and delusion.Still, those performances play almost like a parody of start-up wealth run amok, coming in the service of a so-so series. That's certainly true compared to Hulu's \"The Dropout,\" about Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos; and \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber,\" other cautionary tales about corporate greed gone wrong. (The story was also the subject of a 2021 documentary, \"WeWork: or the Making and Breaking of a $47 Billion Unicorn.\")Adapted from the Wondery podcast, \"WeCrashed\" ultimately shares something in common with its subject matter in one key respect: Despite a pair of Oscar winners front and center in Leto and Hathaway, it looks better on paper then it does once you start wading through the fine print.\"WeCrashed\" premieres March 18 on Apple TV+.

Manzano and Delgado (pictured with co-star Bob McGrath, left) were good friends off-screen and played a married couple on \"Sesame Street.\"Read MoreWhen the \"widely watched onscreen wedding\" aired, Manzano said, \"Latinos on television were the butt of the joke.\" But the realistic and respectful portrayal of two Latino characters on a public TV series -- before and after their wedding -- was meaningful to viewers, she said. \"Our wedding presented flesh-and-blood Latinos wanting the same things out of life as other Americans. To love, get married, have a baby, send them to daycare, go camping,\" Manzano said. \"Our affection for each other came through so strongly people thought we had really gotten married.\"Both Manzano and Delgado appeared on the series from 1971 until 2015. After his stint on the series ended, Delgado joined the board of the Bayard Rustin Center for Social Justice, which highlighted his history of activism, from his early support of United Farm Workers to his work in support of Latinos in media.\"Emilio held children in high regard, saw adults as individuals, always defended the underdog, and was eternally positive,\" Manzano said. \"I will miss him.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Seeing exes Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas on screen together will be an undeniable attraction (if not of the \"Fatal\" variety) for \"Deep Water,\" but that shouldn't obscure the simple pleasures of this erotic thriller directed by Adrian Lyne, a crafty veteran of that genre. While the movie falls apart toward the end, the mystery -- and crackling central performances -- cruises along at a low boil much of the way.Adapted from the novel by Patricia Highsmith (\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\") and relegated to a low-key premiere on Hulu, the story hinges on the strange marriage between Vic (Affleck) and Melinda (\"Knives Out's\" de Armas), a picture-perfect couple that outwardly have everything, including his invention-earned wealth and their adorable young daughter.The two have reached an apparent understanding, however, that allows her to compensate for his indifference and emotional distance by taking lovers, an unhappily-ever-after dynamic that causes discomfort among their friends, with whom they regularly throw neighborhood parties, mostly due to her brazenness.As for Vic, he acts unperturbed by his wife's infidelity, but there's the little matter of Melinda's one-time \"friend\" who has gone missing, and lingering suspicions as to whether he had anything to do with that.Vic doesn't seek to quell those rumblings, underscoring the mind games that the couple plays not only with each other, but those around them. When a pulp writer (Tracy Letts) who is new to the community observes that Vic's \"a weird guy,\" Vic merely smiles at his wife having said much the same to him and responds, \"So I've been told.\"Read MoreKnown for his glossy excess, Lyne practically invented this modern variant of the erotic thriller with \"Fatal Attraction,\" \"Indecent Proposal\" and later \"Unfaithful,\" the film that this movie most closely resembles in tone and topic. The irony, of course, is that while some will watch out of curiosity about the leads due to their off-screen relationship, most of de Armas' steamiest scenes happen with others.Lyne and screenwriters Zach Helm and \"Euphoria's\" Sam Levinson have taken liberties with the novel, but the broad outlines make for a tense, twisty atmosphere -- at least, until they pull back the curtain, sacrificing the psychological uncertainty and squandering that momentum down the stretch.It's nevertheless a strong showcase for Affleck -- whose history with the genre includes \"Gone Girl\" -- and de Armas, playing a character seemingly determined to test how far she can push her aloof husband, desperate to elicit some sort of emotional reaction.Despite the tabloid-tinted side of the star pairing, this once-thriving formula is no longer enough to lift the film's must-see factor out of the shallow end commercially speaking, which likely explains its debut via streaming, not theaters.Still, Affleck and de Armas' generate enough heat to make \"Deep Water\" worth watching, even if the movie seems destined to generate its biggest splash over what transpired off screen instead of what's on it. \"Deep Water\" premieres March 18 on Hulu. It's rated R.",

        "content": "(CNN)A series built around a US civil war is bound to get attention, especially in these polarized times. But \"DMZ\" merely uses that backdrop as a device to introduce another dystopian drama based on a DC graphic novel, basically \"The Walking Dead\" meets the '70s artifact \"The Warriors.\" The result is an uninvolving miniseries that, at four parts, feels either too long or not nearly long enough.That's because the war has already happened when the story begins, finding the US divided, with Manhattan turned into a lawless \"demilitarized zone\" between the two riven sides. Years after being separated from her teenage son as they fled the chaos, Alma (Rosario Dawson) braves returning to that zone, determined to be reunited with him no matter what the cost.What Alma finds, though, is a population essentially divided into wary factions, working toward a vote seeking to provide greater order and unity to their society. On one end sits Alma's ex, Parco (Benjamin Bratt), and on the other Wilson (Hoon Lee), each ruthless and brutal in their own way.Adapted by Roberto Patino (\"Westworld\"), with a premiere directed by Ava DuVernay and the remaining episodes helmed by Ernest Dickerson, there's ample talent both behind and in front of the camera.The net effect, however, is dramatically inert, perhaps in part because there have been so many variations on this theme, and because Alma's quest -- and the idea of a mother desperate to reconnect with her now-grown child -- overshadows the more interesting or distinctive aspects, turning it into a rather generic action thriller.Read MoreNor does it help that the narrative basically joins the story in progress, without pausing or flashing back -- as, say, \"The Handmaid's Tale\" did -- to flesh out how America reached this sorry point.Despite her resourcefulness and history with the key players, Alma too often feels like a bystander as conflicts rage around her, through no fault of Dawson's, who is pulling double streaming duty as Ahsoka Tano. With her energies steadfastly fixed on her son, broader questions about the DMZ's fate and assorted subplots are at best underdeveloped, and at worst relegated to colorful detours.In that respect \"DMZ\" has a bit in common with FX's recent \"Y: The Last Man,\" another disappointment adapted from a graphic novel that sought to balance personal family drama (including a mother-child bond) with societal collapse.While that's fertile territory in theory, like \"Y,\" \"DMZ's\" alphabet soup winds up in a kind of bleak and familiar no-man's land, one that makes it a little too tempting to zone out before crossing the finish line.\"DMZ\" premieres March 17 on HBO Max, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",

        "content": "(CNN)Evan Rachel Wood delves deeply into allegations of domestic abuse against former boyfriend Marilyn Manson in \"Phoenix Rising,\" a detailed chronicle of the \"Westworld\" star's evolution from acting to activism. Yet an equally sobering aspect of this two-part HBO documentary involves Wood's upbringing in Hollywood, and her memories of being sexualized in movies at an early age.The headline-grabbing foundation involves Wood's fight for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in conjunction with a coalition of other survivors, which successfully lobbied to extend the statute of limitations on such cases in California.At length, Wood describes meeting Manson, a.k.a. Brian Warner, when she was 18 (he was 37), the beginnings of their romance and disturbing allegations about how she was abused, including a music video in which their interactions prompted concern among members of the crew. Manson declined an interview, but his legal counsel provided a detailed statement to the filmmakers saying that he \"vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone,\" and that former partners had \"weaponized\" consensual relationships into \"fabricated horror stories.\"Directed by Amy Berg (\"The Case against Adnan Syed\"), much of the documentary is devoted to Wood finding her voice to speak out, acknowledging her apprehensions about doing so. She was \"terrified\" to name Manson publicly, she says, adding that doing so risks \"retraumatizing yourself\" and \"putting a target on your back.\" In the second half, she meets with other alleged survivors of purported abuse by Manson, a segment that drags on a bit too long.\"Phoenix Rising\" proves most compelling during the first part, which includes a step-by-step breakdown of common patterns that domestic abusers follow to control and intimidate victims. That chapter incorporates Wood's family issues and history, moving to Hollywood after her parents separated and becoming a child star, appearing in the extremely edgy \"Thirteen,\" a stark independent film about troubled teens. Read MoreWood, who was 14 while shooting the movie, discusses her discomfort with certain scenes, including one in which she had to make out with a 23-year-old actor. After that role, she recalls being offered various \"Lolita\"-type parts, and notes that Manson referenced the movie when they first met.Documented with home videos and excerpts from Wood's diary, that section in particular presents a damning look at children raised on movie and TV sets, an issue Wood previously addressed in the 2020 HBO documentary \"Showbiz Kids,\" which in some respects serves as a companion to this.The documentary clearly comes with a specific mission in mind, shining light on the issue of domestic violence through the lens of Wood's advocacy. Toward that end, HBO is partnering with RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) and other organizations to ensure that the embers stoked by \"Phoenix Rising\" don't end there.\"Phoenix Rising\" will air March 15-16 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.",

And based on the trailer for her new self-titled Disney+ series, she's every bit as endearing and relatable as her comic iteration.The new trailer for \"Ms. Marvel,\" dotted with speech balloons straight out of a comic book, introduces viewers to Kamala, a Muslim, Pakistani-American high schooler from New Jersey who doodles and daydreams about one day joining the superheroes she idolizes. Kamala, who was introduced in comics in 2013 before getting her own series the following year, was Marvel's first Muslim-American superhero.Though one day our teenage hero (played by Iman Vellani) will become one of Marvel's most powerful crime fighters, the series appears to serve as her origin story. The Kamala we meet encounters sniping classmates who mispronounce her name and poke fun at her Avengers T-shirt. She gawks at a shirtless boy at a party surrounded by equally awed friends. And, crucially, she envisions herself as a version of Captain Marvel, a cosmic-powered icon in the MCU. The future is in her hands. Ms. Marvel, an Original series from Marvel Studios, starts streaming June 8 on @DisneyPlus. #MsMarvel pic.twitter.com/k1s7HWOtaV\u2014 Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) March 15, 2022\n\nThat daydream is pure fantasy, until it isn't: The trailer doesn't show us just how Kamala gets her powers or their extent (no spoilers here) -- she describes them as \"cosmic.\" \"It's not really the brown girls from Jersey City who save the world,\" Kamala says at one point in the trailer. But \"Ms. Marvel\" the series will likely prove her wrong. Read MoreWhat foes will Kamala face beyond high school mean girls and intimidatingly attractive classmates? Will her family learn her super-powered secret? And when will she get to join her idol Captain Marvel in defending Earth from interstellar invaders? (She's set to appear in the upcoming \"Captain Marvel\" sequel \"The Marvels.\")The MCU loves a slow build, so it's likely neither Kamala nor the viewers will get every question answered. Marvel fans have likely already begun theorizing, but they'll have to wait until June 8, when the show starts streaming on Disney+, to see how Kamala's story plays out.",

Fellowes is well known as the creator of \"Downton Abbey\" and his and Richardson Whitfield's involvement was one of the things that inspired Baltimore Sun journalist John-John Williams IV to watch \"The Gilded Age.\"\"I like ['The Gilded Age'] better than 'Downton Abbey' actually,\" Williams said. \"They haven't just inserted a Black person in, like in traditional pop culture when you have the Black friend and they would have no story. They would just be on screen.\"\"[The character of Peggy Scott] actually has her own life and her own story and she exists independent of the white lead and I think that's really important,\" he added. \"She's a rich character with her own secrets and her own mysteries just like everyone else on the show and I think that's ideal. That's what makes the show really, really pop.\"\"The Gilded Age\" airs Mondays on HBO and streams on HBO Max.",

        ],
        "content": "(CNN)In Batman lore, the police summon the hero by projecting a magnified Bat-signal across the night sky. That's a fitting metaphor for the character's much-debated history in movies, which has cast an unusually large shadow thanks to fans convinced, in their minds, precisely how the Dark Knight should be depicted.Created in 1939, Batman isn't the first superhero or even necessarily the best. But different approaches to adapting him for the screen have provoked inordinate passion among fans, including knee-jerk reactions that border on the hysterical. That included the howls that greeted casting Michael Keaton in the 1980s (admittedly an unorthodox choice) and perhaps especially Ben Affleck in 2013.In a December interview with Howard Stern, Affleck admitted feeling \"hurt\" by an online petition that circulated opposing him starring in \"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\" For his part, Stern pointed out that Batman aficionados have a track record of complaining \"no matter who gets that role.\"Through the years, fans seeking fidelity to the comics have had reason to be wary and suspicious of Hollywood.The key window for Batman in comics came in the 1970s, which marked shift from the lightness and camp that characterized the 1960s \"Batman\" TV show -- with its \"Wap! Bam! Pow!\" graphics -- to a darker vision of the caped vigilante.Read More\"The Batman,\" starring Robert Pattinson, represents the latest screen incarnation of the character, and in many ways feels designed to tap into the desires of that ardent fan base. Brooding and serious, the film caters to those weaned on Batman as a creature of the night, an image honed by comic-book artists Marshall Rogers and Neal Adams in the '70s, and Frank Miller in the landmark graphic novel \"The Dark Knight Returns.\"Director/co-writer Matt Reeves has cited another comic written by Miller, \"Batman: Year One,\" which captures an early stage in his crimefighting career, among his inspirations.Ben Affleck as Batman in 'Zack Snyder's Justice League.'Those comics evolved Batman's profile toward a more adult tone that informed director Tim Burton's 1989 movie. Yet even with its success, sequels directed by the late Joel Schumacher -- starring Val Kilmer, and then George Clooney -- revived the kind of broader camp that many comics fans saw as the bad old days.Christopher Nolan rectified that with his trilogy of \"Batman Begins,\" \"The Dark Knight\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" which featured Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning take on the Joker -- the kind of prestige that usually eludes superhero fare.But reinvention has always been a part of Batman's screen incarnations. Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Picture Group (like CNN, part of WarnerMedia), recently told the New York Times that Reeves' challenge was to \"create a Batman that is compelling and dynamic and thrilling, but different than anything we've seen before.\"While the movie is assured of a big opening weekend, how well it lasts will be determined not just by how committed fans respond, but whether those less invested join them in marching back to theaters.When Affleck was selected, CNN's Jake Tapper jokingly introduced a segment on the overheated response as \"the debate tearing this country apart: Batfleck.\" The next year, Affleck conceded to Entertainment Weekly that Warner Bros. warned him about possible blowback, quoting studio brass as saying, \"Are you sure you want to get into this? This is part and parcel of these movies now. There's a lot of active fans with a lot of opinions.\" Social media has fueled that dynamic, creating echo chambers where those holding \"a lot of opinions\" can commiserate with like-minded souls, or conversely, argue with dissenters.The loudest voices, of course, aren't always the most representative, especially with something like Batman. But they do reflect why that Bat-signal occupies such a distinctive place in pop culture: Because so many people think they know what's right for the character, believing that he -- no matter who wears the costume -- belongs to them.",

        "content": "(CNN)Pixar has a knack for coming-of-age tales, but few that mix the touching and adorable much better than \"Turning Red,\" a bright and appealing animated movie somewhat surprisingly headed directly to Disney+. Audiences should still warm to this mother-daughter story on streaming, but in bypassing theaters it feels like the studio is leaving some green on the table.Directed and co-written by Domee Shi (the theatrical short \"Bao\"), the film tells the story of 13-year-old Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), whose family runs a Chinese temple in Toronto. An honor student who craves the approval of her mother (Sandra Oh), Mei has a trio of close friends with whom she shares a passion for a boy group named 4*town, which will soon be playing a concert in her town.Budding boy mania, however, triggers another unexpected response: Mei's transformation into a furry Red Panda, a legacy of her family's mystical history. The parallels between that and the advent of puberty are unavoidable, and Shi and co-writer Julie Cho hilariously lean into them, with Mei's introduction to dawning womanhood bringing with it a series of mortifying side effects.In tone and style, \"Turning Red\" perhaps most closely resembles \"Inside Out,\" another Pixar film that did an inordinately good job of addressing the pangs of this particular age in a sprightly and entertaining package. Here, the add-ons include not only a generational clash but the weight of expectations that Mei faces, trying to satisfy her mother as she begins to exhibit signs of independence.\"Turning Red\" also gets a whole lot of mileage out of the panda gags, which, in the crassest commercial terms, should sell a whole lot of plush toys to younger tykes.Read MoreLike the best Pixar fare, the film operates on multiple levels, in ways that will be relatable to parents and older kids that are both culturally specific and broadly universal, with the added garnish of original songs by Billie Eilish.Animation has obviously been a major driver for Disney+ over the past two years, at a time when the streaming service needed content and viewers were hungry for escapes at home.Whether that logic holds as theaters are opening up is between Pixar and Disney's accounting teams, but the lack of a theatrical window right now is puzzling, with a movie that's qualitatively in the conversation with the Oscar-winning \"Soul,\" and a cut above recent releases \"Luca\" and \"Onward.\"Still, wherever one sees it, \"Turning Red\" delivers an exquisitely animated story that's moving as well as funny -- welcome evidence that creatively speaking, at least, Pixar hasn't lost its golden touch.\"Turning Red\" premieres March 11 on Disney+.",

        "content": "(CNN)Amy Schumer titled her sketch comedy series \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" which would actually be a better moniker for \"Life & Beth,\" a Hulu dramedy that Schumer created and stars in, in addition to writing and directing most of the episodes. Personal but ponderous, it's a flawed trip down memory lane where children bear the lingering burden of their ill-equipped parents.Schumer's Beth seems to have a lot going for her as the series begins, with a longterm boyfriend and perq-filled job as a wine distributor, before being suddenly shaken by an unexpected loss. That event throws Beth into a tailspin, causing her to begin questioning her choices and reminiscing about painful memories from her youth (she's well played at that age by Violet Young).Most of those interludes demonstrate how cruel kids can be, capturing awkward and embarrassing moments in Beth's adolescence. But several deal with Beth's divorced parents, and especially her beautiful mom (Laura Benanti), who attracted men in droves and discarded them just as quickly.As for the present, Beth's relationship fizzles but she soon meets a taciturn farmer (Michael Cera, at his Michael Cera-est), who is brusque at first before the two become romantically entangled. Their interactions get complicated by her sudden interest in reexamining her life, which frequently puts more emphasis on drama, albeit not very well, than comedy.\"Do you ever hear yourself?\" Beth's younger sister (Susannah Flood) asks, and clearly, much of the time she doesn't. Therein lies one of the show's drawbacks, which is that even with the cruel blow life has dealt her, Beth comes across as self-absorbed in a way that exhibits little awareness that others might be hurting too.Read MoreAfter starring in several movies, and with her gig co-hosting the Oscars coming up, Schumer attracts some marquee names, with David Byrne and Jonathan Groff among the guest stars, and Benanti lighting up the flashbacks as the mother that young Beth alternately loves and can't stand.Just structurally, \"Life & Beth\" is such a slender premise as to feel conspicuously stretched at 10 episodes, putting Beth's new relationship through various contortions seemingly as a means of prolonging it.All told, the Hulu series provides Schumer -- who has begun making the turn into dramatic fare, including the recent movie \"The Humans\" -- a wide berth to explore material loosely based on her own experiences. (Schumer also produced a reality show for HBO Max, \"Expecting Amy,\" chronicling her difficult pregnancy.)There's obviously a long history of filmmakers engaging in similar exercises, just as there is in comics branching out into more serious fare; still, the stark rawness of the material doesn't translate into a particularly distinctive series.\"Life & Beth\" eventually comes around to recognizing that despite hardship and setbacks, life goes on. Yet beyond Schumer's loyal fans, the temptation will be to come to that realization before its protagonist does.\"Life & Beth\" premieres March 17 on Hulu.",

        "content": "(CNN)The equivalent of missing what should be an easy layup, \"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty\" stumbles on the road to greatness, undermining can't-miss subject matter for basketball fans with an uneven, at times farcical tone. Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds.Produced by \"Don't Look Up's\" Adam McKay (who also directed the first episode), and based on Jeff Pearlman's book about the period, the 10-episode series focuses on the first season in which new owner Jerry Buss (John C. Reilly) drafted rookie phenom Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson (standout newcomer Quincy Isaiah), winning the first of five NBA titles in a decade.In addition to their passion for basketball, the late Buss and Johnson (who has notably disavowed the project) shared a playboy lifestyle, while transforming the Forum, where the Lakers played their games, into the hottest ticket in town.What came to be known as the \"Showtime\" Lakers (a title left unused by HBO for obvious reasons) featured a larger-than-life collection of personalities, and a series of soap-opera-worthy twists, like coach Jerry West (Jason Clarke) quitting, but still hanging around; and new coach Jack McKinney (Tracy Letts) suffering a devastating accident that left overwhelmed assistant Paul Westhead (Jason Segel) in charge.Still, \"Winning Time\" feels too cute for its own good, especially in the early going, when characters keep breaking the fourth wall to chat directly with the audience, and everyone but Buss and Magic appears to be kind of a jerk.Read MoreTo be fair, the series settles down a bit after that (eight of the 10 episodes were previewed), focusing on fleshing out individual players, from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Solomon Hughes, a mere 6'11\") to Buss' daughter Jeanie (Hadley Robinson), treated abysmally by her direct bosses because she's the owner's kid.John C. Reilly as Dr. Jerry Buss in 'Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty.'There are some memorable moments scattered along the way, such as Buss' encounter with Boston Celtics president Red Auerbach (Michael Chiklis), who sizes up the real-estate mogul as a dilettante and dismisses him as any threat to the Celtics' aspirations. Reilly also makes the most of Buss' flamboyance, spending almost drunkenly as he hangs off the edge of a financial cliff and assures everyone who asks, \"Let me worry about the money.\"For those wondering, most of the actors are roughly six inches shorter than their real-life counterparts, but the basketball sequences -- and the clever washed-out tones used in shooting the entire production -- work quite well. Isaiah captures Johnson's charisma and infectious enthusiasm, but also his competitive streak, particularly given the attention showered on fellow rookie superstar Larry Bird (Sean Patrick Small), the league's \"great White hope.\"Yet despite its all-star lineup, which includes Sally Field as Buss' mother and Adrien Brody as future coach Pat Riley, \"Winning Time\" plays too fast and loose -- approaching its material with an irreverence, from snippets of animation to cheeky on-screen chyrons, in a way that's periodically off-putting. What should be catnip to those who watched ESPN's docuseries \"The Last Dance\" misses that target, winding up in a creative no-man's land.Buss does emerge as a visionary, someone who recognized the NBA's potential and Johnson's magnetism not just to win titles, and thanks to the rivalry with the Celtics, elevating the entire league's fortunes.It's a high-stakes, fact-based story that requires scant embellishment, one that could do for sports what \"Succession\" does for media.That blue-chip roster, however, only makes \"Winning Time's\" shortcomings more glaring. While the Lakers rose to the occasion, the series falls short of its potential in terms of conjuring premium-TV magic.\"Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty\" premieres March 6 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.Correction: An earlier version of this story identified Red Auerbach as the owner of the Boston Celtics. During the period covered in the show he was the general manager, not the owner.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Oscars are about honoring the year's best movies, but they're also a TV show, devoted to attracting an audience that will benefit host network ABC and promote the movie business. And after record-low ratings in 2021, the old adage about the Lord helping those who help themselves comes to mind.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is surely feeling pressure to breathe some life back into ratings for the Oscars, and part of that plan has logically involved nominating movies that more people have actually seen. Yet despite expanding the best-picture category to 10 nominees, few of the major contenders in the nominations unveiled Tuesday morning meet that description -- especially if it means having seen those films in theaters.Before the nominations, producer Cassian Elwes -- known for smaller-scale films like \"Mudbound\" and \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" -- tweeted that it was \"shortsighted\" for the Producers Guild's awards to overlook \"the two terrific movies that saved the theatrical business this year,\" \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" and \"No Time to Die.\"If you subscribe to that theory, the Oscars will be inordinately reliant on movies that have primarily reached audiences through streaming, with two Netflix titles, \"Don't Look Up\" and \"The Power of the Dog,\" among the 10 nominees, joined by Apple's \"Coda,\" and \"King Richard\" and \"Dune,\" which premiered simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. (The last two are from Warner Bros., like CNN, part of WarnerMedia.)As for the aforementioned movies that \"saved the theatrical business,\" \"Spider-Man\" -- currently the fourth biggest domestic box-office release of all time -- received a lone nomination for visual effects, while Daniel Craig's final appearance as 007 was recognized for best song, sound and visual effects.Read MoreGranted, the belief that popular movies are key to boosting Oscar ratings doesn't always hold true, although the most-watched telecast ever remains the year that \"Titanic\" sailed away with best picture. Yet it seems undeniable that hit films broadly help, giving potential viewers more of a rooting interest in who and what wins.Mindful of that, the Academy flirted with introducing a \"popular film\" category in 2018, seeking to add a more populist streak to the ceremony. After members shot down the idea for various (mostly logical) reasons, the organization opted to expand the best picture category to 10 movies, in part hoping that at least a few widely seen titles would sneak into the mix.Smaller movies, however, have generally prevailed. And part of the challenge that the Oscars and the movie business face has stemmed from the consumer pivot to streaming, a trend that was already growing before being dramatically hastened by the global pandemic.Hidetoshi Nishijima and T\u00f4ko Miura in 'Drive My Car,' which received Oscar nominations for best picture and international film.For theaters worried about their future, the fact that people interested in catching up on nominees will find \"The Power of the Dog\" (this year's most-nominated title, with 12) and \"Don't Look Up\" on Netflix -- along with others that earned major nominations, including \"Tick, Tick ... Boom!\" and \"The Lost Daughter\" -- won't ease those concerns.Because streamers generally don't provide detailed viewing data, it's unclear how many people have seen some of these movies, but they're obviously being watched via those platforms in vast numbers. Witness the Billboard-topping songs from \"Encanto,\" a nominee for best animated movie, which took off once that title landed on Disney+.While blockbusters (other than the sci-fi epic \"Dune,\" a more modest box-office performer) remain scarce in the best-picture category, the Academy did recognize an international movie, Japan's critical darling \"Drive My Car,\" as well as its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi. That follows the historic best-picture win by \"Parasite\" two years ago.In addition, the Danish animated documentary \"Flee\" registered an impressive showing, notching nominations in the animated, documentary and international film categories.The Academy's ongoing efforts to be more representative in terms of diversity and inconclusion continue to yield mixed results, with some notable oversights (see Ruth Negga for Netflix's \"Passing\") but major acting nominations for Denzel Washington (\"The Tragedy of Macbeth\"), Ariana DeBose (\"West Side Story\"), and Will Smith and Aunjanue Ellis (\"King Richard\").Inevitably, the omissions will receive as much attention as the nominees, but by now it should be clear that the Oscars can never please everybody, especially with 10 best-picture nominees and only five slots for directors.Whether that somewhat disjointed roster adds up to a menu that will lure back more viewers remains to be seen. But if the Academy does see ratings rebound, the hero will be streaming, not Spider-Man.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Cleveland Browns have defended their signing of embattled quarterback Deshaun Watson, saying they carried out a \"comprehensive evaluation\" beforehand. The trade of 26-year-old Watson from the Houston Texans was confirmed on Sunday. The quarterback heads to Cleveland along with a fifth round draft pick, while the Texans receive three first round picks, a third round pick and a fourth round pick. According to NFL.com, Watson told the Texans he is willing to waive his no-trade clause for the move and will reportedly receive a five-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract from the Browns. It would be the highest guaranteed money given to an NFL player, according to ESPN.Last week, a Harris County grand jury declined to charge Watson over allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct. Watson still faces 22 civil lawsuits, many of them alleging sexual assault and misconduct.The NFL is also investigating the accusations and if Watson is found to have violated league rules, he likely would be suspended.Read MoreNews of Watson's trade and signing led to a swell of backlash from fans, primarily on social media, directed at the Browns hierarchy, with some saying it marks the end of their fandom with the team. However, in the statement announcing the details of Watson's trade, Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said the team had done a \"comprehensive evaluation\" before signing off on it, with the general manager saying they had completed \"extensive investigative, legal and reference work.\"\"We are acutely aware and empathetic to the highly personal sentiments expressed about this decision,\" Dee and Jimmy Haslam said. \"Our team's comprehensive evaluation process was of utmost importance due to the sensitive nature of his situation and the complex factors involved. We also understand there are still some legal proceedings that are ongoing and we will respect due process. \"It was pivotal that we, along with Andrew Berry and (head coach) Kevin Stefanski, meet with Deshaun to have a straightforward dialogue, discuss our priorities, and hear directly from him on how he wants to approach his career on and off the field. He was humble, sincere, and candid. In our conversations, Deshaun detailed his commitment to leading our team; he understands and embraces the hard work needed to build his name both in the community and on the field.\"Watson drops back to pass during the first half against the Tennessee Titans at NRG Stadium on January 3, 2021.Shortly after the trade was announced, Tony Buzbee -- the attorney for the 22 women who are suing Watson -- told CNN that no NFL teams reached out to him or his clients in an attempt to research Watson.\"The Browns organization did not reach out to me. I didn't expect them to do so and can understand why they didn't. But, knowing what I know, they probably should have,\" Buzbee said.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosBrowns head coach Kevin Stefanksi said the team understands \"the concerns and questions that exist\" but are \"confident in the extensive work Andrew (Berry) and his staff have done to feel confident about him joining our organization.\"During his five seasons playing for the Texans, Watson established himself as one of the best young quarterbacks in the league.

        "content": "(CNN)Charles Leclerc won the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday as Ferrari claimed a one-two after a dramatic ending to the first race of the new season. Leclerc had started in pole position after an impressive qualifying and, after a battle with reigning world champion Max Verstappen, looked to be cruising to victory.That was until a safety car was deployed in the closing stages which saw the pack bunch up for the restart. As per the new regulations, all cars were able to unlap themselves before racing started again -- a rule clarified after the dramatic ending in last year's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix which saw Lewis Hamilton lose the title on the final lap. F1 2022 season preview: New designs, new drivers but one familiar rivalry In Bahrain, Leclerc held on to the lead after the restart with Verstappen hot on his tail but the Red Bull driver -- who was already complaining about a steering issue with his car -- dropped out of the race entirely after appearing to lose power. Read MoreThe Dutchman was furious and could be heard berating his team over the radio as Ferrari's Carlos Sainz overtook him into second.It went from bad to worse for Red Bull as moments later the team's other driver Sergio Perez -- who was in third -- also began struggling with his car, allowing Hamilton to claim an unlikely podium position on the final lap.It was a huge result for Mercedes with the team still struggling to perfect the car -- its other driver George Russell finished fourth.But for Ferrari, who hadn't won a race since September 2019, the season could not have got off to a better start. \"I'm so happy. We knew this was a big opportunity for the team and the guys have done an incredible job building this amazing car,\" Leclerc said. \"A one-two today with Carlos -- we couldn't hope for better. It's incredible to be back at the top.\"Leclerc and Carlos Sainz celebrate on the podium after securing a Ferrari one-two. Not since 1983 has F1 introduced such sweeping changes to the design of the cars. It was hoped the new regulations would make overtaking easier and it certainly seemed the case with Leclerc and Verstappen trading places five times in just two laps in the early stages. But it was the safety car that yet again that caused the most drama -- only this time it was Hamilton who profited over Red Bull. It comes as the Federation Internationale De l'Automobile (FIA) revealed that the controversial season finale at the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the result of a \"human error\" by then-racing director Michael Masi.On Saturday, the report of the investigation was submitted to the FIA's World Motor Sport Council, which concluded that the results of the title decider are \"valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"Hamilton had all but won his record-breaking eighth world title over the eventual winner Verstappen, when Williams Racing driver Nicholas Latifi crashed into the barriers with four laps remaining, resulting in the safety car being called out.The controversy reached its peak when a message from the race director initially said lapped cars between Hamilton and Verstappen would not be allowed to unlap themselves -- only for Masi to appear to change his mind moments later -- leaving the Red Bull driver right behind Hamilton with fresh tires and just one lap to go.Masi's decision meant the race would restart in the final lap, with Verstappen allowed to start almost side-by-side Hamilton, despite the Brit having established a healthy lead.The FIA's investigation said Masi was acting in good faith; however, he was removed as F1 race director in February.CNN's Homero DeLaFuente contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)The new lucrative Saudi Arabia-backed golf league is a \"new opportunity\" for players and the sport, according to its chairman Greg Norman. Speaking to CNN Sport's Amanda Davies, the two-time major winner said that he believes the new venture will provide a perfect environment to sustain the growth of golf while also allowing players themselves to expand their horizons. Norman explained that he believes that for the \"journeymen\" of golf, it can be a game-changing competition.\"If No. 283 (ranked player in the world), who just goes around and just plays through Asia, if he came and won $10-15 million, how great would that be for him, his family, the game of golf to actually reach out and give an opportunity for somebody, who's probably a journeyman on some tour out there, to change their lives?\" Norman told Davies. \"That's part of the beauty of it.\"Norman talks to the media during a practice round prior to the PIF Saudi International.Read MoreGrowthOn Wednesday, former world No. 1 Norman announced the formation of the new team-based, professional golf league. The venture, backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), pledges to award $250 million in total prize money while hosting eight tournaments, held June through October.The news release announcing the series listed the events taking place in seven cities around the world: London; Portland, Oregon; Bedminster, New Jersey; Boston; Chicago; Bangkok; and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.The eighth event -- a team championship -- does not have a venue listed.Five events occur after the end of the PGA Tour season, but three of those occur at the same time as events on the DP World Tour.The PIF is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi's murder.On Saturday, March 12, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted.The source of the money behind the new league has caused golf commentators to question whether it is the best idea for the sport to find funding from a source with a questionable human rights record. But when pressed on the country's human rights record, Norman pointed to all the good work Saudi Arabia has done to grow golf. \"We're here to grow the game of golf. Money from Saudi Arabia has gone into the game of golf and since 2019, Saudi Arabia has put on the Saudi International,\" the 67-year-old said. \"That was co-sanctioned by the European Tour, now the DP World Tour. So the money's been there and the other tours have co-sanctioned these tournaments by Saudi money. Golf is good for the world and golf is good for Saudi Arabia too. We've seen it. \"Saudi Arabia has invested a lot of money into women's golf. They're the largest investor in women's golf today. So when you look at all the facts sitting out there, yes, our investor is Saudi money. I'm proud of that because, like I said, golf is good for the world and we're just going to grow the game of golf on a worldwide basis.\"Phil Mickelson and Norman talk during a practice round prior to the PIF Saudi International.OppositionRumors of the new venture have sparked speculation about which golfers will play on it. News that the big-money Saudi-league had approached some of the biggest names in golf -- including Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau -- to be its poster boys caused players to publicly distance themselves from the so-called \"Super Golf League,\" with Johnson, DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy all reiterating their commitment to the PGA Tour. Phil Mickelson, one of the biggest names in the sport, caused controversy in February when he said he'd play in the league. He later apologized for his previous comments, lost multiple sponsorships over the controversy and said he will take some time away from golf.Although it is unclear which golfers will compete in the tournaments at the time of writing -- Norman said that \"nobody's signed up because it's an invitational and the invites haven't been sent out yet\" -- Norman doesn't think that they'll have any trouble attracting the biggest names. \"We're not going to have a problem getting to players,\" he said. \"I bet you we don't have a shortage of players, to tell you the truth. \"It's an invitation and the invitations will be going out and we'll gladly make an announcement about who's playing in the near future as we lead up to it. And as I said to the players, if you're sitting out there and you're liking what you're seeing, go apply for a release. \"From the European Tour, from the PGA Tour or whoever it is, go apply for a release. You have three releases, you have the right to go play under their rules and regulations today, go do it and go play.\"So you've got three out of the eight, and if you only play three then you might not get the individual world championship opportunity for the top three individual players which is $30 million at the end of the year after seven events. So the more you play, the more chance you have of catching that pool, no different to what the FedEx is for the players today.\" The currently established golf tours -- primarily the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour -- have expressed their opposition to the new venture. Norman told CNN's Davies that they have had to battle \"white noise\" which has been \"controlled by other entities\" to make strides towards getting off the ground. And the 20-time PGA Tour winner questioned what the PGA Tour has to fear from the new league. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosJohnson chats with DeChambeau near the green at the WGC FedEx St. Jude Invitational.\"There have been a lot of obstacles put in our path, there's no question about it. The PGA Tour have fallen great, big redwood trees across our road but we've figured it out,\" he said. \"We're here for the long-term, I want to give the opportunity for players to have a better chance and more chance, other chances to go out there as independent contractors and go play golf. Let me ask you that question: what is wrong with that? And from the PGA Tour's standpoint, what are they afraid of, quite honestly, with us giving the opportunity for independent contractors to go out and play for additional golf? \"We're 100% additive to the game of golf. We just want to make the game of golf bigger and better, have a lot more evolution to the game of golf, enhance the entertainment side of things, for the fans, for the players, for the stakeholders, everybody. So as the players understand it now, it's a totally different narrative.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Two Premier League managers sat before the media to discuss a football match earlier this month. One faced questions on the sanctioning of a Russian oligarch, while the other was asked about the execution of 81 men in one day in Saudi Arabia. Premier League matches might have huge global appeal and its broadcast deals are worth billions of dollars, but right now the organization finds itself at the eye of a moral, ethical, and political storm.That storm raged fiercely when Chelsea played Newcastle United on March 13, a game pitting two of the most controversial club ownerships in world football against each other. It's been dubbed the Premier League's \"game of shame.\"The fixture was played soon after the UK government sanctioned Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as one of \"Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin,\" according to a UK government press release.Meanwhile, Newcastle's controversial takeover by the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) last year also raised ethical concerns even \u200bbefore it was approved by the Premier League.Read MoreThe PIF -- which has an 80% stake in the club as part of a three-party consortium -- is a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the man who a US intelligence report named as responsible for approving the operation that led to the 2018 \u200bmurder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Bin Salman has denied involvement in Khashoggi's murder.The day before the match between Chelsea and Newcastle, Saudi Arabia executed 81 men in the biggest mass execution in decades. Rights groups have criticized the country for executing people who were minors at the time of the offenses for which they were convicted. Chelsea fans during the Premier League match against Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge, London on March 13.Geopolitical issuesEarlier in March, British businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who played a key role in the consortium's acquisition of Newcastle, said it wasn't \"particularly fair\" that Abramovich had been forced to sell Chelsea as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"I'm sad someone is going to have a football club taken away because of a link they may have with someone,\" Staveley, who owns a minority stake in Newcastle, was quoted as saying at the Financial Times' Business of Football Summit in London, according to the FT.\"I don't think that's particularly fair to be honest, but we do have to hold all of our relationships to account. We'll always have geopolitical issues, this world is never not going to have problems,\" she added.The sanctioning of Abramovich means Chelsea must find answers -- and quickly -- to an array of questions: how to finish the season, how to ensure a smooth sale to a new owner, and, fundamentally, how to ensure Chelsea Football Club can continue to operate next season.But Chelsea's current predicament also raises uncomfortable oversight questions for the Premier League and the UK government regarding an approach that has often been described as \"light-touch regulation.\"Death and destruction in Ukraine ultimately triggered Abramovich's sanctioning, yet Chelsea's owner did not suddenly become \"close to Putin,\" as the UK government alleged in its announcement of sanctions against him, in the few weeks before or since the invasion.\"He [Abramovich] is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin,\" the UK government said in a statement following the sanctions announcement.Last month, British lawmaker Chris Bryant cited a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns Abramovich had \"links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,\" the MP said in Parliament.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the sanctions.Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea smiles following his team's  Champions League final victory against Manchester City at Estadio do Dragao on May 29, 2021 in Porto, Portugal.Premier League's Owners' and Directors' TestOver 30 spectacularly lucrative years, the Premier League built its multi-billion-dollar industry on a process of self-regulation, with the UK government content to take a non-interventionist approach as it basked in the success of a globally attractive business.Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the horror that has subsequently unfolded may be changing all that\u200b.Suddenly, urgent questions are being asked about whether the vetting of new owners should take into consideration the issue of human rights as the UK government finds itself overseeing the sale of one of the country's biggest teams.The Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test lays out conditions that would bar prospective individuals from owning a club, notably prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies.Prior criminal convictions, bankruptcy or insolvency, and bans from sporting bodies didn't apply to Abramovich or bin Salman, though following the imposition of sanctions by the UK government, the Premier League Board did disqualify the Russian oligarch as a director of Chelsea Football Club on March 12.One clause stipulates any individual could be disqualified \"in respect of any offense involving any act which could reasonably be considered to be dishonest,\" whether committed in or outside the UK and regardless of whether it resulted in a conviction.Members of the media work outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium in London on March 10, 2022.Football accountancy specialist Kieran Maguire told CNN that the test presents a low bar to prospective owners and says that is very much by design.\"It's a relatively low hurdle,\" Maguire told CNN. \"And part of the reason for that is because the rules are determined by the owners themselves.\"The last thing they want to do -- given most will eventually be looking for an exit route -- is make the criteria for selling too difficult. This would reduce the pool for buyers, which reduces the price.\"Asked for comment, the Premier League pointed CNN towards the evidence of its chief policy officer Helen McNamara at Tuesday's parliamentary committee hearing.\"This is an extraordinary, complex and unprecedented situation. It's pretty new to all of us,\" said McNamara, referring to the issue of Chelsea and Abramovich.\"We already have an independent panel, chaired by a QC, who oversee our sanctioning regime and we are in the process of putting together an independent panel that will support the Premier League board and scrutinizing their decision making on the Owners' and Directors' Test.\"According to Maguire, the test primarily is designed to ask whether a potential owner has unspent criminal convictions and whether they have the resources to fund the club.  To change any aspect of the test, 14 or more of the 20 Premier League clubs would have to vote in favour.The exterior of Newcastle United's St James' Park stadium in Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England on October 8, 2021.IntegrityIn 2018, Abramovich had issues with his UK visa and was subsequently granted Israeli citizenship, according to Israeli media.That visa issue came at a time of diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow after the poisoning of a former Russian spy with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in March. Nonetheless Abramovich continued to own Chelsea.And despite many -- including the fianc\u00e9e of late journalist Khashoggi -- voicing human rights concerns, the PIF passed the test too. When the sale of Newcastle was announced in October, the Premier League stressed that it was the PIF, rather than the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, behind the takeover.Lawmaker Julian Knight, who chaired Tuesday's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and meeting, told Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston that the Owners' and Directors' Test \"wouldn't have stopped the Saudi takeover, it wouldn't have stopped Roman Abramovich taking over.\"\"It seems to be ... if you have enough money, therefore you can buy a football club. Is that really the right way to go or should there be a more stricter outlook in terms of the integrity of the ownership of a football club?\"Huddleston replied: \"What I can say is that we do recognise there is a need for further refinement and more robust Owners and Directors Test and of course the integrity element of that is something that is being pushed.\" \"We recognize \u2014 and the Premier League recognize -- that the Owners' and Directors' Test needs further work, it needs to be a more robust ... but it's really important that we continue to make sure we have a robust and very successful football ecosystem in the UK. \"The Premier League is a major global success story, it's an outstanding export earner for the UK and we welcome investment.\"Asked if he welcomed the Newcastle takeover, Huddleston replied: \"Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK across multiple areas including investment, intelligence, culture and other elements.\"That purchase was a commercial decision which the government did not take part in. That was within the law and within the restriction of the Owners' and Directors' Test of the Premier League.\"The Premier League logo is displayed on an LED screen prior to the Premier League match between Leicester City and Sheffield United at The King Power Stadium on March 14, 2021 in Leicester.Human rights clause Former Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore recently said that the UK government \"actively\" encourages investment by the Saudi sovereign wealth funds.\u200b\"\"I'm not too sure that the Premier League should take any sort of stance that is not, in some ways, consistent with UK law and governance,\" Scudamore told the University of Cambridge's Varsity website.Maguire believes it is \"feasible\" that a human rights clause could be added to the criteria, citing recent comments made by the Premier League's current CEO Richard Masters.Earlier this month, Masters told the FT's Business of Football summit \u200bthat the league had held discussions with Amnesty International about including a human rights section to its Owners' and Directors' Test.Conceding that the test had \"been under a lot of scrutiny for the last 12 months,\" Masters said the Premier League is seeking \"external contributions\" to amend the test. That comes after UK lawmaker Tracey Crouch's review of football called for the reform of the test and for it to come under the control of an independent regulator.Referencing both the test's pending review and discussions of an independent regulator, Huddleston remarked that English football was at a \"turning point.\"\"There has been a bit of a wake up call here,\" Huddleston said, \"particularly as it relates to Russian investment ... The mood's changing -- I think we are at the cusp of quite significant change in sport.\"Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville during the Premier League match between Southampton  and Norwich City at St Mary's Stadium on February 25, 2022 in Southampton, England.Envy of other Europeaan leaguesThe change in mood was echoed by leading pundit Gary Neville, who in recent years has been vocal about a range of issues facing the game, notably the idea of a European Super League.The former Manchester United and England defender described recent events at Chelsea as \"a massive wake up call,\" both for himself and English football.Having initially welcomed \"new money\" -- be it from Abramovich, the PIF, or the Abu Dhabi United Group at Manchester City -- Neville said he was no longer quite so sure about the benefits of the investment of nation states and oligarchs like Abramovich.\"I can imagine the executive of the Premier League sat there looking at their owners and saying, 'What do we do with this situation?'\" Neville told Sky Sports on Monday. \"They'll be sat there very nervously thinking, 'We don't want to set a precedent here -- what do we do?'\"\"Football is absolutely coming under huge scrutiny,\" Neville added.Meanwhile, the Premier League's bottom line couldn't look healthier.As of next season, a new $6.65 billion package will see the Premier League's international broadcasting income overtake domestic broadcasting rights for the first time, raking in a total of more than $13.8 billion dollars from broadcasting rights alone, according to The Athletic.\"It's indicative of the league's success and appeal to a global audience,\" Maguire said of the deal. \"The Premier League is the envy of all the other leagues in Europe.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)For almost 20 years, Roman Abramovich rocketed Chelsea from a club on the periphery of the elite to a global football superpower, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in his reign coming to an abrupt end.Bloody conflict in Ukraine and international outrage over Russia's invasion placed a renewed focus on Abramovich and his ownership of Chelsea. It's a focus that has shone a light on the jarring friction between sport and politics: Abramovich the dream-realizing football owner -- adored by much of the Chelsea fanbase -- versus Abramovich the Russian oligarch.Days after the war began, as the West responded by imposing sanctions on Russia and its oligarchs, Abramovich's assets -- including Chelsea -- appeared increasingly vulnerable to a more punitive financial environment and he soon announced his plans to sell the club.Before the sale could be completed, however, the UK government announced that Abramovich would be subject to sanctions as one of \"Russia's wealthiest and most influential oligarchs, whose business empires, wealth and connections are closely associated with the Kremlin.\"Read MoreChelsea FC: British property developer Nick Candy \"still interested in\" buying club despite Roman Abramovich sanctionsOn Saturday, the English Premier League's board disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea.The disqualification of an owner would normally trigger the sale of their shareholding, though in the case of Abramovich the Russian oligrach had already announced his intention to sell the club and that process is underway.The UK government is open to Chelsea's sale and would consider an application for a new licence to allow for a sale to take place, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday.Chelsea will be somewhat shielded from the sanctions, allowed to continue fulfilling its fixtures under a special license. But it does mean the club is not able to sell merchandise or tickets to upcoming games, engage in the transfer market, or issue new contracts to players.Last month British lawmaker Chris Bryant called for Abramovich to lose ownership of Chelsea after seeing a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns the 55-year-old had \"links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,\" the MP said in Parliament.According to Reuters, Abramovich has been granted Portuguese and Israeli citizenship in recent years.  \"Surely, Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country?\" Bryant said.Abramovich's representative did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the oligarch being sanctioned.Spurred by Abramovich's enormous financial investment -- upwards of $1.99 billion according to respected football business blogger Swiss Ramble -- Chelsea has enjoyed an unprecedented period of success since his $233 million acquisition of the club in June 2003.\"I don't want to throw my money away,\" Abramovich told the BBC following the takeover, \"but it's really about having fun and that means success and trophies.\"During the 19 years under Abramovich, the club has collected 21 major trophies, according to Chelsea. After winning the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi last month, Chelsea has officially won ever major trophy at the club's disposal.JUST WATCHEDHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club ownerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club owner 02:56'Thank you Mr Abramovich'It is gratitude for this golden era that underpinned a sweeping tide of adulation for the oligarch upon the announcement of his impending sale of the club, among fans as well as former players.\"The best,\" former captain John Terry tweeted, accompanied by a picture of him and Abramovich celebrating another Premier League triumph in 2017.A statement from the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) board encapsulated the broader outpouring of feeling among the club's fans on social media, thanking Abramovich for \"his affection, passion and dedication\" during a tenure that brought \"unparalleled success.\"\"Chelsea supporters will never forget all he has done for our club. Thank you Mr Abramovich,\" the statement added, published before the UK government announced the sanctions.According to Richard Weekes, who is one of the founders of Chelsea supporters' group 'We Are The Shed,' \"the Roman Empire\" helped realize supporters' wildest dreams.\"The last 20 years has enabled Chelsea supporters to live their best lives,\" Weekes told CNN before Abramovich would be sanctioned.\"Traveling around the world winning and celebrating the biggest prizes in football, you simply cannot ask for more than that and, for that reason, Roman will forever have a place in all Chelsea supporters' hearts.\"To have 'the Roman Empire' come to an end with Chelsea as 'Champions of the World' could not be a more fitting conclusion to this chapter in our history.\"'Scorched air'If the last 19 years have been jam-packed with golden memories and trophy after trophy, the coming days and months look more uncertain.In light of the sanctions placed on Abramovich and the consequential impact on Chelsea, the club released a statement confirming it would seek \"permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible.\"Amid such turmoil, the CST called for the voices of supporters to be heard.\"Supporters MUST be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fanbase,\" the group said in a statement on Twitter. \"The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea's future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.\"Chelsea beat Norwich 3-1 in its latest English Premier League match on March 10. The sanctions also prevent a sale of the club, pending the issuance of a special license.In his initial statement published on the club's website before he was sanctioned, Abramovich said the net proceeds from the sale will be donated to a foundation set up \"for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.\"  That statement was conspicuously vague regarding who specifically might be a victim; Abramovich's critics pointed out that the wording could also allow his new foundation to support the families of Russian soldiers.  \"Roman Abramovich is very sensitive to what is happening now,\" Mikhail Khordokovsky, an exiled oligarch and Putin critic, told CNN before the recent sanctions were announced. \"I don't have any information, but I can't imagine that he's made any decision without first consulting with Putin.\"Regardless, this means that he's gotten a whiff of scorched air. What he smells is the fire burning under President Putin,\" Khodorkovsky said, referring to Abramovich's plans to sell Chelsea.What CAN the club do?Pay allowances and pensions of all employees of the Club, including the wages of Players and coaching staff.Pay reasonable costs of travel to and from Fixtures but \"not exceeding the value of \u00a320,000 per game per Club team.\"Pay reasonable costs necessary for the purposes of the Club hosting Fixtures at its home grounds but \"not exceeding the value of \u00a3500,000 per Fixture per Club Team.\"Pay fees, dividends or other allowances to directors of the Club.Pay \"reasonable fees\" or other costs directly related to ongoing regular maintenance of the Club.Broadcasters may broadcast any Fixtures involving the Club.In 2018 the US Treasury released the names of 210 prominent Russians, dubbed the \"Putin list.\"The administration was required to name the companies and individuals and consider whether to sanction them under legislation meant to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 US election, as well as its human rights violations, annexation of Crimea, and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.The list, which included  Abramovich, reads like the US has \"simply rewritten the Kremlin's phone book,\" said Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev in a Facebook post at the time.But if Abramovich's current wealth and apparent safety in Russia reflect an affinity with Putin, that may have been what put him at risk with the UK government. Vladimir Putin: The world of sport has shunned the Russian president. So what?\"He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich,\" the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. Canada have since sanctioned Abramovich too.Abramovich made his fortune in steel and investments, taking advantage of the mass privatization that characterized Boris Yeltsin's premiership following the fall of the Soviet Union.Abramovich's wealth, valued at $14.5 billion in 2022 by Forbes, led to influence within Russian political circles as he was first elected to the State Duma and then appointed governor of Chukotka from 2000 to 2008.A nervous futureWhile Weekes admitted that the incoming owner's status as an oligarch had played on his mind back in 2003, he added that fans would have had little power to reverse the takeover regardless of their feelings.\"Chelsea fans did not choose to be bought,\" Weekes said, \"it is unlikely any pushback would have changed the decision at the time had we stopped to think about the morality behind it.\"Today people are more prepared to look into things a little deeper, to understand right from wrong and, with regards to a football club, have the desire to know that who is representing their team suits their ideologies and beliefs. This is a good thing.\"Only time will tell if our feeling towards his character will change but, for now, there is no denying the happiness he brought to Chelsea supporters during his time here and for that we are thankful.\"What CAN'T the club do?Enter into transfer deals for new players or receive money for selling existing players.Issue new contracts to existing players.Sell any new tickets to upcoming games -- only season ticket holders can go to games for the foreseeable future.Sell any merchandise -- however, any third parties who purchased or produced Club Merchandise prior to Thursday are permitted to sell stock.This schism between appreciation and criticism manifested itself in Chelsea's league fixtures at Burnley on March 5 and at Norwich City on March 10.As a minute's applause was held in tribute to Ukraine before the Burnley game, chants of Abramovich's name could be heard on a Sky Sports broadcast before being drowned out by boos from the stands.The chants drew reproach from Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel after the game.\"If we show solidarity, we show solidarity and we should do it together. We take the knee together, if an important person from other clubs or from our club unfortunately dies, we show a minute of respect,\" Tuchel told reporters after the game, which Chelsea won 4-0. \"It's not the moment to give other messages, it's a moment to show respect. We do this because this is what we are also as a club, we show respect as a club. We need our fans to commit to this minute of applause in the moment. \"We do it for Ukraine, there is no second opinion about the situation there. They have our thoughts and our support, and we should stand together as a club.\"Players, officials and fans took part in a minute of applause to indicate peace and sympathy with Ukraine before Burnley faced Chelsea.Beyond this mixture of sentiment among fans is an equally strong feeling of anxiety. Rumors of potential buyers continue to abound, but as yet it remains to be seen when the club's future will be clarified.Who will the new owner be? Will they be capable or willing to invest the same funds as Abramovich? Would they try to move Chelsea away from Stamford Bridge? After almost two decades of looking ahead to nothing but success, these questions and more have Weekes' mind \"whirling.\"\"In the end Roman explicitly outlined that owning Chelsea was never for financial gain, will the new owner fell that way? Unlikely,\" Weekes said.\"That is worrying, as, on top of everything, it might be the supporters that end up paying the price.\"",

Here's how the letter became a pro-war symbolRead MoreThe IOC also announced that it had withdrawn the Olympic Order -- the highest award of the Olympic movement -- from Putin.\"The IOC was viewed as having a close relationship with Russia,\" Michael Payne, former head of marketing at the IOC, told CNN. \"The fact that the IOC has now issued a set of sanctions to Russia, which, in my view, are probably the strongest sanctions the IOC has ever issued ... since probably the early 60s when the IOC banned South Africa for its apartheid regime,\" he said.Meanwhile, world football's governing body, FIFA, and European soccer body, UEFA, have suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions \"until further notice.\"Vladimir Putin kicks a football during an event in the Red Square on June 28, 2018 in Moscow.\"Vladimir Putin has been passionate about both sports and using sport to project Russia's importance on the world stage and giving back to the Russian people a sense of pride in their success on the world stage.\"Payne added that the most immediate impact of sanctions could be to challenge the Kremlin's narrative on the conflict, with ordinary Russians wondering what has happened to events they were due to host.UEFA announced last month that this year's Champions League final will no longer take place in St. Petersburg's Krestovsky Stadium, which is sponsored by Russian state-owned company Gazprom, and will now be moved to the Stade de France in Paris to be played on the original date of May 28.\"There can be no misunderstanding: no amount of control of the Russian media is able to explain what's going on in the sports world, that they've suddenly been banished,\" Payne said.Russia is covering the country's invasion of Ukraine very differently to CNN and other western news outlets. A new law forbids media operating in Russia to use the words \"war,\" \"attack\" or \"invasion\" to describe Putin's decision to unleash his forces against Ukraine. Instead, they are to use the Kremlin's Orwellian phrase: \"special military operation.\"Russians' access to social media like Facebook and Twitter has also been severely restricted.\"Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can't they see their Russian athletes performing? And clearly, then there's prompting the Russian people to say 'What's going on?'\" Payne said.\u200b\"Will Putin care about having to give his Olympic gold order back or what the rest of the international world thinks of him? Probably not. \"Will he care about what all the local Russians are saying, 'Hang on, what is going on?' Absolutely.\" Sports as a nationalist toolLukas Aubin, associate researcher at The French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and a specialist in the geopolitics of Russia and sports, told CNN Sport that Putin carefully curates his image so that observers are aware of his sporting prowess, on a national and international level.\"When Putin arrived at power in 2000, one of his first decisions was to invite his former coach in judo [to the Kremlin],\" he said.The Russian premier has also been pictured ice swimming, fishing and bare-chested horseback riding.Putin attends a gala match of the Night Hockey League teams at the Bolshoy ice arena on May 10, 2017 in Sochi, Russia. \"Today, President Putin uses sports as an element of his power. And not only as a part of his personality because he also has created a big sporting system. He's using oligarchs, politics, former athletes, to create a machine.\"It's a big system, where people [are] driven by Putin in the directions that they need to create a beautiful picture of Russia, in the world of sports,\" he added.This worked for the most part, Aubin said.\"It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics. Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup. It is really very hard to say how many international sporting events Russia [has] hosted the past 10 years -- it's really a lot. At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power,\" Aubin added.  Vera Tolz, professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, told CNN Sport that Putin has used Russian nationalism \"instrumentally and very systematically\" as a way of legitimizing his regime since he came to power.Winter Paralympics: Ukrainian athletes' thoughts are with those fighting the invasion back home as they enjoy golden success in Beijing\"Nationalism -- and the kind of national unification with promoting particular versions of history, of organizing, establishing new national holidays, and of course, sport -- has been absolutely key to his legitimation strategy,\" she explained, adding such tactics date back to the Soviet period, where sport was used \"very intensively as a tool of building loyalty of the people to the regime.\"\"Even the fact that the Kremlin, Russia, has gone to such lengths, in using doping, in order to win more medals, in a way shows how participating in competitions and winning, winning was key to Putin's Popular Mobilization strategy,\" Tolz added. In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions -- notably the Olympics and the World Cup -- for four years over doping non-compliance. The ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.WADA's punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.\"Every time you let Russia into an international sporting event, you're essentially agreeing to swim with man-eating sharks. They will cheat your athletes, they will not feel bad about it, they will lie about it, if they're caught, they will blame you for calling it out,\" Jim Walden, the US lawyer of Grigory Rodchenkov who was instrumental in exposing Russia's initial cover-up, told CNN.Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Putin spoke of his frustration of the \"politicization of sport\" and that the \"the rights and interests of our athletes must be protected from any arbitrariness.\"The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.Putin looks on during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on February 4. Commissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition.\"Putin very much uses his control over sport to try to game the world and win as much as possible, and also curates the content for the Russian population so that he can get maximum popularity, which translates into maximum power to do what he wants internationally -- essentially pitting Russia against the rest of the world, at least the rest of the Western world,\" Walden added.Fast forward to 2022 and another doping scandal -- surrounding Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva -- overshadowed the Winter Olympics in Beijing.The 15-year-old Valieva, a breakout star of the Games who got the highest mark in the figure skating team event, was allowed to compete despite testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina. The failed test occurred before the Winter Olympics but only came to light during the Games, and it remains unclear if the drug test controversy will see the medal revoked.\"Not only is Russia myopically focused on winning at any cost, but in terms of any costs, it's no holds barred, right? So murder, bribery, drug trafficking, any kind of criminality that will give them an advantage. They believe that not only will they do it, but that other people are weak for following the rules,\" Walden said.\"So they marry criminality with obstruction and put that together with sports. And that is how they have consistently won. And that's how the Russian government has used it to prop up its own popularity, so that it has more leeway to engage in troublemaking abroad,\" he added.Trail of moneyOlympic great Edwin Moses, who opposed the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics, has gone so far as to call for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Olympics.\"The boycott in 1980 was political. This is just horrible,\" Moses, who is Chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, said in a press release from Laureus last week.\"It hasn't got a lot to do with politics, it has to do with humanity, the war, the fighting, the children and innocent people getting killed, rockets and missiles, tanks ... and it's live on TV, so everyone is aware of it.\"I was in favor of banning the Russians because of what happened in Sochi in 2014 for really corrupting the integrity of the Olympic Games, via doping. I was on the executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and I thought the penalties were too light.\"What they're doing to the entire world right now in Ukraine, is exactly the same thing they've done to sport, in my opinion. Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games].\"A few years ago, Moses says he met Putin.\"I once sat next to him at [a] table. Two seats to my left, and the translator was in between. And I spoke to him that entire evening. I know how he talked about sports, like it was the Holy Grail, and how important sport was, and how it was good where the best of everyone's country, regardless of your philosophy can compete together, and whoever wins, wins.... I realize now, it was just propaganda.\"CNN's Ben Morse and Ben Church contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Ukrainian boxers Oleksandr Usyk and Vasiliy Lomachenko are childhood friends. They grew up dreaming of fighting their way to fame and glory, and together they conquered the world with their fists.Between them, the 35-year-old Usyk and the 34-year-old Lomachenko won three Olympic gold medals and have since established themselves among the elite boxers in the world. But now they are facing a very different fight -- an existential one -- for the very future of their country. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Usyk and Lomachenko have traveled into Ukraine, taken up arms and joined the territorial defense battalion.Speaking via a video link from a basement in Kyiv, Usyk exclusively told CNN that it's not just invading forces he needs to look out for, but looters as well. He says that he's prepared to take a life, if necessary.\"If they will want to take my life, or the lives of my close ones, I will have to do it,\" he said. \"But I don't want that. I don't want to shoot, I don't want to kill anybody, but if they will be killing me, I will have no choice.\"Read MoreUsyk's manager, Egis Klimas, helped coordinate the interview and translated for Usyk, who doesn't speak English. Despite the terrifying situation that many Ukrainians now find themselves in, Usyk says that he isn't afraid.\"Maybe, it'll sound sentimental,\" he explained, \"but my soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor belong to my country, to my family. So there is no fear, absolutely no fear. There's just bafflement -- how could this be in the 21st century?\"He's not in Ukraine to box right now, but the noble art is still useful in this moment. \"It has helped me to be calm and mentally prepared,\" he said, \"And it helps me to help others who are panicking and nervous.\" Oleksandr Usyk tells CNN that his \"country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt.\"Both men were outside of the country when Russia invaded; Usyk had been in London, shooting sequences for an upcoming video game.He was intending to fly home just hours after the hostilities had commenced, but with the airports closed, he instead flew to Warsaw in Poland and drove almost 500 miles back home and over the border to Kyiv.Lomachenko had been visiting a monastery in Greece and returned home the next day. Instead of flying directly to his hometown of Odessa, he traveled to Bucharest in Romania, then drove for nine hours to the port and caught a ferry into Ukraine.Their manager told CNN that he didn't know they were thinking of taking up arms until they had already signed up for the defense battalion. Former world boxing champions, Vitali -- who is also the Mayor of Kyiv -- and Wladimir Klitschko, have also taken up arms in defense of their nation.Elina Svitolina: Worried for her parents, Ukrainian tennis star says she has been suffering sleepless nights'The bombing around is crazy'Lomachenko was scheduled to speak with CNN at the same time as Usyk but wasn't responding to the calls from his manager at the time. Early Wednesday morning local time, Klimas confirmed to CNN that Lomachenko was safe and sound.He and Usyk remain close: they are godfathers to each other's children and celebrate family birthdays together. Six days into the war, Usyk knows that nowhere is safe anymore in Ukraine.\"The bombing around is crazy,\" Usyk said. \"They just bombed the city of Mariupol, one of my friends got a rocket in his roof. [The Russians] are not playing games.\" As the fighting rages, so too does the debate about whether Russian athletes should be sanctioned for the actions of their country. Usyk chose not to weigh in directly, suggesting that there are innocent people on both sides of the conflict.\"Russian people don't really know exactly what's going on here. They're not seeing what's going on. They are victims of their President [Vladimir Putin].\"Usyk won his heavyweight title belts in a superb display in September 2021 against former champion Anthony Joshua.Usyk has only just become the IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO world heavyweight champion. In September, he defeated Anthony Joshua in London in a superb boxing display to claim the belts. His manager says that talks of a rematch this summer are at an advanced stage.The lightweight Lomachenko has previously been world champion in three different weight classes and was planning to fight George Kambosos in Australia in June.But understandably, boxing is the last thing on their minds.\"I really don't know when I'm going to be stepping back in the ring,\" said Usyk, who looked exhausted and emotional in his interview with CNN. \"My country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt.\"Usyk has three children and, during the interview, the sound of young voices could be heard playing behind him in the basement. He says that family, friends and neighbors have been sheltering together. \"When there is an air raid alarm, we hide. Of course, it's fun when there are a lot of us here -- we're having fun. But we're forcing ourselves to have fun.\" They're trying to keep the mood light for the kids.But in a separate conversation with CNN, Usyk's manager Klimas emphasized the gravity of the situation: \"They're in big danger. When the bullets start flying, the bullet doesn't care if you're a world champion. The bullet just goes through.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Mastering the art of marathon running is a lifetime pursuit for some, but it seemed to take Molly Seidel roughly two-and-a-half hours on one windswept morning in Atlanta a couple of years ago. That was during the US Olympic trials when Seidel, competing in her first ever marathon, stunned the field to place second and qualify for the US team. Fast-forward to 2022 and, three marathons later, the 27-year-old Seidel can now call herself an Olympic medalist and the fastest American woman ever at the New York City Marathon. Having taken to the start line of her debut marathon in Atlanta hoping to place in the top 20 -- with the prospect of competing, let alone medaling, at the Olympics a remote thought -- she's the first to admit the race \"blew away all of my expectations.\" \"Life has a funny way of giving you what you need before you think you're ready for it,\" Seidel tells CNN Sport, weeks out from the fifth marathon of her career in Boston next month. Read MoreWhile many distance runners step up to the 26.2-mile marathon distance towards the end of their careers, Seidel was a comparatively early convert having made the switch from track racing in her mid 20s. Partly, that was due to her frustration with running 10,000m on the track -- \"I kind of kept banging my head against the wall with that one,\" she says -- and partly due to ambitions she had held growing up. \"I always kind of dreamed of doing the marathon,\" Seidel adds. \"I think there's just this kind of like glamor and mystery around it, and especially for a younger runner who enjoys doing the distance events in high school, that's kind of the ultimate goal. Everybody wants to do the marathon.\"An emotional Seidel reacts to finishing second at the Olympic trials. Seidel's success at the Olympic trials wasn't without challenges. As the pandemic delayed the Tokyo Games by a year, further opportunities to prove her credentials in the marathon distance were placed on hold.  \"I struggled with this kind of imposter syndrome after the trials, specifically as probably the person no one expected to make the team and the person that got probably the most criticism like: Hey, why is this girl on the team?\" she says.  \"I think I really struggled with that, and I struggled going into the Games and feeling like I belonged there and trying to prove that I wasn't a mistake on that team.\"The postponement of the Olympics did give Seidel the chance to compete in a second marathon -- a sixth-place finish on a modified, elites-only London course involving 20 laps around Buckingham Palace -- before gradually turning her attention to the Games.When the Olympic Marathon came around 18 months after she had qualified for the team, Seidel once again exceeded her own expectations with a typically gutsy, gritty performance in the sweltering heat of Sapporo.

But with two-and-a-half miles remaining, Salpeter hit a wall and faded from contention. A medal was now Seidel's to lose, and she duly wrapped up the bronze with a scream of joy as she crossed the finish line -- the third US woman ever to medal in the Olympic marathon. \"I struggle with confidence and I struggle with wondering whether or not I belong at this level, whether I belong as a competitor on the world stage,\" says Seidel. \"The Olympic medal was kind of showing me: Hey, you belong here, and you can do this regardless of any insecurities that you might feel,\" she adds. \"You can still go get beaten, you can still have a lot of work to do, but you can do this.\"That run at the Olympics -- brutal and energy-sapping in itself -- was made all the more draining because of the circumstances around the Games. \"Yes, we were coming off this emotional high winning the medal,\" says Seidel, \"but there had been so much just pent up stress over the course of the Games and leading into the Games with Covid, with the quarantine, wondering if the Games are going to happen. JUST WATCHEDShe missed out on the Olympics, so she broke 50km record insteadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHShe missed out on the Olympics, so she broke 50km record instead 02:29\"And so I came back and frankly, I was just tired and emotionally exhausted and spent.\"After returning to her family in Wisconsin -- \"a detox from the amount of stress that I'd been holding throughout the entirety of the Games,\" according to Seidel -- she started her buildup to her fourth marathon in November, this time in New York. But obstacles -- physical as well as mental -- kept appearing. Two broken ribs she suffered ahead of the race hadn't healed with race day looming, and her coach Jon Green suggested she wasn't ready to compete.  \"It was an absolute disaster of a buildup,\" says Seidel. \"It was really hard, not only with the mental stress that we had going on after the Games of just feeling, frankly, no motivation. And just trying to find that drive to re-up for another hard race right after an enormous race that I'd been training effectively two years for. \"And then it was just like problem after problem after problem, and injury after injury.\"Seidel catches her breath at the end of the Olympic marathon in Sapporo. Even with two of her ribs broken, Seidel says she \"felt incredible\" during the race, setting a new course record for an American woman of two hours, 24 minutes and 42 seconds and placing fourth. She had planned to make a return to the streets of New York this weekend for the NYC Half, but announced on Tuesday that \"setbacks in training\" -- which are not infrequent occurrences when you're running up to 135 miles a week -- have meant she took the decision to stay at her training base in Flagstaff, Arizona ahead of the Boston Marathon. \"It's super tough,\" Seidel said on her high-mileage schedule. \"It's hard, but I think it's a matter of learning how to balance. Your body adapts over time and I make sure I'm getting sufficient rest and all that. It's a challenge, but I love the challenge of it.\"Seidel is no stranger to training setbacks and has previously explained how her \"very high pain tolerance\" has caused her to push beyond discomfort and exacerbate injuries. In her first year as a pro runner from 2017 to 2018, for example, she ran on a broken pelvis for a year. A lot has changed in her running career since then. Broken bones have healed and Seidel has established herself as one of the best marathon runners in the world. But that's not to say there are no more goals to chase, nor that there are no more lessons to learn. Each marathon, she explains, brings with it fresh experience and a renewed sense of joy. \"I feel like every single time it's just kind of wild,\" says Seidel.",

        "content": "(CNN)Australian personal trainer Michael Italiano previously had little knowledge of Formula One, but that soon changed when he received a surprise text message from an old acquaintance.That message came from Formula One Daniel Ricciardo at the end of 2017, who wanted Italiano to travel the world with him as his performance coach. The pair, who had met through mutual friends in Perth at the age of 12, hadn't discussed the possibility of working together before, and most of Italiano's experience of F1 had come from following Ricciardo's rise through the motorsport ranks over the years.\"I used to watch the races, for sure,\" Italiano tells CNN Sport as he prepares to enter his fifth season alongside McLaren's Ricciardo.\"Did I know the history behind it? No. Did I know the sport science behind it or how to train a Formula One driver? No. So 2018 was a lot of work.\"Read MoreThe learning process entailed picking the brains of those around him in the F1 paddock, as well as scouring Google Scholar for any available information on the physical demands of driving headlong around a track for two hours.But Italiano's responsibilities don't stop with drawing up fitness sessions for the 32-year-old Ricciardo.An F1 performance coach is charged with ensuring their driver is in prime physical and mental condition at the start of every race -- something that means the pair spend 250 days of the year together.Italiano takes responsibility for massages, nutrition, sleep, jet lag, mindfulness and anything in between to ensure race weekends run smoothly.JUST WATCHEDF1 star Daniel Ricciardo on farm life in lockdownReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHF1 star Daniel Ricciardo on farm life in lockdown 03:40\"It could be making sure his laundry is getting done, or even making sure he's having breakfast on time, or just cleaning up the room and making sure his backpack is packed and ready to go,\" explains Italiano.\"Little things like that really add up [...] giving him a schedule so that he doesn't have to think [...] kind of running his week so he can just focus on racing.\"Neck strengthThe pair are now coming off the back of a three-month preseason in preparation for the first race of the season in Bahrain on Sunday. Italiano has worked on building Ricciardo's neck strength -- a crucial requirement for drivers to withstand the G-force of tackling sharp corners at high speed. And as the sport advances, engines get bigger and cars get faster, placing more demand on a driver's body each year, according to Italiano. \"It's not about just hitting the markers with their neck strength; every year, they need to hit PBs [personal bests] pretty much,\" he says.\"A typical corner on an F1 course might see drivers fighting against four to five G, which is about pulling roughly 35 kilos [77 pounds] on your neck -- quite a big load. \"You might think, 'Okay, it's a corner, it only lasts for one to two seconds.' But you're doing it for two hours, so it can add up quickly.\"This weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix will mark the start of Ricciardo and Italiano's fifth season together having teamed up while Ricciardo was with Red Bull. In an attempt to build Ricciardo's neck strength, Italiano says he's studied other sports like the NFL, boxing and rugby for inspiration, while he also carries a neck harness with him throughout the season for flexion and extension exercises.\"These guys are under tension in the body pretty much for two hours. They're fighting the car and the vibrations of the car, the resistance of the car,\" says Italiano.That means whole-body strength and cardiovascular fitness become an important factor, too.  \"These guys are in fire-resistant suits, they don't breathe,\" Italiano continues. \"All of a sudden, thermoregulation of the body -- the ability for the body to cool down -- is heavily restricted.\"They're low to the ground, the bitumen is so hot; they've got an engine behind them, which is bringing in more heat. \"The ability to cool down is just non-existent [...] You start becoming dehydrated, you start lacking fluids, you start to fatigue. \"And if you start to fatigue, your reaction times start to hinder. That starts happening, you start losing one or two tenths per lap in a Formula One race. It could be the difference between a podium and finishing in the top 10.\"In the gym during preseason, Italiano has tasked Ricciardo with cardio sessions (running, rowing and cycling), strength exercises (deadlifts, squatting and bench-press) and core stability training. \"We also emphasize training on the posterior chain [muscles on the backside of the body] because a lot of the braking loads -- when they're smashing that brake with their left foot -- is going through the calves, hamstrings and glutes,\" says Italiano.JUST WATCHEDRed Bull team boss discusses Max Verstappen's win and moreReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRed Bull team boss discusses Max Verstappen's win and more 03:58Mental preparationItaliano's influence extends to Ricciardo's diet during race weekends -- meeting with the McLaren team chef to provide guidance on mealtimes, recipes and portion sizes -- adapting to hot climates and high altitudes, and assisting with recovery from travel and jet lag. \"We hired a bit of a jet lag guru and we also have a jet lag app, which helps a lot with caffeine timing, light exposure, adapting to the time zone,\" he says.\"The meal timing on a flight is a big one, and also exercise timing when you land can aid with sleep and getting on the right time zone. There are a lot of factors that affect jet lag. It was the number one thing we really, really tried to hone down on.\"Then there's also mental preparation during a race weekend. \"Something we talk a lot about is getting to that flow state on a Sunday,\" says Italiano. \"The Wednesday or Thursday, it's get everything off your chest day, where it's like: 'OK, mate, what's bugging you? What's on your mind?' Just get it off your chest. \"Qualifying, I like to get Daniel in a very calming state of mind because qualifying is about just perfecting the one lap. And Daniel, he performs very well in a relaxed state for qualifying. \"Whereas race, we want him at an intensity level of about seven out of 10, we don't want him too intense because being too fired up can actually make your reactions worse if you're too fired up.\"Come Sunday when the checkered flag falls at the start of the Bahrain Grand Prix, Italiano will be hoping that his painstaking preparation -- from calf strength to cardio, squats to sleep schedules -- bears fruit.Ricciardo, who placed eighth in the driver standings last season, tested positive for Covid-19 last week, but has recovered in time to compete in this weekend's race. Italiano juggles his work as Ricciardo's performance coach with his own online coaching platform, MI Coaching, which seeks to make elite-level performance training accessible to the public. But F1 remains the priority. He anticipates there will be plenty of nerves as the season gets underway on Sunday, but excitement and curiosity, too.  \"There is an element of uncertainty and unknown,\" says Italiano, \"not knowing which teams have made gains and which teams are a step behind. I find it quite intriguing.\"Those emotions are always accompanied by a sense of pride when he watches Ricciardo take to the racetrack. \"It's been a massive inspiration to see a guy from the same city as me on the world stage,\" says Italiano. \"It's just inspiring to be with him and then also helping him.

        "content": "(CNN)Even by Paris Saint-Germain's standards, the past week has been an eventful one.It started last Wednesday with yet another Champions League capitulation, something PSG has become rather adept at.However, the recent meltdown against Real Madrid -- in which PSG conceded three goals in 27 minutes to throw away a 2-0 aggregate lead -- differed to the previous implosions against Barcelona and Manchester United in one key way: it wasn't particularly surprising.As soon as goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma's dawdling had gifted Karim Benzema the first of his three goals, PSG's demise felt inevitable. But despite that inevitability, it still made for gruesome yet compelling viewing, like peaking through your fingers while watching a horror movie.The sequel to that horror show was Saturday's 3-0 win against Bordeaux, in which a significant section of PSG fans turned on their own players. During the match, most of the squad was treated to a frosty reception by the Parc des Princes crowd -- and some received a frostier welcome than others.Read MoreMost notably Neymar and Lionel Messi, both of who were roundly booed by PSG fans during the build up to the opening goal. There was a loud cheer when Neymar turned the ball into the net, but those cheers promptly turned to jeers once the initial jubilation had subsided.READ: Karim Benzema scores hat-trick in 17 minutes as Real Madrid dumps PSG out of Champions LeagueLionel Messi and Neymar were on the receiving end of jeers from their own fans.Messi arrived in Paris to much fanfare in what was arguably the most shocking player move in history, but the signing has so far been painfully underwhelming for PSG fans.The Argentine has mustered a paltry two goals in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this season, with five more coming in the Champions League, and has looked like a shadow of the player he was even in those later years at Barcelona.UEFA investigationThe humiliation against Real Madrid on the pitch was compounded by the widely reported behavior of PSG delegates off it.After the game, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo reportedly confronted the officials in the referees' dressing room to express their anger at Real Madrid's first goal, which they believe came after Benzema had committed a foul on Donnarumma.UEFA later confirmed that a disciplinary case into the incident had been opened. \"The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will take a decision in due course,\" European football's governing body said.PSG declined to comment on the UEFA disciplinary case when contacted by CNN.While the frustration brought on by PSG's Champions League failures were directed at the players on the pitch on Saturday, Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo haven't escaped the ire of the club's supporters.In a statement released earlier on Saturday, club supporter group Collectif Ultra Paris called for Al-Khelaifi's resignation.Lionel Messi has managed just two goals in Ligue 1 all season.\"How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker?\" was one of several questions posed in the statement.\"We don't have a short memory. We know what our return owes to president Nasser Al-Khelaifi but it is clear he is not the man for the job.\"The club's current situation requires complete reorganization at all levels going forward and the daily presence of its president.\"On Monday, fan frustration was visible for all to see at PSG's training center and Parc des Princes stadium, where insults and calls for Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo to leave the club were sprayed onto the facilities.\"Nasser, Leo out,\" read one piece of graffiti, thought to be aimed at Leonardo rather than Messi.Likewise, head coach Mauricio Pochettino did not escape from the Real Madrid debacle without any blame. Unsurprisingly, the Argentine has faced calls for his sacking or resignation, but Leonardo insisted that wasn't a solution.\"We shouldn't throw everything in the bin,\" he told RMC Sport. \"We shouldn't start from scratch after every loss. The objective is to win the Champions League, and until half time we were fine.\"We have to look to improve this team and maintain morale to play in Ligue 1 and to finish the season well. We should stay together. Pochettino is still part of the project for this season. It's not the time to think about that.\"Mauricio Pochettino has come in for criticism following the Real Madrid defeat.With 10 games left in Ligue 1 and holding a 15-point lead over second-place Marseille, PSG is almost certain to secure its seventh French league title in eight season.Following the win over Bordeaux, Pochettino said he was \"sad\" to hear the booing from the crowd and insisted their anger was also felt within the squad.\"We were all affected,\" he said. \"We understand the disappointment and the frustration. We're all living it together, as a team. We have a duty to take responsibility for what happened. We share this disappointment with the supporters.\"Player departures?One player who did manage to escape the booing was Kylian Mbappe.The striker, who was cheered throughout the match against Bordeaux, is the golden boy of French football and scored both of PSG's goals in the recent tie against Real Madrid. Despite the French club boasting both Messi and Neymar in its ranks, Mbappe is perhaps PSG's most prized asset.It will come as a significant concern, then, that there is the strong possibility of PSG losing Mbappe for free in the summer. The 23-year-old's current contract expires on June 30, 2022 and so far no headway has been made on a new deal.Mbappe told CNN at the end of December, just ahead of European football's January transfer window, that he would \"100%\" finish the season with PSG. However, he hasn't hidden his desire to move to pastures new -- specifically pastures in Madrid.When Real submitted a $188 million bid for Mbappe in August -- a deal that was close to being agreed -- the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG.\"I was honest,\" Mbappe said. \"I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart. I'm happy to stay ... it's my city too. I'm French ... I want to win everything this season.\"Whether Mbappe is still \"happy to stay\" now, however, is another matter, and one that is sure to give Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo yet another headache.",

Like many others, they fled Ukraine, setting off on a perilous journey to safety.Paulo Fonseca, the former Shakhtar Donetsk and AS Roma football manager, and his Ukrainian wife Katerina, first attempted to flee the country by car, along with their toddler and Katerina's parents.After encountering gridlocked traffic, they were forced to spend another night in the capital inside a hotel bunker, before enduring a 30-hour car journey through Moldova to Romania.   \"It was really very difficult, but I think it's much more difficult for the Ukrainians which continue there in Ukraine where the situation is becoming worse and worse every single day,\" Katerina told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.\"This war is, I believe, one of the cruelest in the story of all of the world, because the soldiers that are killing us, they are talking the same language and it's unbelievable.\"Read More\"We left everything in Ukraine,\" Katerina added, including friends and relatives who have remained in the country, \"All the places that mean so much for us are still there, so my heart is there and my heart is broken for everything.\"READ: Basketball star is the latest American to be detained in RussiaFonseca in 2018 speaking to his Shakhtar Donetsk players. More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled in a refugee exodus following Russia's invasion of the country, according to the United Nations. To put that into context, it took six months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013, nearly two years after that country's civil war began.Many cities in Ukraine have been devastated, Katerina said, adding that it was important to stop the war and prevent it from spreading to other European countries.The Fonseca family arrived in Paulo's home country of Portugal on February 28 and are now working with the Portuguese Football Federation as ambassadors of an initiative with Portuguese national football clubs which aims to help Ukrainian refugees find homes and jobs.After his playing career, mainly with Lisbon club Estrela da Amadora, the 49-year old Fonseca first became a manager in Portugal in 2005. He then went on to earn the distinction of best coach in the Ukrainian Premier League in 2016-17 as Shakhtar Donetsk coach, where he won seven trophies in three seasons.\"I'm very proud to be part of this world, to be part of football, what the people in football are doing, it's amazing. But I think we can do more,\" Fonseca told CNN Sport.\"I would like to see the great personalities of football defending the peace in Europe.

He returned to Ukraine early from a holiday to help his wife and family escape.In an Instagram post announcing the Fonsecas' new roles as ambassadors for the Ukrainian refugee initiative, the former Roma manager added that the Portuguese Football Federation had \"demonstrated that football can and should be used as a tool for social change.\"He appealed to all clubs to join in solidarity with the initiative.Katerina expressed her gratitude for the Portuguese Football Federation, saying: \"They are receiving with open arms our little young players. It is a really big support for the kids, which lost all the happiness in their everyday lives.\"",

        "content": "San Luis Obispo, California (CNN)Sometimes, the most mundane sounding sentences presage something anything but ordinary: \"All right, seatbelt is on tight? Here we go,\" skydiver Luke Aikins smiles from the pilot's seat of his Cessna 182. \"Brake coming down. Power off. Autopilot engaged.\"The plane slows abruptly, then pitches down, steeper, then steeper still, settling into the most precipitous of dives, pointed directly at the ocean below. To the left of us, the door of the little Cessna has been removed. The wind rages past as the Pacific coast pulls ever closer into view.Aikins laughs as he counts the altimeter down, his hands fully off the yoke. \"It's doing it all by itself! 7,000 feet, 6,000 feet, 5,000 feet ... recovery.\" The Cessna's engine restarts, and it eases back to a horizontal position.CNN Sport is flying high above the Californian coast town of San Luis Obispo with world famous skydiver Luke Aikins. A veteran of some 21,000 jumps, Aikins has worked as a stuntman and consultant on Hollywood blockbusters and trained US Navy SEALs.He has just given CNN a taste of one key element of a stunt that he and his cousin Andy Farrington will be attempting on April 24. Set to be broadcast live on Hulu, the Red Bull Plane Swap will be among the most ambitious skydiving stunts ever attempted.For Luke Aikins, the stunt will be the realization of a childhood dream.Read More'I'm going to skydive into his; he's going to skydive into mine'\"In a nutshell, I'm going to take one plane, my cousin Andy's going to take another one, and we're going to fly up to 14,000 feet in formation,\" the 48-year-old explains.\"I'm in one plane, he's in the other one, nobody else. We put the planes in a dive, straight at the ground, and then I'm going to get out of my plane, he's going to get out of his plane, and we're going to swap planes mid-flight.\"I'm going to skydive into his, he's going to skydive into mine, I'll bring his plane back to land and he's going to bring mine.\"The stunt will be in a 1964 Cessna 182 -- a classic workhorse plane renowned for its tough practicality.It all sounds so simple, but this most extreme of stunts has been decades in the making. For Aikins, it will also be the realization of a childhood dream.\"When I was 16 or 17, there was a parachutist magazine that came out, and there was a picture of an old Stearman biplane in a dive, with a big parachute behind it slowing it down, and a skydiver in a yellow jumpsuit flying with that airplane,\" he recalls.\"I was so inspired by it, I thought it was so cool -- I'm getting goosebumps just talking about it -- and I thought, 'Someday, I want to do that.'\"But Aikins wasn't satisfied with just copying the wild feat. \"As I got older, I'm like, I don't want to do what somebody else has done, I want to take it to the next level and do something more impressive and better than what I saw.\"Dream to realityDreaming of the stunt and doing it were, however, two different things. Aikins knew he needed engineering expertise to design it. \"This airplane weighs 2,000 pounds, if we just put this plane in a dive, normally, it would go so fast it would rip the wings off and the airplane would just disintegrate.\"The answer to the conundrum came at a Red Bull Air Race. \"I got talking to somebody, and I was telling him about this project that I really wanted to do, and they said, 'Oh, you need to talk to Paulo.'\"Paulo is renowned Brazilian aeronautical engineer Paulo Iscold, who was already aware of Aikins' reputation following a previous stunt, where the skydiver had landed in a 100x100-foot net after jumping from 25,000 feet without a parachute.\"I was actually working for Kirby (Chambliss), another Red Bull athlete,\" Iscold explains. \"They went to a race, and they said, 'Hey, the guy who jumped without a parachute is here and is a Red Bull athlete.' And I said, 'Well, I want to meet that guy because he is really crazy and brave.'The two hit it off immediately.\"I sat down with Paulo at the lunch table, and told him I really didn't want to use a drogue chute (a type of parachute), I wanted to do something that had never been done before,\" Aikins tells CNN. \"I wanted the plane to seem normal. He drew -- on a napkin -- this crazy speed brake system, just sketched on a napkin.\"No answers written anywhereLuke Aikins and Andy Farrington practice for their Plane Swap Iscold knew that the project would be far more complex than the sketch suggested.\"This was different to other projects that I did where you can go to the book and find the answers in the book -- this project had no answers written anywhere.\"To find the parts and put them together to be able to do it, that's what caught my attention, and that's why it was a big challenge for me as an engineer, to do something that nobody had done.\"Inspired by their first meeting, Aikins immediately set to work too. \"I went home after meeting with Paulo and I bought an RC plane,\" he recalls.\"I took Paulo's design of the speed brake on the belly, and I made one on an RC plane and started flying it. These actuators would push this brake down, and I would dive the plane at the ground, and we'd measure the speed, then we'd put the brake up and measure the speed.\"Paulo did the math, with the weight of this and the weight of the real plane, and scaled it out.\"The result was a giant 21 sq. ft. speed brake, which Iscold's team worked to attach to a 1964 Cessna 182 -- a classic workhorse plane renowned for its tough practicality.In the hanger where the Cessna is being prepared, Iscold walks CNN through the bizarre looking brake. \"It's composed of carbon fiber plates, which when deployed produce a lot of drag. The plates have holes in them: this is just an aerodynamic trick to reduce vibration.\"\"But the biggest problem that we had to solve was how to attach this to the airplane because this needs to carry pretty much the weight of the airplane. The landing gear is designed to take the weight of the airplane, so why not put the speed brake on the landing gear structure?\"The Cessna is also filled with sensors and a complex vector navigation system, which enables Iscold to track and monitor every aspect of its flight -- crucial given that it will be flying without a pilot during the stunt. The latest in a long line of skydivers and pilots, Aikins grew up around the sport.'Jumping out isn't the hard part'Once Aikins and his cousin leave their planes, however, the rest is entirely down to their skill as skydivers.\"Jumping out isn't the hard part, the hard part is getting back in,\" Aikins explains. \"We'll fly in, chest to the ground, up to the plane, we'll grab the wing strut, and then we kind of walk our way right into the airplane.\"As soon as your body gets halfway into the door, there's no wind, it's all fine. You'll be able to flip the switches and recover the airplane, restart the engine, pull the speed brake up and bring it back around.\"The latest in a long line of skydivers and pilots, Aikins grew up around the sport.\"My Dad learned to fly when he was 13, flying for my grandpa, skydiving for my grandpa,\" he says. \"My Dad flew C-130s in the Navy, we lived in Guam and Japan and kind of grew up all around the world like that. (He) taught us how to fly -- my brothers, my sister -- I have two brothers and a sister that have a pilots' license.\"As a husband, and the father of a 10-year-old son, Aikins doesn't shirk from the fact that the life he has chosen is a dangerous one, a point underlined by the fact that his father lost his life in a plane crash in 2017.\"My wife and I we have all these conversations,\" he admits. \"We've talked about what happens if I die, what happens if this happens and, you know, we have all those hard talks, so I think that you have to have a partner, I mean, my wife goes into this with her eyes open.\"'I need to worry'Iscold says part of his job is to worry. \"As the engineer, I need to worry about everything, that's how we make it safe. My job is to think about all the problems that can happen and talk about those problems.\"\"We make a good team,\" Aikins adds, \"Because he worries a little bit, I don't worry too much, and I'll leave and he'll call me and say, 'There's a couple of things I'm really concerned about,' and we talk about it, and I think we make a really good team that way back and forth. We both give a little bit, we're pretty aligned.\"\"I'm what you would consider an extreme athlete, out doing all this stuff. But what the world doesn't see is all the research and development, all the testing, it's essentially a flight test program from the ground up.\"In just a few weeks, the pair will test that partnership to the absolute limit, high above a remote part of Arizona -- and a childhood dream, more than three decades old, will be brought to life at 14,000 feet.",

And I look at my daughter and I say, 'Wow, I don't think I could do what my dad did every single day.' It's a lot of work.\"Serena's older sister Venus paved the way, turning professional one year earlier than her, winning seven grand slam singles titles so far in her career. Venus still competes on the tour, aged 41.Initially, Serena lived in Venus' shadow.\"My sister was much better than me. I was not very good growing up. And so, everyone was focused on Venus. And in the film, it goes into that, how when we had an opportunity to have better coaches, they saw that Venus was the one.\"And so, that was devastating for me ... but helpful. Because if that hadn't happened, I wouldn't have had the career that I have because I felt like I just had to prove and just had to win.\"Serena and Venus attend the premiere of Warner Bros' \"King Richard\" in Hollywood in November 2021.Williams turned to her mother, Oracene Price, who played a critical but often overlooked role in her success.\"I just had to work with mom. I didn't get to work with the prestigious coaches or anything. And my mom made me tough mentally,\" she added.'We had to be better'Serena, Venus and their dad came up against racism throughout their careers, most notably in 2001 at Indian Wells.Asked by Amanpour how they perceived and overcame the racism that they experienced as tennis players in a predominantly White sport, Williams responded: \"We changed it from being two great Black champions to being the best ever, period. And that's what we did. We took out color, and we just became the best.\"And yes, we had to play harder, and we had to be better, but it made us better.\"And at the end of the day, every time we faced a challenge and every time we overcame that challenge, we created Venus and Serena.\"Williams also discussed her venture fund Serena Ventures, which this week announced $111 million had been raised to invest in founders of diverse backgrounds.\"It's really about diversity,\" Williams told Amanpour, explaining that she was spurred to action when she learnt that less than 2% of all venture capital money went to women.\"Because of tennis, I have a way to impact VC in a different way and bringing diversity to that as well,\" she said.Venus (L) defeated sister Serena in an all-Williams 2008 Wimbledon final.Double standardsAt times, Williams has shown anger and exasperation with umpires on the court, most infamously at the 2018 US Open final which she lost to Naomi Osaka.She was heavily criticized and fined over the episode.Amanpour asked Williams if she feels double standards exist in the sport, given men routinely act out at umpires, often with impunity.Williams argues with umpire Carlos Ramos during her US Open final match against Osaka in 2018.Responding to a recent incident involving German player Alexander Zverev, in which he struck the umpire's chair multiple times with his racket and was subsequently withdrawn from the Mexican Open and fined, Williams said: \"There is absolutely a double standard. I would probably be in jail if I did that. Like literally, no joke.\"And as she chases Court's grand slam record, Williams is also aware that her career and life won't only be defined by how many titles she might win.\"I am who I am, I love who I am -- I love the impact that I've had on people, that I continue to have on people,\" said Williams, who Amanpour interviewed on February 28, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine.\"Right now the world in such turmoil ... when you look at what's happening in Ukraine and Russia, it's just sad to see,\" added Williams.\"Human life ... is so valuable, and it doesn't matter who you are, where you're from, it should be amazing and of value.\"",

When asked where it ranks in his professional career so far, Varner said: \"It's No. 1 right now.\"He also recognized that his spot in the top 50 golf players in the world will open doors for him.\"I was wanting (to be in the top 50). That is awesome,\" he said in a press conference. \"That's the goal, man. That gets you in the things that I haven't played in. I've played in some big events here and there, but yeah, that's why we play.\"I was on the cusp of it after Hilton Head and didn't execute, played a lot of golf. Frickin' A. That's all I wanted to know when I was sitting out there.\"Varner on the 18th green at the Saudi International.'Life happened'Not only did he shoot up golf's rankings, Varner also traveled back to the Charlotte, US, having won approximately $1 million.Since his first professional win in 2016 at the Australian PGA Championship, Varner had undergone somewhat of a barren spell. Between December 2016 and February 2022, Varner didn't win a professional golf tournament. But his belief never wavered during that time. \"I've never questioned my ability,\" he said. \"The only people that question it are the people that sit right in here, and they're like, 'Man, he needs to be winning.' But I don't march to anyone's beat in here. I do what I'm supposed to do and things come.\"Life happened. My wife, my girlfriend at the time, her brother died a week after that and we were celebrating. Things that I wasn't ready to be a man about. I can sit here and tell you like I just didn't know how to handle it because, I don't know, I think it's a hard thing to deal with. Those things get in the way of just focusing on golf.\"When you're a kid and there's nothing else to do, it's only golf. No, I wouldn't change a thing. How cool is that? It hasn't happened in a long time, and the way it happened right there, it's frickin' awesome.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosVarner poses for a photo with the trophy after winning the Saudi International. During that time, Varner explained that he's grown a lot as both a player and a man.When asked in his press conference after his victory in Saudi Arabia whether he has become more of a spokesperson for Harold Varner than for different things, he replied: \"Amen to that.\"\"I am learning that. I think it comes with maturity. I think just learning how to articulate how to say, 'No,' like I've been struggling saying no to these little kids every time I walk around here today, and it's going to be okay, but I'm going to get them when I leave.\"",

The 28-year-old finished a shot ahead of Anirban Lahiri at TPC Sawgrass, going home with the winner's check of $3.6 million.Smith carded a six-under 66 to finish 13-under for the tournament and claim his second title of the season and fifth of his career. When asked what he was going to do with such a large amount of money in the press conference afterwards, Smith hadn't yet made up his mind. \"I really don't -- I don't have an answer for that. It hasn't sunk in,\" he said with a smile. Read More\"That's a lot of money. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it.\"Smith lines up his putt on the fourth hole during the final round of the Players Championship.The win held even more significance for Smith given who was within the crowd. Amongst the fans watching Smith claim victory in Florida were his mother and sister, who he said he hadn't seen in two-and-a-half years.Smith, who lives in Florida, explained that \"golf was second for these few weeks.\"\"It's really cool to have them here. My main priority really was just to hang out with them and golf was second for these few weeks.\"It's nice to see them and nice to get a win for them.\"The tournament -- one of the PGA Tour's marquee events -- was severely delayed due to inclement weather, with rain, darkness and lightning meaning it had to be finished on Monday rather the traditional Sunday final day. When play resumed early on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field had to complete their third rounds.And after a quick turnaround, Smith began his final round strongly with a huge 38-foot birdie putt on the first hole. He registered five birdies in his opening six holes, before three consecutive bogeys from the seventh hole weakened his grip on the lead. But, under huge pressure, Smith reestablished his lead with four straight birdies to start the back nine, giving him a three-shot lead heading into the final hole. Lahiri birdied the 17th behind Smith to cut the lead to two, while on the 18th, Smith hit his ball into the water as it looked like the title might be slipping away. However, he managed to salvage bogey, leaving Lahiri needing a birdie to force a playoff, but the Indian golfer could only manage a par, cementing Smith's victory. The victory meant he became the fifth Australian to win the famous event, moving Smith up to sixth in golf's world rankings. Smith hits out of the pine straw along the 18th fairway during the final round of the Players Championship.\"I felt as though one of these big ones was the next step for me,\" Smith said. \"I've knocked on the door a few times and I just felt like it was my time.When asked about joining his countrymen in winning the tournament, Smith said: \"Obviously, lots of Australians have won here, lots of great Australian golfers have won here, but the best that have ever lived have won here, as well.\"So it's pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them.\"",

Known for being one of the most entertaining names in golf, the Irishman caused the Players Championship to erupt on Sunday, hitting a hole-in-one on the famous 17th. During the third round of one of the PGA Tour's marquee events, Lowry achieved the feat at the par-three, 124-yard island hole, which he described afterwards as \"one of the most iconic holes in golf.\"The 34-year-old hit a pitching wedge with the ball landing approximately 10 feet past the hole before it gradually rolled towards the pin and dropped in, sparking wild scenes of celebration. He embraced his playing partner and Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter as the crowd went wild. Read MoreAfter picking the ball out of the hole, Lowry threw the ball into the crowd and later signed it.  \"It was a special thing to happen, and I'm looking forward to turning on my phone and seeing the messages I've got,\" Lowry explained. \"Not only that, it put me back in the tournament somewhat. So it was amazing. It's been a long day today, and I'm glad to make the call and finish well today. Played the 17 hole twice and did it in three shots, so it doesn't owe me anything.\"I'm excited for tomorrow now. If it's a long day tomorrow, I can do something hopefully in the morning and finish it off in the afternoon.\"It's the 10th hole-in-one on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass, and the first since Ryan Moore achieved the feat at the 2019 edition of the Players Championship. It is Lowry's second hole-in-one on the PGA Tour, his first coming at the 2016 Masters. Lowry plays his shot from the 10th tee during the third round of the Players Championship.Lowry is now four-under for the tournament, four off the top of the leaderboard. This year's Players Championship has had severe delays after inclement weather swept into the area in Florida.

Three late goals from Gerard Moreno, Pau Torres and Arnaut Danjuma condemned the Old Lady to its joint largest Champions League home defeat. The result also means that Juve has been eliminated in the last 16 for the third consecutive season, while the 2020/21 Europa League-winning Villarreal will play in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2009.Ahead of the match, the two sides were level at 1-1, following a cagey affair in Spain. Juve, however, could not make its home advantage count on the return leg. The Vecchia Signora dominated the first half, creating multiple goal-scoring opportunities, all of which were saved by Villarreal goalkeeper Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli, deflected off the goalposts or blocked by the defense.Read MoreIt wasn't until the 78th minute that The Yellow Submarine had a shot on target when Moreno converted a penalty, after Francis Coquelin had been fouled by Daniel Rugani. Seven minutes later, Torres exploited the poor Juve defense, prodding a corner ball into the back of the net.Then, nearly on the stroke of full-time, Danjuma completed Villarreal's unlikely lopsided victory, converting another penalty conceded by Matthijs de Ligt with a hand ball in the penalty area.Villarreal's Arnaut Danjuma scores a goal against Juventus to complete a surprising 3-0 victory for the Spanish side.Although it was roundly beaten 3-0, Juve dominated in other aspects of the game. The Italians had more possession, more shots, more shots on target and more corners than their opponents, according to match statistics.\"I agree that we had to qualify today, but it was not easy,\" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters after the game. \"It's useless to talk now, we must remain quiet, focus on the league and the Coppa Italia to see if we can take a trophy at home.\" Juve currently sits fourth in Serie A, seven points behind leader AC Milan, and leads its Coppa Italia semifinal against Fiorentina 1-0 after the first leg.Villarreal now advances to the quarterfinals and will find out its next opponent at the Champions League draw on March 18.",

        "content": "(CNN)As Diego Simeone jogged towards the Old Trafford tunnel, the Argentine did well to dodge a number of bottles and cups that were thrown his way by furious Manchester United fans.Simeone's Atl\u00e9tico Madrid had just ended United's last hope of winning any silverware this season in the only way a Simeone team knows how.Cholismo, the sacred art of defensive nous and intense work ethic, had helped Atl\u00e9tico secure a 1-0 win and passage through to the Champions League quarterfinals and left United supporters staring at a fifth straight season without a trophy.Another Champions League meltdown, star players booed and rumored departures: What next for PSG?However, once their rage with Simeone and his team subsides, those United fans will likely realize their real anger is not with an Argentine coach and his divisive tactics, but rather with their own club.\"It's difficult to put into words how we feel now at the moment,\" goalkeeper David De Gea said after the match. \"We did not do enough in both games to win it. It's a very disappointing day for us.Read More\"We are out of one of the most important competitions so we are very sad. Of course, it's not good enough. It's hard for the club, for us and the fans. It's really hard. There are too many years without any trophies, even without fighting for trophies.\"This is where we are at the moment. It's a difficult situation. We have to keep fighting. I feel very sad. But we were not good enough.\"After Tuesday's defeat, interim United head coach Ralf Rangnick said \"some curious refereeing decisions\" were partly to blame for his team's demise.In truth, United was, as De Gea succinctly put it, just not good enough. Not at Old Trafford nor at the Wanda Metropolitano, where three weeks ago it looked as though the team had earned a valuable 1-1 draw.Cristiano Ronaldo struggled to impact the match against Atleti.The reality is this team hasn't been good enough for several years now and the club finds itself in a perpetual state of failed rebuilding; waiting for another unsuccessful season to end before trying to remedy that lack of success with high-profile summer transfer signings or a new manager.Since 2012, United's net spend is \u20ac1.075 billion ($1.18 billion). The club has paid \u20ac1.545 billion ($1.7 billion) in transfers while receiving \u20ac470 million ($516 million) in player sales, according to study published by Switzerland-based independent research group CIES Football Observatory.The squad United has built is unquestionably a talented one but has lacked an identity since Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013. For too long now, the team has relied on moments of individual brilliance to dig it out of holes -- see Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick against Tottenham on Saturday -- and when that doesn't come, the attack simply grinds to a halt.Chelsea made plea for 'sporting integrity,' despite oligarch owner being sanctioned after Russia's invasion of UkraineThe appointment of Rangnick -- a manager lauded for his intense, proactive style -- was supposed to help provide United with a new identity, or at least begin laying the foundations for one.Tuesday's game was the 20th time Rangnick had taken charge of this United team, but he's yet to come up with a framework to get the most out of Ronaldo, Paul Pogba and Jadon Sancho.Instead, the team continues to wander aimlessly through a barren period that is the club's worst since the late 60s, with no apparent plan in place to help guide it to success once again.United, which finally appointed a director of football in John Murtough in March last year, has continued to get decision after decision spectacularly wrong in recent years.Whether it's appointing the wrong head coach -- or taking too long to sack him -- or spending vast amounts of money on players who are either not good enough or do not quite fit a manager's system, it's easy to see why United has stagnated so badly.The difficult part, as the club hierarchy is no doubt aware, is fixing it.Cristiano Ronaldo breaks all-time FIFA record after scoring his 806th career goalMany feel getting the next managerial appointment right is the crucial first step of setting the club back on the right path, with PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag reportedly the frontrunners.However, it's difficult to see either of those men succeeding where Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and now Rangnick have failed without serious structural change.Rangnick even admitted last month he doesn't \"really know\" what Darren Fletcher's role at the club is, after the former United midfielder was appointed the club's first ever technical director in March 2021.But the rebuilding of the club doesn't end on the pitch. Last week, United revealed further plans it has to redevelop Old Trafford, which has been showing its age for several years.The club's chief operating officer Collette Roche said they have developed \"a Masterplan for the modernization\" of the famous stadium.United fans have pleaded with the Glazer family, the club's absent owners, to sell up for several years now, believing the Americans' main priority is to make money, with on-pitch success a distant second.United might not have won a trophy since 2017, but according to Forbes, the club's value is $4.2 billion.Since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, United have won just three trophies -- the FA Cup under Van Gaal in 2016, and the League Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho the following year -- but none of football's major prizes. United last won the Premier League nine years ago.This summer may be the most important of the Glazers' tenure.As for coming up for winning formula for the team, United need a masterplan and quickly. If the wrong decisions are made once again, it will be near impossible for United to end this rut anytime soon.",

Are you good at tennis?\" Kyrgios asked the man in the crowd behind him. \"Exactly, why are you speaking?\"He then pointed at Stiller and said: \"Do I tell him how to act? No!\" which drew laughter from the stands.After the match, Nadal told reporters he hadn't seen the incident with the racket, but said \"the ATP should review things and make decisions\" if these incidents continue to happen.Last week, Nadal called for tougher punishments for players after Alexander Zverev received only a suspended eight-week ban for his petulant outburst in Acapulco, Mexico last month.Zverev smashed his racket multiple times near the umpire's feet after his doubles defeat and called the umpire a \"f*ing idiot\" during the match.Rafael Nadal will face compatriot Carlos Alcarez in the semifinals.\"I like him [Kyrgios] like a character, but of course when you cross some lines then the thing becomes different,\" Nadal told reporters after the match. \"The problem is, in my opinion, the same. When you allow the players to do stuff then you don't know when the line is.\"It's a tricky thing, but probably because these situations are happening more and more often, probably the ATP should review things and make decisions. Not about today's match because I didn't see what happened, so I can't have an opinion.\"I hope nothing too bad happened because I wish him [Kyrgios] the best ... but if it's bad, the ATP need to make decisions to avoid that and to stop that because sometimes, even if it's very unlucky or unfortunate, going right in that moment that something negative will happen.\"Up next for Nadal is 18-year-old Spanish sensation Alcaraz, who defeated defending champion Cameron Norrie in straight sets.",

        "content": "(CNN)At 38, Benjamin Alexander became Jamaica's first ever alpine skier to compete in the Winter Olympics -- just six years after he first strapped on skis. In his first few years in the sport, skiing with friends, he attracted a lot of attention. \"Being the only Black representative in the group, even though I am only half-Black and being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing jokes, sideways jokes at me about 'Cool Runnings,' the Jamaican bobsled team and, 'You should go to the Olympics,'\" Alexander told CNN Sport. Benjamin Alexander represented Jamaica in alpine skiing -- a first for the island nation.Although the Summer Games are often heralded as a melting pot -- 11,417 athletes from 206 countries and regions across 33 sports participated in Tokyo 2020 -- the Winter Games are nowhere near as diverse, with 91 delegations taking part at Beijing 2022. That's five times more than the number of teams represented in the first Winter Games in Chamonix, France in 1924. Read MoreBut athletes from Africa, South Asia, as well as those from smaller island nations still find themselves struggling to qualify for competition in the Winter Olympics due to warmer climates, the prohibitively high cost of equipment, lack of infrastructure and limited opportunities to practice and compete.  And one athlete and his coaches that CNN interviewed for this story warn that continental quota systems that allowed countries and regions with smaller Winter Olympic delegations the opportunity to establish and expand in sliding sports in PyeongChang 2018 were scrapped ahead of Beijing, with a knock-on effect on African countries.  A push for diversity, with limited success More countries are making their debut in the Winter Olympics.Saudi Arabia and Haiti each sent an alpine skier to Beijing while Nigeria and Eritrea competed in the Winter Games for the second time after making their debut in PyeongChang 2018. In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number. But just five African countries participated in this year's Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia. European and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.  But climate isn't the only factor affecting Olympic participation -- when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations. At PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway -- one of the world's wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million -- topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it \"aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.\"  It allocates a \"substantial portion\" of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help \"athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need.\" Some 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to \"support qualification efforts,\" according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships. Only NOCs \"whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record\" had access to the program, the IOC said. Meanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.  Athletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000. \n\n\nEuropean athletes received most funding from Olympic scholarships ahead of 2022 Winter Games\nOf the $7.5 million in scholarships issued ahead of Beijing 2022, athletes from Europe collectively received more than $5 million while athletes in Africa received just $177,000, according to the 2017-2020 IOC Olympic Solidarity report.\nOlympic Scholarships for athletes allocated to National Olympic Committee (NOC) ahead of Beijing 2022\n(Rollover rectangles below for detail)\n(Tap rectangles below for detail)\nEuropeAmericasAsiaAfricaOceania\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: International Olympic committee\n\n\nScholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds -- derived from Olympic revenue -- towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.  CNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding. Racial diversity not reflected On a national level, the composition of delegations often isn't very racially diverse. \"There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don't know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,\" Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport. Black athletes have proven crucial to Team USA's Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.  But even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing -- speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history -- White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year. Prior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.  In 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA's first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies' figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002. Hockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US. Four years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy. Overall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.  Surya Bonaly of France performs a backflip in her free skate routine in the women's Olympic figure skating in Nagano on February 20, 1998.Bonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics -- an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges -- which she landed on one foot.  That move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition.\"They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way,\" Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, \"people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that's good. And it's more accepted.\"Bonaly added: \"Now, back then ... you only came from one mold, one way.\"Black athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America's Olympic bobsled team. Nathan Chen skates during the Men's Free Skating program at Beijing 2022 on February 10, 2022.Asian American athletes, including figure skater Nathan Chen and snowboarder Chloe Kim, have also had a commanding presence at this year's Games. Four of the six Team USA singles figure skaters were Asian American: Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Alysa Liu and Vincent Zhou. Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women's hockey player in US team history.  Pay to play economics Experts say that economics -- not just talent -- plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics. \"That notion of economics is very key because we're looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating -- and that equipment alone costs so much,\" Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.  \"Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,\" Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN. \"It becomes not just a racialized issue, it's a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody's going to be a working-class hero,\" she said.  With stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children's Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.  Ghana's first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.  \"This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,\" he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season. Jamaica's first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: \"I'm competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.\"  \"And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,\" he said. In 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes' rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable. The athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.  Shiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India's only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.  \"Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don't have the systems in place that enable a successful career. \"Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,\" he added. Many elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they're growing up.  Bode Miller -- the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals -- attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he \"wouldn't have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia.\" Parents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has \"earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.\"  Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.The study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.  \"If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,\" Alexander told CNN. \"If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don't have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,\" Alexander said. Adding that he doesn't think\" winter sports are racist at all,\" Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports. \"I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology ... then I believe the tide will turn.\" In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it \"fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.\"  \"We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,\" it added.\"Some sports in all reality are more accessible,\" James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.  \"But you can't sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you've got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there's factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,\" he said.  \"And that's not something that us at the IOC are going to change.  \"All sports have different levels of access,\" Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport \"tries to look at.\" The IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations \"to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports' structures and priorities.\"  \"Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,\" it added.  Infrastructure challenges Winter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia -- notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an \"unexplored market\" in India, Keshavan said.  \"For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.  \"We don't really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,\" he said. This year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India's nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.  Khan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport. Shiva Keshavan of India reacts following run 3 during the Luge Men's Singles on day two of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games. \"Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,\" he said. \"Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,\" he added. Athletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come. Frimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don't necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow. \"But that doesn't matter,\" he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.\"You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I'll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It's not like it's impossible,\" he said. \"Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,\" Macleod told CNN adding: \"That's within the remit of the national government.\" \"Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,\" Macleod said. \"We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa -- that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,\" he added. \"Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, 'Actually, we're not going to invest in winter sports because that's not a priority for us.'\"'We're going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.' And they will always have to make that choice of where they're going to put their funding and what programs from our side they're going to apply for,\" he said. \"We put at the disposal of our stakeholders -- whether it's NOCs or the IFs (international federations) -- a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,\" he said. Representation matters Carter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations' final offerings.  \"For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,\" she added.  In winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique. \"If you don't see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,\" she added. Some sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said. \"But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility -- and have the bobsled -- is very limited in general,\" she added. Ahmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.  \"We see a general trend in ... Summer Games -- you've got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You've got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,\" Ahmed added. Ditching continental quotas a step backwards for inclusion Frimpong and Nigeria's Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's (IBSF) continental quota system.  But the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games -- something coaches had warned would deliver a \"crushing blow\" to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.  Coaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that \"inequitable quotas that didn't take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.  \"The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,\" they wrote.  Akwasi Frimpong of Ghana starts his men's skeleton training session at the Olympic Sliding Centre, during the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 12, 2018.Simidele Adeagbo of Nigeria reacts as she finishes a run during the Women's Skeleton on day eight of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games on February 17, 2018.\"An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,\" they added in the email. The quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing -- a decision which directly affected Frimpong. \"Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,\" an IOC representative told Frimpong's coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN. \"I qualified as Ghana's first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,\" Frimpong told CNN.  Frimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.  \"Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games -- to be able to qualify outright,\" he told CNN. On December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics. Frimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant \"I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good -- maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever -- but I'm good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.\"  Frimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports \"for qualified African athletes who can safely compete.\" \"We're not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we're not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.\"But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there's enough African athletes,\" he added. In a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.  \"To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,\" the organization said in a statement. No athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal. \"We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it's less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it's disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,\" Frimpong added. But there is hope -- even if only for a select few athletes.American bobsledder Meyers Taylor's bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis' four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.When asked about passing Davis' record saying, she said: \"That is overwhelming. It's so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I'm part of a legacy that's bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.\"We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be. \"So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.\"UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the IOC's most recent individual Olympic Solidarity scholarship data.CNN's Homero De La Fuente contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's the fuel that powers performance -- few things are as important to an elite athlete as their diet.Eating the right nutrients is critical to success, but so is the odd indulgent meal to keep spirits high through grueling training sessions. And as the Winter Olympics comes to an end, a new cookbook provides a glimpse into what makes top athletes tick.The Winning Recipes cookbook is the idea of the Purple Project, an organization that looks to support domestic abuse survivors, which has worked over the past year to create a gastronomic tome made up of the favorite recipes from some of the US' best Olympic athletes. \"The Purple Project reached out to me out of the blue,\" retired Olympic skier Noah Hoffman, who was invited to take part, told CNN Sport. Read More\"At first, I thought, 'That's a little strange, I'm not a chef. I don't know if I can contribute to a cookbook.' \"But, of course, I love to cook. I think everybody loves to eat and I love to eat, and I have favorite recipes. \"I actually sat down with my partner and we came up with the recipe together and made it once or twice to make sure that we had it correct.\"Hoffman's offering of 'Berry Dutch Baby' can be found in the breakfast section, but even he admits it's designed for someone with a very sweet tooth. The recipe, which involves fried frozen berries underneath a baked doughy pastry, was a favorite of Hoffman's during his career but only on the odd occasion. \"Certainly, only on days off,\" he said laughing. \"It's a little bit time intensive and maybe not the best training fuel, but a nice treat on a recovery day.\"READ: Canada-born Humphries wins gold medal for US after \u200bfiling harassment complaintTwo-time Olympian Anita Alvarez (R) unloading donations with the Purple Project.8,000 calories per day Hoffman retired from competitive skiing after the PyeongChang Games in 2018 but enjoyed a long career which involved two Winter Olympic Games.He specialized in endurance events and would push his body \"to the limit\" during training in order to reap the rewards come race day.Hoffman says he would consume food \"endlessly\" during training blocks. He even remembers sitting down to eat over one pound of pasta for lunch. \"There was a time in my early 20s, when I was still growing, that I was eating at least 8,000 calories a day. It's an incredible amount of food,\" he said, before remembering some of the tricks he used to boost the calorie intake.  Noah Hoffman: Former Olympic cross-country skier is 'scared' for athletes who speak out at Beijing 2022\"So you cook a whole box of pasta and you eat it all in one sitting for lunch. It's just astounding.\"I don't advise that for any young athlete, but I couldn't fill myself up. I was just eating constantly. It was wild.\"Hoffman's eating habits changed slightly as he became more successful and he worked with a dietitian for much of his career. The US ski team employed nutritionists to help its athletes reach their optimal levels of fitness and Hoffman still looks after what he eats even after retiring from competitive skiing.

Like many have done since the pandemic, Hoffman wants to use his platform as an athlete to change society for the better. He confesses to not knowing much about domestic abuse rates prior to working on this initiative but says he's been \"humbled\" to learn more about the work the Purple Project is doing. According to the organization, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the US, so the Purple Project looks to provide aid and support for emergency domestic violence shelters.\"I do think the role of an athlete has changed, and I think that's kind of part of a societal change where politics seem to be a little more central and, unfortunately, a little more divided as a whole.\"So I think that as that happens, athletes like everybody feel the need to speak out and really feel passionately and want to see the world a better place.\"So athletes are really wanting to give back and are understanding that they have a lot of leverage and a lot of power to help organizations that they want to help.\"So I was just really honored to be included in this project ... and getting to learn about the Purple Project and all the work that they do.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The feeling of total vulnerability is something that would prevent most from trying rock climbing, but for Lor Sabourin, it's what they love most about the sport. Being so far out of their comfort zone, tackling a route that requires both mental and physical fortitude, provides Sabourin with an opportunity to reflect and work through the challenges in their life. In many ways, it's much more than just a sport for them -- it's a way of exploring identity which has helped them accept who they are. \"I think it's really hard to hide from the stress of climbing. When you go out, you're really choosing to be vulnerable,\" Sabourin tells CNN Sport.\"You don't have to do that everywhere else in life.Read More\"People are able to really find out how they do best when they're in stress and to learn better ways to respond to stress and to things like fear and insecurity.\" Sabourin has recently released a film with Patagonia that explores their life as a non-binary climber, following Sabourin as they take on one of the hardest routes of their life in the sandstone canyons of northern Arizona. It provided Sabourin with a chance to speak about their journey and address what it means for them to be a trans climber in 2021.In tackling some dark periods of their life -- including battles with eating disorders, self-harm and sexual assault -- the film \"They/Them\" shows how Sabourin has learned to thrive in the climbing community. \"Making the film was hard in a lot of ways because, so often when we go through something hard and then come out on the other side, we want to just pretend that that didn't happen,\" they added.\"So I really had to go back to parts of my story that maybe I didn't talk about with people in my life very often. \"And that was at first really challenging, but over time, it actually became really healing.\" READ: Climber receives apology after inappropriate images were aired during World ChampionshipsPatagonia's latest documentary, \"They/Them,\" is a film about Lor Sabourin, an Arizona-based climber, guide and coach.'All consuming'Despite always loving the outdoor lifestyle, even when growing up in the urban area of Detroit, Sabourin was a self-confessed \"super-scared kid.\" It may seem improbable now when you see photos of them hanging off the side of a rock face, but there was a time when they were too scared to use the three-meter slide at their local swimming pool. In truth, climbing wasn't something that came naturally, but sport always played a major role in their upbringing. They were a strong runner throughout their education but finally fell into climbing as a way of combining competition with their love of the outdoors. \"[Climbing] is very all-consuming,\" Sabourin said. \"Running, for example, it's like your mind can go anywhere and you can still run quite quickly.\"And that's one of my favorite things about running is having a place where I can just let my mind go, and climbing isn't really that way. \"When you're climbing, you have to have 100% of your attention on what you're doing. And that's really therapeutic in its own way.\" READ: 'We should be less afraid to be afraid,' says Emily Harrington after historic El Capitan climbJUST WATCHED'Black Ice': The men and women making climbing more diverseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Black Ice': The men and women making climbing more diverse 03:34Dealing with hate The sport now plays a major role in their life and they balance it with their studies to become a therapist. However, as their profile within the sport becomes more well-known, Sabourin has had to deal with online hate and microaggressions from within the community, such as people reacting angrily about using different pronouns. In the film, they describe how they were subject to online abuse after an interview with climbing magazine \"Rock and Ice\" was published. There are also times in normal life where Sabourin feels less safe than their non-trans friends. \"I guess that's really challenging, especially having a background of experiencing pretty extreme violence at a young age for my identity,\" they said. \"With the film, it definitely brings up that fear. I am putting myself out there in a really public way, and so it's definitely opening up to the potential for more of that to happen.\"But [...] in all of those interactions, people didn't take the time to get to know me.\"What I feel is really powerful about the film [...] is you kind of have to stay with me long enough to learn that I'm a human just like anyone else and that being trans is one aspect. \"Something that I really love about myself is my identity, but it actually is a fairly small aspect of my identity in the grand scheme of things.\" READ: Two world-class climbers scale the tallest chimney in EuropeSabourin wants to be a positive role model to others. Becoming a role model The process of making the film was an intimate affair, with Sabourin often being joined just by co-director and friend Blake McCord. They didn't want the film to make generalizations about the trans experience, but instead share their own unique story in a humanistic way. Sabourin is aware that they may become the face for the wider community as a result. At a time when trans people are facing scrutiny in both the sporting arena and in wider society, Sabourin says climbing has an opportunity to create a more inclusive framework that other sports can follow. \"I think it could be simpler than people believe,\" they said. \"They get so hung up in the political debates and the legislation.\"If we look at the value of sports to people, as humans, and the reasons that we participate and we strip it down back to that human aspect, it's a lot simpler than we think it is.\"Sabourin says the thought of being a role model feels similar to tackling climbing projects -- intimidating, but also inspiring -- and admits the thought of people looking up to them has made them become more honest in their personal life. The American has struggled with eating disorders since they were seven or eight years old and wants to trigger conversations about how it can affect both athletes and the trans community. Now in recovery, Sabourin has learned to adopt a healthier relationship with food and exercise and has realized the destructive ways in which they were using food to manage their transition. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresThey say the topic still isn't spoken about enough. \"I've tried my best to be a combination of holding myself really accountable and being really firm with myself about taking steps every day, but also give myself some levity around it and not always feel like I'm beating my head against the wall,\" Sabourin said. \"I want people to have a role model that's someone who takes care of themselves, who lives a life that they think is meaningful. \"I also personally want to be a person who has those things for myself.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)It was a chance encounter that would change her life forever. In 2017, Nadhira Alharthy met the first Omani man to climb Everest.Khalid al-Siyabi had summited Everest seven years earlier. He was part of a group of pioneering Omanis who were telling their inspirational stories at an assembly hosted by the Ministry of Education, where Alharthy was working as the director of citizenship at the time.  That evening she made a pledge to replicate al-Siyabi's achievement, using his mentorship as guidance.\"His story, it touched me,\" she tells CNN Sport. \"I was inspired to do something for myself [...] to challenge myself.\"Building up her strengthRead MoreBefore training to climb the world's tallest mountain, Alharthy's workout routine extended to going to the gym a few times a week. She knew she had to dramatically change gears, beginning with strengthening her muscles and improving her resistance. With al-Siyabi's help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving. The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. \"Training the mind [...] it's harder than training our bodies,\" she says. In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy's ambition was al-Siyabi. \"We kept it as a secret for a long time,\" she says.She wasn't just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: \"I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience.\"The endurance athlete says she takes advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain. She recently visited Jabal Akhdar, part of the Al Hajar mountain range in Oman. 'I was very lucky'In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition. \"They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety,\" she says.Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team -- including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. \"I started feeling worried about him. But I said, 'OK, he will make it, he's strong,'\" she says.A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: \"Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing.\"In January 2021, Alharthy became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam, Nepal. His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn't just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi's memory as well.  \"He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me,\" she says. \"I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of [...] the climb.\"After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi's summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain. The poetry of their story isn't lost on her, acknowledging that \"the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest].\" She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: \"I was very lucky to have them [...] it brought us all together.\"Two years later, Alharthy's face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. \"It's not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping,\" she says. \"It was a different type of happiness.\"Ama DablamWhile participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers. In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) -- a mountain south of Everest -- while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar. \"I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad [...] he messaged me that he was going,\" says Alharthy.\"I told him, I'm not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it's winter season and that's very difficult.\" Long readsAustralia's first international cricketers won fame abroad. At home, they were betrayed'The Fight of the Century': A divided US nation 50 years onFootball club founded by Turkish immigrants creates stir in Germany Olympian pressured to 'perform better' and lose a few poundsHaving unsuccessfully attempted the same climb in 2018, Alharthy was \"scared of failing again,\" but she knew that Badar's moral support, coupled with her training for Everest, would set her in good stead. \"I felt that I was prepared.\"With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet. She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest. \"There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it's like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time,\" she adds. \"If we miss anything, it's very dangerous.\" Over the past year, Alharthy hasn't had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she's been taking advantage of Oman's arid desert terrain -- most recently visiting the country's epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles. \"I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically,\" she says.Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders. Rock formations in the Al Hoota natural cave after it re-opened to the public for the first time in three years near the ancient city of Jizwa in Oman's northern Dakhiliya region on September 2016. Finding solidarity through faithCementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight. Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining. Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. \"I was feeling depressed,\" she says. \"I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for.\" Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith. Alharthy says she hopes her story will inspire young Omanis to participate in endurance sports. \nAhead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. \"Our faith [...] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power.\"Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. \"For them, it's something very exposed, it's something very unsafe. My mom, she's waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again,\" she says. \"They support me to do what I want, but they are worried.\"She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story. \"When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it's now becoming quite common,\" she recently told the Times. Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. \"They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights,\" she says.Mount Ama Dablam, which peaks at 6,812 meters (22,349 feet), in the Everest region.'Believe in your dream'Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry's mantra -- to figuratively \"die empty\" from sharing knowledge: \"I think that's what Khalid was doing with many Omanis.\" \"I think it's a great story,\" she goes on to tell CNN. \"Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves.\" She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager's assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world's highest peak at age 75. \"He's very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us,\" she says. \"Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard.\"Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots. \"I always wake up in the morning and say, 'Alhumdullilah, thank God I'm here [...] I reached my goal,\" she says.",

        "content": "(CNN)Janja Garnbret can't remember a time when she wasn't climbing. As a child growing up in Slovenia, she'd regularly be found racing up trees or scaling the door frames in her house, but it was on the climbing wall where she felt most at home and where her talent eventually shone through. Yet despite being one of the favorites to win gold at this year's Tokyo Olympics, Garnbret's career didn't get off to the start you might expect. She came last in her category in her first competition as a child but says she loved the sport too much to care at that stage. \"People always ask me if I was ever comparing myself to other kids, I was actually not,\" Garnbret, who recently scaled Europe's tallest chimney, tells CNN Sport. Read More\"I was just enjoying myself on the wall and I was just climbing, trying to push my limits. I never thought to myself that I am better than everyone else. I just enjoyed climbing.\" After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country. Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently. She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut. READ: Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' Slovenia's Janja Garnbret says she's looking forward to making her Olympic debut in Tokyo. 'I learned a lot about myself'The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around. She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country's lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn't expected. \"I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation,\" she says.\"I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn't know myself like that.\"It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly.\"Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again. Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she'll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week.\"I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn't know what to expect, how to deal with it,\" she adds.\"But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It's still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics.\"READ: The climbers aiming to boost diversity in the sport JUST WATCHEDClimbing Europe's tallest chimneyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClimbing Europe's tallest chimney 02:59Driving four hours a dayShould sport climbing make its debut at this year's Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees -- sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance. She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions. It's a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile. \"I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit,\" she says. \"I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold.\"\"I can't say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that. \"I will definitely keep training and I will be prepared as much as possible when the time comes and then we will see what will happen. But, definitely, I'm looking forward to it.\" READ: Emily Harrington on her historic El Capitan climbGarnbret says the global pandemic initally knocked her motivation. Promoting healthy climbing While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year's Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that. \"I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It's super young,\" she says. \"So it's definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That's definitely something huge.\" Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country. She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results. She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success.\"I just want to set a good example in that you don't need to lose extra weight to be successful,\" she says. \"I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it's always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself.\" She continues: \"I remember I fell in love [...] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall. I remember that I was the only kid who stayed on the wall and didn't want to come off.\"",

A win for Stoltman over his American opponent in the Atlas Stones and the title was the Scot's. As Stoltman dropped the mammoth stone onto the platform, he turned to see his American opponent still negotiating his way through the colossal orbs. The Scot dropped to his knees in equal parts exhaustion, celebration and relief. The 27-year-old knew he had achieved what once seemed impossible; he was the 'World's Strongest Man.'The 'World's Strongest Man,' Tom Stoltman, back home at his gym in Scotland with the trophy.Read MoreThe giant Scot wasn't celebrating alone for long. He was immediately embraced on the floor by the man who finished seventh in the same competition -- his older brother, Luke. \"We kinda dropped to our knees and said a few things. That was the most special moment ever,\" Stoltman recently told CNN Sport after his remarkable victory in Sacramento, California back in June -- a victory made even more remarkable when you consider his extraordinary and unlikely path to victory. Stoltman has autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, often presented in restricted, repetitive patterns. \"[Growing up] I didn't have a clue that I was doing anything wrong,\" Stoltman recalls. \"All my behaviors and the stuff I was doing, like in the house, out of the house, to my parents, siblings, etc., I thought was normal.\"I thought the other kids, doing different things, were the ones that were in the wrong.\"As Stoltman became a teenager, his social issues intensified, until \"something just clicked in my brain\" and he decided to tell his closest friends at school.\"I stood up and took my seven or eight best mates into a room and said, 'Look, I have autism.'\"And they said, \"Look, there's no problem at all. We're still going to like you for who you are.'\"And that day is when a weight lifted off my shoulders and I felt normal. Like a normal member of society. I felt just normal around people and they all just treated me the same as them. \"That was the day that changed my life. When I was open about having autism.\"Tom and Luke Stoltman are the strongest brothers in the world. READ: Marathon running left him 'totally depleted.' Then he became a strongmanBulking upSoon, teenager Stoltman followed his older brother Luke, who was already competing in strongman competitions, to the local gym.\"I was a skinny boy, not much confidence, and Luke said, 'Come on to the gym.' So I went to my local gym and hated every single minute of it. I didn't like the people staring at me. But I kept going and kept on pushing myself and Luke kept on pushing me.\"I knew he was obviously the best in the country, so I was just always wanting to try to get close to him. He was a bigger brother. I was just trying to pip at him, bite at him at every session.\"Stoltman may have been skinny, but he wasn't small. And at six foot, eight inches, the young Scotsman had a prodigious appetite, which soon became key for his new found way of life given the need to 'bulk up.'\"Even when I was a younger kid, I was taking four or five sandwiches to school for lunch. A lot of fruit, some sweets as well. And I would have two or three snacks on top of that.\" Tom Stoltman competes in the World's Ultimate Deadlift competition in Dubai, UAE in October 2019.A decade later, in order to prepare his body for the merciless rigors of training and competition, Stoltman typically eats upwards of 10,000 calories a day. And as he began honing his focus on his ever-increasing strength, Stoltman was finding his autism was proving to be a valuable asset. \"Having autism and [going to] the gym goes hand-in-hand,\" reflects Stoltman. \"When you're in the gym, you need a routine. And obviously, when I found 'Strongman,' it's all routine. \"You're waking up every day. You're eating the same meals every day. You're doing the same things every day. And you're going to the gym at the same time every day.\"However, his relentless quest to improve his performance presented challenges.\"Sometimes, if I missed that lift, I'll think about it for 24 hours or not talk to my wife. I'll be in a really bad head space. So there are positives and negatives with it and I still struggle with the negative side of things.\"A lot of muscle needs a lot of food ... as much as 10,000 calories a day for Stoltman.READ: Powerlifter Karenjeet Kaur Bains 'found a love for being strong.'

I want to get [on the] podium next year, then win it the year after.\"Despite the interpersonal, emotional and physical obstacles Stoltman has had to overcome to achieve his goals, his journey has left him with a positive outlook to pass on to other people with autism.\"I always say to young kids and parents of young kids to use it as a superpower. You know, we're different. But now we've got an advantage over people that aren't different. We've got a superpower, they don't.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Ryan Hall may hold the fastest marathon and half marathon times for a US athlete, but these days he admits that running doesn't feel like it used to. \"It just feels like you're wearing a weight vest the whole time,\" says Hall, which is hardly a surprise when you consider his physical transformation since retiring from the sport five years ago.As a professional runner racking up 120 to 140 miles a week, Hall would weigh in at a lithe 130 pounds; today, he's 190 pounds and far more likely to be found lifting weights than grinding out 20-mile long runs.And while he may not be able to get close to his half marathon record of 59:43, nor his best marathon time of 2:04:58, the 39-year-old Hall says that he feels all the better for it. \"My body was just done -- I couldn't even finish an easy, 30-minute run at that point,\" he tells CNN Sport as he reflects on his retirement from professional running in January 2016. Read More\"I'm five foot 10, I was 127 pounds and my body was just totally depleted and in really bad shape, and I needed to get back to my body. \"Weightlifting became a new medium for me to express who I am, which is a guy who loves physical challenge. I love being active. I have to work out every day or else I'm grumpy and in a bad mood.\"Ryan Hall on course during the LA Marathon on March 15, 2015 in Los Angeles, California.His current workout routine involves daily weightlifting sessions of 60 to 90 minutes, squeezed in around his coaching (he trains his wife Sara and 10 other professional athletes) and parenting commitments.Among the benefits of lifting compared to his running schedule, Hall says, is an increase in his energy levels, which are \"10 times better\" than when he was running professionally and would rely on taking two-hour afternoon naps each day. He says that his testosterone levels were always \"clinically low\" as a runner, with natural remedies making no difference. Hall's workout involves weightlifting sessions of 60 to 90 minutes a day.\"It's just a really hard profession on my body,\" Hall adds. \"Whereas weightlifting is totally the opposite of that: it's anabolic in nature, so I'm building muscle and building strength. \"It is a great way for me to give back to my body after it had given so much to me over a 20-year period. Now I did finally give back to it and I feel amazing now, my testosterone is back into the normal level, my energy's better, my motivation's better. \"I'm a better dad, a better coach and a better person as a result of it.\"JUST WATCHEDMarathon runner Sara Hall reflects on the greatest race of her careerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarathon runner Sara Hall reflects on the greatest race of her career 03:54Sheer thrill of runningAmid his transition from professional running to coaching, Hall's desire to push the physical limits of his body hasn't diminished. Rather than testing himself over the 26.2 miles of a marathon, he will take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance. Last month, for example, he took on a wood chop/water carry challenge. That involved splitting a cord of wood and running 6.3 miles to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, then 6.3 miles and 5,000 feet of elevation back up while carrying a 62-pound water jug in each hand. \"It kind of reminded me of my pro running days being on the starting line of a marathon and trying to run 4:45 per mile for a marathon distance and just being like: How am I going to do this?\" Hall says of the feat. \"Even though you're trained, you're prepared, when you get in that moment it's a scary place.\"Hall plans to take on unique challenges combining strength and endurance.He's now mulling his next challenge. One goal is to try and complete a 500-pound deadlift and mile run in under five minutes (he got 5:28 for his first attempt), and another is something that involves \"covering a good amount of distance with a heavy weight.\"However, he's hasn't entirely forgotten his love for racing marathons. Coaching his wife Sara, who has run the second-fastest marathon time ever by an American woman, serves as a reminder of that. \"When I'm at Sara's races and she's super fit and she's warming up for marathons ... I just remember: Oh, how good it feels to be ripping it on the roads, feeling like a million bucks floating through it. There's no sensation like that,\" says Hall.He continues: \"I can think back to a whole bunch of moments when it was just me out in the woods on single-track trail, no one else around, no other sounds besides the wind blowing through the trees and having that same exact sensation: being in full flight, feeling like I'm floating along.\"It's the sheer thrill of running that Hall tries to pass on to the runners he mentors, including his four daughters. \"I try to remind my girls: Hey, it's not about the performance, it's not about what place you are. Can you just fall in love with just the sensation of your body being in flight?\" says Hall. \"Because if you can fall in love with that sensation, you're going to get everything out of running that you want to get out of running. \"That's where the good stuff is at. It's not hitting a PR [personal record], it's not finishing a certain place or going to the Olympics or any of this stuff.

He is, he admits, \"a much better coach than I am an athlete.\" While he was \"super rigid\" with his schedule during his running career, he's learned to appreciate the value of constantly making adjustments to an athlete's training routine. \"I like to see myself as almost a chef,\" says Hall. \"When I'm writing the training, I have a 'recipe,' right? But based on what I'm seeing, based on the feedback I'm getting, it's like I'm tasting it as I'm cooking and then I'm changing up the flavors, throwing this and that in there, taking this, that out, making it just right.\"He has a similar approach to his own training in the weight room, making tweaks to his workouts to challenge his body in new ways. \"I've got to be throwing new stimulus at my body that it hasn't seen before, so I'm constantly finding new ways to do that,\" says Hall.\"I've studied a lot of training, I get inspiration from other people's training, but then I also get creative and I do stuff that sounds fun ... I try to be really intuitive with my training.\"Hall has also tweaked his diet over the past few years. As he did when he was a runner, he still eats a meal or a snack every three hours, but these days he's also upped his calorie intake.\"I'm eating a ton of protein and I'm still eating a ton of carbs,\" he says. \"Basically, I'm eating a lot more calories than I used to eat ... I'm trying to eat 4,500 to 5000 calories a day, and if I'm not, no matter what I'm doing in the weight room, I'm not seeing strength gains.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Strongman Marathon: 26.2 grueling miles of various exercisesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Strongman Marathon: 26.2 grueling miles of various exercises 03:15Away from their life in Flagstaff, Arizona, the Halls have supported development projects in Africa, which has included fundraising to bring clean water to 90,000 people in Zambia and for a new health clinic to be built in Kenya. They have also founded the Hall Steps Foundation, a non-profit organization that protects vulnerable women and children living in extreme poverty in Ethiopia. In 2015, the couple adopted their four daughters from Ethiopia; Hall says the family plans to set up an initiative there in the future. \"We want to do our part to help,\" he adds. \"Our kids are so amazing; they blessed us way more than we blessed them.\"Until the family can return to Ethiopia, Hall's focus remains on coaching and imparting the lessons he learned throughout his running career; it makes the injuries and setbacks all the more valuable. \"I'm passionate to share these things that I've learned the hard way,\" he says. \"I love it because it redeems the failures that I've made along the way.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)It started with a two-and-a-half-mile run with his partner. Now it's a lifestyle for Robbie Balenger.He's pushed his body and mind to the very limits by taking on mammoth endurance challenges, notably running 3,175 miles across the US in just 75 days in 2019 in order to promote the benefits of a plant-based diet.More recently, Balenger broke the record for most laps around New York's Central Park in one day. His life now is in sharp contrast to when he was running successful restaurants. \"I lived in Austin, Texas, and was very much a part of the food and bar scene. With that comes a lot of partying and late nights,\" he tells CNN.Read More\"You work hard, then you blow off steam. I was still living that kind of lifestyle and quickly realized it wasn't going to add up.\"All that partying wasn't really going to make me a very good leader or someone that could fulfill the duties of my job every day in the way I wanted to.\" Then his now-fiancee invited him on a run. The short jog triggered something in Balenger, who quickly saw the advantages of exercising as a way of coping with the stresses of his job and coming up with new ideas for his restaurant. Balenger gradually took on longer and tougher challenges; a half-marathon; a full marathon; and then found himself lining up on the start line for a grueling ultra-marathon. \"It definitely replaced that hard-partying lifestyle,\" he adds. \"[It was] much healthier but there was still something in there that felt kind of similar. It's kind of a raw feeling.\"READ: 'We should be less afraid to be afraid,' says history making climberRobbie Balenger says he has a spiritual connection with running which has helped him forge a new identity.Run across the USBalenger eventually stepped away from the bar scene. He flirted with the idea of charity work or working in solar energy and he also liked the thought of being a wildland firefighter. But he always came back to running.Then, after a chance encounter with another man who had run across the US, Balenger started prepping for the biggest challenge of his life -- the transcontinental run.  \"I completed it in 75 days, so that averaged out to 43 miles a day. So I was putting in an ultra[-marathon] every day,\" he says, smiling. The main drive behind the project was raising awareness of better food choices. Balenger says his vegan diet was his \"superpower\" for the run and insists it was one of the reasons he was able to complete it. \"Here in the US especially, we have a really bad obesity problem and people are just really unhealthy,\" he says.\"I think I hit it at a time where people were willing to acknowledge and accept that there was an issue, and therefore, they were open to conversations because they were seeing people all around them who are unhealthy and getting sick.\"My thought was, 'I'm just going to show that I can do this on a plant based diet,' and along the way, I quickly realized not only could I do it, it was the reason I was able to do it.\" READ: Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' She didn't listen.In March 2021, Balenger broke the Central Park Loop challenge record, running almost 100 miles in one day.Central Park record After finishing his epic run, the self-proclaimed \"plant-based alternative endurance athlete\" had the taste for more. In March 2021, he set a new record for The Central Park Loop Challenge, where he had to complete as many 6.1-mile laps of the park as he could within its opening hours. From 6:05 a.m. to 12:55 a.m. the next morning, Balenger ran 16 laps -- just under 100 miles -- smashing the previous record of 11 loops. \"It was just super appealing to me coming out of the depths of Covid. It felt like it was a cool thing to do,\" he says.\"It was on the first day of spring and then it really resonated with me because that's where I finished my run across the United States, in Central Park.\"[I was] really excited to have accomplished it and then your legs seize up and you get really stiff and then you get really tired, and luckily, you can pass out right afterward.\" Balenger runs 10 miles every day in preparation for big challenges. Come rain or shine, he throws on his sneakers and goes outside. Consistency, he says, is key. While the thought of heading out for a run on a freezing morning might deter many, Balenger has always found a way to overcome the doubts in his mind.It's because running is more than just a physical challenge. It's his sanctuary. It's where he feels most at peace.  \"Running is the most spiritual aspect of my life,\" he says. \"It's where I go to be with myself and to explore who I am and the energies around me and who I want to be.\"There's something that's very beautiful in the discomfort of it [...] feeling what some would call pain -- I guess it is like a dull low pain. \"But what comes out of that, you feel very alive.

As he searched for a sense of himself, Balenger went chasing a party lifestyle. \"I expressed it in a lot of ways and a lot were probably not very healthy. Like being a guy that went out and drank a lot,\" he says.\"Partying like that was kind of embodying what I thought it meant to be a man. It was living hard and that was kind of where this masculinity showed itself.\" He says running helped him redefine masculinity, especially after watching athletes compete in the Hardrock Hundred Mile Endurance Run -- one of the hardest runs in the US. \"I was like: there's another version of a man that is just rough and tumble and got all of those qualities that I think I was trying to get from this bar scene,\" he says.\"This is a way that is the healthier version of that. And so after seeing that, I wanted to embody that. And so that started this exploration of it and it's something that's still ongoing. \"I'm 36 years old, I'm still trying to understand what that is, and I do that through my running. It helps me to create an identity for myself that is healthy, and I think embodies a lot of what it means to be a man.\" Balenger is currently tackling another mammoth challenge, in what he has dubbed  the \"Colorado Crush.\"It involves running a marathon in June, a 50-mile run in July, and a 100-mile run in August. In between these, he will also bid to complete the Colorado trail -- which stretches for 500 miles -- and summit 58 peaks that are over 14,000 feet. During the challenge, he will be using neuroscience technology to see how it can optimize his sleep and help aid his recovery.\"I think the more we run, the more we move our body, we push ourselves, the clearer and higher our frequency becomes,\" he says.\"I think encouraging other people to do that will only better ourselves and better our communities and better the world. \"I know I am the best version of myself when I have a goal, when I'm moving my body, when I'm taking care of myself and I'm eating healthy. I want that for everyone.\"You can follow Balenger's latest challenge on his Instagram account.",

She is a mother of two who embodies power and strength.Rene Campbell has dedicated most of her life to sculpting her once diminutive frame into one that, she says, goes \"completely against what society thinks a woman should look like.\"The bodybuilder's dedication has brought plenty of awards but building her dream body -- gaining over 85 pounds, going from a UK size 8 to 14 -- has had its challenges, too, both physically and mentally. \"I was very insecure about my body image, very insecure about myself as a person,\" Campbell, 44, tells CNN Sport from her home in Cornwall, UK, as she reflects on her motivation to transform herself. \"I was constantly feeling under pressure through the media that women needed to look a certain way.\"\"My bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself,\" says Rene Campbell.Read More'A woman with muscle'\"For quite some time I struggled with eating disorders because I was constantly trying to keep my weight really low, to appear skinny, like these women are on magazine covers,\" she says.Then, she attended a women's bodybuilding show and became intrigued by the way these seemingly confident women held themselves.Though Campbell \u200bsays she loves the way she now looks, \u200bshe says she is sometimes treated with cruelty, like when she has been asked to leave women's toilets. \"A lot of the time you are up against a lot of negativity. People set in an old mindset,\" Campbell adds. \"I was up against -- and still am -- a lot of criticism from people who don't understand why women would want to be muscular. But it just gave me a sense of confidence and mental strength.\"I'm stuck in a situation where I have to prove that I'm a woman in order to use these toilets? It's quite offensive. I do try and explain to them quite nicely. I may look this way but, at the end of the day, I am a woman. I have every right to use these toilets.\"\"There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,\" says Campbell.Studying female bodybuilders For over a decade, sociologist Dr. Tanya Bunsell has been researching female bodybuilders.\"When I would tell people that I was studying female bodybuilders, the first reaction was, 'That's just not attractive,'\" Dr. Bunsell, a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science at Canterbury Christ Church University, tells CNN Sport.\"There's definitely a glass ceiling on muscularity, and that crossover boundary where the body becomes transgressive and interrogates people's notions of male and female.\"The troublesome and disturbing body of the hyper-muscular woman is deemed so outrageously deviant by society that it provokes harsh comments.\"\"Even though there is a huge market encouraging women to build abs and tighten their figures, the ideal still stands for smaller waists, curvy hips and lean legs, the so-called hourglass figure,\" adds Dr. Bunsell.Campbell takes enormous pride in the way she has reshaped her body.'The body becomes an amazing machine'When she started her bodybuilding career, \u200bCampbell says eating copious amounts of food was, at first, a shock to the body and mind.\"My body temperature went up,\" she says, \u200bsaying that putting on weight initially scared her.\"I was feeling hot all the time because you're constantly eating, but once you get over that stage the body becomes an amazing machine and it starts to take that fuel in.\"\"There's a very close relationship between passion, dedication and obsession,\" says Campbell.\"You look at any athlete that has achieved great things, there has to be a certain level of obsession.\"A photograph of Campbell is currently featured in a six-month exhibition in west London called \"Womanhood.\" Max Ellis, the photographer who took the portait of Campbell, describes his subject as a \"work of art.\" \"She's worked her whole life to try and achieve this,\" Ellis \u200bsaid. \"If you're a woman and you're doing this [bodybuilding], you are swimming upstream. You're fighting every known convention.\"   SteroidsBut bodybuilding has a dark side, a long association with steroid use to help build muscle. \"Before she went to the world championships, Rene had to do a drug test and passed the drug test, but a lot of these girls didn't pass,\" Wanda Tierney, chairperson of IFBB (International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness) Women's Committee, tells CNN Sport.Campbell says it would be na\u00efve to think that the problem does not exist, but argues that steroids abuse happens in other sports and in society, too.\"The onus is on the athletes to adhere to the rules and regulations set by their federation,\" Campbell says. \"My federation (The IFBB), is a signatory to the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code, and the IFBB anti-doping rules are in full compliance with the 2015 WADA code.\"And as she reflected on her body's evolution, Campbell was keen to stress how bodybuilding had been accompanied by a shift in her mental health.\"It was a very big shift for me mentally, because my bodybuilding journey made me realize that I needed to do things for myself.\"",

Over Brooks' 30 year career, she has treated many patients who suffer from eating disorders and acted as the eating disorders specialist in the HBO film Thin.According to a US study -- Prevalence of Eating disorders among Blacks in the National Survey of American Life -- anorexia was the rarest eating disorder among African American adults and adolescents, while binge eating was the most prevalent eating disorder among adults and adolescents.\"We are really understanding more and more that eating disorders are not just a White, suburban women's disease, and that, you know, for a long time the belief was that women of color, particularly Black women, were protected culturally from developing eating disorders,\" said Dr. Brooks.As she trained for her first Olympic appearance in 2016, Loomis adhered to a strict diet.\"I would eat super healthy and super clean, be on it for a month. One time I was just like, 'I really would love a donut, or I really would love a cupcake' and I have a sweet tooth.\"However, according to then-coach Richard Fisher, Loomis wasn't eating enough.\"We started working together, she was eating maybe three meals a day tops. Everything was low and minimum.\"She would be so hungry, she would eat unhealthy things as anyone, and her lack of nutrition was hindering her from performing the correct way that she needed to.\"The track and field coach adds: \"A lot of coaches look at, I would say the average high jumper who's professional and look at their height and their weight ratio.\"They use that as the standard for what they believe an athlete should be, which in reality is not true all the time. Yes, it might be the perfect standard of what you want. But a lot of these athletes, you have to realize, are one a billion.\"Priscilla always used to say to me, 'I'm the shortest, fattest high jumper out there.'\"Once she's finished competing Loomis wants to pursue an acting career.READ: From world titles to the cover of Vogue Arabia'Loving myself'According to World Athletics, in a statement sent to CNN: \"There is no one kind of body measurement requirement to qualify for the Olympics. That is not the case. There is no such requirement. The qualifying standards are all based around performance.\"Last year World Athletics released a Nutrition Consensus Statement providing the latest research and guidance around nutrition to athletes, coaches and administrators.In a statement sent to CNN Sport, the International Olympic Committee also said it \"stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement, which is reflected in the Olympic Charter, Fundamental Principle 6.\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Olympic Charter shall be secured without discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\"Furthermore, athletes' safety and wellbeing is a priority and a core value for the IOC, which is committed to leading and supporting the Olympic Movement in the implementation of safeguarding measures, in line with its mission stated in the Olympic Charter to promote safe sport and the protection of athletes from all forms of harassment and abuse.\"Even Loomis' teammates were all too quick to chime in with disparaging comments about her appearance.After Loomis' appearance at the 2015 Outdoor World Championships in Beijing, she says she was called \"thick\" and \"heavy\" by her teammates from Antigua and Barbuda. And that was after she had just competed on the track.The Antiguan and Barbuda Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.Three years later she placed fifth in the high jump at the Commonwealth Games in Australia. She went to the bar to grab a beer to celebrate when a man, who recognized Loomis from her famous purple hair, came up to her and said, \"Oh, I saw you on TV. If you would drop a few kilos, you would have performed better.\"As a result of those comments, Loomis says she would drink a pot of coffee to dehydrate herself to appear slim on screen.Loomis is currently working with a female coach, Lauren Biscardi, a former New York state champion in high jump, who the 31-year-old athlete says has \"changed my professional career.

Okoro was awarded her 4x400m relay Olympic bronze medal at the Anniversary Games at the London Stadium in 2018.Read MoreOver the last decade, she's also competed in a variety of European and World Championships, collecting a total of three silvers and four more bronze.'I can see your veins'But as she looks back at her career, Okoro reflects perhaps bronze and silver were not quite good enough. Come to think of it, perhaps even a gold medal wouldn't have been good enough.She also wants to start a wider conversation about the issues surrounding women and body acceptance.Okoro says she started to feel that she wasn't just having to compete on the track. She was having to compete with people's expectations and demands as to what an athlete should look like.According to Okoro, that look was skinny, slender and tall. \"Oh, I can see your veins, this must mean you're in good shape,\" Okoro recalls a conversation she had with coach Charles van Commenee, who worked with the British Athletics team for a number of years, during the prep camp leading into the 2010 European Championships. Okoro says that Van Commenee then asked her about her weight.\"Proudly, I was like '60 kilograms,'\" replied Okoro, who considers that her personal ideal race weight.Okoro says that is 15kg heavier than the other athletes she raced against, placing her above traditional weight threshold norms in track and field.According to Okoro, Van Commenee then responded: \"Oh, you must be heavy boned!\"Van Commenee, who now works as a motivational speaker on \"high performance culture,\" told CNN Sport: \"Being too light or being too heavy can cause injuries and therefore the staff, led by the head coach, has a duty to address this issue.\"It would be unprofessional to turn a blind eye but obviously the right words and the right tone have to be used in addressing the issue,\" he added. Okoro competes in the 800 metres event of the Norwich Union 2006 International Athletics competition at the Alexander stadium, in Birmingham, 20 August 2006. Okoro came fourth with a time of 2.03.08 minutes.After the championships, Okoro says she began working with a nutritionist and was advised to go on a zero-carb diet.\"I just thought, 'Okay, you've just taken out all my carbs, so I'm going to have no energy' ... You start to doubt yourself.\"Speaking specifically about Okoro, Van Commenee said he doesn't want to have a public debate with the track and field athlete. He continued: \"If she has a problem with anything I may or may not have said, I expect her to speak with me, which she has not done.\" However, Van Commenee recalled one conversation with his former athlete where he described Okoro \"ranting about her non-selection for the 800m\" at the 2012 London Olympics adding: \"It was a very painful experience for her.\"Okoro remembers the conversation differently.\"In 2012, Charles and I had an exchange regarding selections, well, he was just shouting at me in the training facility which embarrassed me.\"The 35-year-old Okoro added: \"It was two days before the British trials and the press got a hold of it as it potentially affected my (poor) performance at the championships and ran with the story.\"Okoro emphasized that it wasn't to do with her weight on this occasion.\"It was more to do with him having to have his way and throw his dominance around,\" she said.Britain's Lee Mcconnell, Christine Ohuruogu, Nicola Sanders and Okoro celebrate on the podium after the women's 4x400m relay final, 02 September 2007, at the 11th IAAF World Athletics Championships, in Osaka. USA won ahead of Jamaica and Britian.'Athletics is a complicated sport'In the same year, Okoro lost her British Athletics funding under the UK Lottery program.British Athletics told CNN that they wouldn't comment on any individual decisions, but that funding allocations are made for \"performance reasons.\"The criteria that determines the performance and funding decisions are published each year by the organization. UK Athletics (UKA) 2020 World Class Programme Policy states: \"We have to be realistic -- athletics is a complicated sport with many varied disciplines, so one size can't fit all.\" Another section highlights that athletes have to meet individual performance thresholds and demonstrate \"ongoing global medal potential\" to receive funding. UKA follows a 'What it Takes to Win' data and analysis framework to assess an athlete's medal winning capacity. The framework talks of \"key physical and technical characteristics of medal winning athletes,\" which will be part of the athlete's review process taken in person with their coach.Charles Van Commenee, Marilyn Okoro and Greg Rutherford of Great Britain speak ahead of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 5, 2009 in Torino, Italy.READ: The death-defying jumps that caught Hollywood's attentionAccording to leading sports scientist Simon Brundish, these characteristics are created through historic performance data.\"There are real genetic advantages and genetic barriers to be an elite sprinter or an elite endurance runner,\" Brundish, who's been working in international sports for 22 years, tells CNN Sport. \"Van Commenee was probably right in that Okoro was above the threshold markers, but the problem is that those markers were wrong.\" \"'The data will be based against historic norms. BMI, maybe even skin folds. Which is fine for say tennis, in the 80s, where all women look the same. Then Serena appears. Suddenly the 'demands of the game' change.\"She introduces a power and speed element that didn't exist before. The price of said power is muscle. Muscle increases weight. A similar thing happened with 800m and into all middle-distance events over the last 10 years or so\"The shape of women in particular has changed because the demands changed.

It is not uncommon for women to be self-funded during their sports career. Tulshi Varsani, an accredited strength and conditioning coach, tells CNN Sport: \"Women must pay to play.\" Okoro and Mariya Savinova of Russia compete in the Womens 800m Final during day three of the European Athletics Indoor Championships at the Oval Lingotto on March 8, 2009 in Torino, Italy.

Okoro is proud of her Nigerian heritage and looking back she says her family background helped her deal with what she saw was unnecessary attention over her body shape.\"Physically, I look different and a lot more robust and muscular than a lot of the girls that I raced. My Nigerian background... that was something I had to hold my ground on,\" she says passionately.\"It plays a huge part in my achievements and striving for success.\" If she feels strongly about recognizing her Nigerian heritage, Okoro is equally passionate about taking pride in her body shape.\"We're expressing ourselves; you know, muscles hold strong and sexy campaigns.\"According to Okoro, over the course of her career while working with different coaches, some believed she spent too much time at the gym, but the reality is she mostly trains outdoors. \"I was different to what coaches in the UK perceived to be the image and shape for an 800m runner,\" Okoro said. \"These assumptions were there long before Charles [Van Commenee].\"Okoro says that her coaches focused on sprint training and not enough on endurance. It was only when she started to have injuries that Okoro began to question the way she was being coached.\"Does this coach really understand? And are they really in it for me?\" she reflects. \"I was exhausted mentally and physically.\"It's been a real struggle to prove myself as one of the best 800m runners we've had in this country and even in the world.\"Okoro, Jenny Meadows of England and Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya compete in the Women's 800m semifinal at Hampden Park during day eight of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 31, 2014 in Glasgow.

More specifically, what it means to be feminine and masculine and how female athletes' bodies may defy this stereotype and in turn be ridiculed for it.\"She points out that there have been small shifts in society, such as the body positivity movement, which was originally founded by black women, who celebrated their body types and reclaimed traditionally negative terms such as \"fat.\"Yet Dr. Matheson also argues that the body positivity movement has been \"whitewashed, with many campaigns dismissing the origins of the movement.\" GB's women's 4x400m relay team celebrate receiving their reallocated bronze medals, from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games during Day One of the Muller Anniversary Games at the London Stadium on July 21, 2018 in London, England.Real models Okoro is hoping to round off her 20-year career with a gold medal in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics -- but just as importantly fight body image expectations. \"You've got one body, and it was doing pretty great for me, so I needed to look after it,\" said Okoro, who has drawn inspiration from Serena Williams.As Brundish references, Williams has been a key point in the conversation surrounding body image. The 23-time grand-slam champion was criticized for her shape and size. Two years ago, Williams published a letter online addressed to her mother sharing the struggles she's faced with people's body image expectations.  She wrote: \"It has been said I don't belong in women's sports -- that I belong in men's -- because I look stronger than many other women do.\"No, I just work hard, and I was born with this badass body and proud of it.\"Williams says her daughter Olympia shares the same physique and, in the letter, she expresses, \"I don't know how I would react if she [her daughter] has to go through what I've gone through since I was a 15-year-old and even to this day.\"\"We don't all look the same. We are curvy, strong, muscular, tall, small, just to name a few, and all the same: we are women and proud!\" Williams said.Okoro has also drawn inspiration from women athletes in rugby and football.\"They're not your stereotypical beauty queens but they are caring less about how they look and getting dirty and delivering some great performances.\"Okoro wants a new era of role models, or as she calls them \"real models.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Throughout the bitter winter, during rain and snow, Jon Vaughn has alternated between sleeping in a tent or a campervan outside former University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel's house.  A former University of Michigan and NFL football player, Vaughn is one of more than 1,000 people --- mostly men -- who says they were abused by athletics doctor Robert Anderson, who worked for the university from 1966 to 2003 treating students across sports including football, track, and wrestling.  Anderson, who died in 2008, subjected students, 90% of whom were men, to \"sexually abusive conduct\" and invasive exams, including unnecessary genital and rectal examinations, according to a 2021 independent report commissioned by the university.\u202f Many of Anderson's victims were Black -- and survivors say this has played a part in why the abuse was allowed to continue for decades. In his roles at the university, including director of its health service, team physician for the athletic department and a clinical instructor at the university's medical school, Anderson abused men and women from different racial backgrounds, undergraduate and graduate students, student athletes -- including a two-time Super Bowl champion and former world-class wrestler -- and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community, the report found.  The university missed numerous opportunities to stop him over his 37 year long career, it concluded.  Read MoreThis month the university announced a $490 million settlement with over a thousand victims of Anderson's alleged sexual abuse, pending approval by the Michigan Board of Regents and the claimants. Dr. Robert E. Anderson worked for the University of Michigan from 1966 to 2003. He died in 2008.\nBut despite the settlement, the University is still facing calls to take responsibility for its role in the abuse, which spanned more than three decades -- as well as the university's failures to address alleged present day sexual misconduct and abuse by and of students and university staff.Victims say that despite knowledge of Dr. Anderson's predatory behavior, U of M failed to take any action, and instead chose to continue enabling Dr. Anderson's abuse of vulnerable young men until his voluntary retirement in 2003.   \"They've shown that over the last half century... [they're] uninterested in student safety as a priority,\" Vaughn, who played for U of M from 1988 to 1990 said. \"They've shown the inability to police themselves on a consistent basis, as pertains to sexual assault,\" he said. Schlissel -- who was fired this month from his position as President following an anonymous complaint suggesting that he \"may have been involved in an inappropriate relationship with a University employee\" -- has apologized for Anderson's \"tragic misconduct,\" and said in a statement that the university is committed to resolving victims' claims.  But Vaughn, 51, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has been protesting for more than 100 days says he will continue to sleep outside the university president's house until the University of Michigan addresses historic and alleged present day abuse, after realizing how \"acute\" issues of sexual assault, violence and rape are on campus.  Vaughn is also one of many involved in hundreds of individual lawsuits and a class-action lawsuits filed against the University and the Board of Regents by survivors.  Black men treated differently\u202f The allegations against Anderson mirror those against disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar at Michigan State University and Richard Strauss at Ohio State University. They too were doctors who abused their trusted positions to sexually exploit college students and athletes.\u202f With more than a thousand people -- mostly men -- coming forward to say they were abused by Anderson, attorneys representing the victims say it may be the largest case of sex abuse by a single person in the US. The scale of the alleged abuse surpasses that at Michigan State, Ohio State, and similar incidents at other US universities.\u202f But the case has received nowhere near as much media coverage as that of the abuse of Nassar.  A disproportionate number of the victims are African American, Vaughn told CNN. \"I don't think the world right now is ready to complete that spectrum of the face of abuse and include African-American men,\" Vaughn told CNN.\u202f Attorney Mike Cox, who is representing 174 victims in confidential federal court mediation with the University of Michigan told CNN that some 40% of the 1000 Anderson victims are African American men. \"We have not done a formal analysis because all are victims and viewed equally in that sense. But clearly the amount of African American victim survivors is much, much higher than their numbers in American society,\" Cox told CNN over email.  Black Americans represent just 13.4% of the American population. The percentage of African American survivors is also \"dramatically higher\" than their percentages as part of the UM student base, Cox said. The University of Michigan agreed to work toward a goal of 10% African American enrollment by 1973, but did not reach this goal: Black student enrollment had declined by 1987 to 5.3% of the student body from the high of 7.7% in 1976 and never reached the 10% goal targeted by administrators in the early '70's. From the 1980s until 1996, there was a 10% increase in African American student enrollment. However, efforts to increase African American enrollment to reflect the Michigan state's 14% Black population have been unsuccessful, according to the university. Vaughn said it took years for him to even recognize what had happened to him as abuse, and that in communities of color, \"for men to even discuss their abuse is seen as a weakness. In those communities, you're forced to be tough and strong.\"\u202f \"We've been fighting to have a voice, just typically in this country, for over 400 years, we're constantly and have historically been marginalized, or dehumanized in so many ways. So I really think those two factors create this perfect storm,\" he said. Jon Vaughn says he will continue his protest at the university.Attorney Parker Stinar, who represents around 200 of the survivors, agreed, adding that Anderson's case has not received anywhere near as much media coverage or public recognition as other sex abuse cases because the vast majority of survivors are older, Black men.\u202f \"For Larry Nassar, you had prominently White, 30-year-old women, whereas for Dr. Anderson, the vast majority of the survivors are Black and in their 50s, 60s and 70s. This case is overlooked in part because of that,\" he told CNN. \"I think our society looks down on men who are sexually abused, let alone big, strong, athletic, Black men who are sexually abused, compared to female survivors of abuse,\" Stinar added. \"Because they have this societal influence that asks men: How can they allow themselves to be sexually abused?\"Rebecca Wanzo, professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Washington University, St. Louis, told CNN that race plays a significant part in whether or how violence and abuse is reported by the media. \"If you don't have someone who's the face of something that they [the media] put forward, or seems like an ideal victim that people want to tell a story about, historically, that is something that can really affect the ability of a story to travel,\" she explained.\u202f This, she said, is often an issue when it comes to reporting issues like sexual abuse and murder. \"Systemic violence often tends to get less attention, which is why violence against people of color, systemic violence in general, in terms of class and other factors, isn't reported,\" she said. Racist stereotypes\u202f \"We don't have a language to talk about Black as rapeable in the US, because the racist stereotypes of Black men as the rapist and as violent stops us from looking at data that's been collected by the CDC for the last decade,\" Tommy Curry, professor of philosophy and personal Chair of Africana Philosophy and Black Male Studies at The University of Edinburgh told CNN. Nearly 1 in 5 (19.4%) non-Hispanic Black men have experienced contact sexual violence -- which includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion, and unwanted sexual contact -- in their lifetime, according to the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010-2012, which is the latest published data broken out by race or ethnicity.  Social psychology data shows \"Black men are always perceived as being taller, more aggressive, or violent, more prone to conflict, more athletic than they actually are,\" Curry said. \"And it's those social perceptions that have been linked to forms of dehumanization -- likening them to apes, sorts of primal beasts and animals -- that fit into how we think of Black men, both as athletes and as kind of super predators, as superhuman.\"\u202f  Attendees add their signatures to a board in support of survivors of sexual abuse at a vigil outside the home of outgoing University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel October 13, 2021 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Former gymnast Trinea Gonczar, who testified against Larry Nassar, told CNN that in her work supporting victims of sexual abuse, she has learned \"that most men, no matter what, if they've been assaulted, they won't report based on more shame.\"  Nassar, the longtime doctor for the USA Gymnastics team and Michigan State University, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison on child pornography charges, and was also sentenced to a 40-to-175 year state prison sentence in Michigan after pleading guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct. Gonczar has been spending time with Vaughn in his protest to show solidarity with abuse survivors at the University of Michigan. \"In my case, as a privileged woman, my perpetrator is in jail, we received a settlement. I'm White, and I come from an expensive, per se, sport: you have to have money to have to be in that sport,\" Gonczar said. Gonczar now works as director of development at the Avalon Healing Center, which provides support for victims of sexual abuse.\u202f \"I've had to learn that I am a privileged, White person, and all abuse is not the same,\" she said. There are several reasons why Black men choose not to report abuse, Curry told CNN. \"We know from interviews with Black male victims that it's not only the pressures of not being believed -- but it's also being perceived as the aggressor,\" he explained. Curry said that his research had shown that in domestic violence cases, Black men would stay in situations of abuse, or they would not report victimization.\u202f \"They fear that the police or the criminal justice system or society is going to view them as the perpetrator and they'll be criminalized even harsher than the kinds of abuse and violence that they suffer,\" Curry said.\u202f When Black men report that they have been victimized by others, \"different stereotypes activate\", Curry added. \"A lot of racists would say, 'No, he was really the aggressor, he tried to rape me, I wouldn't rape a man. It wasn't me. This person was violent or aggressive, or he's a drug dealer, a thief.'\u202f \"All these racial stereotypes are utilized to undercut the credibility of Black men who are victims in ways that other groups don't have to deal with,\" he said. Conditions that enable abuse Attorney Stephen Estey told CNN that Anderson was easily able to take advantage of his victims.\u202f\"Some of these men, they came from the inner city [which had] not the best healthcare in the back of the day,\" Estey, who represents some 80 survivors, said. \"Some of them never had a physical [examination], and so they didn't know what a physical should have been. And Dr. Anderson would tell them, if you want to play football, it's part of the process,\" Estey told CNN.  Wanzo said that a nationwide commitment to protecting athletic programs \"particularly makes Black people vulnerable in the US because they are disproportionately often in some of these programs.\" Anderson first served as a University Health Services doctor and was moved to the Athletic Department in 1981 after \"credible reports of misconduct\" were relayed to the then Assistant Vice President of Student Services Thomas Easthope in late 1978 or 1979, according to the WilmerHale report.\u202f \"The fact that they switched him out of general care to the athletic program as if they [athletes] were sort of disposable people says a lot about how the institution thought about how to deal with the problem person: they value athletics as institution, but the people who participate in athletics and make some money are disposable.\"  Vaughn told CNN that there are a \"number of dynamics\" aside from race that help perpetuate \"this culture of abuse in sport.\" \"I think it is the athlete's dedication to this specific sport, and the overwhelming trust that they tend to have in their coaches and trainers because of the focus that it takes to be successful in sport,\" Vaughn said. Coaches and medical staff are often the most powerful people in a child and student athlete's life, he added. If sports create the perfect conditions for abuse, then institutions are failing to regulate themselves, survivors say. \"It's really the institutions that are protecting their brands, and the position that they hold within that sport, because they really want that sport to be a catalyst for their financial gain instead of taking concern about their sports doctors who are actually predators,\" Gonczar, a gymnast who was treated by Nassar for 15 years, and who estimates that she was molested some 856 times, said.\u202f A number of the women said they had reported Nassar's abuse previously but that the systems of authority, including USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Michigan State University, did not take their concerns seriously.\"Absolutely not enough has changed,\" Gonczar said.\u202f \"In the US it's taking so long to just simply get these big institutions to be aware and to be willing to be accountable and transparent, and to have people in the leadership roles that are willing to facilitate that,\" Gonczar warned.\u202f Campus abuse between students ongoing issue The University of Michigan finalized a new sexual and gender based misconduct policy in September, but critics say abuse and assault between students and by university staff still isn't being dealt with well enough. Vaughn said that since he has been protesting, he has been approached by students who have told him of their own experiences of sexual assault and abuse at the university. There were 157 allegations of sexual assault reported to the University's Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to its yearly report. The University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which records incidents reported to the DPSS, law enforcement agencies and campus security authorities, described 18 on campus rapes and 31 reports of fondling not associated with Anderson in 2020. Some 106 reports of sexual assault were made to the University's Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center (SAPAC) in 2020, down from 151 in 2019 and 168 in 2018.  Vaughn says he has spoken to students who feel harrassment is still a problem at the university.There were 77 reported instances of sexual harassment and 57 reports of stalking, according to the University's Division of Public Safety and Security, which provided the data as \"additional information regarding crime reports on campus.\"   Campus enrollment in 2019 stood at 48,090 students, and 47,907 enrolled in 2020. \"All the reporting agencies within the university have essentially failed all the students and all the student athletes, because they've done nothing to support in any consistent manner, or protect in any consistent manner,\" Vaughn said. \"Professors have said if you support or even help report a student's standpoint, it's like a career suicide,\" he added.  Some 42.4 percent of Michigan students said they had experienced at least one type of harassing behavior since entering school, and more than a quarter (26.9 percent) of undergraduate women reported nonconsensual sexual contact, according to a campus climate survey regarding sexual misconduct.  Out of women who say they experienced harassment, 8.9 percent of Michigan undergraduates reported the person was a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker compared to an average of 4.8 percent of undergraduates and across the 33 schools surveyed in the overall survey, which looked at responses from a total of 181,752 students from 33 colleges and universities. Some 31.8 percent of graduate or professional Michigan students reported their harasser to be a teacher, advisor, boss, supervisor, or co-worker, compared to an average 16.5 percent in the overall survey.  Vaughn has slept in a tent and later, a trailer, to protest at the University over issues of sexual abuse and assault.Vaughn has been protesting through harsh conditions at the University of Michigan.The overall survey found that the 33 schools surveyed, more than half of undergraduate women (59.2%) and transgender, genderqueer, and non-binary students (65.1%) reported experiencing at least one harassing behavior.  \"I speak to a lot of students, many of them feel like with the assaults that have happened to them, that the university has not been able to deal with it properly,\" Charlie Kolean, chairman of Michigan Students Against Sexual Assault told CNN. \"Typically, a case will not be criminally referred. And additionally, a lot of survivors from assault, they don't want to go through the university's process reporting the assault, because it is fairly arduous,\" he added. Emma Sandberg, a former student and founder of activism group Roe v. Rape told CNN: \"Overall, it is very difficult to be a survivor at U of M. The sexual assault prevention center doesn't provide any real resources, university leadership has engaged in sexual misconduct themselves, and those who go through the all-consuming Title IX process are traumatized by it and rarely receive justice, support, or validation.  \"We need a supportive center for survivors, not just a preventative one, and we need more effective prevention methods at all levels,\" Sandberg, who graduated in in 2021, said. In addition to Anderson, at least five current and former university professors and officials have faced accusations of sexual harassment or abuse in the last few years.In a statement to CNN, Rick Fitzgerald, associate vice president of Public Affairs and Internal Communications at the University of Michigan said: \"We encourage every incident of misconduct to be reported and we take action,\" pointing towards the university's annual report for further details.\u202f \"SAPAC has a 30-year history of supporting and advocating for survivors of sexual misconduct, through a range of supportive services, based on individual needs,\" he said, pointing towards the university's confidential resources for students and staff.He added: \"The University of Michigan always has taken sexual misconduct seriously and we have been increasing our efforts steadily,\" and that a Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center has been on campus for almost 40 years. Fitzgerald added that any case that involves criminal behavior is \"first turned over to police and the ECRT investigation is put on hold so that criminal activity can always be addressed first.\"  Vaughn wants the university to overhaul its approach to misconduct. \"You cannot only celebrate parts of your history, you must deal with your entire history in order to root it out and change that culture,\" he said. \"Because the longer you ignore it, the more you perpetuate it and the more it empowers other predators, because they're watching the lack of discipline, or consequences for serial predators and rapists that then gives others the green light to make those decisions and prey on young men and young women.\" Co-lead class counsel attorney E. Powell Miller told CNN his team is seeking \"class action relief for reforms, policies and procedures to prevent an Anderson problem from occurring again.\"  Attorney Jonathan Selbin, co-lead class counsel in a class action suit against the University, told CNN: \"While paying money to the victims is a critical first step, U of M must also commit to system-wide changes that bring all of the stakeholders together to reform the campus and institutional culture and prevent abuses like this from ever occurring again.\" Vaughn wants the university to create programs that empower students to report instances of sexual violence, and strengthen mechanisms to protect students. Last July, the university announced revisions to how it will address sexual misconduct, including the creation of a new office with \"significant\" new resources for support, education and prevention. The office was launched in August.  \"I knew that there was nothing that I could do in my protest to change what happened to me. But we could uncover the truth here at Michigan, and also make this place safer for now, and in the future, so that these atrocities don't continue to happen,\" Vaughn said. \"We want to change the narrative, as well as the culture. So until that's done, I won't be leaving.\"",

        "content": "Wrestler Navid Afkari was executed by the Iranian government on September 12, 2020. The story of his life and the movement he has inspired is being republished by CNN International to mark the anniversary of his death. This article was first published on June 28, 2021. (CNN)It was the worst news that anybody could have woken up to; as Sardar Pashaei reached for his phone one morning in September, he knew immediately that something terrible had happened.\u202f \"When I woke at about six or seven o'clock in the morning,\" he told CNN Sport, \"I see a lot of phone calls from Persian television. And when I listened to the voicemail of my journalist friend, I just cried. I couldn't control my tears.\" The Iranian Pashaei, who was the 1998 Junior 60-kilogram Greco-Roman World Wrestling champion, has been living in self-imposed exile in the US since 2009.On that fateful morning, he learned that another Iranian wrestler, Navid Afkari, had been executed, hanged for a crime that his family and friends say he didn't commit.\u202f Pashaei, who was close to Afkari's coach in Iran, had been campaigning hard to save his life. It was a campaign that ended brutally with a hangman's noose, but in the months since Afkari was silenced, his voice seems only to have grown louder. Read MoreAn ancient sportWrestling is one of the oldest sports in Iran and it is one of the most popular. Ever since winning their first Olympic wrestling medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Iranian wrestlers have excelled at the Games, returning home with a total of 43 medals to date, more than double the haul in their next best sport -- weightlifting.\u202f Pashaei says that there's a wrestling gym \"in every corner of every city in Iran,\" and successful wrestlers there are treated differently, enjoying an elevated status in comparison to other athletes. They're on a pedestal.\u202f Iranians wrestle during a workout session at the traditional Shir Afkan \"zurkhaneh\" (House of Strength) gymnasium in the capital Tehran in February 2018.The ancient sport is naturally aggressive and competitive, but experts say it's a combat sport borne out of a practice to promote\u202finner\u202fstrength through\u202fouter\u202fstrength.When viewed through such a lens, wrestling might not seem too dissimilar to yoga. The spirit of wrestling is deeply engrained in Iranian culture, where it has transcended the arena of sport.Max Fisher wrote in The Atlantic in 2012 that \"The ideal practitioner is meant to embody such moral traits as kindness and humility and to defend the community against sinfulness and external threats.\"\u202f One could argue that it was these very qualities that got Afkari executed -- by his own government.\u202f 'He was the best one'Afkari was born on July 22, 1993, and raised in the city of Shiraz; located in the southwest region of Iran, it's one of the oldest cities in Ancient Persia and known to be a hotbed of poets, literature, flowers and wine.Legend has it that the famous Syrah grape, grown as far afield as the Rh\u00f4ne Valley in France and in the new world territories of Australia, New Zealand and California, first took root in Shiraz.\u202f It was here that a young Afkari learned to find his way in the world. One of five children, he discovered wrestling at the age of nine and quickly dedicated his life to the sport.By the time he was 17, he was good enough to be included in a group of eight wrestlers in the 69-kg category that attended a national training camp. Six years later, Pashaei says Afkari was ranked second in his division and on track to fulfill his dream of one day becoming an Olympic champion.\u202f Parents will usually try to avoid having a favorite child or revealing the truth if they do have a preference, but Afkari's three brothers and sister knew their place in the family. Sources close to them say that he was the apple of his mother's eye; Afkari was successful, but modest, and he was never a burden to them. A family member, speaking to CNN Sport only on the understanding that their identity would be protected, described Afkari as \"the nicest member of the family,\" adding that his friends would agree: \"He was the best one.\"\u202f Navid Afkari (bottom left), sitting with his brother Vahid (top left), brother Saeid (bottom center), Habib (bottom right) father (top center) and mother (top right). Videos of him with his hands in the air, dancing and singing at home during Persian New Year, and somersaulting acrobatically into a swimming pool confirm the family's description of Afkari as \"enthusiastic, full of energy and excitement.\" Such positivity would rub off on those closest to him, especially within his family.\u202f They say that he wasn't particularly interested in politics, but he was keen to help out in the community, making donations and helping the poor, and he was troubled by the culture of discrimination in Iran, especially against women and those living in poverty.\u202f\u202f That's why Afkari took part in the seismic demonstrations that swept through the country in 2018.Initially, these were protests against the government's economic policies, but they soon morphed into political opposition of the theocratic regime and its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were regarded as the most significant domestic challenge to the government in almost a decade.\u202f Afkari was concerned about rising prices in Iran, so -- along with millions of others -- he took to the streets to protest. His family says he was frustrated by corruption and poverty and worried that daily life was no longer affordable to many of his compatriots.\u202f It was a fateful decision that would end up costing him his life.\u202f A forced confession / A lack of evidenceAccording to the official version of events, Afkari killed Hassan Torkman, a water company security employee, during a protest in Shiraz on August 2, 2018. Afkari and his brother, Vahid, were arrested a month and a half later, on September 17 according to the UN, and another brother, Habib, was rounded up later that year. Afkari was condemned to death; Vahid and Habib received prison sentences of more than 33 and 15 years respectively and all were to be punished with 74 lashes each, according to Amnesty International. Initially, Afkari confessed to the crime, but in court he retracted those words, arguing that he had been tortured during his interrogation by \"men with hats, glasses and masks on,\" and that a false confession had been forced out of him. His supporters say that his trial was devoid of any compelling evidence, and in fact, the only video evidence available, from a closed-circuit television camera, would have been more likely to prove his innocence. Afkari's attorney, Hassan Younesi, told the Center for Human Rights in Iran that \"There is no visual evidence of the moment of the crime, and the film presented in this case shows scenes an hour\u202fbefore\u202fthe time of the murder.\" In this June 2018 photo, a group of protesters chant slogans at the main gate of the Old Grand Bazaar, in Tehran, Iran. The case of 27-year-old Navid Afkari has drawn the attention of a social media campaign that portrays him and his brothers as victims targeted over participating in protests against Iran's Shiite theocracy in 2018. An audio recording was made in the court and leaked by human rights activists; in it, an agitated Afkari, speaking in a high-pitched voice, can be heard pleading with the judge, who seems to have little interest in giving him a fair hearing.\u202fSuch recordings of court proceedings are extremely rare in Iran and whoever made it and released it would have done so at great personal risk.  The prosecution claimed to have video evidence of the crime committed at the specific time of 11:32 p.m., but according to the audio tape, it was never shown in court and the defendant was never able to see it for himself.Long readsAustralia's first international cricketers won fame abroad.

On the recording, Afkari demands that his witness, Shahin Nasseri, be heard, somebody who can testify to the abuse he experienced while being held in police detention for nearly 50 days.In a complaint filed with the judiciary in September 2019, Afkari described \"the most severe and physical psychological torture,\" but according to Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, the head of the Fars Province Judiciary rejected claims that Afkari had been beaten or tortured and, in court, he was dismissed out of hand.\"Not related. Not the time for it, sit down, don't talk anymore!\" ordered the judge on the recording. \"You do not have a defense.\"The Iranian government has said repeatedly that Afkari was not tortured and that his confession wasn't forced. CNN has asked the government if he received a fair trial, but we have not received a response.The executionAccording to the Afkari family, his final days were brutal, but there wasn't necessarily any reason to think that the end was near.The family says that he was kept in solitary confinement for a week and \"beaten by 20 guards,\" before being told that he and his brothers were being moved from the prison in Shiraz to the capital, Tehran.That was a lie; instead, Afkari was executed on September 12th, at the age of 27.\u202fMuch later, family members learned that Vahid and Habib were in a cell close to the gallows where they had heard their brother die. \u202f His body was returned to his family in the middle of the night, and they say he was denied a proper burial. The authorities had already dug a hole in the dirt and that's where Navid was expected to be placed.In the months that have passed since, he has hardly been able to rest in peace. The family has tried to honor Afkari, by placing a stone to inscribe in remembrance and a wall to protect it, but they say it was broken down by the authorities with a bulldozer.\u202fAs the Afkaris tried to prevent further damage, the father was arrested, and they were cautioned that the whole site could be completely destroyed.\u202f Iranians in Canada on Mel Lastman Square demonstrate against the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by the Iranian regime, in Toronto, Ontario in September 2020. The death sentence caused international uproar, yet the regime persisted.  As such, Afkari's final resting place is now just a simple grave.\u202f His death was a crippling blow to those who had loved him and also to those who had never even met him.So successful was the campaign to raise awareness of his plight that Dana White, the head of UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) asked then US President Donald Trump to appeal to Iran for clemency.\u202fUnfortunately, though, their efforts were in vain.\u202f Speaking shortly after Afkari's death in a press conference, White tried to make sense of it all but could only conclude that \"he was fighting for what he believed in. And it cost him his life.\" One UFC fighter, Bobby Green, was so emotional that he could think of nothing else after beating Alan Patrick in Las Vegas.Green, who was a wrestler himself before turning to Mixed Martial Arts, cut short his post-fight interview by saying, \"Somebody just lost their life for protesting; that just messed me up. I thought we were going to be able to save him. That is so sad, it broke my heart. I don't even want to talk right now.\"Inciting a culture of fearAfkari was one of at least 267 people who were executed in Iran in 2020.A report compiled by Iran Human Rights and advocacy group Together Against the Death Penalty (ECPM) concluded that Iran can boast of the highest number of confirmed executions in the world per capita, and that The Islamic Republic uses executions \"as a tool to oppress political dissidents, including protesting citizens, ethnic minorities and journalists.\" IHR's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam explained that the regime creates fear through the death penalty to maintain power, but that fear is now waning.\"Protests in recent years,\" he said in the report, \"have shown that not only are people losing their sense of fear but they are also uniting in their anger against these executions.\" Navid's mother (left) stands by Navid's grave in March 2021 in Shiraz, Iran. While still grieving, Afkari's friends and family are dealing with further intimidation.His former coach,\u202fMohammad Ali Chamiani, says he has been warned not to talk about him, and just in case there is any misunderstanding, he's been banned from teaching wrestling, sacked by his gym and stripped of his benefits and insurance.\u202fIt's a humiliating end to Ali Chamiani's career; until recently, he was revered, considered on three separate occasions to be the top wrestling coach in the country. The family is now concerned for the safety of their other sons in prison but they say that Afkari has prepared them to be strong.Throughout the two years that he was imprisoned, family members say he was building them up, allaying their fears where possible and ensuring that they'd be able to continue his struggle when he was gone. He knew that he was going to be put to death, but in his last night alive, his family says he called them to say that he was doing OK, asking them not to worry. United for NavidAfkari may be gone, but his voice is now louder than ever. The recording of him defiantly challenging the judge can be found all over social media, so, too, an audio recording that he made while he was in jail.\u202f \"During all the years that I wrestled,\" he states calmly, \"I never faced a cowardly opponent who played dirty because wrestling is an inherently honorable sport. But it's been two years that my family and I have had to face off against injustice and the most cowardly and dishonorable opponent.\" Upon realizing that his legal challenge was destined to fail, he concluded, \"They are just looking for a neck to throw their noose around.\" One of his most prominent supporters is Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist, author and political activist, who's now living in New York.\u202fShe never met Afkari, but she later learned that he had reached out to her during the protests.\u202f People protest against Iran's death penalty opposite Downing Street as a march to demand a people's vote against Brexit passes by on October 2018 in London, England. On February 12, 2018, Alinejad had posted an image on Instagram of an Iranian woman who'd been arrested for protesting the compulsory headscarf (Hijab) law. Among the list of 1,648 comments was one from Afkari, whose public courage and audacity would have been inconceivable to many in Iran.In Farsi, he posted a direct attack on the Supreme Leader, a line which translates to \"I spit on your rotten soul.\" Alinejad's original post received over 71,000 likes and could have been seen by any of her five million followers.\u202f Alinejad told CNN that it was Afkari's brief comment, quickly lost in the sea of social media, that has posthumously formed such an unbreakable bond between them. \"I was shocked at how brave he was,\" she told CNN Sport. \"He cursed the Supreme Leader of Iran, in public, under his own name. That is why I care so much about Navid. That actually breaks my heart. I did my best, but sometimes I feel miserable and frustrated that we couldn't save him. \"We have so many Navids now fighting for freedom,\" Alinejad explained, \"fighting for equality, fighting for justice, fighting for dignity, fighting to have a normal life, fighting to get rid of dictatorship.\"\u202f Tokyo 2020'I felt my body was still capable': Meet the moms hoping to shine at the OlympicsOlympic silver medalist food for Uber Eats to fund Tokyo 2020 dreamTriple jumping rapper on why his music is his 'love language'How a married couple navigated the 'purgatory' of a postponed OlympicsAlinejad believes that the government viewed Afkari as a threat and moved quickly to silence him, using his execution as a deterrent to others, adding, \"His only crime was just joining Iran protests and that scares the government. The government actually wanted to create fear within the society.\" But his execution might prove to have been a miscalculation; it may have backfired.\u202f Alinejad is the\u202fcampaign founder\u202fof United for Navid, an action group that is keeping his voice alive.Afkari's sacrifice has motivated many Iranian athletes to find the courage to step up and speak out; while some want politics to be separated from sport in their country, all agree on the need for even greater reforms.She understands the risks that many of them are taking. \"Sometimes, when you keep silent, they can execute you. Sometimes, when you speak up, they can execute you. So that is why we have to do something beyond just talking about Navid, talking about his goal. He wanted to have greater freedom. He wanted to have a better country [in which] to live.\" Iranian-American supporters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) protest the execution of wrestler Navid Afkari by Iran, in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. in September 2020. The execution ended the life of Afkari, but it has failed to silence his voice. He continues speaking from beyond the grave: \"If there's one thing I learned from stepping onto the wrestling mat,\" he was recorded saying in jail, \"it's that I should never give into oppression and lies.\" That spirit seems to be alive in his family; despite enormous pressure to comply with the government and blacken Afkari's name, they are standing firm. \"We care about the good thing that we have to do. We care about our goal, rather than think about the tortures and fear,\" said his relative, adding that Afkari's mother is torn between conflicting emotions. \"She has two feelings right now. She's so sad for losing Navid. And secondly, she's so proud of Navid because she knows that Navid chose the right path.\"\u202f Afkari has become larger in death than he ever was in life. Pashaei concludes that the campaign of which he is a spokesman is now an unstoppable force.\"They thought that by killing this guy, they can bury his name like his body. But it never happened. Now, we see that he's a champ. He's a hero for millions of young athletes. He's everywhere now.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Athletes are trained to be tough; they've learned to push through the pain barrier and find courage when all hope might seem to be lost.But athletes in Iran have to be braver than most. For them, the battle isn't just on the field of play, it's also away from the arenas, where the consequences of their actions could be painful, even deadly.\"I am 100% fearful,\" judoka Vahid Sarlak tells CNN Sport. He knows fighting for his beliefs could end badly in a country where political activists and their families are routinely intimidated, arrested and can even be executed. \"Every day, my mom asks me not to do this, she is worried daily. But I say, 'I was born once, and I'll die once.' I have sworn that I'll fight for my freedom for as long as I'm alive.\"When asked to detail the kind of threats that she is facing, the soccer player Shiva Amini tries to make light of it, telling CNN: \"SMS messages, such as 'We will cut your head off and send a picture of it to your family.' Do you want just one example, or do you want to hear the rest?\"Read MoreThey used to say that sport and politics shouldn't mix, but those days seem to be a distant memory. In many parts of the western world, athletes are now using their platforms to shape social and political discourse.In Iran, sport and politics have always mixed, but it's the theocratic government that makes the rules and enforces them through fear. The former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei knows exactly what can be at stake; he campaigned to try and save the life of wrestler Navid Afkari, who was executed in 2020. Afkari's death became a rallying cry for athletes in Iran to unite and push for change in a campaign called 'United for Navid.'\"If we be silenced today, we don't have anything to tell our children tomorrow,\" Pashaei told CNN.All three are now living in self-imposed exile abroad, where it's a little safer to be outspoken; all are brave, but all have been traumatized by years of harassment and intimidation. When asked if he fears for his life, the former karate international champion Mahdi Jafargholizadeh scoffed at the suggestion: \"I died 20 years ago. I lost everything when I was in Iran. If you kill me again, you just killed a dead person.\"In 2017, soccer player Shiva Amini was forced to apply for asylum in Switzerland because she was observed playing without the compulsory hijab while outside of Iran.An eternal blowSarlak might be a judoka, but he could easily have been a poet.\"Have you ever been in love?\" he asked CNN Sport. \"Sport is love,\" he opined. \"When you meet a girl for the first time, fall in love and then lose her, would it mean that you will never fall in love again? I'm sure you will, 100% sure. The next love will come.\"At the age of 40, Sarlak is still madly in love with his sport. He says a life without sport would feel \"the same as death.\" But he's had his heart broken more than once and in ways that most athletes couldn't even begin to imagine.At the age of 17, he says he was ordered to lose by his team at the World Junior Championships. Deliberately losing is an alien concept to any athlete but it's not for Iranian athletes in international competitions.When entering a tournament, they don't fear the prospect of running into a stronger opponent, their biggest concern is that an Israeli athlete lies ahead of them in the draw because their government's unwritten rule means that they're not going to be allowed to compete against them.Sarlak says that the first time he was told to lose in 1998, he didn't give it much thought -- he was still so young. But when it happened at the 2005 World Championships in Cairo, he was absolutely devastated.\"It was the most difficult moment of my life,\" he recalled. \"I was just crying and asking why? Why should I lose? I remember my coach slapped me and told me: 'You know that you have to go and lose the match.'\"Other stories by Don RiddellThe untold story of the Munich OlympicsHow boxing is changing the way society looks at women in GazaHow a nation of just 11 million people became world's top-ranked football teamBaseball star took a knee and then his life unraveled in Trump's AmericaSarlak was fighting in the 60kg repechage and on course for a bronze medal; he'd been drawn against an opponent from Azerbaijan, but Israel's Gal Yekutiel was up next.His coach delivered the news that no athlete would ever want to hear: \"Your next opponent will be an Israeli, and we are not permitted to be in a match with Israelis.\"Nearly 16 years after the event, Sarlak is still traumatized by it and the details of that day have been seared into his memory.He says that the broadcast cameras were trained on him because they realized he'd thrown the match. His coach put a towel over his head and he was rushed back to the hotel, denying him the chance to watch the rest of the competition.\"I broke all the windows in my room,\" recalls Sarlak. \"It was the worst day of my life. A hole opened inside of me and that hole is still open. The dream of having that medal has remained with me. I will never forgive them.\" To add insult to injury, Sarlak says he's still taunted about it.\"Even now, when I see my Azeri opponent, he tells me, 'Your medal is on display at my house. Your medal is on my neck now. You didn't want it and I won it.' This will never be erased from my mind.\"CNN has asked the Iranian government if it acknowledges that it has prevented athletes from competing against Israelis. We also asked if they will allow their athletes to compete against Israeli opponents at the Olympics this year. They have not responded to our inquiry.Iran's Vahid Sarlak duels with Spain's Javier Fernandez in the up to and including 60 kgs men's open category during the World Judo Championships in Cairo in September 2005. Sarlak says he was forced to default from the tournament after he'd been drawn against an opponent from Israel. 'I'm not going back'Jafargholizadeh had always wanted to be a karate champion. He says his father was the head coach of the national team, but he didn't believe in his son. \"I remember one day I was wearing his national team jacket,\" Jafargholizadeh told CNN Sport. \"He just slapped me in the face and said, 'Who the hell are you? You get it yourself.'\" That was all the motivation that Mahdi needed. \"OK, I said, I'll show you.\"He was barely a teenager when one of the top teams in the country took an interest in him, and in time, he was competing internationally -- a national champion picking up more than 20 medals all over the world. But Jafargholizadeh says it all came to a screeching halt when he was thrown in jail in 2004, arrested at the airport and accused of planning to be an Israeli spy. He says he was tortured and interrogated for five to six months and even threatened with the death penalty.Tokyo 2020'I felt my body was still capable': Meet the moms hoping to shine at the OlympicsOlympic silver medalist food for Uber Eats to fund Tokyo 2020 dreamTriple jumping rapper on why his music is his 'love language'How a married couple navigated the 'purgatory' of a postponed OlympicsHe relays the experience in a stream of consciousness and a smile that belies the suffering he endured.\"They break my nose, many different stuff that I don't even want to talk about.\"He says the accusations were so incredulous that he didn't take them seriously at first, but it reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore and he started goading his tormentors to go make good on their threats.\"I never forget that I had a shirt with buttons,\" he recalled, gesturing that he ripped it open and declared: \"Take your gun and shoot me here now. Or you want to hang me later on? Do it now!\"It's scarcely believable that Jafargholizadeh was eventually released from jail and able to resume his competitive career at the top level, fighting again at the 2005 and 2007 Asian championships and winning gold and silver medals with his team.But after another brush with authority in 2008, he realized that it was no longer safe for him to remain in the country. His opposition to the government in Iran wasn't much of a secret, and he was perhaps something of a marked man. According to Jafargholizadeh, the President of the Karate Federation, a man \"who has been in the intelligence service for years and years,\" saw him with tattoos all over his body and declared it would be his last year with the national team. \"I take my last chance; I'm not going back again. I didn't go back. I left the national team in Germany and became a refugee,\" said Jafargholizadeh.Forced to forfeitMany young Iranians dream of becoming professional athletes, but they can't imagine the pitfalls that will come with their exposure to the international community.\"Every Iranian has a passport,\" explains Sarlak. \"On the first page, it is written that you can travel to any country you would like to go -- except 'the occupied Palestine.'\"Sarlak says even speaking the name Israel just isn't done in Iran.\"We all know that, but the intensity of this problem is more obvious with athletes because we face situations with Israel. Ordinary people may not have to deal with it, [but] this problem is a flashpoint for athletes that will never go away.\"It's well known that athletes from Iran are prevented from competing against Israelis -- in any competition.In the main sports where they could have met at the Olympics -- boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling -- there has never once been a contest between athletes from either country. It almost happened at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, when a swimmer from each country was drawn to race in the fourth heat of the first round of the 100-meter breaststroke. But the Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, never showed up.In 2017, the wrestler Alireza Mohammad Karimimachiani was in a winning position against Russia's Alikhan Zhabrailov at the Under-23 World Championship in Poland, when his coach became animated on the sideline. He can be seen and heard on the broadcast highlights calling from the floor: \"Lose Ali!\" The clip, which can still be viewed at UWW.Org, reveals an increasingly desperate coach imploring his athlete to throw in the towel: \"Alireza! Lose Alireza! Alireza! You must lose! Alireza, you must lose! Israel won. Israel has won.\"The Israeli Uri Kalashnikov had just beaten the American Samuel Brooks and was awaiting the winner in the next round. It was the second time in his career that Karimimachiani says he had been told to lose, later he told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency that \"my whole world seemed to come to an end.\"Iran's Saeid Mollaei (in white) fights against Belgium's Matthias Casse during the semifinal of the men's under 81kg category during the 2019 Judo World Championships at the Nippon Budokan, a venue for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Mollaei, who claimed he was ordered to deliberately lose a world championship fight, could compete under a refugee flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, officials said on September 1.  A much clearer instruction can be heard in an audio recording made at the 2019 World Judo Championships in Tokyo, when Saeid Mollaei was ordered to lose his semifinal in order to steer clear of the Israeli world champion Sagi Muki. \"Based on my stance, that of the regime and that of the minister, he has no right to compete,\" says the president of Iran's Judo Federation in the recording.The ambient noise of the competition is audible in the background as he concludes with a scarcely veiled threat: \"The circumstances stipulate that one should never question this stance. Make him understand that he has no right to compete under no circumstances. He is responsible for his actions.\"Sarlak now lives in Germany; he breaks down in tears and leaves the interview when explaining that he hasn't been able to see his parents for 12 years. Jafargholizadeh resides in the mountains of Finland and the 1998 junior world Greco-Roman wrestling champion Pashaei is exiled in the US.He fled in 2008, when it became apparent that his Kurdish ethnicity and the connection to his politically active father was shutting down career opportunities.As a coach, he says he was barred from traveling out of the country with the national team.A year before he made the decision to flee the country, he witnessed one of his wrestlers being denied the chance to fight; he told CNN that he watched from a distance as Babak Ghorbani was given the news.\"He was sitting on the stage in the stadium and he couldn't believe it. He was crying and crying. He was telling me, 'You know how hard I worked! I don't deserve this!'\"This is not just about losing one match, it affects your whole life. Your dignity has been taken away by other people, people who are usually members of the intelligence service who don't know the pain of being an athlete. This is sport, it has to be about peace and friendship, but they teach you to hate.\"An Israeli man of Iranian descent holds Iran's pre-revolution flag in support of Iranian judoka Saeid Mollaei during the Tel Aviv Grand Slam 2021 on February 19, 2021.'Girls had no value'Many countries would be delighted to see their athletes and teams triumph on the world stage.In the purest sense, sporting success can be a boost to domestic morale, but it can also be used as a means of wielding soft power on the international stage. Sport is a good way to make friends and influence people -- and so they're willing to make heavy investments or even cheat to achieve those ends.Iranian athletes have come to realize, though, that the opposite is true for them. Iran seems to routinely sabotage its own sporting success and its female athletes are in no doubt about that. They often feel as though they have to compete with one hand tied behind their backs -- that's if they're allowed to compete at all.Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran hasn't sent a female athlete to compete at the Olympics in swimming, wrestling or gymnastics, none of which would be possible while wearing the compulsory hijab.Shiva Amini says her proudest achievement with the national women's soccer team was at the 2009 Indoor Asian Games in Vietnam, where her Futsal team beat Uzbekistan and Japan to win their group, before losing to Jordan in the semifinals.\"With all the difficulties of wearing a hijab, in the heat in Vietnam, we were able to win,\" she explained to CNN. \"Despite all the difficulties, because of the love we have for football and sport, we could fight and be just like any other girls.\"Amini details the inconvenience of competing in a hijab, how it restricts the ability to move and how it becomes heavy with sweat: \"We had a hard time even breathing.\" And if the scarf became loose or if the sleeves rolled up their arms, the referee would blow the whistle to stop the game and a scoring opportunity might have been lost.Amini, who was regarded as the most technically gifted player in the women's game in Iran, says that she and the female team were made to feel as if their status was little more than token.Long readsAustralia's first international cricketers won fame abroad.

I realized that us girls had no value. It was an insult and a humiliation.\"In 2017, Amini was playing football in Switzerland and she posted pictures of it on her social media accounts.Given that she wasn't on official business with the country of Iran, she didn't give it a second thought, until the pictures appeared everywhere back home and caused a storm of controversy: she wasn't wearing her hijab and she was playing with \"anti-Islam\" teams.\"For a few weeks, the entire internet was filled with stories about me,\" Amini told CNN. \"It created a very bad situation for my family in Iran and myself in Switzerland.\"She hired lawyers in both countries, but soon came to realize that the situation was now beyond her control.\"They have fully politicized this event and put your name on a blacklist in Iran,\" she said she was told. \"I was not prepared to deal with what was about to happen, my life was about to fully change in all aspects, I did not have a good mental condition.\"Amini has not been home since and says both she and her family are routinely harassed and intimidated.Navid Afkari: Executed Iranian wrestling star's voice is 'everywhere now'Campaigning for justiceIn September 2020, a dreadful event motivated these four athletes and many others to come together and tell their stories.The execution of wrestler Afkari -- capital punishment for a murder that his family and friends say that he did not commit -- galvanized the sports community and spurred it into action. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee and the Executive Board at the IOC, calling for immediate action to be taken against the National Olympic Committee of Iran.In letters sent on March 5, March 25 and April 19, United for Navid has provided the names and case studies of 20 athletes who've been negatively impacted by political interference in Iran.\"We have a simple question,\" states the United for Navid campaign spokesman Pashaei: \"Can IOC member states torture and arrest athletes and violate the [Olympic] charter? Are you doing anything to protect these athletes? Because their rights are being discriminated against every single day.\"IOC President Thomas Bach speaks during a press conference in Tokyo on November 16, 2020. Within the last few months, the United for Navid Campaign has been writing to Bach, calling for immediate action to be taken against the NOC of Iran. According to the charter's Fundamental Principles of Olympism, \"the practice of sport is a human right\" and \"sports organizations within the Olympic Movement shall apply political neutrality.\" Access to sport should be enjoyed without \"discrimination of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\"The charter concludes: \"Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter.\"In an impassioned plea, the emotion is clear in Pashaei's voice as he continues listing to CNN the many ways in which the integrity and safety of Iranian athletes is compromised by their own government.\"When they don't compete with Israeli athletes, they tell the IOC that this is their personal decision. It's a big lie. Every single trip, there are members of security intelligence watching the athletes 24/7 and if they do something wrong, they have been punished.\"I want to ask IOC, are you aware of this? You talk about gender equality and race equality. Are you aware that one of your members is violating the charter all the time? You have been silent about this; we're not going to be silenced.\" A picture taken on March 8, 2021 in Lausanne shows the Olympic rings next to the headquarters of the IOC.Of the 20 case studies that have been sent to the IOC so far, only 12 athletes have been identified. The names of eight others have been withheld to protect them, as they are still living in Iran. Amini says those athletes fully support the campaign. \"They are very happy with this movement. They encourage us, they push us forward. And the one thing they all say is, 'All of our hopes are in you guys,'\" Amini told CNN.There is an element of risk, also, for the athletes living outside of Iran -- many of them still have family at home.\"Once in a while they question our parents, brothers and sisters, they threaten them,\" says Pashaei. \"But our families, all of them, believe that we're doing the right thing.\"  So far, the IOC's only response has been a tacit acknowledgment that they have received the documentation from the campaign.In a March press conference, spokesman Mark Adams said: \"I don't know to be honest, I think -- I believe -- we have. And as with all communications, it will be dealt with in due course, but it wasn't discussed at the Executive Board today. But trust us, it will be dealt with.\"Former junior world champion wrestler Sardar Pashaei says there's \"an element of risk\" for athletes outside the country to campaign against Iran's NOC.United for Navid is optimistic that the IOC will, ultimately, take action.Earlier this year, their pressure campaign led to the International Judo Federation banning the Iran team for four years, but they're hoping that the action can be urgent. In the letter dated March 25, Pashaei concludes with the line, \"We look forward to your timely response. Every day that passes without action results in more athlete mistreatment.\" Pashaei says there is evidence to suggest that the current head of Iran's Olympic Committee used to be a top-ranking member of Iran's intelligence agency, as detailed in a 2018 report from VOA/Radio Farda: \"He was involved in arresting and torturing people. He is going to the Olympic Games.\"\"Even a little change will make a big difference,\" concludes Jafargholizadeh. He and the other campaigners are confident that action from arguably the biggest governing body in world sport would force Iran to take politics out of sport and treat the athletes better.But it might take an Olympic ban to do it. \"A lot of people think we are against sport in Iran,\" he said, disputing that fact. \"They have to know we have been athletes. We have been part of that national team for years and years. We just want to say, 'Stop torturing people and killing them.'\"\"It's about our dignity,\" says Pashaei. \"We're not going to give up. We're going to go to the end.\"",

Initially, he says, integration proved challenging -- \"we didn't have a lot of interaction with people\" -- but playing football provided a place where he could be himself.    \"It was the first time where I had a smile on my face,\" adds Zinsou. \"You are working hard everywhere to be part of society, but on the pitch, was always the moment where the language didn't play any role.\"     Zinsou is speaking to CNN Sport from his home in Munich. He talks proudly of doing well at school, being married to his German wife and father to two children. \"Society ... gave me opportunities,\" he says.    Football still plays an important part in Zinsou's life -- he's Youth Coordinator for German football club T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc Munich.   Read More\"My mission in life is teaching football,\" says Zinsou as he reflects on his role of overseeing T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's various youth teams. He sees that mission as not just developing talented footballers, but also teaching them valuable life skills.T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc Munich is making waves in Germany both on the sporting and political sceneREAD: Your Country Needs You! What nationality means to the modern-day footballerA club for all   \"Preserving traditions, connecting cultures,\" is T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's motto.    The club's crest is a mix of the Turkish and Bavarian flags and is an ode to the club's founding fathers -- Turkish immigrants, for whom Bavaria was home, and who established T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc in 1975. \"I feel German, but I also love my Turkish roots,\" \u00dcnal Tosun, one of T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's leading player, tells CNN Sport.    The world's largest Turkish diaspora can be found in Germany and Tosun, who is the son of Turkish immigrants, is a physical embodiment of T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's past, present and future.\"We have over three million Turkish people in Germany ... and they can also identify with me. We are an idol club for many immigrant clubs,\" the sharply trimmed midfielder Tosun says.   Beaming with pride as he describes playing for T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc in his hometown of Munich, Tosun recounts receiving messages on Instagram from supporters in Turkey who he says \"look up to us.\"    \"We're not the typical local club,\" adds T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc CEO Max Kothny. \"If I look in the stands, there's so many people from so many cultures that it perfectly shows how the German culture is.\"The club's logo is half-half of the Turkish and Bavarian flags'The higher you go, the harder it gets'   T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's increased prominence -- both on and off the pitch -- owes itself, in part, to its rapid rise through the German football league structure.      Once an amateur team, T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc now plays in the 3. Liga -- Germany's third division, which like the country's top two leagues is fully professional.Remarkably T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc now stands just two promotions away from Germany's elite league -- the Bundesliga. According to Der Spiegel in March 2020, the club's budget was $2 million. T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc wouldn't confirm that figure, but did say it's \"in the lower half  in the table regarding the budgets in 3. Liga.\"\"The higher you go, the harder it gets,\" Kothny says with a wry smile.     Financial backing for the team has been largely provided by Hasan Kivran, a Turkish-born German, who previously played for the club, but is now a   successful business entrepreneur and T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's president. T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc wouldn't disclose how much Kivran has invested in the club.\"Being ambitious is not something bad -- it's something good,\" says Zinsou. \"Following your goals is something good. Taking smart decisions to reach this goal is something good. Working with passion is something good.\"    Kivran intimated he was going to step down in late 2020, but then had a rethink.   \"The main reasons that I changed my mind were those in charge of the company, a high level of fan support over the past two weeks and the prospect of a young talent center in southeast Munich,\" said Kivran in an interview with SPORT1 earlier this year.

FC Kaiserslautern and TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen --- that have previously played in the Bundesliga.That T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc now plays against such clubs -- 1. FC Kaiserslautern is a four-time winner of the German top-flight league  --  is testament to its rise through the German football ladder and its growing prominence.   \"We've been working here since the sixth division, which is absolutely incredible!\" Kothny says speaking to CNN Sport from a 15 square meter wooden portacabin that acts as the club's offices.      \"This is a total start-up mentality,\" he adds.    Kothny says plans are afoot to build the club's own academy and training facilities, but for now this football start-up is currently without a stadium to call home.   'Home' matches are divided between the Gr\u00fcnwalder and the iconic Munich Olympic Stadium, one of the venues for the 1972 Olympic Games.     Playing at the Olympic Stadium -- Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich's former home before the club moved to the Allianz Arena -- Kothny and Tosun say they have to pinch themselves at times to remember the journey they've been on.     \"Now we're playing in an arena which has 60,000 seats -- it's brilliant!\" Kothny exclaims.     \"There are so many good players who played there. They are so many important matches played there -- It's an honor,\" Tosun says.    T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc are playing some of their home matches this season at the iconic Olympic Stadium, venue of the 1972 Munich Olympics Remodel and rebuild     Perhaps what's surprising is not just that Kothny is spearheading operations from relatively modest surroundings but that he's doing so at the age of 24.    \"I think the future is on the young guns so I'm using it as an advantage,\" smiles Kothny.     \"My way of thinking is a little bit different to the rest of this business, which is pretty much the same for the last like 20 years,\" adds Kothny, explaining how each season \"we lose 80% of the roster\" to ensure T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc is competitive, given each promotion means the club will play against better teams.   Tosun joined the club in 2018, yet he's its longest-serving player and one of the few Turkish-German players left in the squad.\"We need to keep that factor in the history, in the portfolio of the club,\" says Zinsou.    \"I mean, if there were somewhere a Togolese team playing in a high level, I would be very interested in joining them as well,' Zinsou says jokingly.     \"Bavarian nowadays doesn't only mean that you have a German name [...] because the culture in Munich is mixed and it is rich.     \"Our main focus is clearly on the quality of the players with the target to bring them to the first team,\" added Zinsou.    Over the last few years there has been a huge turnover of players with the aim of achieving direct promotion to 3. Liga, which signals thet scale of T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's ambition.    \"That brought a lot of criticism also on us but this is how it worked. And I think the success proves that that this was the right way,\" says Kothny.Turkish-born German \u00dcnal Tosun is T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's longest-serving playerFighting fear through football     Nonetheless T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's ascent and the club's strong Turkish associations have drawn plenty of attention.    Inspiring and imaginative to some; divisive and disruptive to others, the club has become a target of  some far-right groups in Germany.   The extreme-right Der III. Weg -- The Third Way -- party, has been vocal about T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc.   According to the German Interior Ministry, the \"ideological statements of the party \"The III. Way\" are shaped from historical National Socialism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia.\"The far-right group's website in October showed a photo of two men, one holding The Third Way flag, displaying a \"T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc is not welcome\" banner outside Zwickau's stadium.Underneath the photo was the statement, \"Whether in Zwickau, Magdeburg or anywhere else: a Turkish team has no place in German football. The message is clear in Magdeburg and among fans of the FCM: T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc is not welcome.\"   \"We were unfortunately already prepared as far as we knew that things like that might happen,\" Kothny says. \"Sometimes it is a burden to have the Turkish flag in your logo.     \"A lot of [users on] social media are saying go back to Turkey or play in the Super Lig, but they are not realizing the background,\" adds Kothny, referring to the Turkish top-flight soccer division.He also recounts how small groups of far-right supporters gathered ahead of the away game against FSV Zwickau in October in Saxony. And when T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc played 1. FC Kaiserslautern in January, racist and xenophobic stickers and flyers were put up in the vicinity of the Fritz Walter Stadium.  The club's recent rapid rise has seen it targeted by far-right supportersBoth FSV Zwickau and 1. FC Kaiserslautern took to social media to stand in solidarity with T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc.   And Rainer Ke\u00dfler, chairman of the supervisory board of 1. FC Kaiserslautern, said in a statement: \"It is intolerable that right-wing groups try to misuse 1. FC Kaiserslautern's name, history, values and the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in the defense of inhuman slogans and ideologies. The FCK family stands for a multicultural society and expressly distances itself from nationalist ideas.\" Meanwhile, in another game against SV Waldhof Mannheim in April 2020, T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc player Yi-Young Park reportedly told the referee that he had been repeatedly racially insulted from the spectator area.Mannheim was subsequently fined $2,900  by the German Football Association (DFB) for the behavior of its fans.Kothny admits that messages at those games are \"not the most brutal thing that I've read on a banner. We get letters from people all around Germany here to our post box. We get emails which are brutal, which is really like far right things against the club.\"    Despite the wider political landscape, Kothny says he is adamant that the club has to maintain its neutrality.      \"We try not to give those people a platform [...] because then they get exactly what they want and this is awareness.    \"We try to always give the answer on the pitch because this is what counts in sports. As soon as we move in one political direction, this will not turn out well for us.\"     Integration    The philosophy of T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's youth setup -- the club has five youth teams, which Zinsou oversees, emphasizes the teaching of life as much as soccer skills.\"This is a package for life, it's not only for football,\" says Zinsou, as he talks about T\u00fcrkg\u00fcc\u00fc's various youth teams.   \"When you talk about integration, it's always on both parts. I need to go one step further and people will do a step in my direction so that we meet somewhere in the middle.\"     That message is one shared by Claudemir Jeronimo Barreto, known as Cacau, the Brazil-born former Germany international who played for T\u00fcrkg\u00fccu, and was integration officer for the DFB until January.While working for the DFB, Cacau was active in supporting the organization's work with refugees. According to the DFB, a scheme the association set up enabled 60,000 refugees to play football competitively in German.In the summer of 2019, Cacau also traveled to Ostritz at the invitation of the local football club and worked alongside Michael Kretschmer -- Minister-President of the Free State of Saxony -- against a right-wing extremist rallyTosun is hoping that he too can deliver a lasting legacy for generations to come.     \"I want to be a role model with my mentality. I want to be a role model for younger players and want to help [them] achieve the same goal that I achieve,\" as he reflected on his career and the example he wants to set.John Sinnott contributed to this report",

In a series of horrific images circulated on social media, innocent civilians were burned to death,\" the statement read.It did not say when the events took place or who was responsible.

        "content": "(CNN)In its hunt for content, Amazon Prime Video has turned to Nigeria, where it has secured key deals with studios that could shake up business in Africa's most prolific filmmaking hub.In recent months, the US giant has signed exclusive streaming agreements with Inkblot Productions and Anthill Studios -- which say the deals will fundamentally change the way they operate. Chinaza Onuzo, co-founder of Inkblot Productions, the studio behind domestic hits \"The Wedding Party\" and \"Up North,\" told CNN Business the company has signed a three-year licensing deal running through to 2024. The deal will see Inkblot's upcoming releases move onto Amazon's platform after showing in cinemas. \"This allows us to plan long-term,\" Onuzo says. Instead of film-by-film commissioning, the company is looking at possible intellectual property deals and franchise potential in Inkblot's existing titles. \"It has given us the opportunity to broaden the genres that we explore (and) given us the opportunity to work with a with a wider mix of filmmakers and talents,\" he adds.Anthill Studios produces original features and animation, releasing titles including \"Prophetess\" and \"Day of Destiny\" (the latter a co-production with Inkblot). Its films will also appear on Prime Video after a theatrical window, in a multi-year agreement.Read More\"We jumped at the deal,\" says founder and creative director Niyi Akinmolayan. \"We've practically doubled the size of our budgets ... we've become a lot more ambitious with the kind of stories we want to tell.\"What the deals will do for studios and cinemasNigeria's film industry, nicknamed \"Nollywood,\" produces thousands of movies every year and the country's entertainment and media market is projected to have double-digit growth between 2021 and 2025, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.Amazon's deal with Inkblot in December 2021 was the first of its kind to be struck between the streaming giant, which has 200 million subscribers, and an African studio. The Anthill deal followed a month later.Niyi Akinmolayan, founder of Anthill Studios, has directed some of Nollywood's highest-grossing films.Anthill's Akinmolayan, also a film director, says Amazon has been hands off so far. \"They're not telling you the kind of films to make,\" he says. \"They have zero input on creativity -- that's very appealing to any filmmaker.\"This is intentional, Amazon suggests. \"We believe that if Nollywood filmmakers focus on telling compelling, authentic, hyper-local and universally accessible stories -- that are grounded in the rich history, lived experiences and culture of Nigeria -- those stories will travel and will engage audiences around the world,\" said Ayanna Lonian, director of content acquisition and head of worldwide major studio licensing strategy at Amazon Prime Video, in an email to CNN.Lonian says the aim is to both diversify Prime Video's offering to its global audience and make the platform a more appealing product for Nigerian audiences.Netflix first original series from Nigeria drops highly anticipated trailerAmazon does not share subscriber figures for individual countries. Akinmolayan believes the Nigerian diaspora will be the primary beneficiary of the new content, explaining that awareness of the subscription service in Nigeria was not high. \"Very few people know that they can actually download the Amazon app and pay for it here,\" he says, \"that's because Amazon hasn't fully unleashed a plan for (the service).\"In the meantime, the deals could have an impact on domestic cinemas.Anthill's deal involves separate licenses for each film, the value of which is determined in part by the film's theatrical box office. This is an incentive to \"build cinema culture,\" Akinmolayan argues.\"Even though it feels to a lot of people that (streaming) platforms are coming to kill cinemas, in this case they will probably do the reverse and actually encourage people to make more for cinema,\" he says.Nancy Isime in Inkblot Productions' 2021 film \"Superstar.\"Onuzo says the share of box office for Nigerian films in domestic cinemas has risen in recent years, but foreign-made blockbusters still dominate receipts. He describes Inkblot's audience as \"both discerning and forgiving,\" given the huge budget disparities between homegrown titles and foreign movies.\"You have to deliver entertainment that is on a commensurate scale to what Hollywood films are doing,\" he explains. \"You can't meet the spectacle, but you can meet the truth: what it means to be a Nigerian; what it means for people to see themselves on screen ... That is something that, no matter what their budget is, (no) Hollywood title can compete (with).\" That said, \"when you're a Nigerian film and you're competing with a Marvel film, you can only pray,\" jokes Akinmolayan.The next chapterThe next stage of Prime Video's move into the African market is already underway. Lonian said discussions on developing and commissioning Amazon Originals -- series or films produced or co-produced by Amazon -- were taking place with producers and talent. \"We attended the African International Film Festival (AFRIFF) in November to start really meaningful engagement with the production industry in Africa,\" she added. \"Our message is that we're very much open for business.\"Akinmolayan behind the camera on a recent production.For Anthill and Inkblot, their immediate focus is on their upcoming slates. Onuzo says Inkblot has seven films in various stages from production, while Akinmolayan names crime drama \"The Man for the Job,\" a romantic comedy, and an \"X-Men\"-style superhero movie among Anthill's future titles.\"We are very excited, because we feel that there's a significant opportunity for Nigerian and African filmmakers to fully engage with the world over the next three to five years,\" says Onuzo. \"It's a good time to be an African content creator.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)With sirens blaring and explosions in the distance, it suddenly dawned on a fearful 20-year-old soccer player that he was in the middle of a warzone.What Amilcar Djau Codjovi, who plays for Ukrainian soccer club Vorskla Poltava, didn't know was that he would spend the next two days frantically traveling the length and breadth of the country trying to find an escape route from Ukraine.In the end, his safe passage into Hungary was only secured after a call from the Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107.\"February 22 was my birthday, and the very next night I heard gunshots,\" Djau Codjovi, who recently rounded out his teens, told CNN Sport.\"I told my team 'oh yeah those are fireworks' and then I went to sleep that night (February 23),\" at the club's accommodation.Read MoreHis slumber was abruptly broken in the early hours of the following morning after the alarm sounded around the city of Poltava, central Ukraine. He checked his phone and saw five missed calls from his parents as the invasion became a reality.Oleksandr Usyk: 'My soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor to my country,' says heavyweight champion after joining Ukrainian defense battalion\"That's when I start panicking,\" said Djau Codjovi, who was born in Spain to parents from the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau.\"I was like 'oh my days.' I opened my suitcase and put everything inside,\" he said.\"And then I went outside to see what's going on and all my teammates were saying they invaded Ukraine, it is actually happening.\"Earlier in February during a training camp in Turkey, Djau Codjovi said his parents, Amadeo and Sika Marie, as well as agent Soriebah Kajue, had pleaded with him not to go back to Ukraine with the drums of war beating louder.Djau Codjovi says Vorskla played down the threat or war -- describing them as Russian \"propaganda\" -- and assured the players that they had backup plans should they need to evacuate them at short notice. At the time, much of the world wasn't sure of Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, even as he massed troops at the border.As a young player with hopes of breaking into the first team ahead of the Ukrainian Premier League's resumption on February 25, Djau Codjovi opted to return in pursuit of his soccer dream.That dream quickly turned into a nightmare.Amilcar Djau Codjovi had been playing for Vorskla Poltava in Ukraine prior to the Russian invasion. READ: Ukraine and Benfica star tears up after receiving standing ovation'Everyone for themselves'When the Russians started attacking Kharkiv, which is 160 kilometers away from Vorskla, Djau Codjovi says he was told by his coach Iurii Maksymov that he should wait at the club's accommodation while the player's travel plans were being arranged.But Djau Codjovi soon realized that he was on his own after he said some of his teammates, who were already plotting their way out, told him it was a case of \"everyone for themselves.\"CNN has contacted Vorskla and Maksymov for comment on Djau Codjovi's version of events but did not get a response at the time of publishing.Loaded with water, chips and chocolate for the 1,500 kilometer journey, a group of 10 players and their families, including a toddler, hit the road unsure of what would await them.After initially deciding to drive to the Polish border, they were informed of long lines of traffic and waiting times, so the traveling party headed towards the Hungarian border.Petrol was scarce, the roads were full of potholes, and travel at night was challenging as explosions and gunfire could be heard.Then disaster struck when one of the cars had a flat tire.JUST WATCHEDUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUkrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasion 03:21\"We had to stop,\" Djau Codjovi said. \"And then you could see the big tanks going past and I was scared, because I thought it was Russian troops.\"\"It was like 5 a.m. and nobody was going to stop and help.\"In fact the tanks rolling by were the Ukrainian army, according to Djau Codjovi, but that did little to reassure him as he was concerned that Russian troops could open fire on them and his party would be caught in the crossfire.After a delay of several hours and finally organizing a spare wheel, they were back on the road, before a short pitstop to sleep and get their energy back.On day two of their journey, they boarded a minivan, optimistically heading to the Hungarian border where they would be dropped off.Freedom in sight\"After driving 10 hours to the border, we get there. We are obviously happy that we are finally here, but we got there and they say, 'no, you can't go through walking, you need a vehicle,\" said Djau Codjovi, with frustration etched across his face.\"We were literally stranded outside in the cold, it was freezing. It's like a 20-second ride ... some people were actually bringing cars there and empty minivans but charging people ... $1,600 per person. At that point I just gave up.\"READ: Ukraine to send full delegation to 2022 Winter ParalympicsDjau-Codjovi managed to safely escape Ukraine via Hungary. When it seemed as if all hope was lost, help came from an unlikely source -- the Croatian Prime Minister Plenkovi\u0107.\"My Croatian teammate Ivan Pe\u0161i\u0107 was calling his embassy, while we sat down and were just giving up,\" said Djau Codjovi.\"Then he called out to us -- 'come quick, come quick' -- so all the group we were together .... and the Prime Minister of Croatia, he called the embassy in Kyiv and they contacted the border and then they let us through.\"CNN has contacted the Croatian government and messaged Pe\u0161ic on Instagram and on his email for further comment but didn't receive a reply at the time of publishing.Once in Hungary, Djau Codjovi contacted his family to let them know he was safe and enjoyed his first hot meal in days while in Budapest.\"It was just the best McDonalds I've ever had in my life. It tasted so nice,\" he said.Tennis star Elina Svitolina says all prize money she wins at Monterrey Open will go to Ukrainian armyHowever, that meal didn't compare to his mom's home cooking on his arrival in Manchester, England, when she made him his favorite Ivorian food four long days after he embarked on his great escape.\"I just felt good, but more for my family because I know my parents were not sleeping,\" he added.Djau Codjovi has since vowed he won't return to Ukraine.\"Even when the war finishes, I don't think football will be the same. To recover from a war doesn't take a couple of years, it takes a lot of time,\" he said.Djau Codjovi's hopes of playing in European competition for Vorskla Poltava might be over, but he's keen to restart his career in Spain or England -- given the opportunity.He was born in Spain and lived there for 15 years before his family relocated to England. He had trials with Premier League teams Liverpool and Aston Villa, before eventually joining Morecambe where he made the first-team bench several times as a 16-year-old, though he ultimately failed to earn a pro deal there.He joined Vorskla Poltava in the summer of 2020 but sustained a knee injury which meant he had to return to the UK for treatment. However, this season saw him break into the first team, making seven appearances before the winter break and scoring a memorable goal against Lviv.If his dream of being a top soccer player is deferred for now, the 20-year-old has plenty of time on his side. More importantly, he's alive.",
