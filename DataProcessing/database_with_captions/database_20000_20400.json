        "content": "London (CNN)After months of speculation, attempts to oust her and parliamentary defeats, the fate of Theresa May is finally sealed. But although there is clarity about her political career -- now she has announced she will resign on June 7 and set the timetable to elect a new Prime Minister -- the future of the Conservative Party, the government and the UK is far from clear. All of this hinges now on who will be elected as May's successor and that person's position on Brexit.Brexit failure forces British PM Theresa May to announce resignationThe frontrunner is the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, the clear favorite among Conservative members who will ultimately elect a new leader -- but they'll only do so once two candidates are put forward for a runoff after a knockout contest by Tory lawmakers.That contest will formally start after May resigns on June 7, although the race has already unofficially begun. Until then, May has two weeks to perform her duties as Prime Minister, including a major state visit by US President Donald Trump and his family in the first week of June, which will take in a State Banquet with the Queen, as well as D-Day commemorations. Theresa May will still be Prime Minister when Donald Trump makes his state visit to London.Even though May's legacy, as the PM who failed to deliver Brexit, is already fixed, these final days will allow her to finesse that departure with some dignity.Read MoreIn contrast to those ceremonial matters of state, a far dirtier, messier business is underway in Westminster: Conservative lawmakers fighting each other to be the next PM. Having been at each other's throats over Brexit, a leadership contest will likely deepen those divisions. The task for the new leader is to bring the party together again.A legacy of failure: Theresa May was a disaster as Prime MinisterJohnson may have huge support among party grassroots, but his popularity among Tory MPs is more muted. According to the website conservativehome.com, the current Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has the most supporters among MPs: 27, compared to 19 for Johnson. Hunt was instrumental in hastening May's departure by holding private talks with her on Thursday -- although he did not directly tell her to quit, he said she had no hope of passing her new compromise Brexit deal put forward earlier this week. The new deal had been already widely criticized by lawmakers from all parties, including those normally loyal to the Prime Minister. After that, there was no way back for May.Runners and ridersWhile Johnson and Hunt may be the frontrunners, the contest is wide open, with more than 15 MPs having either already declared or planning to. In the Cabinet, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a leading figure in the 2016 campaign to leave the EU but who has been loyal to May in trying to get her original withdrawal deal through the Commons, could bring together the different wings of the party. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is frontrunner to be the next Conservative leader.Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who voted Remain but has tacked towards the Brexiteer wing in the past three years, and Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, a prominent Leave campaigner, are all strong contenders. Dominic Raab, who resigned as May's second Brexit Secretary last autumn because he could not support the withdrawal agreement that he played a part in agreeing with Brussels, is admired by Brexiteer lawmakers.Among this wide field of contenders could stand a man or woman who could stop Johnson from making it through to the final run-off among party members. If that does not happen, the premiership is likely to be Johnson's. Brexit talks collapse after Theresa May and Labour Party fail to reach dealThis would be an extraordinary turnaround for a man whose record as Foreign Secretary, before he resigned last July, was patchy at best: he has been blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and often left diplomats and officials bemused or aghast while on foreign excursions. Last August, weeks after his resignation, Johnson caused controversy by comparing Muslim women who wear face veils to letterboxes. It is this record which makes some of his Tory colleagues -- not to mention politicians across Westminster - deeply uneasy.Brexit -- what next?What's more, there are fears that the Conservative Party will elect a Brexiteer Prime Minister who would be happy for the UK to leave the EU without a deal -- something May tried to stop. Some Brexiteer candidates may even push for a \"managed no deal,\" arguing that May had been too soft on Brexit. While there is no majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal Brexit, because of the fears over the economic damage this could bring, this outcome will happen by default if there is no formal deal passed by October 31, the new Brexit date. Even though the prime minister will change, the numbers in Parliament will not -- unless the new leader calls a snap election during his or her honeymoon period. And beyond Westminster, it's not going to be an easy feat to change the existing withdrawal agreement without the approval of the EU. The EU Commission's official Twitter account tweeted on Friday: \"The European Council stated on 10 April 2019 that there can be 'no opening of the Withdrawal Agreement'. It is the best and only deal possible.\" The new prime minister will find dealing with an intransigent Brussels as difficult as his or her predecessor experienced.May's successor, of whatever strand of Conservatism or stance on Brexit, will still have to get a deal through the Commons. That's a huge task. For Westminster and for the UK, there are still months of uncertainty ahead.",

I feel the essence of life is to say that at the end of my life I can really be satisfied with what I've achieved, because you've lived your life to the full.\"What I mean is you've absorbed a great deal, faced up to and learned from others, and to impart your knowledge to others and take from others too.

But the Champions League crown has always eluded him.A stunning Manchester United comeback put paid to Buffon and PSG's hopes in Europe's premier competition earlier this year. Last season, Buffon was sent off after being enraged by a late penalty call from English referee Michael Oliver in the quarter-final match between Juventus and Real Madrid.Buffon later said that Oliver had a \"garbage bin\" for a heart while his actions earned him three game ban from UEFA, European football's governing body.JUST WATCHEDBuffon and his love for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbachReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBuffon and his love for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 02:14Such raw emotion has sometimes led Buffon to be criticized.

But I've noticed that, in the long run, time has treated me kindly and I'm liked generally speaking, by people for who I am.\"Buffon has certainly been appreciated in the French capital as PSG has racked up its sixth title in seven years.Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosAnd he says he has even been forgiven for his role in defeating France in the 2006 World Cup final. \"I believe they (Parisians) have granted me the biggest pardon that a nation could ever grant to an adversary,\" he jokes.The passage of time and the fact that France are current world champions may have something to do with that.But if Buffon, is looking to replicate the success of a national team to bolster his own managerial ambitions, he could do worse than to learn from the country he currently calls home.",

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May finally gave in to the intense political pressure over her failure to secure Britain's withdrawal from the European Union, announcing her resignation in an emotional address to the nation on Friday.Standing at a lectern in Downing Street, May said she deeply regretted not being able to deliver Brexit, the issue that brought her to power in 2016 and which consumed her premiership in the three years since.May said she would quit as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7, but would stay on as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen. That process will be completed by the end of July, her party said.In her speech, May said she had done everything she could to convince Members of Parliament (MPs) to back her thrice-rejected Brexit deal, but acknowledged that she had failed.Live updates: Theresa May announces resignation amid Brexit turmoil\"I tried three times. I believe it was right to persevere, even when the odds against success seemed high. But it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new Prime Minister to lead that effort,\" she said. Read More\"It is, and will always remain, a matter of deep regret to me that I have not been able to deliver Brexit.\"May said it would be down to her successor to find consensus where she could not, and urged all sides to compromise. \"I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold -- the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last,\" May said, her voice cracking with emotion. \"I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love,\" she said, bursting into tears as she left the lectern and walked back into Number 10. Cabinet withdrew supportMay breaks down during her statement outside 10 Downing Street on Friday. May was forced into making Friday's announcement after losing the support of her Cabinet, many of whom were fed up with the ongoing turmoil over Brexit.The last straw for Cabinet ministers appears to have been the latest version of May's Brexit plan, which she unveiled on Tuesday. In an attempt to win over opposition lawmakers, May offered the House of Commons the chance to vote on a second referendum -- a concession that was bitterly opposed by some senior members of her government.Her fate was sealed by the leadership of the 1922 Committee -- which represents the interests of rank-and-file lawmakers in May's Conservative Party -- who threatened to change party rules to allow a vote of no-confidence. May survived an earlier confidence vote in December last year, and under current rules was immune to challenge for another year. Leadership race beginsBoris Johnson is a leading candidate to replace May.May's announcement sets off a frantic race to succeed her. Conservative MPs will vote  on their preferred candidates by the end of June, the party said. The top two choices will then be put before the wider party membership who will choose the leader by the time Parliament breaks for summer recess on July 20. The winner will then replace May as Prime Minister.One leading candidate is Boris Johnson, the wily former Foreign Secretary who commands significant support among grassroots members of the party.Johnson has bitterly opposed the withdrawal deal that May negotiated with the EU, and resigned from her Cabinet over it. On Friday, he described May's statement as \"dignified\" and said \"it is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.\"Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbenchers, said he was standing down from his position in order to consider a leadership bid.Tributes from colleaguesA number of May's Cabinet members, including potential candidates in the race to replace her, paid their tributes on Twitter. Amber Rudd, who serves as Work and Pensions Secretary, praised May's \"great courage,\" while Home Secretary Sajid Javid said no one had \"a greater sense of public duty than the Prime Minister.\" Boris Johnson is frontrunner for PM but he'll face the same Brexit nightmareProminent Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom, who resigned as Leader of the House of Commons on Wednesday, said May's speech illustrated \"her total commitment to country and duty.\" But it's unclear whether the next Prime Minister will have any luck reopening May's withdrawal deal, which Brussels has insisted is locked down. May's successor will face the same deadlocked House of Commons, which has repeatedly rejected her plan but failed to vote in favor of any kind of alternative. That may raise the prospect of a new Conservative leader calling a general election in an attempt to break the impasse. UK opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn jumped at the prospect after May's speech, tweeting: \"Whoever becomes the new Tory leader must let the people decide our country's future, through an immediate General Election.\"Some pro-Remain politicians expressed concern that a Brexiteer could soon take May's place and push Britain towards a hard Brexit.\"The prospect of an even more hardline Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning,\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter. European reactionEuropean leaders responded warily to the news. Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker encouraged Britain to accept May's Brexit deal during an interview with CNN on Wednesday, adding that it was more important to \"to find an agreement\" rather than replace the Prime Minister. A legacy of failure: Theresa May was a disaster as Prime MinisterBy Friday, a European Commission spokesperson said May's speech left Juncker \"without personal joy.\"  \"Theresa May is a woman of courage for whom he has great respect,\" the spokesperson said.French President Emmanuel Macron sent May a personal message expressing his support and gratitude, an Elysee Palace spokesperson told CNN.The Elysee praised Theresa May's \"courageous\" efforts to implement Brexit \"in interest of her country and being respectful of her European partners\".\"France stands ready to work with the future British Prime Minister on the entirety of European and bilateral issues\", the Elysee message said.The message ended with a reminder that the proper functioning of the EU was the priority and \"that rejection votes without alternative project lead to stalemates.\"CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Luke McGee and Sarah Dean contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The president of French football champion Paris Saint-Germain has been charged by Parisian prosecutors with corruption in relation to a $3.5 million payment over the organization of the World Athletics Championships in Qatar, a judiciary source told CNN Thursday.Nasser Al-Khelaifi became chief executive of Paris Saint-Germain in 2011, the free-spending Ligue 1 club which is owned by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), the country's sovereign wealth fund.In recent years Qatar, which will host the 2022 World Cup, has pursued an ambitious strategy in using sport to put the Middle Eastern country on the map.In a statement sent to CNN Sport, Al-Khelaifi's lawyer, Francis Szpiner, said the payments were \"perfectly traced\" and that the PSG chief was not involved in the money transfer.According to Al-Khelaifi's legal team, the PSG chief executive was \"placed under the status of assisted witness\" in March and charged on May 16 over a $3.5 million payment made in 2011 between two companies -- Oryx and Pamodzi Sport Consulting.Read MoreOryx Qatar Sports Investments, an investment fund linked to QSI, did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The manager of Pamodzi is Papa Massata Diack, who in 2016 was described by Interpol as a former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) consultant when it issued a red notice at France's request.\"Papa Massata Diack is wanted by France on charges of complicity in receiving bribes, aggravated money-laundering, and conspiracy in an organized group to invest, conceal or convert the proceeds of active corruption,\" said Interpol. The 2016 red notice is in relation to an anti-doping case.Prior to the red notice being issued, Diack told the BBC: \"There was no extortion of funds from any athlete. I've never met any athlete, any agent, any person in the world ... asking to have a payment.\"Diack is the son of former IAAF president Lamine Diack, who is reportedly barred from leaving France.The French judiciary source confirmed that Lamine Diack was charged with passive corruption on March 27. And recently, there was a prosecution closing speech asking Diack to be sent in front of the magistrate's court, and it's from this matter that he's barred from leaving France. Lamine Diack did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.The Diacks have been influential powerbrokers in the world of sport.

        "content": "(CNN)Aged 26, Julie Ertz already knows what it is like to win a World Cup. The defensive midfielder, the second-youngest member of the US squad in 2015, can talk about the joy of winning the biggest prize in women's soccer, of how onerous a month-long tournament can be and how becoming a world champion \"makes you hungry for more.\" This summer she will aim to help her country to a successful defense of the title won four years ago though, she admits, being considered one of the veterans in Jill Ellis' squad, now that stalwarts like Abby Wambach, Hope Solo and Christie Pearce have since departed, is \"weird.\" After a period of adjustment, the low point coming in a quarterfinal defeat by Sweden at the Rio Olympics, US preparations have fallen into place over the last 12 months. The team went through 2018 unbeaten -- 17 wins and two draws cementing its position at the top of the world rankings and Ellis' squad are favorites for what would be a fourth title for the US. \"It's going to be such an amazing tournament,\" Ertz tells CNN Sport. \"I can't even pick one [favorite]. There are going to be so many great teams and so many great games.\"Ertz has been converted from a central defender to a defensive midfielder for Ellis' side.READ: US Soccer hero's mission to empower womenRead MoreThe summer's World Cup, which begins June 7, is the biggest major all-female sporting event to be held since the Me Too movement swept across the globe. The goalposts have already moved, Ertz says. In her seven years in the international set-up, much has change in the women's game. It is respected more, she says, while fans are more numerous and sponsors slightly easier to come by. \"The growth and empowerment of women in general has shifted in our culture and, on top of that, the respect that has been continued to women's sport in general,\" says the Chicago Red Stars player. \"Every World Cup I feel the fan base and the viewers have increased. The empowerment of women, together and collectively, is a powerful thing. We just want to prove what women's soccer is -- how much we're growing it, how much it continues to grow. We go into every game like that. \"Women's sport in general, all countries and federations, want to do that. Individually, each girl wants to prove that. It's important to us.\"READ: Fighting for equality 'in a lonely world'Going viral in a 'crazy' yearIt has been quite the 12 months for Ertz. On January 21, 2018, while she was preparing to take on Denmark in San Diego, her husband, Zach, was nearly 2,700 miles away in Philadelphia preparing for a place in Super Bowl LII.Once her match had finished, Ertz asked for the result of the Philadelphia Eagles' match and tearfully celebrated on learning her husband would be competing in his sport's biggest spectacle. A clip of the moment went viral and has been viewed over a million times on YouTube alone. Ever since, the pair have been described in many a headline as sport's power couple. It is a moniker Ertz is happy with.  Zach and Julie Ertz attend The 2018 ESPYS in 2018.\"It's sweet and endearing, for sure,\" she says. \"Zach and I work really hard so if anyone supports us as individuals or collectively as athletes we're grateful. It was a crazy and a whirlwind of a year, but we're thankful for it as well.\"Zach went on to score in the Super Bowl as the Eagles beat the New England Patriots in 2018, but there are challenges, of course, to being a high-achieving sporting couple, especially when one plays for a team in Chicago and the other is based in Philadelphia. \"We laugh that we have a relationship with our phones,\" says Ertz of the couple's schedule.\"We FaceTime, text. He understands and supports me, and we just try to make the most of the time we have together.\"Zach Ertz scoring a touchdown in the fourth quarter of last year's Super Bowl.Another test comes when two ultra competitive people challenge each other to a game of chess or cards. The pair keep a record of results in a book so there is evidence when scores are disputed. \"Sometimes you have to step back and cool off a bit,\" Ertz jokes. There are plenty of positives, Ertz stresses, in negotiating life with a partner who is also playing sport at the highest level. \"I've learned a lot from Zach and I think he'd say the same for me,\" she says. \"He's very routine and detailed, which has helped me push myself and assess where I'm at and where I want to be. He's very driven and I love that about him. \"I think he says he's learned about being positive. My attitude is a bit more positive, which I think is important, especially in terms of the highs and lows of sport. I could go on and on -- training together has been the best because we support each other. All the stuff you have to do as an athlete we do together.\"READ: France 2019 -- What you need to knowFaith helps keep perspectiveHelping the couple, who met at college, through the highs and lows of their sporting careers is their faith. It has, says Ertz, been a \"big shift in our lives.\"\"Our relationship with Jesus really did change our life and our view,\" says Ertz, who with her husband started the Ertz Family Foundation last summer to help young children in Haiti, Philadelphia and the Bay Area in California.

        "content": "(CNN)Hundreds of EU citizens living in Britain have been turned away at polling stations as they attempted to vote in the European elections on Thursday, campaigners say.Voters reported confusion with the process for participation in the elections, failings by local councils, and names being crossed off voting lists at polling stations. Hours after the polls opened, the hashtag #DeniedMyVote began to trend on Twitter as European nationals began reporting they had been turned away. Campaigners fear the number of EU nationals denied a vote will be in the thousands by the time polls close on Thursday evening. Maike Bohn, the co-founder of the3million, a campaign group which represents EU nationals living in the UK, told CNN the situation reflects \"a serious democratic deficit\" on the part of British authorities.Read MoreEverything you need to know about the European electionsEU nationals who live in the UK can participate in European elections but must make a written declaration, known as a UC1/EC6 form, that guarantees they will not vote in their home country. It appears that the unplanned delay to the Brexit process has contributed to the confusion. Britain's participation in the 2019 European elections was only confirmed last month, after the country's failure to agree a deal to leave the EU by the original March 29 deadline.Campaigners accuse British authorities of failing to inform EU citizens that they had to complete an extra step to guarantee their right to vote.A number of Members of Parliament (MPs) expressed alarm over the reports. Joanna Cherry of the Scottish National Party said on Twitter: \"There's something very rotten at the heart of British politics when EU citizens resident here are being denied their right to vote.\"The Labour MP and shadow foreign minister Catherine West called it a \"national scandal.\"\"Reports are flooding in of EU nationals being denied the right to vote in today's elections, despite the fact most of them were registered to vote in local elections that took place a few weeks ago. I was granted an urgent question back in April, at which I alerted the government to this problem -- they refused to act.\"Three EU nationals who spoke to CNN told of confusion over the process for participating in the poll. Swedish citizen Lina Dencik, who lives in southwestern city of Bristol, told CNN that she was turned away from the polling booth because the documentation had not reached her before the May 7 voter registration deadline for EU citizens.  \"When I went to the polling station this morning, my name had been crossed out on the list and I was told I was not eligible to vote as a European citizen,\" she said. \"I challenged this and the patrolling officer provided me with an emergency number to call. I called this number and was told that a form to declare that I would not be voting in Sweden had not been sent out in time and that I am therefore not able to vote.\"Early morning visit to cast my vote only to have it disenfranchised because my declaration that I wouldn't be voting in Sweden (my country of citizenship) hadn't been processed in time. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #EuElection2019 pic.twitter.com/kG3PpRaVkD\u2014 Lina Dencik (@LinaDencik) May 23, 2019\n\nEmeline Mimie Morin, a French national who lectures at the University of Stirling in central Scotland, who has lived in the UK for 10 years, said her inability to vote amounted to \"disenfranchisement.\" She had also called a helpline number provided, she said. \"The woman on the phone did see me as registered and put me on hold for a while. After a few minutes she explained that there was a form I should have filled in as a EU citizen but hadn't, and there was nothing they could do,\"  she said.\"I asked where this form was so that I could fill it and this would not happen again. She did not answer but dismissed my question, staring that there was no point, the form was only for European elections and it was unlikely we would need it again with Brexit.\" The3Million blames Britain's Electoral Commission and the government for mishandling the issue.In a letter sent to the head of the commission, it said that the commission had reneged on a 2014 promise to send the form to all registered EU citizens. It also complained of vague and confusing information that did not make it clear that EU citizens had to complete an extra step to register.  \"We maintain that the Electoral Commission's lack of clear guidance has led to an inconsistent approach by local authorities to the registration process for EU27 citizens,\" the letter added.  Europe will 'die from inside' if far-right populists triumph, top EU figure saysA spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said it  had recommended changes to the process but said it was powerless to act without changes to the law. \"The process for EU citizens could be improved and we made recommendations to improve the process following the 2014 European Parliamentary election,\" the spokesperson said. But those improvements were \"reliant on changes to electoral law, which can only be taken forward by government and Parliament.\"The spokesperson suggested the commission not have time to follow up on its recommendations as the UK government only confirmed it would be taking part in the European elections on May 7.\"I should point out that our recommendations were made before the EU referendum. After the referendum, the UK government was clear that the European Parliamentary elections in 2019 would not take place.\"European elections are a pivotal moment for voters to choose between unity and disruptionThe spokesperson said that the information about the form could be downloaded from its website, adding that it had also advised council electoral registration officers to identify European voters and send them the form. Bohn maintained that while the time frame was tight, the commission could clearly see the problem brewing.\"But then they could have run a social media campaign, or tweet a link to the document, they could also email all electoral officers and say please contact EU citizens or please consider extending the deadline,\" she said. \"What you have in theory is 3 million people disenfranchised,\" Bohn told CNN. \"A lot of people [EU citizens living in the UK] proactively found out what to do, but hundreds or thousands of people simply would not have known it and can you blame them?\"",

During this year's Ice Hockey World Championships, Rikard Gr\u00f6nborg is doubling up as coach of the Swedish national team and a 24/7 news reporter.\u00a0He won't, however, be stepping anywhere near the newsroom cameras during the tournament. That happened several weeks ago when Gr\u00f6nborg posed to become the world's first virtual sports anchor reporting on all the action unfolding in Slovakia. Read MoreThe Swedish hockey team's main sponsor Svenska Spel --  a state-owned company operating in Sweden's regulated gambling market -- is behind the idea.In November last year, China's state news agency debuted the first ever 24/7 virtual anchor, but Gr\u00f6nborg's digital clone is the first with a sole focus on sport. The real Rikard Gr\u00f6nborg (right) with the virtual Rikard Gr\u00f6nborg.From the first game on May 10 right up until the final on May 26, the Swedish language live stream will deliver 408 hours of news, interviews, and analysis around the world championships to fans back home.\"We spent hours filming myself in different positions and situations,\" Gr\u00f6nborg, who led Sweden to back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, tells CNN Sport of the painstaking process to create his virtual duplicate. \"Then we recorded my voice saying all kinds of different, very, very weird sentences that didn't really make sense when I recorded it ... The filming was four or five hours and I think recording of my voice saying different sentences was at least three plus hours.\"I think the end product is pretty good and it's obviously built an interest with the fans out there that want to follow our team in the world championships.\"On top of having Gr\u00f6nborg front the news stream, the concept appeals to fans by drawing upon 20 years of ice hockey data to deliver stats and predict results. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosDespite suffering defeats by the Czech Republic and Russia -- the former being Sweden's first defeat for 17 games in the world championships -- Gr\u00f6nborg's side defeated Italy, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Latvia to set up a quarterfinal clash against Finland.Sweden's players celebrate next to a fan during a 5-4 victory over Latvia.The coach is confident his team can go the distance for a third consecutive tournament.  \"Obviously we're still going for gold,\" he says. \"We've been having great success over the last couple of years doing that. I think we definitely have a team among other great hockey nations here. We have a very good shot of going all the way.\"Recent years have seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, with the media industry just one of many examples of AI being deployed in the place of humans. A 2019 study by the Brookings Institute estimated that 25 percent of jobs in the US are at high risk of being replaced by AI and automation.  On the website willrobotostakemyjob.com -- which evaluates the likelihood of professions being replaced by AI and robots -- \"reporters and correspondents\" returns an 11 percent chance of losing its human touch, while \"radio and television announcers\" gives 10 percent.Gr\u00f6nborg's voice is recorded for the virtual reality broadcast.So has the virtual Rikard Gr\u00f6nborg got CNN's sports anchors fearing for their future?\"In my experience, viewers often want a personality they can trust to bring them their sports news or sports coverage,\" says CNN World Sport anchor Alex Thomas, \"someone genuine and knowledgeable and somebody they can relate to. \"I think, for now, that's still a human rather than a virtual anchor.\"I have always worked with the philosophy that it's not about me, it's about the consumer experience. So, if in the future a virtual anchor or AI robot is better at presenting the sport than an actual person, then I wouldn't have a problem with it.\"The immediate future for anchors and reporters seems safe, then. \"At the moment I don't see such developments as a threat to most TV anchors, because there is much more to sports presenting than simply reading the results,\" Neil Thurman, a professor of communication at LMU Munich, tells CNN. \"Virtual anchors also face the 'uncanny valley' effect -- whereby viewers are uncomfortable with virtual presenters that are almost, but not quite, human. \"I see more potential for automation in sports-news videos in so-called text-to-video technology. This technology can produce short news videos from text stories, automatically choosing clips and pictures to match the story, which is told using captions or a computer-generated voice. Captions in particular avoid the 'uncanny valley' effect.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Citizens from 28 countries will cast their votes in European parliamentary elections this week in what many politicians say could be one of the bloc's most pivotal moments.The election will determine the future direction of the European Union itself as it confronts the threat of nationalists and populists across the continent, and as the drawn-out Brexit process continues to dominate the political agenda.Around 350 million people across the EU are eligible to cast ballots for the 751 members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who pass hundreds of laws each year -- from how many hours employees work, to the quality of air that citizens breathe, and even data privacy. While historically turnout has been relatively low, this year analysts say voters are much more engaged with the poll, which runs from May 23 to 26. As a result, Europe's Parliament is expected to undergo a major shake-up.Members of the European Parliament take part in a session in Strasbourg in 2018.\nPopulists expected to make big gainsRead MoreParliament's largest groups, the center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) -- who have long enjoyed a joint majority in Parliament -- are expected to lose a number of seats with euroskeptic and populist movements tipped to make big gains this year.Everything you need to know about the European electionsSenior research fellow Camino Mortera-Martinez from the Center for European Reform (CER) argues that while those ascendant political groups may not dominate Parliament, their presence will be felt as they apply pressure and complicate EU decision-making.\"Euroskeptics and populists are going to grow exponentially this time,\" she says. \"You're going to have a much more divided Parliament. It's going to be more difficult to find compromises.\"Mortera-Martinez says there was always going to be a surge in populist parties following the migration crisis, eurozone woes and various terrorist attacks across the continent. JUST WATCHEDEuropean Union tries to protect election from fake newsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEuropean Union tries to protect election from fake news 02:20In April Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini -- who has spearheaded a series of anti-immigrant policies -- launched what amounted to a \"Make Europe Great Again\" campaign in an attempt to unite far-right political parties across the continent ahead of the  elections. The newly formed alliance hopes to form a weighty bloc in Parliament -- the third largest, Marine Le Pen of France's National Rally has predicted.What does the European Parliament actually do? One clue lies in your phone billAccording to Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the UK-based University of Kent, many European populists believe they will be able to influence Europe from the inside out.Goodwin previously told CNN that populists will be a \"disruptive political force\" and will most likely push \"for the return of powers to nation states, stronger border security, more help with dealing with refugees and probably more democratic and transparent institutions.\"JUST WATCHEDItaly's Salvini pushes for pre-Maastricht EU rulesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHItaly's Salvini pushes for pre-Maastricht EU rules 04:07However, Mortera-Martinez suggests that populists, nationalist and euroskeptic parties will ultimately struggle to work together \"so their influence will diminish a lot because of the lack of coordination.\"In a fragmented Parliament, Europe's Greens -- on course for their best-ever showing -- could find themselves wielding more power. With support for mainstream parties declining, the votes of their projected 57 or more MEPs may well be key to any moderate, pro-EU alliance. The elections that weren't supposed to involve the UKBrexit is also another major factor this year. The UK was scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, but missed that deadline and another in April, meaning it is now obliged to take part in elections. If Brexit does occur soon though, British MEPs won't take up their seats.  Europe's populist nightmare won't end with Brexit\"I think this whole Brexit uncertainty will not only have a role in the elections but also in the priorities of the next commission,\" Mortera-Martinez says.\"Within the next five years the question of how to accommodate the UK -- in, and out of Europe -- is going to take up a lot of time for the leaders of the European Commission.\"It's also an opportunity for remainers and leavers to express their frustrations, Agata Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska, also a senior research fellow at the CER, said in a statement.\"Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives, which had hoped to avoid holding these elections, are facing a drubbing at the hands of Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party,\" she noted, adding that parties pushing to prevent Brexit are \"likely to perform well and keep up the pressure for another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.\"\"If anything, these European elections will confirm that the UK remains as divided over Europe as ever,\" Gosty\u0144ska-Jakubowska added.Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped that the UK would avoid holding these elections.While MEPs have previously struggled to communicate to voters what they actually do at the complex institution, Mortera-Martinez says Europeans are taking a greater interest in the elections this time around.\"Back in 2014 no one thought about the European Union much,\" she says.But this year \"so many people actually know the elections are happening,\" she says, \"and that there is something at stake.\"This story has been updated to correct the number of eligible EU voters.",

READ: Racism in football -- 'Worst thing you can do is leave the pitch,' says MidoREAD: Fatma Samoura -- 'Facelift' of FIFA's male hierarchy is 'ongoing''There are idiots in life'Born in Senegal, Samoura became the first woman, and the first non-European, to hold an executive post at FIFA.Since taking office in June 2016, the 56-year-old has embarked on strategy to help clean up world football's governing body and tackle the biggest issues facing the sport. When it comes to racism, the former UN diplomat knows there is plenty of work to be done. Valencia fans condemned after video shows Nazi salutes and monkey gestures\"Every single incident now is taking a bigger amplitude, which is normal,\" she said.\"There are idiots in the life. There are people who think that they want a world where everybody is the same and I think this is totally wrong.\"Governing bodies like FIFA and UEFA, which governs European football, are also coming under greater scrutiny from high-profile players calling for tougher sanctions for racist incidents.In particular, England and Manchester City star Raheem Sterling has become an unofficial spokesperson in the fight against racism and has criticized the game for not getting to grips with the issue. Speaking at the Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival in New York Tuesday, Sterling argued that T-shirts and social media posts were no longer enough. \"If you know your team is going to get deducted nine points, you are not going to say these racist remarks even though you shouldn't have it in your head,\" he said.

READ: Anthony Joshua on combating racism -- 'Our parents' generation has been sleeping''Zero tolerance' As part of its \"zero tolerance\" approach to racism, FIFA launched the \"three-step procedure\" in 2017 which gives referees permission to stop, suspend or abandon games due to racist chanting within the stadium. However, football's governing bodies have faced questions as to whether post-match sanctions are tough enough when there have been discrimination incidents. For example, Montenegro was fined 20,000 euros ($22,337) by UEFA and ordered to play its next home game behind closed doors after its fans abused Sterling and his England teammates. \"It's a shame on society for people to accept it,\" Samoura said, explaining the challenges those fighting racism face. \"More and more people think that having people behaving non-sportingly is something that we, as a society, can accept and this should not be the case.\"JUST WATCHEDMido on tackling racism in football ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMido on tackling racism in football  01:59READ: Chelsea and New England Revolution team up to blow 'final whistle on hate''Evil in society'But combating discrimination through sanctions alone will not bring a solution to this issue, says Samoura.\"It's the whole sports world that should be fighting racism,\" she said. \"On the pitch, through communications, through education, through demonstrations, through sanctions.\"We have all to pull our efforts together to make it happen. But racism has been as old as any other evil in society, and it's for everybody to combat and to fight it.\" Now in her third year of the role, Samoura says she has yet to experience any direct discrimination herself but believes her own appointment would have raised eyebrows. \"I'm sure in the eyes of some people I was not supposed to be there.

Rather a globally supported soccer giant has had to withdraw an international superstar from a major European showpiece final for no other reason than where he was born.The Mkhitaryan case is a major embarrassment for UEFA and raises huge questions over its decision to stage the game in Baku.Read MoreForget the travel impracticalities of hosting a major European final in the far reaches of Azerbaijan that has made it virtually impossible -- both financially and logistically -- for the majority of both sets of supporters to reach.Even forget the measly allocation of just 6,000 tickets for each club's fans in a stadium that holds 69,870.Simply consider that UEFA, the governing body of soccer in Europe and upholder of its values, has chosen to host a showpiece final in a country where people of a certain nationality are deemed unsafe and are usually not permitted entry.Armenia -- where Mkhitaryan is from -- and Azerbaijan have a century-long conflict stemming from the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917 and there were fears the Arsenal midfielder would not be safe in Baku.That leaves one team technically handicapped by the forced withdrawal of a key player because of a non-footballing decision taken by the organisation which is supposed to promote the sport and uphold its values.Henrikh Mkhitaryan in action for Arsenal against Napoli in the Europa League quarterfinals.READ: Rivals 13km apart to play their season's biggest game 4,000km away from homeREAD: Kylian Mbappe says he's reached a 'turning point' in his careerREAD: Manchester City referred to UEFA body after financial fair play investigationUEFA's core principle on their RESPECT social responsibility campaign, which positively promotes inclusion, diversity and accessibility in football is: \"Everyone has the right to enjoy football, no matter who you are, where you're from or how you play.\"Hopefully that's a message that comforts Mkhitaryan and other Armenians around the world as the international captain sits at home watching on TV on Wednesday May 29.How can this not go against every principle of sport and competition?  And if Arsenal lose the game the question will always be asked -- what would have happened if Mkhitaryan had played?It also risks making UEFA's future equality and anti-discrimination campaigns sound pretty hollow when they continue to back a game in a country where such exclusion and conflict is so prominent?A penny for the thoughts of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich as well given all the work he's done to fight anti-Semitism.The Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA) said it was disappointed by Arsenal's \"unwarranted decision.\"\"Whilst we recognize the right to make a personal decision not to travel, we would like to reiterate that as the host country Azerbaijan has provided all the necessary guarantees required by UEFA to ensure the personal safety of Mr Mkhitaryan,\" said an AFFA spokesperson.\"There is no reason whatsoever to put in question the seriousness of these guarantees provided by Azerbaijan.  Over the past decade a large number of Armenian athletes have taken part in various international sports events in Azerbaijan without any issues.\"UEFA argue they have made every effort to support the participation of Mkhitaryan.\"Working alongside Arsenal FC, UEFA sought and received assurances regarding the player's safety in Azerbaijan from the highest authorities in the country,\" said European football's governing body in a statement.\"As a result of these guarantees, a comprehensive security plan was developed and given to the club. While the club acknowledges the efforts that UEFA and the Azeri government have gone to in this matter, we respect the personal decision not to travel with the player.\"     In essence, if Arsenal and Mkhitaryan aren't brave enough to roll the dice with the safety of their players and staff, then that's their problem. But if UEFA continue to serve their own interests at the expense of fans and players, do Arsenal and Chelsea need to do more in making the case for the game to be moved to preserve the integrity of the competition -- and human decency? Perhaps even to boycott the game?That would be a particularly tough decision for Arsenal to make, given the financial implications of any boycott as the Europa League offers the club it's last chance to qualify for the Champions League.There are stadiums all over Europe which can hold a major game at short notice -- namely Wembley Stadium and New White Hart Lane in London, where both finalists are from.Yes, this would represent a drastic and unprecedented move, but there has never been an occasion in the modern game where such restriction was forced upon a player, and what an example of togetherness and respect for all nationalities and beliefs it would be for two London rivals to set.  But surely some things in sport are more important than winning, losing, financial reward or financial penalties. This is a moment that could etch both proud, illustrious clubs in the history books of peace -- which is far greater good than a tainted Europa League trophy.",

        "content": "London (CNN)More than 350 million people in the European Union are eligible to cast ballots in the world's biggest multi-country election this week.Between May 23 and May 26, citizens from 28 member countries will have the opportunity to vote for who will represent them in European Parliament over the next five years. The biggest challenge for these elections, however, is communicating to voters what the parliament and its members actually do, according to Simon Usherwood, deputy director of the research initiative, UK in a Changing Europe. \"A difficulty for the European Parliament is that it does have a lot of power, but its fame is fairly limited,\" Usherwood said. \"I think a lot of people don't really know about it, they don't understand what the parliament does and doesn't do.\"Here's everything you need to know about the upcoming vote:Read MoreWho can take part?At the European Parliament, 512 million people from 28 member states are represented by 751 members. All EU citizens and qualifying Commonwealth citizens have the right to vote, as long as they have registered.Voting will begin in the Netherlands and the UK on May 23. However most of EU countries will vote on May 26, with results expected later that evening or early on Monday morning.Recently, the turnout to vote in these elections has been steadily dropping. In the last election, in 2014, there was a turnout of just 43% -- ranging from 90% in Belgium, where voting is compulsory, to just 13% in Slovakia.     How can someone become a Member of European Parliament?Anyone can stand to become a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in each country as long as they're a citizen of the European Union, and they can run as a representative of a political party or as an individual. It's also not a requirement for them to have any previous experience as a politician in their home country.\"It's like a national election but the difference is that EU citizens who live in other countries -- other member states -- are allowed to vote and stand as candidates in that country,\" Usherwood explained.\"The idea is to give all EU citizens to have someone represent them, wherever it is they live in the European Union.\"The European Parliament's Hemicycle in Strasbourg. Each country is allocated a certain amount of seats in parliament, depending on its population. Malta for instance -- which is the EU's smallest nation -- receives six seats, while Germany -- the largest -- has 96. \"Roughly speaking, the larger you are as a member state, the more seats you get but because we have quite a lot of smaller member states they are generally over represented,\" Usherwood explained.\"That's really to make sure that even in the smallest member state there are enough MEPs to represent the different political voices and strands that exist in every country and make sure it's not simply a case of the large member states determining all the decisions by themselves.\"How are MEPs organized? The European Parliament isn't organized by political parties, but by political affiliations -- otherwise known as groupings.Currently there are eight political groupings in the European Parliament.\"This is one of the things that is quite unusual about the European Parliament,\" Usherwood said. \"Any MEPs will stand as members of national political parties but once they get to European Parliament they are encouraged by the rules to get together in cross-national groupings based on ideology.\"     The center-right European People's Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) are the two largest groups.\"The larger your group the more influence you have in parliament,\" Usherwood explained. \"Speaking time is allocated by the size of your group (and) the number of chairs and committees you get is also determined by the same formula.\"\"Being part of a large group can give you real clout,' he added. \"It means you get to encounter people from other countries, share ideas, share policies.\"As well as the EPP and the S&D, there's also groups for euroskeptics, liberals, greens, as well as left and right-wing MEPs.In order to establish a group, there needs to be at least 25 MEPs who represent at least 25% of EU Member States. If a MEP doesn't belong to any political grouping they're known as \"Non-Attached Members.\"What powers do MEPs and the EU Parliament have?The European Parliament makes up one of three institutions that are responsible for legislating across the EU. The Parliament is made up of directly elected MEPs who represent EU citizens. Then there's the Council of the European Union, which is made up of representatives of individual member countries, and the European Commission, which is a politically independent executive arm, responsible for proposing legislation and implementing the decisions of the EU Parliament and Council of the EU. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the Council and Parliament have to agree.     \"The easiest way to think about it is that ... you have 28 member states and they're trying to work together to do useful things for their citizens, so to do that they've created a commission which is kind of a European civil service but also a place where you have some political direction,\" Usherwood explained.MEPs pass laws on behalf of EU citizens which are then applied all over the bloc -- from abolishing telephone roaming fees to adopting measures to limit the effects of global warming.They also elect the President of the European Commission (who is currently Jean-Claude Juncker) and holds him or her to account.What does the European Parliament actually do? One clue lies in your phone bill\"It's quite a significant power that the European Parliament has,\" Usherwood said. \"That's ranging from environmental legislation to questions about regional development. So it does make a real impact on people's lives and shapes the continent as a whole.\"However, Usherwood said it's important to note that the European Parliament isn't like a national parliament. \"It's not able to start its own legislation -- that power belongs to the European Commission. And there's still some things that the European Parliament can't decide on -- that's still with member states.\"Auke Willems, a fellow of EU law at the London School of Economics, told CNN that the Commission is \"the most important institution.\"\"It ultimately operates as an agent hanging over the two institutions, making a compromise,\" he said.But that doesn't mean the Parliament isn't a crucial part of the lawmaking process. Where it \"really gains power,\" said Willems, is by \"proposing amendments that go to the Council.\"The European Council is made up of the leaders of the 28 member states. It's not part of the EU's legislating institutions, but it does define the overall political direction and priorities of the bloc.Wait, I thought the UK was leaving the EU?England was already divided. Brexit is only making it worseOriginally, the intention was that by the time these elections came around, the UK would no longer be a member state -- the first planned date for the country to leave the EU was March 29. As such, it would not have needed to hold the elections. However, as a result of Prime Minister Theresa May being unable to receive approval for her deal from UK Parliament, she sought a Brexit extension. EU leaders stipulated that it would allow an extension only if the UK continued operating as a member state in the meantime, which included taking part in the upcoming elections. What will happen after Brexit?The UK currently has 73 MEPs but if and when Brexit does happen, 46 of its seats will be abolished while the remaining 27 will be redistributed to other countries.Usherwood said the removal and redistribution of those seats could influence current political groupings, such as where some may no longer be large enough to qualify for funding. It could also affect the amount of speaking time that each group receives. Ahead of the European Parliamentary electins, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.If the UK can agree a deal before European Parliament returns on July 2, he said, the UK MEPs who were elected during these elections will not have to take up their seats, but adds that it's unlikely.\"I think you're likely to see ... that the 73 British MEPs will take their seats in Parliament and they're going to have a real influence on a number of decisions, not least determining who gets what job within the new parliament,\" Usherwood said.Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May arriving ahead of a European Council meeting on Brexit at The European Parliament in Brussels.However, policy analyst Dominic Walsh, from the think tank Open Europe, noted that when the UK does exit the EU, it \"won't necessarily make much difference\" in Parliament.\"Historically, voting in the European Parliament is not usually very close, so UK MEPs won't necessarily have a decisive influence on the outcomes,\" he explains. \"If they did, however, this would be hugely controversial.\"Sex vouchers for migrants? The truth behind Europe's fake storiesBut Usherwood argued regardless of whether or not the UK sits in the next EU Parliament, its presence, or lack there of, will be felt. \"In or out it changes the balance of votes on particular bits of legislation,\" he said. \"There's always important legislation going through the European Parliament and British MEPs have typically been more towards the more liberal side of trade policy, they were more interested in deregulation, liberalization and without them you may find the European Parliament is a bit more willing to impose limits on what markets can do than what's previously been the case.\"What could happen once the UK leaves, Walsh believed, is that the so-called \"grand coalition\" of the center-right and center-left may gain a \"slightly larger majority.\"What themes and groups are expected to dominate this year?Usherwood said this European election is all about populism and the role the EU plays not only internationally but also internally.\"One of the things that's going to become more of an issue is what role do populists play within the campaigns in different countries,\" he said. \"We've seen the rise of many parties in many countries that talk about populism, that talk about kind of reasserting the national over the European -- so (the question is) how well are they going to do? And how much do other parties try and copy their behavior to limit their progress?\"Europe's populist nightmare won't end with BrexitTrends in the domestic politics of countries like Germany, Italy and Spain now look likely to be \"elevated to the European level,\" Walsh said.\"The 2014 elections took place in the wake of the Eurozone crisis -- which meant issues such as youth unemployment and austerity were very important to voters,\" Walsh explained.\"This time, it comes after the EU has experienced two different crises -- Brexit and the Mediterranean migration crisis. Immigration and security will be important issues in many countries -- as will climate change.\"While Usherwood said Europe's relationships with the US, Russia and China have become more uncertain than five years ago, which will \"raise questions about where the EU sits in the world.\"Usherwood added that the EU still has many internal challenges. \"The eurozone doesn't look very healthy economically, there's still a problem with unemployment and low growth.\"The problem with European elections, he said, is that voters are usually \"more concerned with their national situation than they are with the Europe-wide situation.\"\"Here in the UK people are voting in many ways to express their views about Brexit -- which the European Parliament doesn't really play a role in, just as in other countries they'll be voting on that country's politics and politicians,\" Usherwood said.This story has been updated to correct the number of eligible EU voters.",

'Chronic and corrosive threat'A previous coordinated series of raids took place in December 2018, when 90 people were arrested in an operation targeting the 'Ndrangheta mafia group in Europe and South America.'Ndrangheta has its roots in Calabria, southern Italy, but over the decades has developed into a powerful international criminal organization.90 held in anti-Mafia raids across EuropeApproximately 5,000 international organized criminal gangs are under investigation in the EU, according to Europol's latest Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, carried out in 2017.Earlier in May the UK National Crime Agency warned that there are at least 181,000 offenders with connections to serious and organized crime (SOC) in the country, posing a \"chronic and corrosive threat,\" according to a statement.NCA Director General Lynne Owens called for a \u00a32.7 billion ($3.4 billion) investment in law enforcement in the next three years to fight SOC.\"It kills more people every year than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined,\" said Owens.\"SOC affects more UK citizens, more frequently than any other national security threat.

        "content": "London (CNN)Theresa May was dealt a significant blow on Wednesday night when one of her top cabinet ministers resigned over the British Prime Minister's approach to Brexit. Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons and a prominent Brexiteer, said she could no longer carry out her duties because she \"fundamentally opposes\" May's latest Brexit bill. \"I stayed in Cabinet to shape and fight for Brexit. There have been some uncomfortable compromises along the way, but you have had my determined support and loyalty in your efforts to deliver Brexit as our shared goal,\" Leadsom said in her resignation letter to May, which she posted on Twitter. But Leadsom said she couldn't see a way forward with the new Brexit deal May offered on Tuesday. \"I no longer believe that our approach will deliver on the referendum result.\"Leadsom's resignation could trigger further defections from May's ailing government ahead of the Prime Minister's fourth attempt to get her beleaguered Brexit deal passed. Read MoreMay responded that evening with a letter of her own, thanking Leadsom for her service, and saying that she disagreed with her concerns. \"I do not agree with you that the deal which we have negotiated with the European Union means that the United Kingdom will not become a sovereign country. If the deal is passed, the UK will leave the European Union,\" May wrote.On Twitter, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party Tom Watson described the timing as an \"odd\" choice, just before European elections.It is with great regret and a heavy heart that I have decided to resign from the Government. pic.twitter.com/f2SOXkaqmH\u2014 Andrea Leadsom MP (@andrealeadsom) May 22, 2019\n\nMay is facing pressure to resign; if she does, Leadsom is expected to throw her hat into the ring to become the next Prime Minister. It would not be the first time. Back in 2016, Leadsom was in the running against May in the contest to replace David Cameron as leader of the ruling Conservative Party. But May was ultimately selected to lead Britain through its complicated divorce with the European Union. Three years on, May has failed to deliver on the result of the Brexit referendum. In her letter, Leadsom indicated that the latest version of May's Brexit plan, in which she offered lawmakers the chance to vote on a second referendum as the price for supporting her deal, was a concession too far.\"I have always maintained that a second referendum would be dangerously divisive, and I do not support the Government willingly facilitating such a concession,\" Leadsom said. Theresa May offers vote on second referendum if lawmakers back 'new Brexit deal' In an attempt to repackage the plan, May rolled it up into a wider set of legislation dealing with Britain's departure. As well as the offer of a second referendum, it also contained pledges on workers' rights, environmental provisions, as well as a temporary customs relationship with the European Union.Her \"new Brexit deal\" was greeted with significant opposition from across the political spectrum. Hardline Conservatives who had supported May's last deal, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MPs who prop up May's minority government in Parliament and supporters of a second referendum alike all rejected it.Leadsom said that, with the concessions outlined in May's new deal, she did not believe that the UK would be \"truly sovereign.\" She also aired her frustrations over a \"breakdown of government processes,\" adding that Brexit-related legislative proposals had not been \"properly scrutinized or approved\" by Cabinet members.Juncker lashes out at 'stupid nationalists' on eve of European electionsThe Conservative Party is expected to be soundly defeated at the European elections, which begin on Thursday. And Leadsom said that she had thought carefully about the timing of her departure, on the eve of the vote.\"I considered carefully the timing of this decision, but I cannot fulfill my duty as Leader of the House tomorrow, to announce a Bill with new elements that I fundamentally oppose,\" Leadsom said.May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill is due to go before the House of Commons in the first week of June.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Here in Britain, politicians are being covered in milkshakes. Yes, milkshakes. And lots of people are very angry about it.So far, these sorts of attacks, fast becoming known as \"milkshaking,\" have been aimed at controversial figures.It all began with the milkshaking of Tommy Robinson earlier this month. Robinson, real name Stephen-Yaxley-Lennon, is a far-right anti-immigration, anti-Islam activist who used to run the English Defence League.Brexit mess is about to get much, much worse On May 2, a Twitter user posted a video of Danyaal Mahmud throwing a milkshake over Robinson.In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Mahmud says that Robinson approached him, and \"asked me if I thought he was racist and I said: yeah. Then he says: 'do you know 80% of grooming gangs are Muslim?\" Read MoreAt the end of the video, an onlooker can be heard shouting at Robinson \"that's what you get for being a fascist,\" to what sound like cheers.The video has to date been viewed over 5 million times on Twitter. CNN asked Robinson if Mahmud's version of events was accurate. He has not replied.The incident took place while Robinson was out campaigning as an independent candidate for the European parliamentary elections, taking place on Thursday.Standing for political office might not seem an obvious thing for someone who has been removed from most major social media platforms for posting hate speech. Robinson told CNN Business previously the ban was \"clear evidence of the tech giants working alongside the establishment in order to silence criticism.\"But for a man like Robinson, this kind of condemnation from the mainstream only feeds his fanbase. Robinson has become an icon of free speech on the far-right ever since he was imprisoned for broadcasting details in a trial of four Pakistani men accused of sexual offenses against white girls in northern England. The ruling that he was in contempt of court was later overturned by a court of appeal. The case is due to be retried at a date yet to be decided.The milkshaking video (which it later transpired was the second milkshaking Robinson had experienced in as many days) has inspired subsequent incidents. Carl Benjamin, another controversial candidate in the European elections, was milkshaked four times last week.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. Why was he such a target? Since his candidacy for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) was announced, BuzzFeed News unearthed videos which showed Benjamin using numerous racial slurs and making jokes about rape. Since the videos emerged, rather than apologize he has doubled down, even appearing on national television and making the same jokes to well-known presenters. Benjamin has repeatedly said that his comments were a joke and told BuzzFeed: \"BREAKING NEWS: Anti-political correctness entertainer has used naughty words for fun.\"The most recent milkshaking target is the former leader of Benjamin's party, Nigel Farage, who left UKIP after it tried to admit Robinson as a member, claiming the party was fixated on Islam.Farage, loathed by a large number of people who think his previous political campaigning makes him no different to Robinson and Benjamin, was an obvious target. So obvious, in fact, that police in Scotland requested that a McDonald's located near the site of a Farage rally in Edinburgh stop selling milkshakes for the day.Political protest has a long history of throwing unpleasant things over people one group disagrees with. Think of animal rights protestors throwing red paint and sometimes blood over celebrities known for wearing fur. Think of the foam pie a protestor tried to throw in Rupert Murdoch's face, halted by his then-wife Wendi Deng.One of these objects makes a specific point; the other is just a pie. It seems that the milkshake has more in common with the latter: people who don't like Robinson, Benjamin and Farage like seeing them covered in milkshake.\"The power of social media is that an impulsively thrown milkshake can become a symbol overnight. That McDonald's was served a police notice to shut its milkshake machine down the day of the march is testament to this. A viral image, mixed with the allure of social media infamy, is easily enough to spawn copycats,\" says Alex Krasodomski, director for the Centre of Analysis for Social Media at the Demos think tank in London.A grab from a Tommy Robinson promotional video on Youtube shows Robinson getting 'milkshaked.'Milkshaking is happening more. Thirteen days before the Farage incident, a reddit user posted the comment: \"He must be next in line for a milkshaking.\" You can find similar messages on 4chan.In 2015, Douglas Carswell, a former member of parliament, was surrounded by a group of anti-austerity protestors shortly after he'd defected from the Conservative Party to UKIP. He was escorted from the scene by police for his own safety. While he wasn't milkshaked, the recent incidents have reminded him of the fear of requiring police protection after being confronted by angry members the public.Carswell blames the toxic atmosphere in politics on the treatment of people like him in the media.Police stop McDonald's from selling milkshakes near Nigel Farage rally\"Commentators who believe that human affairs are best arranged by design sometimes believe there's a moral imperative for such their favoured blueprint. Those that don't believe in the blueprint are therefore deemed to be somehow morally suspect and thus fair game,\" he said.Part of the problem here is that the attack in question is coming from someone holding a milkshake. It seems so innocuous. As the Conservative MP Johnny Mercer tweeted after the Robinson milkshaking, \"It's a milkshake. A milkshake. Clearly I condemn political violence. This is not political violence from the guy on the left. It is a milkshake.\"It might just be a milkshake. But politically the UK is a badly divided country at the moment. And it cannot be forgotten that a British MP was killed by a far-right terrorist during the Brexit campaign. It's worth remembering that political unrest can have unexpected consequences.",

There are 150 million metric tons of plastic in our oceans, and that figure will treble by 2025, according to the statement.Young sperm whale found dead in Sicily with stomach full of plastic Whole Foods will ban plastic straws and offer smaller produce bags\"Stopping the production and distribution of these single-use plastic menaces will prevent them from polluting beaches nationwide,\" said Hugo Tagholm, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage.\"It's a really positive and bold step in the right direction in the battle against plastic pollution.\"Further steps include a proposed UK tax on plastic packaging that contains less than 30% recycled content, which is currently in a consultation period.And global action to tackle the plastic waste crisis is increasing.Earlier in May the governments of 187 countries agreed to control the movement of plastic waste between national borders, although the United States was not among them.The move will prevent developed countries sending their plastic waste to developing nations for disposal, which activists argue has turned the latter into \"dumping grounds.\"The new international move is \"a highly welcome step towards redressing this imbalance and restoring a measure of accountability to the global plastic waste management system,\" said the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).The (devolved) governments of Scotland and Wales are also considering similar measures.",

        "content": "Brussels  (CNN)Europe is deeply engaged in a continent-wide battle over its future. Euroskeptic populists are trying to undermine the European Union from within, while those speaking up for a closer bloc, like former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, are doing so louder than ever. \"It's not a question of more or less Europe. It's a question of different,\" Verhofstadt says speaking to CNN in his spacious Brussels office. \"We need a different union because this union will not survive the 21st Century.\"On paper, the 66-year-old is not the sort of person you would expect to hear using such fatalistic language about the European Union's future.In the post-Brexit era, Verhofstadt is a held up by Europhiles as a poster boy for the European project. His style of politics divides opinion. The British Sun newspaper recently described him in an editorial as a \"curtain-haired slimeball\" and the \"most repugnant figure in Brussels.\" However, when he recently addressed a group of anti-Brexit protestors in London, he was cheered for saying that in the world of tomorrow, European countries needed to \"work together\".Read MoreWelcome to the last days of Theresa MayAs the European Parliament's Brexit coordinator and leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, he has made no secret of his desire for a more integrated bloc where European institutions would have greater power.\"The big problem we have in Europe is the enormous distance between the European dream, shared by more Europeans than ever, and then in practice the European Union, which is absolutely not seen as the translation of the European dream,\" he says. Verhofstadt, known for his often combative oratory, is scathing about the populist movements and parties running on a Euroskeptic platform in this week's European parliamentary elections. Italy's deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini of the far-right Lega Nord party, is openly planning to form a large, powerful Euroskeptic bloc -- one opposed to European institutions being given more power -- following the elections that voters across Europe have previously treated as a protest ballot. Euroskeptic parties could potentially win up to 35% of seats. And if Salvini succeeds in bringing groups from countries all over the bloc together, a huge gang that was once on the fringes of European politics will be inside the halls of power, able to push for their own version of reform.\"Reform? I don't call that reform. I call that the kiss of death,\" Verhofstadt says of Salvini's plan for the EU. \"Instead of beating it from outside it will die inside.\"While many bureaucrats and politicians in Brussels have been accused of sticking their heads in the sand and ignoring the threats facing the EU, Verhofstadt sees challenges both inside and outside of Europe.\"The world is developing into one not of nation states, but of empires. China is an empire. India is an empire. The US is an empire. We need to create a European Union that is capable of defending our interests,\" he says. And he doesn't see Europe's internal and external threats -- populism and a changing world order -- as unrelated issues. Nationalist politicians often talk about reclaiming their country's sovereignty, stripping away centralized power from Brussels.Verhofstadt says this is the wrong answer to Europe's challenges and points to the Council -- one of the key institutions of the EU -- as something that isn't working in its current form. Guy Verhofstadt with a group of European Union supporters protesting against Brexit in London.The Council is the forum in which national governments decide on European policy. It makes decisions either by qualified majority or unanimity, depending on the issue. This can mean a single member state derailing huge issues because they don't agree with them.Verhofstadt says a Europe of nation states, where countries scale back their commitment to the bloc, would only exacerbate these tensions, weakening Europe and placing its destiny in the hands of others. \"It's Putin, it's the Chinese leadership, it's Trump who are going to decide on our way of life, on our standards. Some nationalists say 'yeah we are against globalization', but what they are doing is worse,\" he says.   \"What is missing in the pro-European voice is vision and passion. We cannot convince young people to be pro-European with a bureaucratic and technocratic European Union as it works today.\"It's a reasonable point. The EU has in some respects become a parody of itself. It has more institutions than any normal person can name, unelected commissioners who seem remote to citizens and cumbersome bureaucracy that, unless you are on the pay roll, is hard to love. It's little wonder that a simple message of \"Take Back Control\" won out in the 2016 UK Brexit referendum. Pooled sovereignty and federalism lack the romance of national pride.Verhofstadt wants to re-imagine the \"European dream.\" In this, he has an ally: France's President Emmanuel Macron, someone he says is able to stand up to populists but is struggling with his own anti-establishment movement, the \"gilets jaunes\" or \"yellow vest\" protesters. Verhofstadt's version of a reformed European Union is one that creates a \"European Army and European champions\" to rival those in China and the US. That, he says, would offer younger Europeans something more than boring, technocratic tweaks from an out-of-touch political class in Brussels. Go big or go home. Guy Verhofstadt speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. While there is moderate support for Verhofstadt's view among fellow Europhiles like Macron, he is seen by many others in Europe as an outlier. It's simply a fact that the most prominent issue facing the European Union at the moment is Brexit. It has sucked all the oxygen out of virtually everything else.Verhofstadt wants Brexit over and done with. He wants to avoid spending the next five years \"fighting again over Brexit\" instead of \"talking about renewal and reform.\"He's says he's not been impressed with the UK's handling of Brexit and points out one of the unavoidable differences between European countries and the Brits. \"Normally, when a country puts an existential question on the table, a cross-party platform would be created to say what is now, based on the decision of the people, the best way forward,\" he says. Building coalitions and cooperating with your political rivals is normal in Europe.In the UK, the governing Conservative party and Labour are entrenched in a bitter rivalry. Worse, Brexit has divided the internal politics of those two parties, making any kind of compromise near impossible.\"For two years, Brexit has been used as a bullet in a weapon for both sides. That is our feeling. The national interest was never involved -- or even trying to find out where the national interest is,\" Verhofstadt said.He says the UK ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement, the mechanism by which it exits the European Union, is the \"only way forward\" and is not wild about the \"eternal discussion\" on whether Britain needs a second Brexit referendum. Nor was he a fan of the EU's decision to grant the UK a long Brexit extension.While Verhofstadt has his supporters, the reality staring him and other pro-Europeans in the face is that the Euroskeptics are not going anywhere any time soon.When anti-EU politicians take their seats in a new parliament (including those in the UK furious at Brexit having not happened) they will be hellbent on causing as much damage as possible.Europe is at a crossroad. It sometimes looks like it's the Euroskeptics that are winning the argument.As leaders of pro-European nations like the Netherland's Mark Rutte and even members of Germany's governing party borrow the language of nationalists, it's easy to believe that the attempt to keep the far right at bay simply normalizes their rhetoric.When there is a one-to-one fight about what the people want -- Europe, or going out of Europe -- Europe wins.\nGuy VerhofstadtVerhofstadt sees things differently. While he doesn't deny the existence of the anti-EU populists, he believes that when \"there is a pro-European candidate against an anti-European candidate, the pro-European wins. That was the case with Macron against Le Pen. That was the case in Austria. That was the case in the Netherlands.\" You could argue that this is a selective reading of history on Verhofstadt's part and that he is ignoring how those elections actually shook out. But he's sticking to his optimism.\"When there is a one-to-one fight about what the people want -- Europe, or going out of Europe -- Europe wins.\" This story has been updated to correct the spelling of gilets jaunes.",

(CNN)Having risen in triumph from the brink of death after a fiery crash, Niki Lauda's life was one of almost biblical proportions that was given the Hollywood treatment in the blockbuster \"Rush.\"The Austrian Formula One driver pulled off one of sport's greatest comebacks after recovering from life-threatening burns and lung injuries in a horror crash in Germany in 1976 to win two more world titles.But the straight-talking triple world champion, who has died at the age of 70, didn't believe in miracles or the sentiment of the silver screen.The Austrian built his own legacy by defying not only death on the track, but also his family, employers and arch rivals along the way.\"I go my own way,\" Lauda told CNN's The Circuit in 2013.Read More\"Thank God, I learned in sport, that there is no excuse. It's very simple, if you're first, second or third there's no discussion.  \"If something goes wrong, look into yourself first -- what did I do wrong?  \"I only see black and white, I have no gray areas and I hate them.  \"I try to analyze, take the decision, even if it's the wrong one, it's better than making no decision because if you take no decision you never find out what you have to do. \"READ: Three-time F1 champion Lauda dead at 70Lauda had undergone a lung transplant in AugustMaverick racerLauda was born into a wealthy Austrian family four years after the end of World War II, but despite growing up with privilege he learned quickly that he would have to make his own way in the world.His family disapproved of their teenage son's racing ambitions. When Lauda found an Austrian bank to sponsor his debut with the March F1 team, his grandfather -- who happened to sit on the board of the bank -- scotched the deal.\"He said, 'No way! If this is my grandson, you will not sponsor him,' \" Lauda said.\"I really got upset with him and said, 'Leave me alone, it is my own business.' Then I started racing my own way.\"READ: 'Rush' relives F1's death or glory daysLauda bankrolled his own way on to the F1 grid, making his debut in the 1971 Austrian Grand Prix for the uncompetitive March team.His decision to take out further bank loans to finance his F1 career paid off at the end of 1973 when he was signed by Ferrari -- but even this new era with the sport's most iconic team saw Lauda continue to do things his way.\"I remember my first test in Fiorano,\" he recalled. \"I drove the first couple of laps and (team founder) Enzo Ferrari was there and Piero his son to translate.\"Ferrari said, 'So kid, what do you think of this car?'\"I said the car was st.  And Piero said, 'You cannot say this. You cannot tell my father that the car is st because he will throw you out. Tell him it's no good, it sounds a little better.' \"He told him and the old man really got upset because I criticized a Ferrari.\"READ: The crashes that changed Formula OneLauda attends the \"legends race\" at the racetrack in Spielberg on June 30, 2018, ahead of the Austrian Formula One Grand Prix. Lucky to be aliveLauda soon earned the respect of \"Il Commendatore,\" a proponent of tough love who the Austrian described as \"the most charismatic guy I have ever met in my whole life.\"In 1975 he stormed to five wins to capture his first world title with the Italian powerhouse -- but the following season fate cruelly intervened.Going into the German Grand Prix at the notorious Nurburgring circuit, which he had asked his fellow drivers to boycott due to its poor safety setup, Lauda was leading the 1976 title hunt.He came out of the race fighting for his life.Lauda's Ferrari burst into a fireball after a crash on the second lap. He was pulled from the flames with severe burns and lung damage. Lying in hospital later that night, he was administered the last rites by a priest.Typically for Lauda, he saw things differently. At the age of 27, he summoned his will of iron to find a way back.Just 42 days after his crash in Germany, Lauda was back in the cockpit of a Ferrari and racing to defend his title at the Italian Grand Prix.It was a comeback that defied the medics and his rivals. Lauda called it the most courageous decision in his F1 career.\"First, I knew about the danger,\" said Lauda, who wore a baseball cap to hide the scars left by his fiery crash.\"I went to every accident, even if I was not involved or didn't see it, to understand what happened.\"The accident did not surprise me because I knew it was dangerous.  I told myself, 'I was lucky, I'm still alive so why not as I'm alive, God help me, let's try.'\"This was the big challenge ... a comeback. For me it was clear, that the longer I wait, the more difficult it's going to be because the more worries you start building up.\"I had to do it as quick as possible to overcome these problems and to keep racing as before.\"Lauda attends the Hahnenkamm si race on January 20, 2018 in Kitzbuehel, Austria.Defining momentsBut it was another brave decision that decided the F1 title that season.Lauda refused to race in torrential rain in the deciding Japanese Grand Prix, which handed the crown to his rival James Hunt.\"I would take the same decision today,\" Lauda said in 2013. \"It was stupid to race.\"The story of those defining points was turned into \"Rush,\" a movie by F1 fan and director Ron Howard.For Lauda, his self determination guided him throughout his life.After winning a second title with Ferrari and moving to the Brabham team, he quit F1 with two races still to run in the 1979 season. Lauda won the F1 drivers' title three times.Lauda said he \"tired of driving round in circles,\" and a new career as an airline boss beckoned.However, a second coming for McLaren brought his third and final world title in 1984, before an inevitable second retirement followed.Lauda became an opinionated but respected voice in the inner circle of F1's paddock, where he patrolled as a non-executive chairman of the Mercedes team and a TV analyst.If \"Rush\" is the movie of his life then the soundtrack has to be Frank Sinatra's \"My Way.\"\"I do not want to change,\" Lauda insisted. \"I will continue all the way through to the end of my life in this way.\"",

        "content": "Vienna, Austria (CNN)Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz will face a no-confidence vote in the wake of an undercover video scandal that has blown apart his coalition with a far-right party. The main opposition Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6) requested a special parliamentary session next Monday, according to parliamentary spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundbroeck. The opposition \"Jetzt\" party is planning to introduce the no-confidence motion during that session, party spokeswoman Eva Kellermann said. CNN has seen the written motion sent to parliament. Sebastian Kurz (R) governs in a coalition with the far-right party of Heinz-Christian Strache (L), who quit as Vice Chancellor over the scandal.  Kurz's government was plunged into crisis over the weekend when a video emerged of his Vice Chancellor -- Heinz-Christian Strache of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) -- appearing to offer state contracts to a woman claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. Strache resigned on Saturday, and Kurz's conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP) -- which governs as the senior member of a coalition with the hardline FP\u00d6 -- was quick to distance itself from its partners. Read MoreInterior Minister Herbert Kickl, who was secretary general of the FP\u00d6 at the time the video was filmed in 2017, will be dismissed at Kurz's recommendation, the country's president announced Tuesday. Austrian Chancellor moves to dismiss interior minister amid corruption scandal Alexander van der Bellen also said that the other FP\u00d6 ministers in the cabinet were quitting over the scandal, though he added that Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl would stay on. Kurz said he would suggest replacements for the resigning FP\u00d6 ministers as early as Tuesday, and lamented that the episode had \"damaged the reputation of our republic.\"The scandal is the biggest crisis Austria's governing coalition has faced since forming in 2017, and over the weekend more than 5,000 protesters gathered outside the Chancellor's office in Vienna calling for fresh elections.Kurz responded by calling for a snap election in September, though it's unclear how the coalition will work together in the meantime. Van der Bellen said Tuesday that he expected the current government to stay on in the interim. Dent in populist support?The crisis in Austria comes at a delicate time for Europe's populist parties, which have been tipped to make big gains at the upcoming European parliamentary elections between May 23 and May 26. Austria's FP\u00d6 is in an alliance with Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini's League, and Salvini has spoken openly of forming a nationalist bloc in the European Parliament that would take a harder line on immigration. The secret footage of Strache, filmed in Ibiza two years ago, was published Friday by Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper. It is not known who recorded the video or set up the meeting.Salvini says he wants pre-Maastricht EU rules, ahead of far-right rallyThe following morning, Strache denied doing \"anything against the law\" but apologized to \"everyone I have disappointed with my behavior.\"Russia has denied any involvement in the affair, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that \"I cannot in any way evaluate the appearance of this video, because it has nothing to do with the Russian Federation, the President or the government.\"\"We do not know for sure who this woman is, whether she is Russian, therefore this is a story that does not and cannot have anything to do with us.\"Denise Hruby reported from Vienna and Stephanie Halasz reported from London.

It was Dawn's 34th birthday.\"We'd just buried my grandmother -- my mum's mum -- the day before,\" recalls Dawn.\"I can see my dad now coming through the front door with mum. He didn't really walk properly, he shuffled and walked with a stoop, his skin looked gray and his face was gaunt. He was 59 but, I kid you not, he looked 159.\"And it was while we were eating this tea, while Dad was sitting at the table, that he started to cough.\"I remember we helped him up off his chair but his legs kept giving way. With everybody in the house it was quite stuffy so we took him outside. But he just kept coughing and just coughing and you could tell it was getting worse. \"We were screaming, literally screaming, at him to spit the food out. We didn't know whether he had food in it because he'd got his teeth gritted together and he wouldn't open his mouth.\"We were begging with him, pleading with him, 'spit it out, spit it out' but he just wouldn't do it. His legs eventually gave way so we lay him down.\"It was just the most horrific thing because, not just what was happening in front of your eyes, but because you were so helpless, you just couldn't do anything. He basically choked to death in front of us, you know mum, me and my sisters.\"Liverpool's Mo Salah suffered concussion in a Premier League match against Newcastle.Red flagsHead injuries in football are very much in the news at the moment.Star striker Mo Salah was unable to play for Liverpool in its recent Champions League semifinal second leg against Barcelona after suffering a concussion during a Premier League match against Newcastle.Tottenham Hotpsur defender Jan Vertonghen was left bloodied and dazed after colliding with teammate Toby Alderweireld as the pair challenged Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana for the ball in the other Champions League semifinal in the first leg.After being treated on the field for some time, Vertonghen was initially cleared to continue playing, before staggering to the touchline just moments later.There, he stood retching and had to be helped from the field by the team's backroom staff.Tottenham said its medical team strictly followed the English Football Association concussion guidelines in caring for Vertonghen. In a statement, the club said: \"Following testing he was judged to be alert and answered all questions correctly and lucidly, deeming him fit to return to the field of play.\"Vertonghen then underwent further tests and was seen by an independent neurologist who concluded the Belgian international defender hadn't suffered a concussion. World governing body FIFA has a series of red flags that club doctors should observe when examining players suspected of suffering concussion, for example, checking whether they are suffering from double vision or have lost consciousness. But Chris Nowinski, co-founder and CEO of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN Sport that \"international soccer's concussion protocols are the worst in the world. Their substitution rules are archaic and not based on current clinical care for concussion.\"Responding to Nowinski's comments, FIFA said it \"regularly monitors the situation of head injuries, maintaining constant contact with current and on-going studies on this matter and reviewing our protocols. \"As mentioned in the concussion module of FIFA's Emergency Medical Manual,  'if, at any stage of the concussion assessment, the medical team cannot make a definite decision regarding whether concussion is present or not and a doubt exists,' it is recommended that 'when in doubt, sit the player out' and he or she should be removed from play.\"Astle scored 174 goals for West Brom.'Ref, is this the final?'In the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, Germany's Christoph Kramer was allowed to continue playing after a clash of heads, only to be forced off by suspected concussion later in the game.\"Shortly after the blow, Kramer came to me asking: 'Ref, is this the final,'\" World Cup final referee Nicola Rizzoli later told La Gazzetta dello Sport.At last year's World Cup in Russia, Morocco's Nordin Amrabat suffered a concussion during a defeat against Iran, only to play five days later in headgear, which he discarded early on in the match. After Amrabat's return, Morocco manager Herve Renard described the former Watford player as a \"warrior.\"At the time Morocco team doctor  Abderazzak El Hifti was criticised on social media for patting Amrabat on the cheeks as he treated the player.\"We received a letter from FIFA that reminds us of the recommendations to follow [...] we respected them point by point, our intervention was correct,\" El Hifti said in a video sent to media by the Moroccan Federation.\"I asked him five questions and he could only answer one, I saw clear symptoms of cerebral concussion. We can never make a decision that would put a player's health at risk.\"But the decision to put Amrabat back on the field didn't follow FIFA's suggested protocol, which calls for a six-day concussion break.However, the governing body does not have the authority to officially enforce the guideline. The concussion protocols of European governing body UEFA and national federations like the English Football Association closely mirror FIFA's guidelines.Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino helps Jan Vertonghen (C) as he leaves the pitch injured.READ: 'Hopefully no one has die': Taylor Twellman's fears over head injuries'Excuses'But is soccer lagging behind other sports in terms of the way that head injuries -- and specifically concussions -- are treated?  Since the 2015 Rugby World Cup, teams have been able to make a temporary substitution for any player suffering from a head injury.In English domestic cricket, temporary substitutions were introduced in 2018. Meanwhile, American Football -- a sport long linked to head injuries -- has a \"Play Smart. Play Safe\" protocol, with doctors monitoring player welfare on the sidelines using video technology.If found to be showing any signs of concussion, such as impact seizure or fencing posture -- both independent signs of loss of consciousness -- the players must be replaced, according to the NFL's concussion protocols developed alongside the NFLPA. In comparison to rugby, football arguably offers less flexibility as only three substitutes are permitted during a game.FIFA's concussion protocol says examinations \"cannot be performed correctly in less than 10 minutes,\" though when Vertonghen was injured in the first half of in the game against Ajax, there were six minutes of added time, which raises the question as to whether more time could have been allocated to his examination.Nowinski queried whether football devoted enough time to head injury assessments.\"No doctor should be asked to assess a concussion in three minutes,\" said Nowinski. \"By contrast, World Rugby says a concussion evaluation requires a minimum of 10 minutes. Christoph Kramer of Germany lies on the pitch after a collision during the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina.READ: How a painting helped Gianluigi Buffon cope with depression\"The excuses used to not change the rules to allow for concussion substitutions are misguided. I am glad to see that the media and the public are no longer tolerating this abuse of brain-injured players.\"World player's union FIFPro has called for an independent doctor to assist the team doctor to assess whether a player with a head injury should be allowed to return to the pitch.FIFPro also want doctors to be given at least 10 minutes to assess the extent of an injury to a player with a suspected concussion, and for football stakeholders to explore the possibility of a temporary substitute during this period.Dr. Patrick O'Halloran -- Sports Concussion Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, Sport and Exercise Medicine Registrar -- believes that once diagnosed with concussion, players must be given sufficient time to recover before playing football again. \"There is evidence to suggest that continuing to play football having sustained a concussion can result in more severe symptoms, a prolonged recovery, impaired performance and an increased risk of major knee and ankle injuries if it is not recognized. \"As a result, it is important that everyone is doing their best to recognize concussions and remove athletes from play until they are appropriately assessed and have recovered, at every level of the game.\"West Brom's Jeff Astle gates outside the club's Hawthorns stadium.READ: Inside the $500 million football factoryIn the short-term, concussions can cause dizziness and nausea. More severe problems for players, who suffer concussions, often arise many years after retirement.CTE is described by the Alzheimer's Association as \"a brain condition associated with repeated blows to the head.\" However, people may not experience potential signs of CTE until years or decades after brain injuries occur.Astle's posthumous CTE diagnosis in 2014 prompted questions about how players were being looked after.England's Football Association told CNN it was \"committed to researching and examining all areas of head injuries in football, in particular around the long-term effects on players.\"We have commissioned comprehensive and rigorous research studies in this area, in collaboration with the Drake Foundation and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), which are currently ongoing.\"These studies will help establish whether or not there are any risks associated with playing football, as well as giving us a greater understanding of the numerous health benefits from playing football on a regular basis.\"Astle is recognised as one of West Bromwich Albion's greatest ever players, playing 361 times and scoring 174 goals. He led them to the FA Cup in 1968 -- where he scored the winning goal in the final -- and made five England appearances.West Brom fans hold up cards in tribute to Jeff Astle.READ: Benfica teenager who is a 'star already'However, in the later stages of his life, Astle had been stripped of all memory of his past successes.\"At home, he was surrounded with everything he'd won in football,\" his daughter Dawn remembers. \"He'd got cups on the wall, trophies and medals, but he remembered none of it. And he didn't even know he'd ever been a footballer. \"Everything football gave him, football took away. We lost a little part of him every day and endured that pain and helplessness that comes with your dad taken from you with nothing you could do.\" The findings of a 2002 inquest into Astle's death were not what his family expected. \"The coroner and the pathologist described how badly damaged my dad's brain was,\" Dawn explains. \"He found that there was considerable evidence of trauma to the brain which he said was similar to the brain of the boxer. And he said that the main candidate for the trauma was heading the footballs.\"In any other industry, an inquest finding such as dads would have undoubtedly had earthquake-like repercussions for that particular industry,\" said Dawn. \"But not football. Football and its privileged status of self-governing seem to wriggle itself outside it. \"Surely this is the kind of issue that warrants the PFA's very existence. And I've said before, but I lost all faith in the PFA's ability to protect its members.\"In response to Dawn's criticism, the PFA's chief executive Gordon Taylor reiterated the union's desire to protect its current and former players, highlighting numerous efforts they have made to help players suffering from dementia, such as providing financial support to former members suffering from the condition.In 2015, Dawn helped set up The Jeff Astle Foundation which seeks to \"raise awareness of brain injury in all forms of sport and to offer much needed support to those affected.\" Subsequently she says was contacted by about 250 families of other footballers with degenerative brain disease. \"My dad died and there could be hundreds, there could be thousands of others like him.\"",

        "content": "Dublin, Ireland (CNN)In the last four and a half years, Michael Rossney has been to court 40 times and spent tens of thousands of euros on legal fees. Like some 118,000 people in Ireland, his marriage has broken down and he is separated from his partner. As the Dublin native seeks a divorce, his legal and financial situation may sound difficult, but this is not unusual in Ireland due to the country's divorce laws, which are among the most restrictive in Europe. Under current legislation, which is enshrined in the country's constitution, a person can only apply for a divorce after living separately from their spouse for four out of the previous five years. No one is exempt from this mandatory wait time, including those who are trying to leave abusive relationships, most of whom are women. Women suffering from domestic abuse could benefit from a shorter divorce process in order to protect themselves -- and their children -- from continued abuse from a former spouse, according to the National Women's Council of Ireland. Other individuals in the process of separating, like Rossney, argue that the minimum wait time creates unnecessary levels of anxiety, prohibits their ability to move on, wreaks havoc on their emotional well-being and is a terrible financial burden. Read MoreThat could all change on May 24 when Ireland goes to the polls in a referendum on divorce.A 'protracted war'Any changes to the Irish constitution must be approved by a public referendum and, in this upcoming poll, voters will be asked whether they support a government proposal to remove the four-year wait from the constitution. If passed, parliament will legislate on the future time period needed before couples can apply for a divorce.Voters will also be asked if they want to remove a law that doesn't recognize foreign divorces, a provision that prohibits people who divorced outside Ireland from remarrying. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan said in March that \"complex questions of social policy are best dealt with through detailed legislation in the Oireachtas (parliament) rather than within the confines of our Constitution.\" Flanagan added that the government intends to reduce the living apart period to two years so that both parties can \"move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe.\"Forty-year-old Rossney told CNN that the long wait has fueled a hostile environment that has been exploited by the legal system, and that the proceedings -- and relationship with his ex -- could have been more positive if the mandatory period wasn't so drawn out.\"I don't think we would have hit such a low point if things hadn't dragged on so long,\" he said. \"We knew we had a protracted war ahead of us.\" Rossney, a proud father of two, said that he believes that the current law means that legal teams don't have \"any incentives to stop fighting until the money is gone.\" He said that Ireland's family court \"is not fit for purpose\" as \"like any other court, it is ... a fight until one party wins and the\u00a0other loses.\"A changing IrelandMany in the process of divorce support the government proposal. If it passes, it will be the latest in a series of measures reflecting modern Irish society that have recently questioned, and rejected, the historical role of the Catholic Church's doctrine on its institutions. They baptized their children for school places. Now regret is setting in.Ireland became the\u00a0first country to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote,\u00a0with more than 60% voting yes in a referendum in 2015. And, earlier this year, it opened its first abortion services following the 2018 vote that repealed a constitutional amendment that had placed a near-ban on terminations. While public support for the change in divorce law is high, a small minority fears that if it passes, it could lead to the demise of the institution of marriage.David Quinn, director of the Catholic advocacy group Iona Institute, told CNN that if the waiting period was taken out of the constitution, \"politicians will eventually vote two years down to six months, in which case the difference between marriage and cohabitation, legally speaking, becomes ever finer.\"Speaking on Irish radio in December, Quinn said: \"I don't think something as important as marriage should be too easy to get out of.\"There should be a kind of trip wire to really slow down and think about it,\" he added.'You're in a situation where you can't move on'Quinn's comments reflect Ireland's difficult relationship with divorce, and the upcoming vote will mark the third time the country has held a referendum on the subject. In a 1986 referendum, 63% of Irish voters rejected a proposal to end a total ban on divorce.Almost a decade later, Irish voters were asked again. The 1995 divorce referendum was a hotly contested campaign, vocally opposed by the Catholic Church. Marked by prominent signs reading \"Hello Divorce, Goodbye Daddy,\" anti-divorce activists argued that Irish men would leave their wives en masse if it passed. That referendum did pass but only just: Ireland voted to repeal the country's 58-year-old constitutional ban on divorce by a razor-thin margin of less than 1% of the vote. In 1995, Ireland voted by a narrow margin to lift its 58-year-old ban on divorce.Some of that lingering anti-divorce sentiment, coupled with the current legal restrictions and the rise in cohabitating couples, are reflected in the country's current divorce rate, which is among the lowest in Europe. Married couples in Ireland tend to stay together at a far higher average compared to their EU counterparts, with a crude divorce rate of 0.7 out of 1,000 people, compared to the EU average of 1.9, according to Eurostat data. While the introduction of divorce has been viewed as a pivotal moment in Ireland's modern history, most of the Yes campaigners that CNN spoke to argue that the confines of the law continue to reflect an old Ireland, one whose constitution still has laws reflective of the Catholic Church's grip.This also includes a constitutional clause that states that a woman's place is in the home. A referendum on that was expected to take place last October in conjunction with a referendum that removed the offense of blasphemy from the constitution. It has since been postponed. Bishop Denis Nulty, chair of the Council for Marriage and the Family of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference, said in a statement Saturday that \"it is important to reflect deeply on the implications of this referendum which seeks to expedite the dissolution of marriage,\" adding that the government should \"recommit resources to marriage preparation and invest resources into marriage enrichment.\" David Graham, 37, who is currently separated, told CNN that when Ireland first introduced divorce, the \"outside world might have thought Ireland had become more progressive. But when you look at it, it's more regressive because they put in stipulations to make it very difficult to get a divorce.\"While he actively supports the upcoming referendum, he fears the new proposed wait time will still restrict separating couples' ability to move on at their own pace.  \"You go through that process and you just want to get through it, and you want to move on -- but you're in a situation you can't move on.\"",

The 29-year-old retained the Wanamaker Trophy to become the first player to win his first four majors inside two years and he is confident he has more to offer.  \"Double digits, easy! I don't see why I can't get to double digits,\" he told CNN Sport's Don Riddell when asked how many majors he can win during his career.\"I got four now, I'm 29, and they say you don't peak until you're in your thirties. So, hopefully, I peak then.\"READ: Brooks Koepka clinches fourth major at PGA ChampionshipBrooks Koepka retained the PGA Championship in 2019.

It wasn't fun,\" he said, describing his mini-meltdown when he dropped four straight shots on the last day. In @BKoepka, I see a positive, determined young man who knows where he wants to go in his career.

I mean I always had a lead, so what's there to be afraid of.\" If anything, the pressure made the win that bit sweeter. Despite two US Open titles and a PGA Championship already to his name, Koepka struggled to contain a rare show of emotion on the 18th green. \"It was special. To see that putt drop it was absolutely incredible,\" he said after clinching the win. \"The emotion I had was something I've never experienced as a golfer, something you don't see very often, even with me.\"I'm emotionless, I can be stoic at times but that one meant more to me than I think people will ever know.\"  Photos: In pictures: The 2019 PGA Championship so farBrooks Koepka successfully defended his PGA Championship title after a thrilling finish at Bethpage Black.Hide Caption 1 of 36 Photos: In pictures: The 2019 PGA Championship so farThe 29-year-old clinched his fourth major in eight events after overcoming a late wobble at Bethpage.

He now looks a fitting heir to Woods' long-term throne having beaten the Masters champion by 17 shots after two rounds.However, any chance of Koepka beating Woods' record of 10 major trophies before the age of 30 has long past. \"If somebody had said that I'd be mentioned with any of those names, I'd have just laughed at you,\" said Koepka. \"It's very humbling.

Getting credit he deserves Despite setting numerous records, the American's rise has gone somewhat under the radar with his domineering style perhaps not getting the credit it deserves. Unlike the short bursts of success enjoyed by the likes of Rory McIlroy -- whose four titles came in just over three years -- Koepka's previous three major wins have blended into the background, much like Koepka himself. Often deadpan in interviews and steely faced out on the course, the American publicly admits to having a chip on his shoulder. A muscle-bound Koepka only took up golf after a car accident ended his dreams of making it in baseball, basketball and other more athletic sports.However, he is now keen to show the world who he really is. \"I'm still finding me. I'm trying to be who I truly am, I'm not trying to please anybody else anymore,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to bite my tongue or sit back and just go about my business. I want to be me, I want to be who I truly am and I think you see a lot of who I am on the golf course.\"I viewed the media as an enemy and now I'm viewing it differently. Trying to use it as an outlet has been quite humbling, to say the least.\"",

Der Spiegel and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung report that the \"Russian\" woman offered to buy a 50% stake in Austria's Kronen Zeitung newspaper and ensure it supported the Freedom Party.Strache admitted to meeting the woman and described it as a \"private conversation\" in Ibiza. He said he was \"drunk\" but \"no donations have been made to the party\" as a result of the meeting.  \"It was a typical alcohol-infused macho behavior. ... With this I have hurt the most important person in my life, which is my wife,\" Strache said.  Sex vouchers for migrants? The truth behind Europe's fake storiesKurz had accepted his resignation, Strache said. Transport Minister Norbert Hofer, who ran for president in 2016, is expected to take over from him as head of the Freedom Party. Kurz said Strache's tactics exposed in the \"despicable\" video \"damages the reputation of our country.\"Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen said the only way forward was with \"fresh elections. \"These are shameful images,\" he said referring to the video. \"Nobody should have to be ashamed of Austria.\"Austrians have the right to have a government they can trust, a government that is esteemed and respected in Europe and the entire world,\" he added.Freedom Party politician Johann Gudenus, who was in the video translating Russian into German for Strache, also resigned Saturday.  \"With this I announce that I will retire from my position as managing club chairman and as member of parliament. I will step back from all my positions within the Freedom Party of Austria,\" Gudenus said in a statement. \"I want to express my deep regret for the things that happened more than two years ago. I deeply regret having disappointed the trust from voters, party members and co-workers.\"Controversial coalitionThe Freedom Party has long been part of Austria's political landscape. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, it first entered government 17 years ago, the first far-right party to do so in postwar Europe.Strache had sought to modernize the party, but accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia continue to linger. In April, a Freedom Party member and deputy mayor of Hitler's birthplace resigned after writing a \"deeply racist\" poem comparing migrants to rats.According to Reuters, the Freedom Party has a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party.Strache is an opponent of sanctions on Russia, which were imposed by the European Union and the United States over Russia's annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.In a 2018 interview with the newspaper Oesterreich, Strache made his position clear.\"It is high time to put an end to these exasperating sanctions and normalize political and economic relations with Russia,\" he said.Austria was also one of the few EU countries not to expel Russian diplomats in response to British allegations of Kremlin involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury in March 2018.An earlier version of this story used an incorrect acronym for the People's Party and misspelled the name of the Austrian President. This has been corrected.Journalist Denise Hruby reported from Vienna and CNN's Tara John and Sarah Dean reported from London.",

This total includes the 11 people killed during the October 2018 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US.These numbers are down slightly from the 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017, the ADL said.The decision by Kraft and Chelsea to hold a charity match came in the aftermath of last October's attack in Pittsburgh.\"When we saw this event happen in Pittsburgh we mutually wanted to do something to show our respect and concern and so it was really magnanimous of him (Abramovich) to bring his team here, especially when they are still competing for the Europa League and fly over here for seven hours,\" Kraft, who watched the game alongside Abramovich at Gillette Stadium, told CNN.\"They've visited schools, been to the Holocaust memorial in Boston, they were all at my home last night, both teams for a program.

The Prince's office declined to comment publicly on the meeting, or the agenda. But given Charles' passionate and lifelong environmentalism, and Trump's well-known climate-change skepticism, it seems inconceivable that the issue would not be discussed.Trump to make first state visit to UK in JuneCharles warned against \"potentially catastrophic global warming\" in a speech during a tour of the Caribbean in March. \"We demand the world's decision-makers take responsibility and solve this crisis,\" he said. The Trump administration, by contrast, has been accused of deprioritizing the issue, withdrawing from the Paris climate accords in 2017.Read MoreThe most likely date for the Trump-Charles encounter is June 3, the first day of the US President's visit. According to tradition, a state banquet, hosted by Queen Elizabeth, will take place on the first evening.It's unclear whether the meeting came at the behest of Downing Street, which steers the itinerary of state visits in consultation with the Palace, the Prince's office, or the White House. Downing Street declined to comment, saying it was a matter for the Palace. CNN has sought comment from the White House.A political princeIn the past, Charles has come under fire for testing the boundaries of the custom that senior British royals stay out of politics. He has often written to government ministers on subjects close to his heart -- like the environment and modern architecture.But in a recent BBC documentary celebrating his 70th birthday, the Prince promised not to meddle in matters of public debate once he takes on the role of the monarch.Trump's meeting with Charles will be the first since being elected. They previously met during a 2005 tour of the US by Charles and Camilla. Prince Charles, Camilla and Queen Elizabeth II on the balcony of Buckinbham Palace in 2018.British Prime Minister Theresa May first invited Trump for a full state visit shortly after he took office in 2016. The invitation prompted 1.8 million to sign a petition in protest.Trump's first trip to the UK as president, in July 2018, was subsequently styled as a working visit. It nevertheless prompted huge protests in central London, including a 20-foot \"Trump baby\" blimp that flew over the UK Parliament -- all with the blessing of London's Mayor Sadiq Khan.The two men have verbally sparred frequently and last week Khan said he didn't see a reason to roll out the red carpet.  But Khan doesn't get much of a say in the protocols of a presidential visit, and this time around Trump will enjoy the full trappings of a state occasion.Max Foster reported and Sheena McKenzie wrote from London.",

        "content": "(CNN)The UK government is violating its obligations to ensure families have enough food to live on, according to a damning new report from Human Rights Watch (HRW).Monday's report said austerity-motivated cuts to the country's welfare system since the Conservative Party took power in 2010 have left thousands of families with children without adequate food. As a result, families have become reliant on aid organizations.\"The UK is the fifth largest economy in the world. It really beggars belief that in this country increasing numbers, year on year, of families are going hungry,\" Kartik Raj, HRW's Western Europe researcher and author of the report, told CNN.\"The government has really shirked its responsibility in terms of protecting the rights of people to food,\" Raj continued. \"The government has a responsibility to make sure that every single one of its residents enjoys the right to food, that they have an adequate standard of living.\"The report delved into food insecurity in Hull, Cambridgeshire and Oxford, three areas of England with high deprivation levels.Read MoreHRW visited the areas to document how welfare changes and cuts to government funding have impacted Britons, conducting 126 interviews with families, volunteers and staff at food banks. The group also examined official government data and statistics. Dependence on charitable aid has surged in the last 10 years with a 5,146% increase in emergency food packages distributed, the report said, citing statistics from the Trussell Trust, the UK's largest national food bank charity.     One 23-year-old mother from Hull revealed she has skipped meals so her four-year-old daughter can eat, according to a statement from HRW.\"When you're a single mum there are very few jobs you can do that let you drop your child to school in the morning, then go to work and be back at 2.30 to pick them up. I skip meals, so my daughter can eat,\" said the mother who relies on a low-cost community pantry that redistributes surplus food from supermarkets.HRW outlined three key reasons hunger has skyrocketed in Britain. The group analyzed public spending data and found successive governments since 2010 have cut public welfare funding by 44%, \"outstripping cuts in many other areas of government expenditure.\"The report also condemned the overhaul of the welfare system known as Universal Credit -- a government program for people on low incomes that replaces many previous benefits and tax credits, combining them into a single payment. A file photograph of volunteers at London foodbank preparing food parcels in 2017.Thirdly, the report slammed the UK government's apparent snub of \"growing evidence of a stark deterioration in the standard of living for the country's poorest residents, including skyrocketing food bank use, and multiple reports from school officials that many more children are arriving at school hungry and unable to concentrate.\"A government spokesperson rejected the report's findings as \"misleading,\" in a statement to CNN.\"It's misleading to present these findings as representative of England as a whole,\" the spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said. \"We're helping parents to move into work to give families the best opportunity to move out of poverty. And it's working -- employment is at a record high and children growing up in working households are five times less likely to be in relative poverty.\"We spend \u00a395 billion ($120 billion) a year on working-age benefits and we're supporting over 1 million of the country's most disadvantaged children through free school meals. Meanwhile we've confirmed that the benefit freeze will end next year.\"A free hot meal is served by volunteers from Refugee Community Kitchen to people outside Camden Town Underground Station on April 17 in London, England. UK named Europe's worst offenderOpposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly attacked the government for neglecting the country's poorest citizens. In November, he wrote to Prime Minister Theresa May slamming her government's response to a recently published UN Special Rapporteur's report into poverty in the UK. \"The UN report should be a wake-up call about the rising levels of poverty and destitution that exist in Britain today -- this is a national emergency,\" Corbyn wrote, adding that the \"government shames our nation by being condemned for its neglect of its poorest citizens.\"\"Austerity was a political choice and the UN Special Rapporteur has laid out the consequences of your Government's policies. These policies have hit disabled people, women and BAME communities particularly hard,\" Corbyn continued, using a British term for Black, Asian and minority ethnic people.In January, the British Medical Journal put out a report that said food insecurity in UK was among the worst in Europe, particularly for children.A protester stages a food bank demonstration in central London in 2017 in London.Billy McGranaghan, founder of Dad's House, an organization assisting single fathers, told CNN of his distress at seeing so many families on the breadline.\"Poverty is everywhere, it's universal,\" McGranaghan said on Friday shortly after dropping off a food parcel to a property in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, one of capital's most affluent areas.\"No one understands the poverty in Kensington and Chelsea, especially south of the borough, where it's all stucco buildings and beautiful houses. But around the corner there's a housing estate where families are on Universal Credit and they don't have anything.\"His voice broke as he recalled going into homes and talking to parents who are struggling to get by.\"When you see the poverty with the children, they haven't (got) enough, it gets to you,\" he said with tears in his eyes.How 'holiday hunger' is haunting British familiesHRW acknowledged that some steps had been taken by the government to alleviate the impact of its welfare policy changes but said more needed to be done. It suggested fully revoking the two-child limit on some welfare payments, preventing delays in accessing Universal Credit payments, ensuring that payments keep up with inflation rates and incorporating the rising cost of food.It also called on the government to come up with a strategy for combating the hunger crisis, \"including a legal requirement to measure food insecurity and to report the results to parliament.\"Raj said: \"This rise in hunger has the UK government's fingerprints all over it.\"Standing aside and relying on charities to pick up the pieces of its cruel and harmful policies is unacceptable. The UK government needs to take urgent and concerted action to ensure that its poorest residents aren't forced to go hungry.\"",

Narrow fairways, damp, long roughs, gaping bunkers, overhanging trees. But then, Brooks Koepka on the tee, helping himself to the most supreme first round of major golf imaginable.Hide Caption 36 of 36Heir apparentLike Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, the indomitable Koepka has emerged from the firestorm of hot young pros trying to be The Next One. His major charge would seem to suggest he is the true heir apparent to Woods, the Masters champion he beat by 17 shots after two rounds.Koepka was six when Woods won the first of his 15 majors at the Masters in 1997, and he grew up with his countryman's notion that golfers should be athletes. His gym-sculpted body facilitates eye-watering power which he marries to a soft touch and an unblinking focus. While Koepka may have only won two regular PGA Tour events, his prowess on the hardest courses and in the most difficult conditions has turned him into a major machine. Other players have enjoyed major runs in short bursts, such as McIlroy, whose four titles came in just over three years, or Padraig Harrington's three in just over a year.But Koepka's kind of domination of majors has not been seen since Woods' six titles between 2005 and 2008. If the former world No.1's epic 2000-2001 run, when he held all four titles at the same time, is still the benchmark of supremacy, Koepka's current tear suggests no one would be surprised were he to get close. No player has won three straight US Opens since 1905, yet Koepka will go Pebble Beach next month as the hot favorite.\"It's been so much fun these last two years, I don't think anybody thought I would do it that fast,\" Koepka told a press conference. \"To be standing here with four majors is mind blowing. Today is the most satisfying because of how stressful that round was. I know for a fact that was the most excited I've been in my life there on 18.\"Brooks Koepka leaked four straight bogeys on his back nine to set up a dramatic finish.'Motivation'Koepka revealed earlier this week he has a \"number\" in mind for major titles. \"I don't see why you can't get to double digits [majors],\" he told reporters. Only Walter Hagen (11), Woods (15) and Nicklaus (18) have ever won more than nine major titles in the men's game.But for all his explosive exploits on the golf course, Koepka treads a paradoxical line with his public image. He's naturally reticent to be in the spotlight, and yet is riled easily when he perceives he is not getting the attention he should.  JUST WATCHEDTiger Woods wins Masters for fifth timeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTiger Woods wins Masters for fifth time 02:54\"There's always a chip, I think every great athlete has a chip on their shoulder,\" he told reporters at Bethpage. \"I use it as motivation to prove people wrong.\"His deadpan demeanor on the course is a deliberate ploy to stay focused and guard against his hot-headedness as a youngster, he says. But it works against him in the public eye as fans and the media crave characters.The young Koepka took up golf after a car accident ended his dreams of making it in baseball, basketball and other more athletic sports.After college at Florida State, he opted against following his contemporaries through the usual qualifying school route to a professional career in the US and took up membership of Europe's second-tier Challenge Tour in 2012.He traveled widely, from Kenya to Kazakhstan, learning his trade, gaining life experiences and growing up. \"It was the best time of my life,\" he has said.Four victories secured his European Tour card and a win in Turkey in 2014 propelled him back onto the US PGA Tour where he picked up a first title the following year.Koepka discovered his major mojo at the 2017 US Open at Erin Hills, and is now building a body of work that could serve as a blueprint for future generations.",

Grim images posted on the group's Facebook page show the whale lying on the beach, its stomach full of plastic bags and other plastic objects.   \"As you can see from the images we're sharing, a lot of plastic was found in its stomach,\" Greenpeace Italia's Giorgia Monti said in a statement. \"A probe of the sperm whale's death has just started and we don't know yet if the animal died because of this, but we certainly can't pretend that nothing is happening.\" \"Five sperm whales beached on Italian coasts in the last five months,\" Monti added. Read MoreExperts performed a necropsy Sunday on the whale on the beach. Carmelo Isgro, who works at the University of Messina's natural history museum and was involved in the procedure, shared graphic videos and images on Facebook.The whale carcass washed ashore at the popular tourist resort of Cefalu in Sicily on Friday.One video shows the moment scientists opened the whale's stomach and found it full of plastic bags.\"These are the squid the whale ate -- and this is all plastic,\" Isgro says in the video.In another video, Isgro is seen putting the plastic he recovered from the whale's body in a recycling bin. \"It's impressive. Unbelievable,\" he says in the video. Isgro told CNN there were \"several kilograms worth of plastic\" inside the stomach. \"The plastic probably created a block that didn't let the food in,\" he said. \"That's very likely to be the cause of death. We have not found signs that could indicate another possible reason.\"He said that the whale was so young that \"her teeth haven't come out yet.\"\"I'm still shocked because her belly was completely full, swollen with plastic,\" Isgro said. Sperm whales usually live for 70-80 years, he said. In April, a pregnant sperm whale was found in Sardinia with 22 kilograms (49 pounds) of plastic in its stomach. The dead animal, which was eight meters (26 feet) long, washed up on a beach in the tourist hotspot of Porto Cervo.\"The sea is sending us a cry of alarm, a desperate SOS. We must intervene immediately to save the wonderful creatures that inhabit it.\" Monti said. Later this month, Greenpeace and another group, the Blue Dream Project, will launch a project to monitor plastic pollution levels at sea over three weeks, with a particular focus on the central Tyrrhenian Sea, off the west coast of Italy.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)In car-loving Germany, climate change has become a leading -- but divisive -- issue for voters going into European elections.A new Deutschland Trend poll by national broadcaster ARD, shows that 48% of respondents listed climate change as their biggest concern. Everything you need to know about the European electionsOn one side are younger, urban voters, demanding immediate steps to become a carbon-neutral country. On the other, are an older, rural generation who grew prosperous under Germany's coal-powered, automobile-driven economy.\"Young people are much more involved with digitalization now,\" explains Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg-Essen.\"They are almost more happy to get the latest iPhone as a present than a car.\"Extinction Rebellion climate change activists lie on the floor to symbolize a \"mass die\" at the Gendarmenmarkt square in Berlin on April 27, 2019.Read MoreGermany has already committed to reducing carbon emissions next year by 40% from 1990 levels, 55% by 2030 and up to 95% in 2050. It's not clear though if the country can hit those targets.Energy production is by far the leading cause of emissions, and Germany has promised to phase out coal-energy plants and replace them with renewables by 2038. But transportation is the next leading cause of emissions, and getting Germans to give up their cars goes right to the heart of the country's political and cultural debate.Home to Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-BenzIt's no wonder that cars have a special place in Germany.Home to Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-Benz, the country produced 5.5 million passenger cars in 2017, according to the country's Trade and Investment Agency.Germany's Autobahn is a no-limits highway paradise for speed-loving drivers.The automobile industry employs more than 820,000 people and generates about 20% of Germany's industrial output. The autobahn -- a no-limits highway paradise for speed-loving drivers --- criss-crosses the country.But the automobile industry has been hard hit, in part by swelling climate activism as well as the fallout from \"Dieselgate,\" the 2015 emissions scandal that revealed Volkswagen, as well as others, had colluded to cheat diesel pollution regulations.Plummeting car sales were blamed for the country's shrinking GDP last year, nearly tipping the country into recession.A worker stands by Volkswagen hood ornaments at the Golf production line at the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg, Germany.\"Large segments of the population have now realized that climate change is the biggest threat. As the world steers towards reducing emissions, the carmakers have had to change their former models. And they all have moved away from old lines,\" said auto analyst Duddenhofer.\"Both VW and Mercedes as well as BMW and even the supplier have said they want to become climate neutral. We have no other option but to become purely electric.\"What does the European Parliament actually do? One clue lies in your phone billIn its Climate Action Plan 2050 unveiled earlier this year, the government promised to reduce transport emissions by 2030 by as much as 95 million tons. But the plan did not set a deadline for German cars to be emission free and evaded responsibility for stricter emission limits for new cars by stating it would be set at a European -- and not a national level.But for climate activists that is simply too little too late.In an April debate with Economy Minister Peter Altmeier, Luisa Neubauer, 23-year-old leading the Fridays For Future school strikes snapped: \"We see that our future is far lower on your priority list than is that of Volkswagen!\"Few parties have been able to capitalize on that discontent like the Greens. Once a fringe, far-left party, according to ARD the Greens are now polling at roughly 20%, neck-and-neck with its biggest rival on the left -- the once formidable Social Democrats, and far outpacing the far right, Alternative for Germany (AfD).\"People have realized that the idea of climate change -- a climate crisis -- is real,\" says Oliver Krischner, a leading member of the Greens party.\"I think that pays off for us now. Even when we were unpopular and we did not make the headlines, we clearly gave priority to climate change. And voters see when one is genuine and serious talking about such a big public issue.\"Climate activists Greta Thunberg mockedWhile the public seems to support more action on climate change, recent polls show Germans are divided on what steps to take.Sex vouchers for migrants? The truth behind Europe's fake storiesA poll taken earlier this month by national broadcaster ARD showed that 81% of respondents demanded immediate action to reduce emissions but less than 34% supported political proposals, like a carbon tax.And not everyone in Germany is convinced that climate change is a problem.Germany's far-right populist party AfD has campaigned for the EU elections by saying it wants to be the party that \"saves diesel,\" not the climate. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has been mocked by some AfD members.Some AfD members have mocked Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden, as \"Saint Greta\" leading a quixotic rabble of teenage protesters.But for all their taunts, the AFD could be reacting to recent poll numbers from the weekly Deutschland Trendpoll by the ARD that show unusually heightened interest in the EU elections this year, with 63% of respondents said they were \"very interested.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The Netherlands triumphed at a controversial Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel, taking home the title in a kitsch competition that found itself dancing around an uncomfortably political spotlight.Duncan Laurence was the firm favorite before the show, and the little-known Dutch singer received rapturous applause in the arena after performing his song \"Arcade.\" He confirmed victory after scoring strongly with both the public and national juries, beating Italy and Russia to the title.\"This is to dreaming big. This is to music first, always,\" he said after being confirmed as winner -- the first victor his country has had since 1975. The United Kingdom, by contrast, slumped to the bottom spot.The contest also featured a performance from American superstar Madonna, and a crowd-pleasing segment that saw previous winners sing hit songs from the competition's history.But, like a handful of editions in the past, it struggled to shake off an overbearing political row. After protests in the host city and abroad leading up to the show, popular Icelandic group Hatari raised Palestinian flags during the broadcast.Read MoreMadonna had a message of her own, featuring dancers with both Palestinian and Israeli flags on their backs.The contest will next head to the Netherlands, with the winning nation taking over hosting duties for a year. The country's victory is its fifth in total, joining the UK, France and Luxembourg in the all-time ranks. Only Ireland and Sweden, which the Netherlands topped for the title, have won more contests.Duncan Laurence, representing the Netherlands, performs at the show.Here's a look at a few of the other big moments from a memorable show.Iceland's heavy metal entryPerhaps the most eagerly-anticipated contestants of the night, Icelandic synth-bondage-metal group Hatari held true to their appeal with a shouty and strobe-ridden performance.Two members of the group had told CNN they were keen to politicize the event, and they did so after their set by holding up Palestinian flags during the results rundown. They managed a respectable Top 10 finish, but failed to get past the more traditional Eurovision fare produced by the Netherlands, Italy, Russia and Switzerland.Australia's operatic numberIf you're wondering why Australia takes part in Eurovision, you're not alone. But in its fifth appearance since joining as a \"one-off\" act to celebrate the 60th show, the country produced a showstopper.Kate Miller-Heidke's entry \"Zero Gravity\" featured an operatic-style chorus and a barnstorming key change, and it came within a whisker of winning.Scoring well with national juries, Australia ultimately only managed to finish ninth. That result averted inevitable questions about where exactly next year's show would be hosted, given the logistical difficulties of it taking halfway around the world. Conchita Wurst joins previous winnersConchita Wurst's win for Austria in 2014 propelled the onstage drag persona of Thomas Neuwirth to the top tier of Eurovision victors. So a reappearance on the Eurovision stage was hotly anticipated -- but rather than performing that year's winning single, Conchita sang \"Heroes,\" Mans Zelmerlow's 2015 winner for Sweden.Eurovision: What is it and what time is it on?That kicked off a segment of the show that would have thrilled hardcore Eurovision fans, as a series of previous winners came out to sing tunes from fellow title-holders. Zelmerlow performed last year's runner-up, Cyprus' \"Fuego,\" but the highlight was the return of Verka Serduchka. The Ukrainian performer became perhaps the quintessential example of Eurovision-related weirdness with their eyebrow-skyrocketing number in 2007. The moment was rounded off by a group performance of \"Hallelujah,\" performed by Gali Atari, who won for host Israel in 1979.Madonna's set fails to impress someMadonna followed in the footsteps of Justin Timberlake a few years prior, adding a huge American name to a uniquely European event. The pop superstar opened her show with her classic hit \"Like A Prayer\" before entering into her new single, \"Future,\" alongside Atlanta rapper Quavo.Eurovision: Madonna mixes politics with a classic hit during performanceBut her set didn't impress everyone, with some on social media questioning her vocals on a few key notes.The star also used the opportunity to comment on the region's political tensions. As the set ended, two dancers walked off arm in arm, with an Israeli flag on the back of one and the Palestinian flag on the other.\"You're all winners,\" she told the show's contestants before taking to the stage. \"Let's never underestimate the power of music to bring people together.\"Tears, fireworks and leather trousersDespite the controversies, the night was a showpiece that would have disappointed few Eurovision fans. Israel's homegrown performer Kobi Marimi broke down in tears after performing his appropriately named number \"Home.\" It scored a wild reception from the partisan crowd, but ultimately placed just four spots from the bottom.The UK managed to do even worse, finishing in 26th -- dead last. It's a position the country has become accustomed to in recent years, with national juries and the voting public frequently critical of its entries -- only once since 2014 has Britain climbed above the 24th spot. And national dress, skin-tight outfits and plenty of pyrotechnics all made their usual appearances, in a show many on social media commended for its overall musical quality.",

Like many other high-profile sportsmen and women, the heavyweight champion hasn't been afraid to speak out on social issues and is determined to use his lofty platform to instill change.  It's a philosophy that's been mirrored by England and Manchester City star Raheem Sterling, who has emerged as football's unofficial spokesperson in the battle against racism -- calling out the media and governing bodies for a lack of action.\"I feel like our parents' generation has been sleeping to a certain degree, conditioned to be scared to speak up about certain issues,\" Joshua told CNN Sport's Don Riddell, commenting about the increase in athletes speaking out.  \"They [current athletes] are now becoming smarter, wiser and sharper and being able to discuss their situation.\"JUST WATCHEDAnthony Joshua on his past and presentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAnthony Joshua on his past and present 03:17Read MoreREAD: Anthony Joshua reveals his biggest fear and future ambitionsPraise for SterlingSterling and his England teammates were subjected to racist abuse during a Euro 2020 qualifying match in Montenegro in March and Juventus' teenage striker Moise Kean endured monkey chants from opposition fans in May. Recently, English Premier League striker Troy Deeney joined Sterling in a 24-hour boycott of social media platforms, in protest against the lack of action being taken in response to racism.Deeney also felt it necessary to turn off comments on his Instagram posts due to abuse he received in April.\"To me this isn't a game, when you racially abuse my family or myself I have to take measures to prevent young people seeing these comments and thinking that it's acceptable,\" said Deeney on social media. The 30-year-old is close friends with Joshua due to their respective associations with Watford -- Joshua is from the town and Deeney captains the current side. \"The guys are getting a lot smarter. It's not just about kicking a football anymore and being a good footballer, it's about being an ambassador of football,\" Joshua said, speaking about those players who have taken on a more activist role.Johsua praised Raheem Sterling for his work in the fight against racism.

That's what I live for.\"Brooks Koepka is ploughing a lone furrow at the US PGA.'I'm going to need some help'Johnson and co. will be desperately searching for some kind of chink in Koepka's armor. They may cling to his back-to-back bogeys at nine and 10 Saturday, or a number of drives pushed out to the right, mistakes which could multiply should the pressure of trying to maintain his lead intensify.Or they may reach for the history books, which record that Scotland's Paul Lawrie came from a record 10 shots back on the final day to overhaul the befuddled Jean van de Velde in the Open at  Carnoustie in 1999. Then there's the eight shots retrieved by Jack Burke Jr at the Masters in 1956, or the seven shot deficits erased by Arnold Palmer in the 1960 US Open or John Mahaffey at the US PGA in 1978.Johnson himself has experience of disappointment at majors and leads disappearing through his hands, such as blowing a three-shot lead heading into the final round of the 2010 US Open at Pebble Beach.\"I'm going to need some help from him [Koepka], and then I'm going to have to play very, very well,\" Johnson, the 2016 US Open champion, told reporters.Koepka, though, isn't planning to help anyone.   \"I know if I can get off to a good start, guys got to push, and if you're going to push on this golf course, you're going to make mistakes,\" he added. \"I just have to have the same mentality, focus on myself and not anybody else. And at the same time, staying patient and staying in the moment, and every time I do it, I feel like I'm getting better and better at it.\"",

The new election is not a wish, it is a necessity,\" Chancellor Kurz said. The snap election decision was sparked by the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache on Saturday, after a video surfaced showing him appearing to offer government contracts to a woman who claimed to be a Russian investor and niece of an oligarch.\"What is important now, and that is the uppermost requirement, is to ascertain a full explanation of what happened. We need all the suspicious facts which have arisen as a result of the video to be verified; that naturally concerns themes of potential abuse of power, to questions of potential criminal concern,\" Kurz added. Strache also resigned as head of the Freedom Party on Saturday. He denied doing \"anything against the law,\" calling the allegations against him a \"targeted political attack.\" Read MoreSpeaking alongside the Chancellor on Sunday, President der Bellen said the government's main task now is to \"rebuild the trust\" in Austria's institutions, adding that this can \"only be done through new elections,\" which are to be held in September.

He said he was \"drunk\" but \"no donations have been made to the party\" as a result of the meeting.Everything you need to know about the European elections\"It was a typical alcohol-infused macho behavior. ... With this I have hurt the most important person in my life, which is my wife,\" Strache said.Kurz -- who swept to power in 2017 after taking a tough, anti-immigration stance -- said on Saturday that Strache's tactics exposed in the \"despicable\" video \"damages the reputation of our country.\"He added that it was the last straw in a number of smaller scandals, Reuters reported.  The Freedom Party, founded by former Nazi officers in the 1950s, has long been part of Austria's political landscape. It first entered government 17 years ago, the first far-right party to do so in postwar Europe.Strache had sought to modernize the party, but accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia continue to linger.In April, a Freedom Party member and deputy mayor of Hitler's birthplace resigned after writing a \"deeply racist\" poem comparing migrants to rats.CNN's Nada Bashir contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Ah, Eurovision -- the kitsch, camp, glitzy annual spectacle that captivates a continent and profoundly confuses the rest of the world.The annual singing competition attracts hundreds of millions of viewers, has given the world acts including Abba, Celine Dion and Olivia Newton-John, and may even have brought Europe together in the wake of the World War II.But truly understanding the joys and many, many oddities of Eurovision is trickier than it seems. It blends geopolitical skullduggery and skin-tight leather trousers like no other international event can. It sees entire countries glued to their televisions, certain in the knowledge that victory alone can secure a unifying sense of national pride. And -- most importantly -- it tears through copious amounts of glitter, crates of pyrotechnics and wardrobes full of frilly national dress, all in the name of transboundary cooperation. Make sense yet? Don't worry -- here's an explainer.Read MoreWhat is Eurovision?In simple terms, it's an international singing competition organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). It takes place once a year, and is hosted by the previous edition's winning country. There are two semi-finals, and a grand final, which this year is taking place on Saturday in Tel Aviv, Israel. Of course, it's also so much more than that. The show features awkward back-and-forths between presenters, plenty of political messaging, a few big talking points and a controversy or seven. This year, Madonna is even performing during the interval.But the contest's lore throughout Europe comes mainly from the downright absurdity of the contestants taking part. Just how weird are we talking? We'll get to that...Finland's Lordi performs the song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" during the 51st Eurovision final song contest in 2006.How did it all start?The story of the origins of Eurovision is surprisingly noble. Tasked with bringing together a continent torn apart by war, the fledgling EBU organized a musical contest. Seven countries took part the first time around, with the live event testing the limits of the new and shiny technology called \"television.\" The contest rapidly expanded, and its message of peace and harmony was eagerly embraced -- that's why, today, Europe remains a united and carefree region with a contented population and almost no cross-boundary divisions to note. OK, we may be exaggerating that last part.Swedish pop group Abba performs during the Eurovision Song Contest 1974.Who takes part?Any member country of the EBU can take part, and that includes countries on the fringes of Europe such as Morocco, Jordan and this year's hosts, Israel. The Vatican is technically a member too, but their long-overdue entry into the Eurovision fray is tragically yet to materialize. Australia, though not quite within the boundaries of Europe, also takes part.Eurovision faces backlash as musical kitschfest hits IsraelThis year, 41 countries entered, but those were whittled down to 26 via two semi-finals. Because they're the five biggest financial contributors to the EBU, the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy all qualify for the final automatically -- a reward worth paying any price for. Each country performs a three-minute song once, during a very, very long and somewhat emotionally draining broadcast. Singers can sing in any language -- most choose English, but plenty opt for their own -- and they don't even need to be from the competing country. Many countries choose their contestant in a televised competition. The possibilities are endless -- washed-up boybands, regional superstars, novelty acts and more all take part on an annual basis.Then, for those viewers still sober enough to process numbers, the results are announced -- each country hands out points to their favorite competing nations, separately revealing the scores from an expert jury and the public vote. Countries give 12 points to their top dog, 10 to their second-favorites, and between one and eight for their honorable mentions. Votes are read out, via satellite link, by a national celebrity in each of the countries that entered the contest, so we get a whistlestop tour of over 40 European capital cities. \"Hello Tel Aviv!\" they'll all shout, before milking their fifteen seconds in the spotlight and desperately trying to keep it together despite an excruciating delay in the video link. Scores are are announced in English and French -- and so the dreaded prospect of \"nil points\" hangs over every nation until they finally get on the board. John and Edward Grimes of the band Jedward perform for Ireland in 2011.Wait, why is Australia in Eurovision?No one's quite sure. The country was invited to join as a \"one-off\" in 2015, to celebrate the contest's 60th anniversary, but it has stuck around ever since. In theory, it's because Australians have loved Eurovision for decades -- despite it starting in the early hours of the morning, it is broadcast annually by TV channel SBS. If Australia won, the following year's contest would likely be held in a European country of its choosing -- which probably presents Britain's best chance of ever hosting the competition again.How popular is it?Oh, it's huge. Around 186 million viewers watched last year's competition, according to the EBU. Certain regions within Europe take it especially seriously -- Scandinavian nations have long been obsessed and can boast a long list of winners. In Iceland in 2018, more than 95% of television sets were tuned in to Eurovision -- despite the country not even qualifying for the final.Popularity varies from country to country, but few nations can honestly say they're uninterested. The UK likes to pretend it's above the whole thing, but Brits are secretly seething that the once-successful nation hasn't taken home the crown since 1997. They like to put the drought down to all manner of political motivations -- currently, Brexit seems the most logical explanation -- and stubbornly refuse to accept the possibility that their entries are just not very good.Who's won the most?Ireland has the most wins, with seven, but the majority of those were from the early days of the contest, and Sweden need just one more victory to equal their record. Monaco are the smallest country to have won, with their David vs. Goliath triumph coming in 1971.Overall, 27 countries have won the contest. Portugal was the most recent new winner, taking home the title in 2017.OK, how weird are these performances?I thought you'd never ask. In recent years, Eurovision has seen an ethno-pop band called Buranovskiye Babushki comprised of eight Russian grandmothers; a pair of rapping Montenegrin astronauts; an all-female Polish group who churned butter throughout their performance; a Ukrainian dancer in a hamster wheel; and Ukrainian superstar Verka Serduchka, who... well, it might just be easier to see for yourself. That came in second.Not quite every country opts for such an over-the-top spectacle. On Saturday, as is the case every year, there will be a handful of drab ballads about peace, and a few more about love. But with every nation keen to stand out from the pack, even the most straightforward tunes can be presented in some eyebrow-raising ways.All hail the absurd joy of EurovisionThe chorus to Greece's 2013 ska-punk entry was the statement \"alcohol is free\" sung ad nauseum, while Estonia's 2008 performance included dancers in bikinis holding up pictures of onions, for no clear reason. And Eurovision always manages to stay current -- so current, in fact, that San Marino's 2012 entry was called \"The Social Network Song,\" and featured the lyrics: \"If you wanna come to my house, then click me with your mouse.\" But most topical expressions are political: Ukraine's winning 2016 song, \"1944,\" for example, detailed the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union and severely angered Russia.So expect bright colors, perhaps some magic tricks, a few questionable hairstyles... and most importantly, expect the unexpected.Is it always so controversial?Absolutely. Eurovision vaguely resembles Christmas Day -- it's circled on the calendar months before, and millions look forward to it with bated breath. Then, when it finally arrives, everyone falls out with each other and the whole thing descends into one giant shouting match. With sequins.Officially, no \"lyrics, speeches (or) gestures of a political nature\" are allowed during the contest -- but if you believe that, you'll believe anything.In fact, Eurovision's history has always been connected with the continent's politics. It's been alleged that, as early as 1968, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco oversaw a campaign of vote-buying to hand victory to Spain, over the heavily favored British entry Cliff Richard.JUST WATCHEDRussia blames politics for Eurovision lossReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussia blames politics for Eurovision loss 03:38More recently, Lebanon pulled out of its scheduled Eurovision debut in 2005 during a spat over its refusal to broadcast the Israeli performance. And in 2009, a year after Russian-Georgian tensions reached a flashpoint in South Ossetia, Georgia withdrew its entry for the Moscow contest, after unsuccessfully arguing that their entry \"We Don't Wanna Put In\" had nothing to do with the Russian President.And then there's the ever-present complaint of political voting, with clear regional blocs of nations always seeming to gift each other plenty of points. That explains why more isolated nations really need to go above and beyond to win.Editions in cities such as Baku have also drawn complaints over the human rights records of competing nations. This year's contest, in Tel Aviv, has been particularly controversial, coming at a tense time for the country after a flare-up of violence between militants in Gaza and the Israeli military.Who's going to win this year?There's plenty of money on the Dutch entry this year. Their entry is 25-year-old superstar Duncan Laurence. You know, Duncan Laurence. You haven't heard of Duncan Laurence? In fact, he's little-known even at home. But his debut single \"Arcade\" is attracting plenty of buzz among Eurovision experts and performed well in the semi-finals -- meaning the Netherlands are in pole position to claim their first Eurovision title since 1975. Australia are also in the running, but if they pulled off their first ever Eurovision victory it would likely cause chaos back in Europe. With Brexit, political division and regional disputes dominating headlines, it would surely be a cruel step too far if Europe can't even win its own singing competition.The Swiss entry has earned some love, and Sweden are always a good bet. But watch out, too, for Iceland -- their techno-bondage-synth-punk act Hatari have raised eyebrows already, and they're sure to provide one of Saturday's most memorable performances.Iceland's Hatari performs the song Hatri\u00f0 mun sigra during the first semi-final of this year's contest.Eurovision sounds great. How do I watch it?That's the spirit. If you're in Europe but you've so far held out against embracing the wondrous tradition that is Eurovision, you'll likely be able to find it on a terrestrial broadcaster. US networks only began showing the event in recent years, and there are no plans to broadcast it this time -- but worry not, as there'll be an official live stream on YouTube. Swedish broadcaster SVT will also put up an on-demand repeat, which can be watched anywhere.It starts on Saturday night at 8 p.m. in the UK (3 p.m. ET).",

        "content": "Brisbane, Australia (CNN)The night before the Western Australian state election in 2013, a group of friends sat around discussing how they would vote.Amid the deep debate on politics and policies, a more pressing question emerged. Being millennials, they immediately posted it on Twitter. Scott Morrison, Prime Minister of Australia, cooks sausages during a Liberal Party Campaign Rally at Launceston Airport on April 18, 2019\"Hey everyone, let us know where you find your sausage sizzle tomorrow #democracysausage,\" says Kimberley Seats, recalling the tweet which has since become part of Australian political folklore.The group does not lay claim to coining the phrase, which formally entered the Australian lexicon in 2016, when the Australian National Dictionary Center declared \"democracy sausage\" the word (or phrase) of the year.But it has staked a claim to the term on social media, with Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts, as well as a website which maps where Australians can buy a sausage -- or sweeter options -- when they fulfill their civic duty to vote.Read MoreThis year, the Aussie democracy sausage obsession has gone global with sizzles at consulates -- including London, New York, Tokyo, Berlin, Kuala Lumpur and Vanuatu -- where expats have already cast their votes.When you already sent a postal vote but turn up to @AusHouseLondon just for the snags #AusVotes19 #democracysausage pic.twitter.com/zV3Z0ReYH7\u2014 Stacey Fenton (@staceyfenton) May 11, 2019\n\nGiving the Australian Consulate General in New York a bit of competition with a #democracysausage \ud83c\udf2d cook-off for staff at the Embassy.

So far this election season, the sausage emoji has been added to more than two million tweets.The social media site has also teamed up with Democracy Sausage to allow Australian users to find a sausage via a Twitter chatbot on the day of polling, Saturday. Google is also using the data in an interactive map.Wondering where to vote on Saturday? Check out the #AusVotes Election Map to find a polling booth and #democracysausage near you https://t.co/8yaZf9KslM #auspol\u2014 Google Australia NZ (@googledownunder) May 16, 2019\n\nHow did it come to this?Buying snacks at polling booths is not a new phenomenon, says political historian Judith Brett, author of \"From secret ballot to democracy sausage: How Australia got compulsory voting.\"\"Certainly, there's a photo in the 1930s of a polling booth with a cake stall outside, so I think community organizations saw it was an opportunity to fund-raise,\" Brett says.Fund-raising was an unintended consequence of compulsory voting, a policy introduced in 1924 after World War I. All Australians aged over 18 are still required to vote, and can be fined $20 Australian ($14) or taken to court if they don't comply.Labor leader Bill Shorten and Labor candidate for Boothby Nadia Clancy hand out sausages to supporters during a community BBQ on May 14.The introduction of compulsory voting meant polling booths attracted enough people willing to spend their money on cake or jam, with proceeds used to help stock the school library or buy new equipment.Sausages started appearing at community events with the advent of portable barbecues in the 1980s, Brett says.  The sausage, slapped on a piece a bread with optional onion and a squirt of ketchup, is now something of a local culinary icon.  However, Brett says it is not compulsory voting that has led to today's sausage sizzles, but a law introduced in 1911 which decrees that polling day must be a Saturday. With children off school, voting became a family affair and something of a social function as well as a civic duty. \"The other crucial thing is that Australians are not tied to vote at a particular polling booth,\" Brett says, so unlike many other countries, friends can opt to vote together.Liberal Party supporter Dorothy Dehais has a sausage during a campaign rally at Launceston airport on April 18.This year, a record 16,424,248 Australians have registered to vote, meaning turnout will be close to 96%, compared to 61% in the US in 2016 and almost 69% in the UK in 2017. Voting is optional in both those countries. The Australian Electoral Commission says 1.4 million people failed to vote in the last election in 2016, but only a \"relatively small number\" are typically taken to court.Brett can't see an end to compulsory voting -- surveys suggest it is popular with voters -- and in some respects she says it acts as a stabilizing force.\"It means that people who are slightly less agitated and aggrieved also vote. We've had people saying things like because of compulsory voting it's the sensible center that decides elections rather than the fringes,\" she says.When polls opened on Saturday, the team at Democracy Sausage had plotted more than 1,800 locations where voters could expect a sausage with their voting cards.

It was something that was made clear by the royal couple during and after the pregnancy -- when the world was left to wait a couple of days for the name and first images of their son. Speculation on where Archie was born has finally been put to rest with Friday's release of his birth certificate.The birth certificate of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.Here are three things we learned from the document: Archie was born in London  Read MoreIn the days leading up to the birth, there was speculation in the tabloid press that Meghan would opt for a home birth at Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor. Some British media later reported that she gave birth in London. Duchess Meghan celebrates her first Mother's Day with new photo of baby ArchieThe certificate shows Archie was born in the Portland Hospital, a private hospital in London's West End. A spokeswoman for the Portland Hospital said in a statement: \"Huge congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of baby Archie.\"For reasons of patient confidentiality, we are unable to provide any comment or information.\"Meghan's occupation is listed as PrincessOn the certificate Meghan's job is listed as \"Princess of the United Kingdom.\" While Meghan has Princess as an occupation, she will never officially be called Princess Meghan as she does not have royal blood. Only direct descendents of the royal bloodline are allowed the title of Prince and Princess followed by their first name. Royal baby photo revealed by Harry and MeghanThe royal family is riddled with arcane traditions and protocol, which includes one that says the wife's position in the pecking order is validated by her husband of royal blood.So even if Meghan has the job title of Princess, she is formally known as Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex -- which the Queen gave to her ahead of their wedding in 2018. Harry registered the birth Prince Harry registered Archie's birth himself, according to the certificate. It also shows the new dad took 11 days to do so -- the registration date is listed as May 17. When a couple is married in the UK, only one parent is required on the register. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Arrogant. Uninspiring. Out of touch. These are just some of the ways that Australian voters have described both of their prospective prime ministers in polls ahead of Saturday's national election.Australia doesn't really like either its Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, or Opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten. In surveys of who would make a better leader, a full quarter of Australians can't even pick between the two.But with Australia one of the few countries in the world to have compulsory voting, they have to cast their ballot for someone on Saturday, which experts are saying could lead to a record third-party vote.More than anything else, amid a merry-go-round of prime ministers and a lack of leadership, Australians are just fed up with both major parties, former Liberal Party leader John Hewson told CNN.\"Basically both parties are self-absorbed, scoring points on each other, inside the party or between parties, so basically all the big issues have just been left adrift,\" he said.Read More\"(Voters) are so cynical and they've had enough.\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison is given a pineapple hat from a vendor as he visits the Sydney Markets on May 16.A union man and a committed ChristianVoting is due to close at 6 p.m. local time in eastern Australia (4 a.m. ET), with the final ballots expected to be deposited two hours later in the west of the country.Results should be known within a few hours of the booths closing. Polls taken shortly before the vote showed a tight race with a slight advantage to the center-left Labor Party.Neither of the two competitors for Australia's next prime minister has a high international profile -- even the incumbent Morrison has only been in the job eight months.Morrison is a former Tourism Australia chief executive and committed Pentecostal Christian who quickly gained a reputation across Australia as immigration minister in 2013 and 2014.He claimed credit for stopping the refugee boats coming to Australia and effectively implementing the country's notorious offshore detention centers, which human rights groups have described as \"open-air prisons.\" Labor Leader Bill Shorten and Labor Candidate for Boothby Nadia Clancy hand out sausages in Adelaide on May 14.His opponent, Bill Shorten, has been the Labor leader for almost six years. Shorten rose to power through the union movement, during which time he headed up the Australian Worker's Union, one of the country's largest.But Shorten also brings baggage with him to the Saturday vote. As a powerful powerbroker in Labor's center-right faction, Shorten was seen as one of the masterminds behind the toppling of Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2010, an event which preceded nine years of leadership chaos across both parties. It earned him a reputation as \"untrustworthy.\" Australians haven't always distrusted their politicians. Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who died on Thursday at the age of 89, was hugely popular during most of his time in power. John Warhurst, emeritus professor of politics at the Australian National University, told CNN there was just a general lack of enthusiasm for these two current options.\"None of them have that indefinable popularity that someone like (former leaders) Malcolm Turnbull or Bob Hawke had, they don't naturally make a very positive connection with the Australian community,\" he said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Bill Shorten shake hands at the start of \"The Leaders' Debate'' on May 8 in Canberra.Leadership chaosIf Shorten wins to become Australia's new prime minister, he would be the sixth leader in just over a decade.The rapid changeover of prime ministers in party leadership contests has become a national and international joke, with some comparing Australia to other dysfunctional democracies like Italy and Greece.Australia is being devastated by climate change. So will it swing the election?Tony Abbott promised to end the leadership turmoil after he won the 2013 election. But less than two years later he was kicked out by his own party for Turnbull.Turnbull narrowly won the 2016 national election against Shorten, only to be on the receiving end of the knife in August 2018, replaced with Morrison.Former Liberal Party leader Hewson said the constant changes had not only eroded voter trust in politicians, but also pulled national attention away from issues important to Australia's future.\"All the big issues have been left adrift, whether its housing affordability, or electricity prices, there's been a whole lot of areas which probably need great structural reform,\" he said.Record-high voter dissatisfactionIn a survey after the 2016 election, the Australian National University found the country's dissatisfaction with democracy was at an all-time high.Of almost 3,000 voters interviewed, 40% said they were unhappy with Australia's democracy, 56% said the government was run for a few big interests and a record 74% said people in government just \"look after themselves.\"Australian politicians are targeting voters on WeChat. But fake content could end up costing them As more and more Australians grow dissatisfied, voters have been turning to minor parties in record numbers.At the last election in 2016, more Australians cast ballots for a third-party candidate than at any time since the end of World War II. In the country's upper house, the Senate, one in three votes was for neither the Labor party or the Liberal National coalition.And recent polls suggest minor parties are unlikely to go away in the 2019 vote.\"They're providing some relief valves for people who want to go anywhere but the major parties,\" Warhurst said.Election you may not want to winShould Shorten win on Saturday, he will face a difficult battle to get his ambitious agenda through parliament. The Labor Party wants to take action on climate change, increase taxes on the wealthy and boost funding to schools and hospitals.Morrison has pledged to keep the economy strong, slash debt and reduce taxes across the board.But Hewson said neither side had addressed an important reality during campaigning -- Australia's slowing economy.\"The headwinds of our economy are very significant, there's a lot of complacency and ... you haven't had a recession in over 20 years,\" he said. \"(But) you can't rule it out in the next 12 to 18 months.\"",

The court was also told that he targeted Cooper because she was from the Labour Party, which he blamed for immigration in the UK.Renshaw raised his arm to the public gallery in what appeared to be a Nazi salute as he was taken out of the courtroom.The judge, Honorable Justice Maura McGowan, said she acknowledged Renshaw was young, naive and came from a troubled background. However, she said: \"You are an intelligent young man. You may be troubled but you know full well what you have done.\"Read MoreA CPS photo of the weapon Renshaw intended to use.\"Your perverted view of history and current politics has caused you to believe it right to demonize groups simply because they are different from you,\" McGowan continued.\"This is a case in which only a sentence of life imprisonment can meet the appalling seriousness of your offending,\" she ended.British politicians advised to take taxis home amid fears of Brexit violenceThere were gasps from the public gallery as the sentence was read out. A man shouted, \"We're with you Jack, we're with you\" while giving him a thumbs-up, and a woman sobbed.A victim impact statement from Cooper, read to the court by the CPS, said: \"I wish I could say that this planned attack on my life hasn't changed me or my life but sadly it has had a detrimental impact.\"To be informed that a stranger wished to murder you, to decapitate you, hold your staff hostage and exchange them for a police officer and after a further murder, themselves die at the hands of the police -- suicide by cop -- is something out of a horror movie, not life as I know it,\" the lawmaker said.Rosie Cooper, MP for West Lancashire.CPS Head of Counter Terrorism Division Jenny Hopkins said in a statement: \"A crime of this type against anyone is a serious matter but when our MPs are targeted it is also an attack on the democratic process and public service.\"Jack Renshaw was prepared to act on his white supremacist world view and plotted to kill a Member of Parliament -- a plan reminiscent of the abhorrent murder of Jo Cox MP.Where the threat to free speech really lies\"He also made threats against a police officer and his prison sentence reflects the seriousness of the offenses.\"Renshaw has been ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison.British politician Jo Cox was slain in a violent and frenzied street attack in northern England in 2016. She was shot and stabbed as she left a meeting with some of her constituents and later died as a result of her injuries.

Pechier worked at two private clinics in Besan\u00e7on, eastern France.Pechier worked in two private clinics.Investigators allege that he tampered with medical equipment so colleagues would administer dangerously high levels of local anesthetic or potassium to patients aged between 4 and 80 who were undergoing minor operations.When the patients went into cardiac arrest as a result, Pechier would step in to revive them and show off his apparent skill as a doctor, investigators allege.Read MoreCNN affiliate BFM TV reported that Pechier was a highly regarded doctor in the region.Manteaux told reporters that Pechier was in \"open conflict\" with fellow anesthesiologists at one clinic during the time many of the incidents occurred.Pechier, who denies the allegations, faces life imprisonment if convicted.Manteaux told reporters that Pechier was \"the common denominator\" in the new cases, and was \"most often found close to the operating room\" when the patient's condition worsened.Pechier also made quick decisions on the appropriate course of action, \"even when nothing allowed anyone to suspect an overdose of potassium or local anesthesia,\" said Manteaux.\"There is a possibility that Dr. Pechier was the author of these poisonings but this hypothesis is nothing but a hypothesis and this long inquiry over two years has shown nothing ... to the extent that in this instance, the presumption of innocence must be stressed,\" Jean-Yves Le Borgne, one of Pechier's lawyers, told reporters Thursday, according to the AFP news agency.Manteaux had pressed for Pechier to be held in custody, but he was released overnight, another of Pechier's lawyers, Randall Schwerdorffer, told AFP Friday.Manteaux told AFP he would appeal the decision to release Pechier, with a judge expected to rule on the matter within 15 days.Sandrine Simard, spokeswoman for Avapolvi, an association representing victims of the poisonings, told reporters that they cannot accept the decision to allow the doctor out of police custody.\"We are shocked about this decision, especially when taking into account the charges against him,\" said Simard.\"For us, it is inconceivable that he should be free.\"CNN's Audrey Legrais contributed to this report.",

Katherine Legge and Michaela Cerruti drove just six races between them in the sport's inaugural campaign.This season, ex-Formula 1 test driver Susie Wolff has become Formula E's  first female team boss, taking the helm at Venturi -- and the calm and collected Scot is surprised she's still making headlines as a high-profile female in racing's male-dominated world.\"I thought the whole gender issue was over when I stopped racing!\" she tells CNN. \"But I can also see that it's causing quite a lot of interest with me being a team principal.\"Read MoreDe Silvestro -- who drove for the American Andretti Autosport team in the 2015/2016 Formula E campaign -- is also used to the glare of the spotlight.\"As a woman ... there is more scrutiny,\" she explains to CNN. \"If I have a bad weekend sometimes people will [find it] easier to say 'Oh it's because she's a girl.'\"JUST WATCHEDMeet the leading lady of Formula E: Simona de SilvestroReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the leading lady of Formula E: Simona de Silvestro 03:21READ: Forget A to B, electric cars can now get you from London to ParisREAD: How to drive a 225kph electric race carNot enough role modelsTo go from a novelty to the norm is, what Wolff describes as, a \"two-step problem.\"She explains: \"The first issue is there's not enough role models, enough women that are visible to inspire the next generation. \"That leads to the second problem, that we simply don't have enough women entering the sport.\"Change comes through opportunity and in December, Formula E staged a unique initiative for female racers in collaboration with the organizers of the Saudi Arabia E-Prix.

In total, nine females took part, making it the sport's highest female participation event.  \"It was a great initiative,\" Tatiana Calderon, who was chosen by DS Techeetah to take part in the test, tells CNN.\"Sometimes people don't want to give you the chance to express all your talent so 'forcing' the teams to take a female was great. \"It's a big challenge, you only have one day to give a good impression and you need to gain the confidence and trust from the team.\"Formula E founder and chairman Alejandro Agag now plans to make these inclusive tests an annual event. \"We will have tests for women at least once a year,\" he tells CNN. \"It is part of my agenda.\"The more track time women have in the car, the more chances there are that we can get one or two competing in the championship.\"DS were so impressed with the Calderon that they offered her, and Briton's Jamie Chadwick who drove in Saudi for NIO, the chance to test again in Marrakesh. Tatiana Calderon has been testing for the DS Techeetah team.Creating chances for female talent\"After Saudi they wanted me to test again so that means they saw the potential,\" explains Calderon. \"If the Saudi test hadn't happened I wouldn't have had that chance.\"That's exactly what we need in order to get to the top of the series, people giving you chances. It's about creating opportunities for female talent, then it's up to you to open that door fully so they commit to helping you.\"Calderon's determination is working. As well as racing in the Formula 2 championship this season -- the feeder series for F1 -- the Colombian has also been retained as a test driver for the Alfa Romeo F1 team after impressing in a show run in Mexico and a private test for the team at the end of 2018. JUST WATCHEDTatiana Calderon: Future Formula One driver?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTatiana Calderon: Future Formula One driver? 06:23Di Silvestro, who finished as the fastest female at the Saudi test, agrees having support from within a team is crucial. She is signed to Wolff's Venturi team as a test driver and is also as an ambassador for Formula E's title sponsor ABB.\"I'm lucky to even be in a team,\" she says. \"If Susie wasn't there I don't think anybody else would be giving me a shot, but she really believes in me. \"It's quite special for me that she has given me this opportunity to help the team with the tests and simulator work. I have to prove that I can get the job done.\"If I'm doing the job correctly ... then technically I should get the chance to move up and that's what I'm working hard to achieve.\"The Swiss racer has another idea to help talented young females make the step up to a race seat -- an all-electric feeder series.There are several global championships to put drivers on a pathway to F1 -- including the FIA's Formula 3 and Formula 2 series -- but there isn't a parallel 'junior' electric single-seater series to potentially nurture female talent.\"There are a lot of young girls who are quick but they're not getting the right opportunities,\" explains De Silvestro. \"A feeder series where there are more opportunities for girls would be a good thing. Maybe there is going to be a feeder series for Formula E in the future ... because Formula E is definitely growing and has the potential.\"Simona de Silvestro is the only the female racer to have driven in Formula E.Driving a dreamDi Silvestro's ambassadorial role with ABB -- championing the company's work in future mobility and sustainability -- is another vital support to her twin aims of returning to the Formula E grid and inspiring the next generation.\"It's important to show I had this dream of being a race car driver and I pushed for it and committed to it,\" she explains. \"With ABB there are young women who want to be, not a race driver, but an engineer, a mechanic. Maybe it's not the first thing a girl [thinks] to get into but if you're passionate -- go for it!\"At this year's Mexico City E-Prix, Wolff also joined forces with the FIA to inspire the next generation.The Mum-of-one hosted an educational program for girls aged eight to 18, offering the chance to try out activities including karting, pit-stops and science and engineering challenges.The first of many groundbreaking events to come for @fiawim & @D2BDofficial.Already looking forward to the next one! #DrivingFemaleTalent #WomeninMotorsport pic.twitter.com/HVVCfOwL34\u2014 Susie Wolff (@Susie_Wolff) 9 March 2019  The aim is to roll out the united \"FIA Girls on Track -- Dare to be Different' initiative across future events in Formula E and beyond.\"The sport is sometimes perceived as a male-dominated environment but the truth is if you just inspire those little girls they could be the potential next engineers or racing drivers,\" Wolff tells CNN. \"It's just about showing them the possibilities out there. Ultimately if no-one does anything the situation's not going to change. So we need to do something and the Formula E team have been very supportive.\"Gutsy decisionAgag is also a supporter of Wolff -- he describes her leadership at Venturi as \"setting a great standard\" which could open doors for future female team principals.\"Her style and her management have really made a big difference so that may get other teams thinking in that direction,\" he says.The Formula E founder also agrees with Wolff that female participation in motorsport needs to grow at the grassroots. \"Everything comes back to the talent pool,\" Agag explains. \"Motorsport has been for a long time a male sport ... so you have more to choose from a male than a female talent pool, but that's grassroots.\"It's not that a woman can start motor racing when she's 17 -- it's too late. It's too late for a man and too late for a woman.\"They need to start karting when they are eight or 10. The women need to start at the same time as the men.\"Wolff and the FIA may be doing their bit to future-proof a spot for females on the grid but for now the fact remains that there is no female racing in either of the single-seater world championships.Di Silvestro is the only female to have raced in Formula E while F1 has not seen a woman compete in a grand prix since 1976.Are the big players just too timid to take a risk on racing a female?\"All these big teams in racing are there but somebody would need to have the guts to give [women] a proper shot -- and that would change it quite a lot,\" says Di Silvestro.\"But at the moment most of the people who are really high up in any racing team are male, so we maybe have to change their way of thinking or have more people like Susie involved.\"The first and last female to race in Formula E: Di Silvestro scored points in her only full seasonCalderon adds: \"I wouldn't say that he or she would be brave to put a female in a car ... but it's that next step.\"If you don't earn enough points for the team it's a lot of money that [they] lose so it has to be a female who comes in with great resource and proves that she can deliver as much as another guy.\"What is often not understood from the outside is that all female racers -- and racers-turned-team-principals like Wolff -- don't see themselves as women racers, they just see themselves as racers.When the sport's major players do too then that is when real change comes. Does Formula E as a forward-thinking championship have a responsibility to lead the way?\"I would love to have a female driver on the grid,\" says Agag. \"It's frustrating.\"We are really trying to push teams in that direction but unfortunately it's not me that chooses the drivers.\"All we can do is give more opportunities to women to have track time and for the teams to evaluate them and put them back in the car.\"Di Silvestro says Formula E is \"too established\" to act as a testing ground for female talent but she believes the sport is moving in the right direction. \"For how young Formula E is and how quickly it has evolved I think there is already quite a lot of diversity,\" says Di Silvestro. \"We are seeing more female engineers, hopefully we are role models and more women will be involved in the sport.\"Opening doorsCalderon says of her recent testing experience with the DS team: \"They told me 'you're not a female, you're a racing driver' and that's exactly what I've always wanted to hear.\"I've always wanted to open doors because of my abilities not because of my gender. I think finally they are starting to understand that.\"JUST WATCHEDTatiana Calderon: The next female F1 driver?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTatiana Calderon: The next female F1 driver? 02:05Calderon is in the unique position of being the only woman to test both current Formula E and Formula 1 cars at the end of 2018. But the 26-year-old feels it is the electric championship which is more likely to put a female back on the grid.\"The history of females in Formula E is much bigger in recent years,\" she explains. \"So I think you're more likely to see a female competing in Formula E than in Formula 1 right now. \"But I do feel like motorsport in general is changing and we're going to get more and more female participation. I hope we will have a female driver, not only in Formula E, but also in F1 in the next couple of years.\"The final word goes to Wolff, the last woman to drive, although not race, in F1 and now on a mission in Formula E.\"I don't think Formula E has a responsibility more than anyone else to provide more opportunity for women,\" she sums up. \"That's something that has to be done across the board.\"What's great for Formula E is that it's another platform for drivers ...  and it can play an important role.\"",

Spieth needs just the US PGA to become only the sixth player to clinch the career Grand Slam of all four major titles and a first win since the 2017 Open.

Needing a birdie up the last to make the cut at four over, his approach was wayward and he was unable to chip in from the fringe, adding a 73 to his opening 72 to finish five over to miss the cut by one.READ: Woods' Masters win has Nicklaus \"shaking in my boots\"READ: 'It's surreal,' says Woods of 15th major Photos: Tiger Woods: From highs to lowsTiger Woods clinched his fifth Masters and 15th major title with victory at Augusta in April.

Or from 2005-2008 when he won six of 14 and was no worse than fourth six other times. \"What Brooksy did, he's driving it 330 yards in the middle of the fairway,\" added Woods. \"He's got 9-irons when most of us are hitting 5-irons, 4-irons, and he's putting well. That adds up to a pretty substantial lead, and if he keeps doing what he's doing, there's no reason why he can't build on this lead.\"Koepka has been vocal in the past about not receiving enough recognition, but he admits he uses any perceived slights as fuel. Rocket fuel, it would seem, as he becomes increasingly box-office viewing.\"I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing, put the pedal down and try to build a bigger lead,\" said Koepka.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Around seven in 10 LGBT people have suffered some form of sexual harassment at work, according to an alarming study highlighting a \"hidden problem\" in British workplaces.Unwelcome jokes and comments or questions of a sexual nature were the most-reported forms of abuse, with nearly half of all LGBT workers reporting such behavior, according to the study by the Trades Union Congress (TUC).Around one in six said they had received unwanted emails or pornographic images, and one in eight LGBT women even reported being seriously sexually assaulted or raped at work.Most respondents did not tell their employers about the harassment, the study found, with some refusing to do so for fear of being \"outed\" at work. Its authors are urging new legislation to protect LGBT workers.\"This research reveals a hidden epidemic,\" TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said in a statement. \"In 2019 LGBT people should be safe and supported at work, but instead they're experiencing shockingly high levels of sexual harassment and assault.\"Read MoreLGBT workers should be protected from discrimination. Let's hope the Supreme Court agreesThe study was released on May 17, the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.It found that LGBT women are more likely to experience unwelcome touching at work, with 35% -- more than in one three -- experiencing such advances, compared to 16% of men.Black and minority ethnic (BME) women, and disabled people of both genders, are particularly victimized. More than half (54%) of LGBT BME women said they had experienced unwanted touching at work, and exactly half of disabled women said the same. Around a quarter of women in both categories reported serious sexual assault or rape.Disabled men were also more likely than non-disabled men to suffer abuse, according to the research, with one in five reporting serious sexual assault.The study calls on government to enact \"a mandatory duty for employers to protect workers from all forms of harassment,\" and a statutory code of practice on sexual harassment. It has also urged employers to review their existing policies and conduct training for all employees.\"Workplace culture needs to change,\" said O'Grady. \"No one should think that a colleague being LGBT is an invitation for sexualized comments or inappropriate questions -- let alone serious acts of assault.\"A spokesman for the Government Equalities Office said: \"It is appalling LGBT people are suffering this harassment. Workplaces should be safe, supportive environments for everybody.\"The government will consult shortly on how we can strengthen and clarify existing laws on third-party harassment, as well as making sure employers fully understand their legal responsibility to protect their staff,\" he added.",

Woods' woes were a far cry from playing partner Brooks Koepka, the defending champion, who stormed to a course-record seven-under 63 -- one off the all-time major record set by Branden Grace in the Open at Royal Birkdale in 2017 -- to set a searing pace.

But while Koepka coasted, Woods experienced a roller-coaster of a round including two double bogeys and an eagle, not helped by a misfiring putter.

Indeed, in five seasons in Turin, he has lost just 19 games in Serie A.His time with Ronaldo has seen that superiority continue, with Juventus 13 points clear of second-placed Napoli with just two league games to go.There has, however, been occasional criticism -- not least during this year's fruitless Champions League campaign -- that Allegri's men had become over-reliant on the Portuguese star.His hat-trick had clinched an improbably victory in the competition's last-16, but with his powers neutralized by Ajax's own quality in the subsequent tie, Juventus resembled a side shorn of ideas.",

Such an established history comes with its own set of unique traditions, including the iconic blanket of yellow daisies which is draped over the winner at the finish line. The yellow and black flowers, dubbed \"Black-Eyed Susans\", represent the colors of Maryland and the State is also honored with the traditional singing of \"Maryland, My Maryland\".

        "content": "(CNN)A Belgian court has ruled that Albert II, the former king of Belgium, will be fined \u20ac5,000 ($5,600) every day until he takes a DNA test to determine whether he fathered a child during an alleged affair. Delphine Boel, a Belgian artist and sculptor, claims the king had an affair with her mother, Sibylle de Selys Longchamps, resulting in her birth in 1968. Albert married Paola Ruffo di Calabria, later Queen Paola of Belgium, in 1959. He became king in 1993.In 2013, at the age of 79, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son Philippe, citing concerns over his age and health. That same year, Boel launched a legal case to see the former king recognized as her father.Read MoreIn October of 2018, the Brussels Court of Appeal ruled in her favor and ordered Albert to submit to a DNA test, but so far he has not done so. Belgium's King Albert II gives up throne to son Albert must now submit to a test by a court-appointed forensic expert or face a fine, the appeals court ruled Thursday. At Boel's request, the result of the DNA test will be kept confidential until the legal proceedings conclude. Her lawyer, Marc Uyttendaele, told the AFP news agency that she \"suggested this option in order to calm the situation and avoid a media storm.\"\"I can't imagine for a second that he doesn't submit to the test,\" Uyttendaele said. Albert's lawyer, Guy Hiernaux, told CNN that the former king is currently \"out of the country\" until Sunday and has not yet responded to the ruling. \"We will probably be in touch Monday or Tuesday to discuss things further,\" Hiernaux said.\"I think he will accept the test because it will be confidential so there is no reason to not do it,\" he added. \"It has been his position since the beginning that the DNA test was premature but he never refused to do it. But we had to wait for this verdict before getting the DNA test done.\" If Albert is proven to be the father, Boel would be entitled to go by the name of Delphine Van Belgi\u00eb, and, by royal decree, might also take the title of princess, CNN affiliate VTM Belgium reported.",

When that doesn't work you have to take a choice. Life is full of difficult choices to make. \"I'm quite clear in who I am and where I want to go and, in the end, it was a decision I was confident with.\"Hegerberg is an outstanding talent. This weekend she and her Olympique Lyonnais Feminin team will aim to win a fourth successive Champions League title. Should they beat Barcelona in Budapest on Saturday, they will become the first team, male or female, to achieve such a feat. Last season she scored 53 goals in 33 games, including a record-breaking number in a single Champions League campaign.On the back of such prolific form, Hegerberg became the first female recipient of the Ballon d'Or last December -- a historic event which was, for that week at least, overshadowed by one of the co-hosts asking the Norwegian whether she could twerk.

Though goals have not been as plentiful this season, she has still found the back of the net 26 times in a season where her club has continued its domination of French football. The Norwegian moved to France in 2014, joining a club she describes as the model for how others should be organized. The team won its fifth league title this month, and the Women's French Cup.

The fact of keeping a lot of players together for a lot of years so we get to know each other -- and know each other well on the pitch which is really important. We have the conditions to be the best, we have equality here because of one man basically, the president.\"I was [made to feel] welcome from day one when I came to Lyon. People think there are so many tough environments in this club but it's the opposite and you need that good atmosphere to succeed. \"We're so well integrated into the men's club, it's our club now -- men's and women's team.

They would discuss the subject at home. \"There was never a question in our family, you play football whether you're a girl or a boy,\" she says.\"Just by coming from a family who talks a lot about that subject gave me the regard to look upon things.

We're in 2019. Women must have their spots, and that's in society,\" says Hegerberg.\"That's why, even though there are changes, that's why you need to push for those changes every single day, never stop demanding for equality and development.

But staying in her comfort zone, she says, would not only be detrimental to her game, but to women's football in general. \"I always look at what we can do better, what can the players do better, and that is obviously to train, train hard enough, stay out of the comfort zone and always increase the level. But, at some point, you need help to develop the product in the form of an investment,\" she says. Working with a mental coach in Norway after every season, analyzing her campaign with her family and fianc\u00e9 has also helped Hegerberg remain focused. \"It's important to think about what you've done and what needs to be done,\" she explains. \"That's a clear plan I've had from youth. I always analyze myself.\"As the world's best female players gather in France next month for the 2019 World Cup, when Hegerberg reflects on another season full of goals and trophies, and potentially more history-making feats, she will have no regrets. \"That's part of the consequence,\" she says of missing a tournament where the semifinals and finals are being held in a city she now calls home. \"I knew about the choice like this, but it doesn't stop me from making that choice because I believe in it so passionately because I want the best for the sport, I want the best for the youth, the ones who comes after.

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson, former London mayor and ardent critic of Theresa May's Brexit strategy, has thrown his hat into the ring to replace the British Prime Minister, announcing he will run for leadership of the Conservative Party when she steps down.\"Of course I'm going to go for it,\" he told a BBC news anchor at a business conference in Manchester, when asked if he would be a candidate in a future Conservative leadership election.The winner of that contest will automatically become Prime Minister, taking center stage in the chaotic Brexit process that has plunged Britain into one of its worst postwar political crises.A senior figure in the Conservative Party, Graham Brady, said May had agreed she would set a \"timetable for the election of a new leader\" after her Brexit deal is put to lawmakers for a fourth and final time in early June. The deeply unpopular deal has already been soundly rejected three times by Parliament.Johnson, a former Mayor of London, has long held leadership ambitions. He has been an arch critic of May's Brexit approach -- although he ultimately voted in favor of her plan on the third occasion it was placed before MPs.Read MoreHe is a favorite among grassroots Conservative members but has faced opposition in the past from a significant number of the party's lawmakers.Welcome to the last days of Theresa MayWidely expected to run for the Conservative leadership in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum, Johnson dramatically changed course after his former pro-Brexit ally Michael Gove announced his candidacy.May eventually won that contest and appointed Johnson as her Foreign Secretary, but he resigned in July 2018, writing in his resignation letter that the Brexit \"dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.\"He has instead supported leaving the EU without a deal, a scenario economists have warned would have a severe financial impact. Johnson has been a prominent figure in British politics for well over a decade, earning praise from some corners for his relaxed and bumbling persona, and criticism from others for a litany of gaffes, controversies and racially divisive comments.He has called Africans \"piccaninnies\" and Papua New Guineans \"cannibals,\" and once referred to Hillary Clinton as a \"sadistic nurse in a mental hospital.\" Johnson also wrote last year that Muslim women wearing burqas resemble \"letter boxes.\"First elected as an MP in 2001, Johnson will face stiff opposition in what is anticipated to be a crowded field of candidates. The prize will be the unenviable task of attempting to bring the complex Brexit process to a conclusion.Britain is currently scheduled to leave the European Union on October 31, having twice delayed its departure.",

Now, Saturday's Preakness Stakes will be historic in a completely different way. For the first time since 1951, none of the top three finishers of the Kentucky Derby will be competing in the Preakness. Neither 'winner' will run On May 7th, just three days after the Derby, trainer Bill Mott announced that winner Country House will not be competing in the second leg of the Triple Crown due to an illness. Country House, a 65-1 long shot, was named the winner of the Kentucky Derby after the initial winner, Maximum Security, was disqualified for interference. The owners of Maximum Security filed an appeal to overturn the disqualification, but it was rejected. Now, they've filed a federal lawsuit and pulled Maximum Security from the Preakness.Read More\"There's no Triple Crown on the line for us, and there's no reason to run a horse back in two weeks when you don't have to,\" the horse's owner, Gary West, said during an appearance on NBC's \"Today.\" Country House (#20) and  Maximum Security (#7) during the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby.The 2nd- and 3rd-place finishers are out, too JUST WATCHEDTrainer defends Kentucky Derby win via disqualificationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrainer defends Kentucky Derby win via disqualification 01:46On the same day Country House was pulled from the Preakness, the trainer of the Derby's second-place winner, Code of Honor, announced his horse also would not compete in the race.

According to the Baltimore Sun Mott never intended to take Tacitus to the Preakness, regardless of the Derby's outcome.

The first race is the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, and the final race is the Belmont Stakes, in Elmont, New York. The Triple Crown is one of the most legendary honors in the sporting world. It's also rare -- until American Pharoah achieved the feat in 2015, no horse had done it in 37 years.For that reason, horses who win the Kentucky Derby almost always go on to compete in the Preakness in hopes of winning all three races. The last time a Derby winner didn't go on to compete in the Preakness was 1996, when Derby winner Grindstone was injured during the race and retired directly afterward.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's one of those stories you couldn't make up -- except someone did. It said the German government gives migrants free coupons for prostitutes, and the Greek government could follow suit.Or at least, that was the claim made by one Greek nationalist politician and TV personality, Kyriakos Velopoulos, who in February said on his current affairs show that migrants in Germany are given \"free vouchers to brothels so they don't rape the natives.\"The assertion has been around for decades with similar claims about Germany and Austria also appearing online. For the record, none of these countries are giving sex coupons to migrants.Science being 'debunked:' Why are some countries making a vaccine U-turn?Ahead of the European Parliamentary elections later this month, analysts who study social media content say some populist politicians are capitalizing on voter misconceptions about the EU, to push misinformation on hot button issues like immigration.Populist figures meanwhile, say open and critical debate about different cultures is being sacrificed at the altar of political correctness. Read MoreWith populist parties tipped to make big gains in the upcoming election, fact-checkers from across the continent are now combining forces to debunk the tide of political misinformation. We spoke to some of them about their most startling stories -- and what they reveal about the issues dividing nations.Sex vouchers in Greece Velopoulos, the founder of the Christian nationalist Greek Solution party, is known by Greeks for his inflammatory style and his comments in March were no exception. \"In Germany, the Syrian or the Afghan migrant goes, gets a coupon twice a week, goes to the brothel, does the work and leaves,\" he told audiences on the Alert TV channel he appears on. \"This is the Europe I don't like,\" said Velopoulos, whose Greek Solution party currently does not have any seats in the European Parliament.  He warned that \"in a short while, let's say in 2021,\" Greeks \"might see\" their government also giving migrants \"free vouchers to go to the brothels of Omonia Square\" in the capital Athens.\"And even that will be paid by the Greek citizens.\"CNN reached out to Velopoulos but he had not replied at time of publishing.Migrants stage a protest at Athens central train station, in April this year, over travel restrictions.Velopoulos' comments come as Greece emerges from nearly 10 years of austerity, where \"populist politicians taking advantage of the continuing hardship still manage to get lots of traction among voters,\" said journalist Thanos Sitistas Epachtitis, who originally debunked Velopoulos' comments on the news site Ellinka Hoaxes. The article is one of dozens featured on Fact Check EU, an independent project pulling together fact-checking reports from 19 media outlets across Europe. The outlets, including France's Le Monde and Ireland's The Journal, are all signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network.Even though the sex coupon story is made-up, it \"does try to exploit, manipulate and exacerbate the existing anti-immigrant sentiment in Greece,\" said Lamprini Rori, a lecturer in politics at the University of Exeter and spokeswoman at the academic network Greek Politics Specialist Group.Macedonia will change its name. Here's why it mattersShe pointed to a 2018 poll  by independent research and policy institute Dianeosis, that found just over 72% of Greeks believe there's more crime because of the increase in migrants. The 2010 Greek financial crisis, coupled with an abrupt increase in refugees, had created \"a poisonous cocktail for anti-immigrant sentiments,\" said Rori.Germany, which adopted a pro-immigrant stance following the 2015 refugee crisis and oversaw Greece's financial bailout and austerity measures, has become a convenient \"scapegoat\" in these kinds of stories, said Rori.The brothel story highlights another issue troubling conservative Greeks -- the perceived moral decay of Europe, said Epachtitis. Greeks \"have very strong feelings about religion -- in our case, Orthodox Christianity -- and are willing to listen to those politicians that promise to preserve it,\" he added.As for Velopoulos' political future, Greece is due to hold a general election by the end of October -- where his party is predicted to take just 2% of the national vote, according to Politico.EU.Homophobia in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, populist politician Thierry Baudet has also perfected the fine art of an outrageous statement. But unlike Velopoulos, this has translated into big wins in the country's March provincial elections, with his Euroskeptic Forum for Democracy, along with Prime Minister Mark Rutte's party, gaining the most votes to become the joint biggest party.  In March, Baudet, who has been described as the \"suave new face of Dutch rightwing populism,\" blamed an increase in homophobia in the Netherlands on \"uncontrolled immigration.\"Thierry Baudet, leader of the Forum for Democracy (FvD), on election night 2017.  The claim was investigated by Eufactcheck.eu. The project, run by the European Journalism Training Association, is fact-checking political claims with the help of more than 150 students and staff from 20 journalism schools across Europe.The group looked at several research reports but could find no data to support Baudet's claims about immigration and increased homophobia. After reviewing recent LGBT studies, they concluded Baudet's remark that homophobia had increased in the Netherlands was \"generally untrue.\" The group also cited a 2015 police study on homophobic crimes in the Netherlands that found 61.8% of homophobic crime suspects had Dutch nationality. The fact-checkers said the police did not differentiate between immigrant and non-immigrant suspects.Baudet had not responded to CNN's request for comment at time of publishing.Dutch church holds 800-hour service to save family from deportationBaudet's tweet pits the liberal attitudes of Dutch people -- encapsulated in their acceptance of homosexuality -- as under attack by immigration, said Claes de Vreese, Professor and Chair of Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam.\"Populists typically use strong rhetoric to create an image of a threatening outside group,\" he said. De Vreese said Baudet's claims were reminiscent of fellow far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who \"also appropriated 'gay rights' as 'Dutch rights' under threat from immigration.\"Populist parties in Netherlands have a strange balancing act -- defending a country known for its tradition of tolerance, with an uncompromising stance on immigration.The next test for Baudet is whether he can ride his wave of popularity all the way to success in the European elections.   Islam and free speech \"Criticism of Islam is forbidden!\" said a Facebook post from Germany's far-right AfD politician Martin Sichert in March. The post added that according to the European Court of Human Rights, the \"protection of Islam is more important than freedom of expression in Europe.\"Sichert was referring to the case of Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff, an Austrian political scientist who in 2009 gave a seminar on Islam in which she compared the Prophet Mohammed's relationship with a child to pedophilia. The seminar in Vienna was promoted by Austria's far-right Freedom Party (FPO).Sabaditsch-Wolff was convicted by an Austrian court of disparaging religious doctrines and fined \u20ac480. She appealed several times, but the decision was eventually upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in 2018.According to German research news site, CORRECTIV, the AfD politician's Facebook comments were \"grossly oversimplifying a complex issue.\" The group's investigation into Sichert's claims was featured on the site Fact Check EU.\"It cannot be concluded from the judgment of the court that the 'protection of Islam' is more important than freedom of expression,\" said CORRECTIV. \"The judgment does not even contain the phrase, 'protection of Islam,'\" it added.Sichert told CNN he \"firmly stood by\" his comments. In a lengthy statement, he said: \"If we deny ourselves an open and critical debate about different religions or cultures, we are basically sacrificing our freedom of speech and expression on the altar of political correctness. \"It is not the Islam that is being criticized here,\" said Sichert of his Facebook post. \"But the politics and courts, who are failing to uphold and protect our fundamental rights -- all in fear that this may be uncomfortable to some.\"The case sheds light on a bigger issue troubling many right-wing, and some centrist, voters in Germany, according to Werner Patzelt, a political analyst who has closely followed the rise of the right-wing movement. And that is \"the feeling that all kind of criticism of Islam is forbidden under the flag of political correctness.\"The \"EU itself does not exert any pressure of political correctness,\" Patzelt added. But, he said, in the eyes of right-wing populists, the EU is nevertheless the \"invented or felt enemy\" because its policies hinder nation states' abilities to protect themselves. The AfD, once on the fringes of politics, is now the third-largest party in Germany following big gains at the 2017 election.And within days, populist parties across the continent could take their national successes to a European level.CNN's Chris Liakos contributed to this report",

However, playing the Black in the cool, wetter conditions of May in a US PGA is a different story to the tight, fast set-up of a US Open in June. \"When we came here in 2002 this was one of the biggest ballparks you've ever seen and it's got bigger,\" he added.\"In order to win this one driving is going to be at the forefront with the rough as lush as it is.\"Watson insists the sports world will be glued to the next chapter of the Woods story this week, and says his return to the New York area as a major champion again will have the already boisterous crowds at fever pitch.\"The atmosphere alone, just being around Tiger and Tiger's group is going to be overwhelming, the energy and the buzz that's going to be up here,\" added Watson. \"It's going to be a joy to be a part of. But you want to knock him off the pedestal.\" READ: Tiger Woods' major career by the numbersThe famous sign warning golfers contemplating tackling Bethpage Black. Bethpage rediscoveredThe Black was opened in 1936, as one of the now five public courses in Bethpage State Park on Long Island. Designed by noted architect A.W. Tillinghast, it long had a reputation as a formidable course, but by the early 1990s it had fallen into some disrepair. David B. Fay, executive director of the United States Golf Association (USGA), had heard rumors of its greatness and knew the tales of golfers sleeping in their cars overnight to get a tee time.  Valentino Dixon: How art and golf freed innocent man from life sentenceIntrigued, he pulled in on a whim one November afternoon in 1994. Seeing beyond the fraying bunkers and poor condition of the course, he had his epiphany when he reached the tee of the tree-lined par-five fourth hole with its famous cross bunkers and elevated fairway on the other side. \"That's when I knew,\" Fay is quoted as saying in John Feinstein's book \"Open,\" the story of how the US Open came to the Black. \"Right there, it hit me.\" There were myriad obstacles -- \"a million ifs\" -- in the way, but Fay drove away convinced the Black could be a US Open venue. Fast-forward to 2002, and Bethpage Black became the first publicly owned and operated course to host the US Open.  Woods was the only player to break par for the tournament, winning the 102nd US Open by three shots from Phil Mickelson for his eight major title. Bethpage held the event again in 2009 when Lucas Glover won and has since held two PGA Tour events. It is also set to host the Ryder Cup in 2024.      Grand Slam quest While Woods's tilt at a 16th major is the biggest story in town, other notable narratives could come to the fore. Jordan Spieth is making his third attempt at clinching the career grand slam of all four major titles.Having won the Masters and US Open in 2015 and the Open in 2017, victory this week could elevate Spieth into the elite list of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Woods to have won golf's big four events.

Then there's Brooks Koepka, the world No.3, who is the defending champion and the winner of three of the last eight majors. The powerful 29-year-old has become one of the most dominant players in the game, and was tied second behind Woods at Augusta, having held off the resurgent former world No.1 to triumph in the US PGA at Bellerive last August.   However, the last player to win back-to-back US PGA titles was back in 2007. His name? Tiger Woods.World No.1 Dustin Johnson and fourth-ranked Rory McIlroy also head the betting, and McIlroy anticipates a lively week.\"We all know what New York and Long Island is like,\" he told reporters. \"I think they're planning on letting 60,000 in a day here this week, so it'll be pretty loud.\"Should Woods win, with Johnson outside the top 10 and second-ranked Justin Rose and Koepka not second, he would return to No. 1 in the rankings for the first time since March 2013.Woods will play the first two rounds with Koepka and British Open champion Francesco Molinari, the man he overcame to win at Augusta.

READ: How Raheem Sterling took on the racistsRead MoreTeenager criticized by teammateBut Kean's teammate Leonardo Bonucci said the striker had to take \"50-50 of the blame.\" \"Moise should not have done that and the Curva [fans] should not have reacted in that way,\" the defender told Sky Sports Italia. \"Kean knows that when goals are scored he just has to think about cheering with the team, hugging them all together. It was an episode and even he knows he could have done something different.\"        View this post on Instagram           The best way to respond to racism \ud83e\udd8d #notoracism \ud83d\udeab A post shared by  K M B 9 \ud83e\udd8d (@moise_kean) on Apr 2, 2019 at 3:19pm PDT England and Manchester City star Raheem Sterling led the criticism of the defender's remarks, posting on Instagram: \"All you can do now is laugh,\" while English rapper Stormzy has also lambasted Bonucci on the same social media platform.Netherlands and Lyon Memphis Depay directly addressed Bonucci on Twitter, posting: \"I am disappointed in your reaction ... We will not be quiet!\" The Italian, 31, has since posted an Instagram story which said: \"Regardless of everything, in any case ... No to racism.\" But that did little to mask the widespread condemnation of his initial reaction. Much traveled striker Mario Balotelli, who in February told ESPN that racism in Italy was much worse than in any other country he had played in, commented on Kean's Instagram post. \"Bravo. Bonucci is lucky that I wasn't there. Instead of defending you he does this? I am shocked,\" he wrote, while Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba reposted Kean's picture, with the caption: \"I support every fight against racism, we're all equal.\"Among those also supporting Kean was former Juventus and Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, who posted on Twitter: \"This is not acceptable in football or anywhere in the world. Well done to @MoiseKean for standing up to them and showing them who is boss.\"'Idiots who do stupid things'Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri had also criticized Kean for his celebration on Tuesday, but went on to say that the authorities did not want to tackle racism.\"He shouldn't have celebrated in that manner,\" said Allegri, according to the club's official website. \"He is a young man and he has to learn, but certain things from the crowd also shouldn't be heard.\"Juventus' Blaise Matuidi reacts after Kean scoresIn his post-match interview Allegri called those racially abusing Kean \"idiots who do stupid things and ruin it for everyone else.\" \"You need great intelligence to deal with these situations and should not go to provoke people. That, of course, does not mean the idiots in the crowd and the way they reacted should be justified,\" he told reporters. \"I don't think talking about it all the time helps. I don't think halting play helps, because not everyone in the stadium did that.\"We need to use the cameras, find those who are doing it and punish them. It's very simple, identify them and not one-year ban or two, just give them a lifetime ban.\"We've got the technology, it can be done if the authorities want to. The problem is, they don't really want to.\"At the time of publishing, CNN had not received a response to requests for comment from the Italian Football Association, Serie A, Juventus or Cagliari. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosWarning issued to crowdAccording to reports, the match was delayed by around three minutes and a warning was issued to the crowd over the public address system. Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini led the player protest to referee Piero Giacomelli, while Juve midfielder Blaise Matuidi -- who complained last year that he was subject to racist abuse at the same stadium -- also spoke to the referee and reportedly threatened to walk off. Cancelo comforts Kean at the end the matchLuca Ceppitelli, Cagliari captain, was also seen appealing directly to the home fans behind the goal for the offensive chants to stop. Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini told Sky Italia: \"We should avoid moralism. Kean was wrong as the Juventus players also said ... if there were racist chants they must be condemned, of course.\"Earlier on Tuesday, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said referees would be told to be \"brave\" and stop matches where there was racial abuse from fans. \"The moment a match is stopped, or it's not played, I think that 90% of normal people in the stadium would kick the asses of those idiots,\" said Ceferin.READ: Fans back idea of points deduction to curb racism in footballRacism still a problem in footballDuring a Euro 2020 qualifying match on March 25, some England players were subjected to abuse in Montenegro, which led Sterling to urge football's authorities to do more to tackle racism.Several incidents of racists abuse have been reported in English football this season, while last year the German Football Federation came under scrutiny after star player Mesut \u00d6zil, who has Turkish heritage, announced his retirement from international football for what he called a \"feeling of racism and disrespect.\"Over the years, there have been a number of ugly incidents in Italian football.JUST WATCHEDSulley Muntari: Racism happens every gameReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSulley Muntari: Racism happens every game 03:31A Boxing Day game between Napoli and Inter Milan last December was marred by racist chanting towards Napoli's Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly, with Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti saying he would be happy for his side to stop playing the next time a member of his team was racially abused. In 2017, Ghanaian footballer Sulley Muntari walked off the pitch after hearing abuse while playing for Pescara.Speaking on CNN World Sport, football broadcaster and journalist Carl Anka said: \"There's a unique problem within Italian football itself.\"The fact that Bonucci called up the Curva, and you've got Cagliari's president saying 'I heard nothing' shows that some sections of Italian football wants to turn a blind eye.\"There's a good book \"Football, Fascism and Fandom\" which more or less states that the the Curva, or the ultras of Italian football, have very deep links to organized elements of Italian football and Italian football, to an extent, believes some of this is necessary to maintain the spirit or the atmosphere of Italian football -- if you get rid of the more unsavory elements, you get rid of crowd chants in general.\"That's unacceptable. That's reprehensible. There needs to be some form of change where you understand that chanting at someone based on their skin color is completely different to chanting at someone because they play for a rival team. \"That's a difference that needs to be made and that's the difference Cagliari's president, Bonucci and Allegri need to understand.\"Additional reporting by Gianluca Mezzofiore and Christina Macfarlane",

In a lengthy post published on the Professional Footballers Australia's (PFA) website Tuesday, 26-year-old former A-league player Andy Brennan said he had thought about coming out for years.\"I can finally come out and say it,\" he wrote. \"I'm gay.\"Brennan signed with the A-league's Newcastle Jets for two seasons in 2015. He now plays for lower league Melbourne club Green Gully Cavaliers.The PFA confirmed to CNN that Brennan is the first professional male footballer to publicly come out. CNN has reached out to Brennan for comment.\ud83d\udde3 \"For people wondering why it is important for me to share this - the reality is, is that no straight person has to ever question how those around them might respond to their sexuality.\" In My Words @AndyBrennan36 https://t.co/LgZubghLZx\u2014 The PFA (@thepfa) May 14, 2019\n\nRead More\"Being gay, in sport, and in the closet, it has been a mental burden of not knowing how those around you will react. It was a perceived pressure that consumed me,\" Brennan wrote in the Tuesday post. \"In fact, I've only become comfortable with it in the last year, which means for the best part of the last decade -- most of my adult life -- I've been pretty unsure of myself. In all honesty, that's been pretty tough.\"         View this post on Instagram           It's taken me years to get\u00a0comfortable saying this - I'm gay.  I was scared it would affect my friendships, my teammates, and my family. But the support of the people around me has been so great and helped me get to the final step; being completely open.  Being open is the best way for me to feel most comfortable and be myself. So... carry on! \ud83c\udf08 #owlyagoing A post shared by  andybrennan36 (@andybrennan36) on May 13, 2019 at 11:50pm PDT\nBrennan said his teammates and coaches \"were and are truly amazing. The overwhelming response has been one of huge support and happiness.\"He added: \"I think it's really important that they see that there's someone else who has come out, that there are many other people who are the same, and that it is OK. It is fine to be in a sporting environment and play, and people will accept you.\"",

It's been very hard for me to take this path, but I feel that it's what I need.\"I wanted to thank you for all the love you've given me in these five years, in which I've won my first important trophies with a club.

This is a practice banned by UEFA and the Premier League.In a club statement in March, City said it saw the UEFA inquiry as \"an opportunity to bring to an end the speculation resulting from the illegal hacking and out of context publication of City emails.

        "content": "Stockholm, Sweden (CNN)Sweden will re-open its investigation into an allegation of rape against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, the country's deputy chief prosecutor announced on Monday.Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson told reporters in Stockholm that the investigation into the alleged rape had been suspended in 2017 not for lack of evidence but as a result of Assange's continued residence in Ecuador's London embassy.Following his removal from those premises by British authorities last month, Persson said that circumstances had changed and investigators would seek a new interview with the 47-year-old computer programmer. \"After reviewing the preliminary investigation carried out so far, I find that there still exist grounds for Julian Assange to be suspected on probable cause of the charge of rape,\" Persson said. Eva-Marie Persson speaks at a press conference in Stockholm on Monday.The Australian whistleblower originally faced four sex-related charges in Sweden after an August 2010 visit to the country. The claims of misconduct triggered a years-long extradition battle, which Assange eventually lost in the UK's Supreme Court in 2012. Read MoreShortly after that, Assange entered Ecuador's embassy, and remained there for almost seven years. Assange -- who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing -- has always maintained that he sought refuge over fears of onward extradition from Sweden to the United States for his work with WikiLeaks. In August 2015, the statute of limitations on three of the allegations of sexual abuse lapsed. Under Swedish law, any charges related to the fourth allegation of rape must be made by August 2020. The WikiLeaks founder has never been charged in relation to the allegations; and proceedings have never developed beyond the investigation stage. What now? On April 11, Assange was dramatically evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy and taken into British custody. He has since been sentenced to nearly a year in a UK prison over bail violations stemming from when he entered the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden in 2012.On the heels of his dramatic arrest, Elisabeth Massi Fritz, a lawyer for the alleged victim in Sweden, requested the probe be resumed. Fritz said on Monday that her client was \"very grateful\" for the prosecutors' decision and that \"today she has regained confidence in the Swedish justice system.\"Fritz said the decision to reopen the inquiry showed that \"no one is above the law, not even if their name is Julian Assange.\" We are going to do everything we possibly can to get the swedish police investigation re-opened so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape. No rape victim should have to wait 9 years to see justice be served.\u2014 Elisabeth Massi Fritz (@ElisabethMFritz) April 11, 2019\n\nDeputy Chief Prosecutor Persson said that the next step will be to file a new European Arrest Warrant (EAW) for Assange for after he has finished serving his UK sentence. Valid across the European Union since 2004, the EAW was designed to speed up lengthy extradition operations and allows EU members to ask for the arrest and surrender of criminals in other member states.However, Persson emphasized that a decision on filing charges had not yet been made.\"I would like to make the following very clear: my decision to re-open the preliminary investigation is not equivalent on whether or not to file an indictment with the courts. This is the matter we'll have to revisit,\" she added.In response to the Swedish inquiry restarting, WikiLeaks accused prosecutors of bending to \"intense political pressure\" but said renewed investigations would allow Assange to clear his name. \"Since Julian Assange was arrested on 11 April 2019, there has been considerable political pressure on Sweden to reopen their investigation, but there has always been political pressure surrounding this case,\" WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said in a statement.Pamela Anderson visits Julian Assange in prison\"This case has been mishandled throughout,\" he said, adding that Assange \"was always willing to answer any questions from the Swedish authorities and repeatedly offered to do so, over six years.\"\"This investigation has been dropped before and its reopening will give Julian a chance to clear his name,\" Hrafnsson said.Assange is already facing a provisional extradition request from the US for one count of conspiring with former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to access US Defense Department computers in order to steal military secrets in 2010.Proceedings through UK courts for that extradition request have been adjourned until May 30.Who gets him first? During the press conference on Monday, Persson said she was aware that the US had already put in an extradition request for Assange. She added: \"In the event of a conflict between a European Arrest Warrant and a request for extradition from the US, UK authorities will decide on the order of priority.\"According to UK law, in the case of competing extradition claims, the decision is left to the country's Home Secretary to determine which petition takes precedence. Julian Assange's legal battles have only just begunExtradition lawyer Rebecca Niblock of Kingsley Napley told CNN that the Home Secretary would make that decision based on four things: \"Firstly, the relative seriousness of the offenses; secondly, the place where the offense is committed; thirdly, the date the warrant was issued and when the request was received and fourthly, whether the person is accused or convicted.\"She continued: \"It would be a very difficult decision for the Home Secretary to make because he would then have to decide on the seriousness of the offenses ... rape against the computer intrusion. In my view the offense of rape would the more serious one -- it carries a sentence of life imprisonment in this country.\"Over 70 British lawmakers have already signed an open letter calling upon UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid \"to stand with the victims of sexual violence\" and offer Sweden the UK's full support.Where is he now?In the meantime, Assange is serving his UK jail term at Belmarsh prison, a high-security facility in Thamesmead, southeast London. Belmarsh has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates. The facility is comprised of four main residential blocks as well as a high-security unit -- known for previously housing some of Britain's most notorious terror suspects including Abu Hamza al-Masri and Anjem Choudary.Visitors to Assange have been restricted since arrival but one of the first to visit -- aside from his lawyers -- was ex-Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson on Tuesday. Anderson tweeted that she was unsurprised following the announcement from Sweden. I'm not surprised.

The 1960 criminal trial, which pitted publisher Penguin Books against the UK's 1959 Obscene Publications Act,\u00a0has been described as a turning point in Britain's modern history, and one of the reasons that the arts minister is hopeful that it can find a buyer inside the country. Read More\"The trial of Lady Chatterley's Lover captured the public attention in 1960,\" Ellis said in a statement on Monday.\"It was a watershed moment in cultural history, when Victorian ideals were overtaken by a more modern attitude. I hope that a buyer can be found to keep this important part of our nation's history in the UK,\" he added. Collection of 'obscene' books on display at Oxford UniversityThe famed copy was first owned and used by Judge Sir Laurence Byrne, who presided over the trial.In preparation for court, Bryne's wife Dorothy underlined up some of the most sexually explicit passages of the 118-page novel for her husband's review, penciling in the words \"love-making\" and \"coarse\" where relevant. The judge also added notes.After Penguin was acquitted, the book sold 3 million copies.The Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest (RCEWA) recommended the ban, saying that if the book left the UK it would be a blow to the country's history. In a statement, RCEWA Chairman Sir Hayden Phillips, said the book \"may be the last surviving contemporary 'witness' who took part in the proceedings.\"\"It would be more than sad, it would be a misfortune, if this last surviving 'witness' left our shores,\" he added. \"Lady Chatterley's Lover,\" which was privately published in 1928 in Italy, was Lawrence's final novel. It was not published in full in the UK until 1960, 30 years after his death, due to fear of prosecution.",

The big-hitting Koepka, 29, is a triple major champion in his own right having won three of the last eight majors, including last year's US PGA, when he fought off a resurgent Woods to secure a two-shot triumph at Bellerive. That he finished tied for second at Augusta last month merely reinforces his status as a man at the top of his game. For Koepka, a charging Tiger holds no fear. Read More\"I'm not afraid of anybody,\" he told CNN Sport. \"There's no reason to be afraid of anybody. We just know now that he's more than likely going to be there come Sunday.\"Koepka's recent run is a phenomenal feat that separates him from his equally illustrious peers; Jordan Spieth's trio of major titles came in an 11-tournament period, while there were 15 majors between Rory McIlroy's first and fourth wins.Now, though, there is an added complication for the game's Generation Z to consider; during his absence, many admitted that they would have loved to have witnessed -- and gone up against -- Woods in his prime.

Woods clinched his first major for 11 years and was mobbed by an adoring Augusta crowd, and greeted by colleagues and rivals as he approached the clubhouse.High-fives, backslaps, ceaseless whooping -- the respect and shared joy was plain to see. Then Koepka tapped him on the shoulder for a bear hug between recent friends.\"I've seen him when he was not able to play golf and not sure whether he was going to be able to get back to playing golf,\" he reflects of their embrace.\"It has been interesting, it has been a fun journey to watch. Everybody wants him out there again. He's back healthy and it has been fun building a friendship over the last couple of years.\"It is just good for the game.

        "content": "(CNN)A group of indigenous people from low-lying islands off the coast of Australia on Monday lodged an unprecedented complaint against the country's government, accusing it of insufficient action on climate change. The eight Torres Strait Islanders filed the complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Committee, claiming that rising sea levels were having a devastating effect on their communities. Around 4,500 people live on the Torres Strait Islands, a group of more than 270 islands lying between the north coast of Australia and Papua New Guinea. The complainants say their homes, burial grounds and cultural sites could disappear underwater in their lifetimes.Australia's failure to adequately address the problem was a breach of its human rights obligations to the islanders, they allege.Australia is being devastated by climate change. So will it swing the election?\"We're currently seeing the effects of climate change on our islands daily, with rising seas, tidal surges, coastal erosion and inundation of our communities,\" said one of the complaint's authors, Kabay Tamu, in a statement. Read MoreThis was also having an impact on \"the social and emotional wellbeing of our communities who practice culture and traditions,\" he added.The complaint is the first legal action worldwide brought by low-lying islands against a nation state, said lawyers from environmental campaign group, ClientEarth, which is representing the group. It is also the first climate ligation against Australia on the basis of human rights.The group has asked the UN committee to rule that Australia should increase its emission reduction target to at least 65% below 2005 levels by 2030, going net zero by 2050. It has also called for the phasing out of thermal coal, in domestic electricity generation and export markets. The committee's rulings are not legally binding, though states are obliged to consider them.In 2016 Australia became one of 185 countries around the world to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. But the target has been branded \"insufficient\" by research bodies. Australia relies heavily on coal-fired power plants, and the country's own Climate Change Authority has recommended more ambitious emissions targets.     \"Australia has done very little on climate change since signing the Paris agreement,\" Sophie Marjanac, the complainants' lead lawyer also told Reuters.\"I don't think Australians realize that their fellow Australians are on the climate frontline -- they see it as an overseas problem but it's happening in their backyard,\" she said.A spokesperson for the Australian environment minister, Melissa Price, told Reuters that the government was committed to addressing climate change by meeting its international targets, investing in renewable energy technology, and protecting the environment.It was investing AUS$3 million ($2.1 million) in a Torres Strait development plan that included climate change issues, the spokesperson said.Late last year, Vanuatu's government said it was \"exploring\" whether to sue fossil fuel companies and the industrialized countries that use them for their role in the climate threat to low-lying islands.",

Anatomy professor Hermann Stieve collected the corpses of people killed at Ploetzensee prison in Berlin throughout the Nazi period, before dissecting and studying their remains.Decades later, tiny fragments of the victims' body tissue were discovered on microscopic slides at the doctor's estate and matched with the records of people killed at the prison. They were finally buried in a ceremony in Berlin on Monday afternoon.The victims, mostly young women, were among thousands of people executed at Ploetzensee prison during the Third Reich. \"Stieve helped the Nazi justice system to deny these people a grave,\" Andreas Winkelmann of the Brandenburg Medical School, who identified the victims, told CNN. \"He was not a member of the Nazi Party but he was not a resistance fighter either ... he benefited from a murderous Nazi system.\"Read MoreA Holocaust diary is reborn on InstagramStieve's main area of study was the female reproductive system, and most of the victims whose bodies he collected had been arrested for supposed political crimes.\"These were women imprisoned by the Nazi justice system. It could be for high treason, it could be for plundering after air raids ... or if you said something bad about Hitler, you could end up in jail or be executed,\" Winkelmann explained.The professor was the director of the Berlin Institute of Anatomy from 1935 until his death, from a sudden stroke, in 1952. His slides were found in 2016 by family members, among various items from his career. \"Only when they looked at them closer and saw that there were names on some of them, they thought this was something that should be looked into,\" Winkelmann said. He went on to identify those names as belonging to people killed at Ploetzensee.The tiny tissue samples lie on glass slides and measure about a hundredth of a millimeter in thickness and approximately a square centimeter in area.The burial of the slides at Berlin's Dorotheenstadt cemetery, which was arranged in part by the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital, will \"help restore some of their dignity to the victims,\" the hospital's CEO Karl Max Einh\u00e4upl said in a statement. \"You would not usually bury microscopic slides because the tissues are so small,\" Winkelmann added. \"In this case, it is a special group of victims and they were denied a grave at the time, so the relatives didn't have a place to commemorate them.\"Tens of thousands of political prisoners, including suspected resistance fighters, Communists and trade unionists, were incarcerated or executed by the Nazi regime before and during the Second World War, and Ploetzensee became notorious as a center of capital punishment during the era.",

Sergio Aguero, Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez, and Ilkay Gundogan all scored for the visitors after Glenn Murray had given the home side the lead on 25 minutes. It's the first time a team has won back-to-back titles since Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United in 2009, and City's total of 98 points is the second highest haul in Premier League history -- two shy of the 100 points Pep Guardiola's men accrued last year.

Liverpool's 97 points, meanwhile, would have been enough to take top spot in every Premier League season bar the two most recent. \"I think it was the hardest and most satisfying,\" Man City captain Vincent Kompany told Sky Sports, reflecting on his three previous titles with the club.\"Liverpool were exceptional.

Laporte headed home unmarked from a corner to give his side a 2-1 lead 10 minutes before halftime, putting City firmly in the driving seat.Mahrez's right-footed strike on the edge of the area extended the lead midway through the second period, before Gundogan's sweetly-struck free-kick from 25 yards ultimately sealed the match -- and the title.Following the trophy lift on England's south coast, the City team is flying straight back to Manchester to celebrate at its home ground.READ: Is this the greatest Champions League season of all time?

Despite the Merseysiders' heroic unbeaten run to end the season, City -- now back-to-back English champion -- was unflappable, even when Brighton took a shock lead.That early slip-up, which allowed Brighton to score an the 27-minute mark, was greeted by a thunderous cheer some 250 miles northwest.

As the day wore on, though, the natural order of this 2018-19 Premier League season was restored. City talisman Sergio Aguero restored parity on the south coast just seconds after the Seagulls had the temerity to score, before Aymeric Laporte headed in a second. Then, just after the hour mark, Riyad Mahrez made it three. Ilkay Gundogan added the icing on the cake 10 minutes after that, but by then Livepool were done.

In defiance to authorities, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski said he intervened personally Saturday evening to switch the meters back on for about 450 people, including 100 minors, who live in an abandoned state-owned building, according to ANSA news agency. \"It was a desperate gesture,\" Krajewski, who is Vatican almoner and Francis' \"charitable arm\" told ANSA. \"There were over 400 people without electricity -- families, children -- without even the chance to run the refrigerators.\"\"I didn't do it because I was drunk,\" he added.

Read MoreActivists from the Spin Time Labs collective have occupied the building since 2013, providing shelter for homeless families but also a tavern, a theater, a craft beer laboratory, a carpentry shop, a music rehearsal studio, and various social activities. The power was cut on May 6 after they accumulated a debt of \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3260,000 or $337,000), according to ANSA. The collective appealed on Facebook to the city of Rome to find a lasting solution \"so that light doesn't go out anymore.\" During a campaign speech in Bra, Cuneo, Italy's far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini said: \"I expect the Pope's almoner also pays the \u20ac300,000 in debt,\" amid the cheers of his supporters. \"I think all of you pay the bills by making sacrifices. If someone is able to pay the bills for the millions of Italians who are struggling economically, we are happy.\"A spokesperson for Salvini's office told CNN the minister \"hopes Krajewski can pay the arrears back.\"CNN's Delia Gallagher and Valentina DiDonato contributed reporting",

Second place.A day of anguish at the end of a fascinating, record-breaking, unprecedented season.There was, for a short time at least, ecstasy. But ultimately, Sunday afternoon would become one of painful agony for Liverpool fans worldwide. A curious kind of heartache, though.For this has not been a title lost or an opportunity blown, but a race fought from first day to last. And at the end of it all, a contest won by Manchester City on the day that a marathon became a sprint.Liverpool's final points tally would have won the Premier League in 25 of its 27-year existence -- bettered only by this City side of the last two years.Read MoreFor Jurgen Klopp, it is a statistic that makes the final result easier to accept, though even harder to understand.\"People might say we could have done this or that but not really, I don't think [we could have done any more],\" he told Sky Sports. \"City were lucky in moments, we were lucky in moments. It was about staying in the race and believing and that's what we did.\"When your opponent is City, it's difficult. They couldn't get rid of us and we couldn't get rid of them. Being second in the Premier League is not what I wanted but we have to see it as the first step for this team. We have three weeks to prepare for the Champions League final - let's give it a go.\"Liverpool fans watch on with hope at AnfieldA 2-0 win against Wolves will succumb to the archives. It is the winners who are remembered. And Pep Guardiola's City side did what a champion does -- and in some style.However, there was a spell -- albeit a short, fruitless time -- when all appeared to be pointing tentatively in Liverpool's favor.When Trent Alexander-Arnold's cut-back on 17 minutes was met with the decisive thud of Sadio Mane's right boot, Liverpool climbed above its great rival.When Glen Murray nodded in to give Brighton a shock lead at the Amex Stadium on England's south coast, the roars from the Anfield faithful could well have been heard among the seagulls more than 250 miles away.READ: Manchester City retains Premier League title with win over BrightonREAD: Is this the greatest Champions League season of all time?But, perhaps appropriately in a season that has seen both Liverpool and City raise one another with win after win, Sergio Aguero equalized almost as quickly as his team had fallen behind. A rumbling Anfield turned, if not to a hush, then to a series of murmurings.And when City marched into the ascendancy through an Aymeric Laporte header, the sense of foreboding had begun further north. Liverpool, sharp and fast early on, became sloppy and edgy. Very possibly feeling the effects of an extraordinary week that began with a famous 4-0 win over Barcelona, Liverpool became slower.For long spells, Jurgen Klopp's outfit was indebted to Alisson, the Brazilian goalkeeper who has played such a key role in making Liverpool a far sturdier side than in times gone by. Seen as the missing piece of the jigsaw upon his arrival, he has more than lived up to expectations. He was handed the league's golden glove award after the match, having kept 21 domestic clean sheets.Sadio Mane scored both goals in Liverpool's final-day win on an occasion that, ultimately, ended in disappointment.If Matt Doherty's strike that clipped the crossbar on the stroke of half-time was meant to be taken as a warning sign of sorts, it was advice that Alisson heeded as the second half wore on.He made crucial stops from Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez as all the flowing football came from the visitors, who were playing with a freedom that could not be said of Liverpool as the tension of the day and the impending disappointment wore on.A second goal did eventually come for Liverpool; Tuesday night's hero Divock Origi had already hooked over when well-placed, before Mane doubled his side's advantage with just nine minutes to go.In truth, it came against the run of play as he headed in Alexander-Arnold's pinpoint cross. It was his 22nd league goal of the season -- the same number achieved by teammate Mo Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Virgil van Dijk, announced as the Premier League player of the season shortly before kick-off -- the latest individual gong to add to his burgeoning collection -- headed against the woodwork as Alexander-Arnold closed in on a rare hat-trick of assists late on. However, by then, Liverpool's race was run -- not that there was much more the north-western team could have done.When Manchester City lost at Newcastle on January 29, Guardiola and his reigning champions had 14 games remaining. His team had to win each and every one of them.14 games on -- and 14 victories later -- City had achieved what did, at one stage, seem the improbable dream.Alisson was handed the Premier League's Golden Glove trophy after the final game of the season.For Liverpool, nightmares of hindsight will turn back to a three-week spell in January and February; it was by no means a poor time, but draws against both Leicester City and West Ham, as well as a stalemate against a Manchester United team depleted by injuries will be looked back upon as moments where a thrilling race was won and lost.A 2-1 reversal when Liverpool visited Manchester City's Etihad stadium on January 3 always felt -- both before and afterwards -- that it might become a defining moment in a titanic struggle. Aguero and Roberto Firmino shared a goal each, before Leroy Sane scored a 72nd-minute winner for the home side.In a year settled by a single point, John Stones' goal-line clearance for City, with 11 millimeters to spare, could scarcely have been more important.It all meant that Liverpool's fate was out of its hands. The club's fans remained defiant to the end, remaining afterwards to applaud the efforts of a team that has provided a colossal title race when, perhaps, logic suggested there should not have been one. 97 points -- 25 clear of third-placed Chelsea.In 116 of the last 119 top flight seasons, it would have been enough to clinch the trophy. Not this time.A race settled by the finest of margins.",

Senator Penny Wong would be the third consecutive woman to take on the role, but the first Australian foreign minister of Asian heritage and the highest-ranking gay politician in a parliament typically dominated by conservative white men.In a recent speech to the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Wong said if Labor wins the election on May 18, her elevation to foreign minister would send a broader message to the world about Australia's values as a multicultural nation.\"What would be significant... is what it says about us. What it says about who we are,\" she said. \"Narratives matter, as do perceptions. There are times when Australia's past attitudes on race can be evoked in ways which are neither accurate nor helpful.\"Labor Senator Penny Wong (R) and Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten (C) celebrate after parliament passed the same-sex marraige bill on December 7, 2017. Malaysian backgroundRead MoreWong, 50, was born in the coastal city of Kota Kinabalu on the island of Borneo and moved to the Australian city of Adelaide with her parents in the 1970s when she was eight.The Australian suburbs were very different from her early years in Borneo. \"I remember feeling like I didn't belong for quite a while,\" Wong told CNN affiliate SBS.  \"I remember my first day at school. That was a bit hard, actually,\" she said. \"I was probably the first Asian a lot of those kids had ever seen, and I remember things being said as we walked in to go to enroll. I remember people making comments about my race, and me realizing, that was the first time I actually realized, race was a factor.\"Her early political ambition was obvious when she took over the Labor Club at the University of Adelaide before graduating with an arts-law degree. Wong spent time with a trade union representing workers in the furniture industry before practicing law and becoming a ministerial adviser.  She was elected to the Senate, the upper house of parliament, in 2001. When Labor won power in 2007, Wong was appointed Climate Change and Water Minister and took part in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. She was Minister for Finance and Deregulation from 2010 until voters pushed Labor back into opposition at the 2013 election. Australia stands in solidarity and sorrow with the people of New Zealand following the horrific attacks and the dreadful, tragic, senseless loss of life we saw yesterday. To New Zealand, we regard you as family and today your Australian family grieves with you. pic.twitter.com/5KYL4wUnTX\u2014 Senator Penny Wong (@SenatorWong) March 16, 2019\n\nWong was the first woman elected as Leader of the Government in the Senate. The 2013 election loss meant she became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate within the same year -- it was the first time a woman had filled either role. Her six-year term in the Senate expires in 2022, when she can run for re-election.As part of Labor's election campaign, Wong -- the shadow minister for foreign affairs -- has been deployed to areas of the country where the party fears losing seats. They are also places where Wong is considered to have high personal appeal -- electorates with high migrant, and especially Asian migrant, populations. \"I think she's a role model for many people in Australia society who want to see a different face to our public life and our public institutions,\" said former Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane. How Australia's 'everyday racism' moved from political fringe to mainstream media A Human Rights Commission survey released in 2018 found that 76% of Australia's business and political leaders were Anglo-Celtic.  The figure was marginally higher inside parliament, where 78% of ministers and senators were of English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish origin compared to 58% of the broader population.Only 4% of parliamentarians had a non-European background, compared to around 21% of the population, according to the report, \"Leading for Change.\"\"The default of leadership in Australian life remains largely a white, Anglo-Celtic and male one and it's going to require more people like Penny Wong to set an example for others so that people don't accept that default as being the only possibility in Australian life,\" said Soutphommasane, who commissioned the report.Wong is also firmly in the minority as a gay politician. In 2017, she campaigned for the law to be changed to allow same-sex marriage, a move backed by 62% of Australians in a nationwide postal survey. Wong and her partner, Sophie Allouache, have two children.After the vote, Wong said, \"I hope that everyone in this parliament has heard the resounding voice of the Australian people today, a mandate for change, a mandate for equality.\"Senator Penny Wong is handed a rainbow flag by Senator Derryn Hinch after the same-sex marriage survey announcement pic.twitter.com/TNVBqzHTKg\u2014 andrew meares (@mearesy) November 15, 2017\n\nDealing with China The same-sex marriage debate may have focused attention on Wong's family, but she's known to be protective of her personal life and doesn't actively seek media attention outside her work.Wong's foreign policy portfolio hasn't featured highly in the upcoming election campaign, as voters focus on domestic issues such as taxes, wages and spending. However, if Labor wins, Wong would become Australia's face to the world.  Australia is being devastated by climate change. So will it swing the election?That face would be more focused on Asia as part of Labor's FutureAsia policy, which seeks to deepen regional ties, establish new diplomatic missions and increase aid to poorer countries in the region. Wong said that if elected, her first trips would be to Indonesia and Malaysia.The Southeast Asian nations are seen as increasingly important to Australia for trade, security and tourism -- both to the current Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and the opposition Labor party, led by prospective prime minister, Bill Shorten.In Asia, Australia's main focus is on its relationship with its leading trading partner, China. Relations have been strained in recent years by allegations of foreign interference, which the Australian government has addressed with new laws restricting foreign political donations.Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Penny Wong, speaks against a motion in the Senate on June 20, 2018 in Canberra.\"The new government, whether it'll be the Morrison government or the Shorten government, will have to decide the kind of temperament they have with China and the pros and cons of being upfront and blunt and the pros and cons of being quieter,\" said John Lee, a China expert from the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.But he played down the idea that Wong's Asian origins could help improve relations in the region.\"I don't think countries think too much about the backgrounds or identity of Australian politicians. They look at the government's policies,\" said Lee, who was a senior adviser to former Liberal foreign minister Julie Bishop from 2016 to 2018. Australia may elect its seventh leader in just over a decade as election called\"If Penny Wong becomes foreign minister, I don't see it signaling that it would lead to a vastly different department that what it has been currently,\" he added.Wong herself said a Labor government would reframe its relationship with China so the country wasn't pre-emptively seen \"only as a threat.\" Labor would also bring a \"more considered, disciplined and consistent approach\" to its dealings with Beijing, she said.Wong said the United States would continue to be a \"pillar\" of Australian foreign policy, though some have pointed out that Shorten's previous description of President Donald Trump as \"barking mad\" could present some difficulties. Shorten answered those queries Monday by saying he'd approach Trump \"professionally and politely.\" \"With Mr Trump and with Xi Jinping and Theresa May and Mr Macron and Mr Trudeau and all the other leaders, and my friend Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand, I'll be professional,\" he said. \"But what I'll also do is never compromise our national interests. My foreign policy will be independently minded and it will speak with an Australian accent.\"As most foreigners know, the Australian accent is hard to master.If she is elected, Wong will be striving to hit the right tone between the Australia of the past and the truly multicultural nation it will inevitably be in the future.",

        "content": "(CNN)Unbeaten during his professional career and regarded as the savior of the heavyweight division, it's no wonder it takes something significant to scare Anthony Joshua. His biggest fear is being taken \"before my time,\" but that acknowledgment of the dangers of his chosen profession has made the British boxer, who has 22 wins to date, also remarkably philosophical of the responsibility he has to his sport.\"If you get hit, you're vulnerable, you go down,\" Joshua told CNN Sport's Don Riddell, speaking about the danger both he and his opponents face.  \"I don't want to inflict that much pain onto my opponent that he can't go home to his family and I hope that's the same for me.\"I hope I can go on, see my career through and go on and do great things in this world.\"Read MoreAnthony Joshua wants to retire from boxing while he's still healthy. READ: Daniel Jacobs faces the fight of his career against Canelo Alvarez'I've seen things'Helping others has become an integral part of who Joshua has become and is one of the driving influences behind his stellar career. Once the bell sounds on his final round as a boxer, the Londoner wants to use his lofty platform to be an ambassador for charities and help those more vulnerable than himself. \"As doors have been opened for me, I'd like to open doors for others,\" he revealed. \"I feel like I've still got a lot to live and I want to live a full life.\"It's a philanthropic mission perhaps borne from his own troubled teenage years. His involvement with drugs and street culture has been well documented but Joshua is not frightened to speak about a previous life so different from his current one.\"I've seen a lot of things and I've been through a lot of things. I just thank God I've never had a near-death experience in my life,\" he said. \"Nothing has been that scary yet because every hurdle that's been presented to me I've had enough strength to overcome it.\" He overcame a troubled past to be appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2018.

Joshua and boxing has been reaping the benefits ever since, with his reign sparking a wonderful rivalry with the likes of Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. Despite a thrilling fight between Wilder and Briton Tyson Fury, Joshua is still the man to beat, given he holds three of the four major belts in the heavyweight division.\"Why am I the chosen one?

First for Joshua, though, is a fight against American Andy Ruiz Jr. on June 01.The IBF, WBA and WBO champion will fly to New York's Madison Square Garden for his first bout on US soil and the Briton is excited to spread his message to a new audience. \"I say my message is definitely to look after number one, help elevate the people around you once you've elevated yourself and just be real,\" he said.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)In the summer of 2014, Danisch Farooqi says he received a phone call from his ex-wife informing him that she had taken their daughter, Aaliya, to Turkey. In a panic, he tried to get her back to Germany, he says, but within days his daughter was in Syria and her mother had married an ISIS fighter.\"I don't even know what my daughter has experienced and seen in those five years,\" Farooqi told CNN, tearing up at the thought. \"Once you finally find your daughter, you then hope for the help of the German government to get her back.  And there is none. It's devastating. It's frustrating. And I'm really very angry.\"  The defeat of ISIS has stranded tens of thousands of ISIS followers -- including Aaliya, now eight years old -- in Kurdish-run camps in northern Syria, but the German government has been slow to repatriate German citizens. Earlier this week, Farooqi organized a public protest by family members, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, outside the Foreign Ministry in Berlin to demand the German government do more to repatriate its citizens, especially children, stranded in Syria.  Several dozen protesters carried placards with photos of their daughters, sons and grandchildren.  International courts, Guantanamo, citizenship-stripping: What next for Western ISIS supporters?Germany's Foreign Ministry would not confirm to CNN how many German nationals are now in the camps but only a handful of children born to ISIS followers have been brought back to Germany and placed with relatives. In a statement to CNN, the Foreign Ministry insists that it is \"virtually impossible\" to provide assistance to any of them.Read MoreThe statement reads: \"Although the Federal Foreign Office is aware of cases of German nationals who are supposed to be in custody in northern Syria, the Federal Foreign Office has no information on this subject. In Syria, after the closure of the Embassy of Damascus, consular assistance is still virtually impossible.  For Syria there has long been a travel warning.  Irrespective of this, the Federal Government, in consultation with its partners, is also examining possible options to enable German nationals, above all children, even in humanitarian cases, to be repatriated to Germany.\"Germany is not the only country dealing with this problem. Thousands of men and women across Europe joined ISIS. France, the UK and other countries are grappling with how to deal with ISIS returnees.   Danisch Farooqi organized a protest in Berlin this week.For those captured in Iraq, there is an existing Iraqi court system to process former ISIS members and try them as members of the terrorist organization. Some German nationals, including wives of ISIS fighters, have already been prosecuted there and are currently serving time in Iraqi prisons. In some of those cases, the children of German citizens have been brought back to live with their extended family.  But in the Syrian territory controlled by Kurdish forces, there is no recognized legal system to prosecute ISIS members. As a consequence, Kurdish tent camps have swelled with the number of captured ISIS fighters and their families.  Anaya Azim joined the Berlin protest, to get her sister and her niece and nephew back. She says her sister left in 2014 for Turkey, wearing make-up and high heels, to help take care of her brother's family living in Turkey. Weeks later, Azim says she received a photo of her sister, draped in a full-body veil, apparently living in ISIS-controlled Syrian territory.   Azim now believes her brother was \"brainwashed\" into joining ISIS and forced his family, including his sister, to come with him.  He was killed in the fighting, but his wife, sister and the children are now in a Kurdish camp where, her sister has told her, conditions are deteriorating.  In January, the World Health Organization reported that 29 children had died in the camps, mainly from hypothermia and that severe overcrowding was leading to shortages of food, medicine and basic sanitation facilities.  Anaya Azim and her father.\"When I last spoke with my sister she was urging us to free her, I saw she had tried to cut herself. She is not the same person anymore,\" she told CNN. ''I expect the German government to please help these women and children. It's not their fault! We need to help these children -- the longer they stay on, the worse it gets.\"Azim believes that Germany should provide a legal process for her sister to return and try to prove her innocence.  Originally from Afghanistan, Azim and her family fled the Taliban to settle in Germany. Now, she fears her sister will only be further radicalized if left in the Syrian camps.We need a long-term solution for captured ISIS members\"We escaped war, we did not want to have anything to do with people like this,\" Azim said. \"A state has to protect its own citizen, to bring them back, gather evidence until they have found proof to find out who is innocent, who hasn't done anything. I think they should be able to do that.\"One German great-grandmother who did not want to give her name, said her grand-daughter was being held at the Al-Hol camp in Kurdish controlled Syria. But she had not heard from her grand-daughter or her children in the last 37 days. \"The last time we spoke, she told me the women from different nationalities are arguing a lot at the camp about food rations. And that the tents had caught on fire from gasoline burners.\" She told CNN: \"They said they couldn't take it anymore. And they needed to come home to Germany soon.\"She has never met her great-grandchildren, born in ISIS-controlled territory, but she worries that one-year old Ibrahim has a persistent rash and 3-year-old Hanifa may be malnourished.  \"They say they don't want radicalized children here but with every single day children are at this camp they may become increasingly radical,\" she said. ''I just pray to God each night that I will be able to see them soon.\"",

If Ajax's young, home-grown talent weren't on the radar of Europe's top teams before, they most certainly are now.Ole's at the wheelMarcus Rashford scores the decisive penalty against PSG.With interim boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in charge, Manchester United recovers from a 0-2 home first-leg loss to stun PSG in its own backyard with a controversial and dramatic injury-time winning  from Marcus Rashford to send the Red Devils through. It is another early exit from the under-achieving Parisians and, watching on from the sidelines, an injured Neymar is not impressed.Dutch courageNot content with knocking out the holder, Ajax is at it again, this time against Cristiano Ronaldo and Juventus in Turin.

But the script is ripped up in Manchester for the return leg, as the sides serve up an instant classic. City's Raheem Sterling and Tottenham's Son Heung-min exchange a brace of goals each and Bernardo Silva and Sergio Aguero also net for the Blues. A disputed strike scored off Fernando Llorente's hip gives Spurs a crucial lead on away goals but with time running out, Sterling thinks his hat-trick goal has put City through, only for VAR to rule out the goal for offside.Merseyside miracleLiverpool fans celebrating their win over Barcelona.A spirited Liverpool had given their all in the first leg in Barcelona but Messi was the difference with his two late goals adding to Luis Suarez's opener. But on another famous European night at Anfield, a pair of goals from the unlikeliest sources -- striker Divock Origi, who was only playing because of injuries to star starters Mohamed Salah and Firmino -- and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum turn the match on its head and send the Reds through 4-3 on aggregate. The winning goal is something extraordinary. Wise beyond his years, local lad Trent Alexander-Arnold catches Barca off guard with his clever corner and Origi sweeps the ball into the net, and makes himself a Liverpool legend in the process.Mour, mour, mourTottenham celebrate its semifinal victory over Ajax.The best is arguably saved for last as Tottenham, already down 1-0 from the first leg and now losing 2-0 on the night in Amsterdam, somehow produce possibly the greatest result in the club's proud history to score three second-half goals to advance to the final. Brazilian forward Moura -- who much like Liverpool's Origi might only have been playing because of injury to talisman Harry Kane -- scores an historic hat trick, with the winner coming in the sixth minute of injury time, to break Ajax's young hearts and set up just the second all-English final in history.The world awaits the Madrid final on June 1 between Tottenham and Liverpool, the outcome impossible to predict.",

Neymar scores during the final against Rennes.In the shootout Neymar also slotted his penalty home, but the Parisians couldn't match the Brittany team's accuracy -- Rennes converted all six spot-kicks to PSG's five. The win handed Rennes its first major trophy in 48 years.The post-game altercation wasn't the only moment of nastiness, with PSG's French striker Kylian Mbappe sent off on the 118th minute for a high lunge at Damien Da Silva, landing his studs on the French defender's right leg.More trouble for Neymar?Neymar was recently banned from European competition by UEFA for a Instagram post criticizing match officials in charge of the French club's defeat to Manchester United in March -- the player was incensed that a last minute penalty was awarded to United using the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system.He'll serve a three-match suspension as punishment, all to be served in next season's group stage, as PSG is no longer in this year's competition.",

        "content": "(CNN)Donald Trump is not worthy of his upcoming ceremonial state visit to Britain, suggested London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday, saying that the US President is not \"in the same class\" as his predecessors.    Most US presidents have not made state visits to the UK\u2014the exceptions are Barack Obama, who visited in 2011 and George W. Bush, who visited in 2003.\"History tells us only two [US] Presidents have had a state visit,\" Khan said during an interview on British radio station LBC. \"President Trump is not in the same class as those two.\"\"Of course we should have a close relationship with the president of the USA, but we shouldn't be rolling out the red carpet, we shouldn't have a state banquet,\" Sadiq added. Trump's state visitRead MoreTrump has traveled to the UK before, meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle in 2018, but that was styled as a working visit.This time, his visit is planned to take place from June 3 to June 5, and will involve the full trappings of a state occasion. Its grand ceremonial flourishes will be similar to those enjoyed by Obama, including a formal welcome at Horse Guard's Parade, followed by lunch and dinner at Buckingham Palace, a royal source told CNN.State visits are normally made on invitation by Queen Elizabeth. According to the royal family's official website, the program of the visit can vary.Trump's trip will finally make good on UK Prime Minister Theresa May's invitation for a full state visit, made shortly after he took office in 2016 -- which prompted 1.8 million to sign a petition in protest. Trump is deeply unpopular in the UK. His 2018 working visit sparked protests involving over 250,000 people in London and other cities. The capital's anti-Trump demonstrations featured a 20-foot \"Trump Baby\" blimp that flew outside Parliament -- given permission to do so by Khan.Khan's comments on Friday could inflame another war of words with Trump; the two have been sniping at each other in interviews and on Twitter since 2016.\"Hugh Grant-type, public scene\"Khan also said he had an issue with the way Trump talked about women -- a view he said May should \"call him out\" for during June's state visit. Though not in a \"Hugh Grant-type, public scene,\" he added, in reference to the fictional confrontation between a British Prime Minister and US President in the 2003 movie \"Love Actually.\"Khan added that Trump's treatment of women gave \"almost a green light for others to behave badly.\" During his 2016 US presidential campaign, a leaked tape from television show \"Access Hollywood\" revealed Trump bragging that he could grope women because of his celebrity status and that sometimes he would \"just start kissing them.\"\"The prime minister should say, 'Listen, we may have a special relationship, we may agree on most things but I got to tell you this... I think you are wrong on A, B, C, D and E,\" said Khan.London's first elected Muslim mayor, Khan has also previously criticized the US president for his travel ban on citizens of several Muslim-majority countries. Trump, meanwhile, has hit out at Khan for his handling of terror attacks carried out in London, citing the attacks in his call for the travel ban.In November 2017, Khan also slammed Trump for retweeting anti-Muslim propaganda from a British far-right party, and suggested May shouldn't welcome Trump into their country for a state visit.\"We're (the US's) closest mates, that give us a responsibility to call people out,\" Khan said in his interview today.",

But just 24 hours later, in the same competition, fellow Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur overturned a 3-0 deficit to somehow top Liverpool's feat and set up an all-English Champions League final in Madrid on June 1.The weekend promises to be just as exciting, with Manchester City and Liverpool taking to their respective fields for simultaneous kickoffs -- and it's anyone's guess who'll be crowned Premier League champs.But that's not all.

        "content": "Bristol and Willenhall, England (CNN)As you drive into the market town of Willenhall in central England, the words \"Willenhall is wonderful\" are emblazoned in large letters across the wall of a supermarket.Locals laugh ruefully at the sight, for they remember fondly what once stood there before the store -- a renowned Yale lockworks factory.\"If you've got to put that on the wall, Willenhall isn't wonderful -- you don't have to convince yourself,\" Roger Wilcox, a local resident, said with a chuckle. This small town lies around 15 miles northwest of Birmingham in England's \"Black Country,\" an area that some say was named after the smoke created by the explosion of factories, mines and mills here during the Industrial Revolution. It then sat at the heart of the country's lock-making industry, which required skills that were passed down through generations and employed thousands of people. Read MoreBut it no longer exists. British lock-making declined in the late 1980s when it became cheaper to import from abroad, and many businesses closed. Willenhall's lock industry declined in the 1980s amid recession and competition from cheaper foreign imports.The decline hit families hard in the region, rendering the many skills locals had redundant overnight, and stalling Willenhall's growth. \"Almost every day you'd see a piece of machinery on a flatbed lorry leaving the town and you'd think, 'that's been sold to India, that's been sold to China' and of course the jobs are going as well,\" Wilcox said.Willenhall, situated in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall, is now among the most deprived areas in England, with poorer health and higher rates of unemployment than other areas of the country. The area also voted by 67.9% to leave the European Union in the UK'S 2016 referendum.Walsall North, Willenhall's constituency, also contributed the fewest signatures of any constituency to the Revoke Article 50 petition in March 2019, calling for the UK to remain in the EU.This petition was so popular it repeatedly crashed the UK Parliament website and made headlines for attracting more than 6 million signatures.     Only 1,900 residents from Walsall North signed the petition while the southwestern city of Bristol -- which voted 61.7% to remain in the EU -- sat at the opposite end of the scale. More than 37,000 people from the Bristol West constituency demanded Brexit be canceled.The attempt failed, but these signatures -- or lack thereof -- tell the story of a divide between two Englands that existed long before the Brexit vote but surfaced in its aftermath.Brexit 'crystallized' England's divideMany people now see themselves either as as Leavers or Remainers, and it's this \"Brexit identity\" that has cemented age-old splits throughout UK society -- by class, age, values and geography.Will Jennings, a professor of political science and public policy at the University of Southampton, said these divides are more important than ever. Partly that's because London still dominates the UK, but also post-industrial towns -- many of them in the Midlands and north -- have found it difficult to adapt after long-term economic and demographic decline.\"To let\" signs adorn many of the shops on the high street in Willenhall.\"The major difference that we see between core cities and smaller towns is the great divergence between the age of population,\" said Jennings, who has spent five years studying how Britain's core economic model favors its cities over its towns. Over the past 30 years English towns have aged, while cities, such as Bristol, have become younger and younger. And by losing key trades, towns such as Willenhall have lost a large amount of jobs. The number of people with professional qualifications and skills has stagnated as the young move to cities.Brexit has \"crystallized\" England's divide, Jennings told CNN, fueling \"a politics of resentment, or cultural backlash ... because the populations of different parts of the same country ... hold increasingly divergent views.\"     'The land that time forgot'Wilcox, who worked as a police officer in Willenhall for 30 years, believes the town voted so heavily to leave the EU because locals feel it's \"the land that time forgot.\"He said residents here often feel they're the last -- if at all -- to be considered or consulted during policy changes. For them, the future feels like something that's happening elsewhere.The area itself started to feel depressed -- not just individuals, but because the whole of society was changing.Mike Batchelor, Willenhall local\"I think the Black Country and the West Midlands has long been seen to be behind the curve. I remember my wife saying when she worked in London in Oxford Street that if a rep was sent to the West Midlands, it was considered to be a punishment posting.\"Mike Batchelor, a project manager at a local charity store and advice center, Bridging the Gap, said locals now call Willenhall a \"dormitory town\" -- a place with no major industries where people travel to larger towns or cities nearby for work. Things began to feel different when factories closed after the recession in the late 1980s, he reflects.\"At first people could transfer from one engineering industry to another because of transferable skills but as more and more of the engineering factories closed down and manufacturing changed or went abroad ... the hands-on skills were not needed anymore,\" Batchelor said.\"The area itself started to feel depressed -- not just individuals, but because the whole of society was changing.\"Mike Batchelor is a project manager at the charity store and advice center, Bridging the Gap.Batchelor remembers how the main street used to be bustling in the 1960s, when factory workers -- who all lived locally -- would pour onto the street and into the street market. \"You would have to weave your way in and out of people,\" he recalls. While the market still runs, on a smaller scale, only a few original shops remain on the main street. Some new stores have opened, but many others are advertised as \"to let.\" Willenhall's police station, train station and post office have also closed.\"It's those little things where the town has lost its status,\" Wilcox said. \"We have lost significant parts of our identity.\"The loss of something like a train station greatly inhibits economic opportunity. \"What we're seeing is that geography and connectivity matters more than ever in the global community,\" Jennings said. \"Where you are and how you are connected to things is both important for economic opportunity but also important in terms of support services.\" As a result, younger people, including Batchelor's children, have moved away to cities for better opportunities and \"don't tend to come back.\"This anecdote is clearly illustrated in Willenhall's demographic statistics. There's been a 32% decrease in those aged 24 or younger and a 45% increase in those aged over 65 in the last 30 years, and that's just one example of what's happening to towns all over the country.'12 separate towns stitched together'Meanwhile, cities are getting younger and more diverse. With a population of around 460,000 Bristol has become the second most populous city in southern England and was declared the best place to live in the UK in 2017 by the The Sunday Times.\"What you have is a cocktail of things (in Bristol),\" its mayor, Marvin Rees told CNN. \"(It's) city that goes on being international, a world-class university, a thriving creative sector that's grown.\"     During a short drive from its main train station it becomes clear how eclectic the city is -- with various districts, each with their own distinct character. There's a shopping quarter, a redeveloped harborside, leafy Clifton with upscale boutiques and beautiful Georgian homes, and Stokes Croft, with a vibrant artist community and walls upon walls of street art. \"Bristol's an interesting place. It's almost like 12 completely separate towns that have all been stitched together,\" said local Sam Hickmott, who's also part of the pro-EU political group Bristol for Europe.Overlooking the city of Bristol and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. It has become attractive to not only international migrants, but it also has the highest net internal migration in the UK. \"There's a head of steam that ends up here. The more exciting and innovative and creative and diverse the city becomes it attracts those people who are drawn to that and they invest in it and they grow it,\" Rees said.A microcosm of EnglandWhile there are a lot of positives about Bristol in the way its economy is flourishing, it's also a city that suffers from inequality. \"There are parts of the city that are very connected to the center and there are peripheral parts of Bristol ... that are exhibiting the same sorts of dynamics [as towns] on a micro level,\" Jennings said.Just five miles south of Bristol's city center is Hartcliffe, a suburb that consists largely of public housing and suffers from the city's greatest levels of deprivation. It also voted to leave the EU. Here men will die an average of 10 years earlier than those in the district of Hotwells near the city center. Young people are also significantly less likely to go on to higher education. This inequality is something Bristol's mayor experienced first-hand.\"As a young kid growing up in Bristol there were periods where I felt quite hopeless, like I was looking in on all this prosperity and this opportunity and it wasn't for me,\" Rees remembers. \"I've lived on the underbelly of Bristol in many ways and yet, this is a city that ... then ultimately voted for me to become Mayor.\"Marvin Rees is the first Black African-Caribbean descent mayor to be elected in Europe.As a result of the deprivation suffered by many throughout the country, Rees believes Brexit is the \"wrong answer to the right problem.\"\"The right problem are all those things that people are citing, but Brexit isn't going to solve those,\" he said. \"The architects of Brexit don't have any track record of delivering on poverty, social inclusion and empowerment of people who have been left behind by the political system.\"Jennings echoes this sentiment. \"Without a fundamental change to an economic model that's based on agglomeration of city regions, it seems unlikely that these divisions are going to go away -- regardless of what happens with Brexit. \"We're going to continue to see the sorts of pressure on demographics that are driving places apart.\"However in Willenhall, Wilcox remains optimistic, despite the town's decline.\"As long as the economy keeps growing, it will trickle down and eventually, last of all, it will reach places like this.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)In the past, when people thought about electric cars they probably envisaged being stranded at the side of the road, an empty battery and not a charging point in sight.The thought of even getting from home to work and back was worrying enough, and the idea of making it from one country to another was, frankly, absurd.Fast forward to 2019 and electric vehicles have come a long way. Gone are the short battery ranges and sporadic charging stations -- there are now full charges which last for hundreds of kilometers and a rapidly-growing network of chargers.Perceptions about what electric cars can be have changed too, thanks in part to Formula E's advent which has shown they can be fast and fun and not like old milk floats.Vastly improved technology, allied to environmental concerns, has also seen the sale of electric vehicles (EVs) soar in recent years.Read MoreREAD: Spectacular crashes mark first wet ePrixREAD: This is what supercars will look like in 2035According to EV Volumes, a global electric car database, plug-in vehicle sales reached 2,100,000 in 2018, 64% higher than in 2017.Of the total sales, 69% -- or 1,449,000 -- were all-electric, while the remaining 31% were plug-in hybrids.And for the first time in its 42-year history, British magazine What Car? chose an electric vehicle as its Car of the Year. But if you're thinking Tesla's latest model or BMW's new electric i8, think something more understated.Kia's e-Niro is the car for now, according to What Car? Marketed as a spacious, affordable family car, the e-Niro boasts a range of 282 miles (454 kilometers) in a single charge and is completely emission free. This improved technology has seen an increase in battery life across the EV market, with most cars now comfortably exceeding the 150-mile range, more than enough for the average road user to complete several journeys.

Take the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, the world's first mass-produced, highway-capable electric car that was released in 2009.The US version had a range of just 62 miles (100km) in a single charge, though the 2015 version increased to 100 miles (161km) and takes just 30 minutes to fully charge.\"Now of course, you don't have that problem in a petrol or a diesel car because you can just pull into a petrol station,\" Moss says. \"But I think these days electric cars have come on to the point where the range is pretty good. \"So this car, the e-Niro will do 407km in the real world between charges, about 253 miles and the majority of journeys, that's going to be absolutely fine.\"The chances are, if you're doing that kind of journey, you're going to need to stop, in which case you'll be doing it somewhere like a motorway service station, where there are fast chargers which can get you back up to 80% in about 75 minutes, so that's enough time for a coffee and a chat.\" Photos: The 2018/19 Formula E seasonFormula E 2018/19 \u2013 The 2018/19 Formula E season proved to be a thriller, with the exciting new Gen2 cars boasting top speeds of 280km/h.

Despite knowing we should make it comfortably with miles to spare, range anxiety inevitably kicks in as our eyes flick to and from the dashboard, checking the charge at regular intervals.Once we land in Caen, the longest stretch of the journey lies ahead; a five-hour, 150-mile drive to the iconic Invalides in the heart of Paris, where the eighth leg of the Formula E calendar takes place.Sadly, the miserable British weather has followed us across the Channel and while the gloom hinders our view of the rolling French countryside, it at least offers us the chance to test more of the car's functions.Sensors detect when rainfall on the windshield gets heavier and automatically turn on the wipers, while the heated seats and steering wheel provide a welcome bubble from the outside elements.It's widely acknowledged that the next big step in the car industry will be autonomous vehicles. The e-Niro has cameras providing lane assistance which forcibly pull you back into the middle of your lane if you stray and the cruise control adjusts its speed, accelerating and decelerating based on the distance to the car in front of you.

We pull into the gardens of Les Invalides, meters from where the weekend's race will start and check the dashboard one last time -- we made it and with 66 miles to spare. Range anxiety? Nothing to worry about.",

        "content": "(CNN)After a week in which football has redefined the word \"incredible,\" the Premier League title race enters the final chapter of an extraordinary season.Follow @cnnsport\n\nReigning champion Manchester City, the odds on favorite, will retain the title should it defeat Brighton on Sunday. Should Pep Guardiola's men triumph at the Amex, then that is it. City is the Premier League champion.But in a week in which City's chief rival Liverpool qualified for the Champions League final in the most dramatic of circumstances, and Tottenham stunned European football with an astonishing comeback win at Ajax, you can perhaps forgive City fans for feeling slightly apprehensive.Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp  celebrates his side's win over Barcelona with his players.To that end, the Premier League has confirmed that two trophies will be on standby for Sunday, just in case Manchester City fails to beat Brighton and Liverpool is crowned champion.The 'Champions Trophy', which has been sitting in City's trophy cabinet all season, will be brought to Brighton for Guardiola's team to lift should it be triumphant. A second trophy, identical in appearance and with an engraved base detailing past Premier League champions, will be at Anfield for Liverpool should it provide the venue for yet another remarkable chapter in the club's history.Read MoreVincent Kompany and Sergio Aguero of Manchester City lift the 2018 Premier League trophy.Still, Brighton, one place outside of the relegation zone, have offered little in way of a scare factor for a City side that defeated the south coast club in the FA Cup semifinal last month. For Brighton, without a win in eight league games, the only highlight being a draw away at Arsenal, the season is all but over after narrowly escaping relegation. But should Brighton decided against a day trip to the beach and instead gain a result against City, then the Premier League title could be off to Merseyside.     If Liverpool, fresh from that astonishing victory against Barcelona, wins at Anfield on Sunday then it will finish the season with 97 points -- the highest any team in second has ever achieved. Even more galling is the fact that should it avoid defeat against Wolves, it would have lost just one league game all season.Divock Origi of Liverpool (27) celebrates as he scores his team's fourth goal against Barcelona with Xherdan Shaqiri.Both City and Liverpool have been exceptional, but only one can become Premier League champion.  So far, the lead at the top of table has changed hands 32 times ... only Liverpool can make it 33.Here's how the great battle between two of England's and Europe's most in-form clubs unfolded.October 7: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester City City's Riyad Mahrez misses a late penalty at Anfield as the game finishes goalless.Manchester City wasted a glorious opportunity to claim a first win in 15 years at Anfield after Riyad Mahrez missed an 85th minute penalty.Mahrez fired high and wide of the goal after teammate Leroy Sane was fouled by Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk.His miss left both teams unbeaten after eight games, with City top of the pile ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool on goal difference.Points: Manchester City 20, Liverpool 20December 2: Liverpool 1-0 EvertonOrigi scores a dramatic last-minute winner against Everton to give Liverpool bragging rights in the Merseyside derby.Better late than never, Liverpool sneaked past local rival Everton courtesy of Divock Origi's 96th minute winner.Origi, making his first Premier League appearance since August 2017, netted from close-range after a mistake by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.The dramatic scenes at the end of the contest were too much for some to handle with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp running onto the pitch to celebrate -- an act he later apologized for.The win moved Liverpool to within two points of Manchester City with 14 games of the season having been played.December 8: Chelsea 2-0 Manchester City Chelsea's  David Luiz (R) celebrates with Ross Barkley after scoring his side's second goal in the 2-0 win over Manchester City.City suffered its first defeat of the Premier League season as Chelsea claimed a surprise victory at Stamford Bridge.Goals from N'Golo Kante and David Luiz brought an end to City's 21-game unbeaten league run stretching back to April 2018, and a sequence of 14 unbeaten games away from home.City boss Pep Guardiola refused to blame his players for the defeat, insisting they had been \"fantastic.\"Points: Liverpool 42, Manchester City 41December 22:  Manchester City 2-3 Crystal Palace Andros Townsend's sensational effort helped Crystal Palace secure a shock 3-2 win at City.City suffered its first home defeat of the season as Crystal Palace pulled off a stunning 3-2 win at the Etihad.Trailing to Ilkay Gundogan's 27th-minute strike, Palace roared back to lead 3-1 with Andros Townsend's exquisite strike a contender for goal of the season.Kevin De Bruyne pulled one back with five minutes remaining but Palace held on to record its first win at City for 28 years.The defeat, City's first at home in the league all season, halted a run of nine successive league victories at the Etihad for Guardiola's side.Points: Liverpool 48, Manchester City 44Dec 29: Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal Roberto Firmino celebrates after scoring a hat-trick in his side's victory over Arsenal. Roberto Firmino scored a hat-trick as Liverpool came from behind to thrash Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield.The home side led 4-1 at the interval with Firmino's quickfire double canceling out Ainsley Maitland Niles' opener for Arsenal, before Sadio Mane and Mo Salah got in on the act.Firmino completed his treble from the penalty spot in the second half to leave Liverpool nine points clear of second place Tottenham and 10 ahead of City.Liverpool's total of 54 points from its opening 20 Premier League games was the third highest in Premier League history after Chelsea (55 in 2005-06) and Manchester City (58 in 2017-18Points: Liverpool 54, Manchester City 44January 3: Manchester City 2-1 LiverpoolLeroy Sane scores his side's second goal in the 2-1 win over Liverpool at the Etihad.City claimed a dramatic 2-1 win to end Liverpool's unbeaten 20-game start to the Premier League season and move to within four points of Klopp's side.Leroy Sane's strike, 18 minutes from time, secured all three points for City from a game of fine margins at the Etihad.Liverpool was denied the opening goal of the game in the first half when Mane's effort was cleared off the line  by John Stones with the ball just 1.12 cm from going over.Having gone so close, it was even more galling for Liverpool when it fell behind to Sergio Aguero's 40th minute strike. Liverpool equalized after the break through Firmino but Sane's strike sealed the points for Guardiola's men.Points: Liverpool 54, Manchester City 50January 30: Liverpool 1-1 Leicester Leicester City's Harry Maguire shoots to score in the 1-1 draw at Liverpool.Liverpool missed the opportunity to move seven points clear of Manchester City after being held to a 1-1 draw by Leicester at Anfield.After taking a third minute lead through Mane, Klopp's men failed to impose themselves on the contest with a snow-affected pitch causing problems for both sets of players.Harry Maguire's equalizer, just before half time, denied the home side all three points and the opportunity to capitalize on Manchester City's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle 24 hours earlier.Points: Liverpool 61, Manchester City 56February 10: Manchester City 6-0 ChelseaSergio Aguero celebrates scoring his team's third goal in the 6-0 win over Chelsea.Aguero scored a hat-trick and Manchester City scored four goals inside opening 25 minutes on its way to thrashing Chelsea 6-0. The result took City back to the top of the Premier League on goal difference, though having played a game more than Liverpool.Aguero's hat-trick, his 11th in the Premier League, equaled the record held by former Blackburn and Newcastle forward Alan Shearer.Points: Manchester City 65, Liverpool 65February 24: Manchester United 0-0 LiverpoolLiverpool's Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum looks frustrated after his side's draw at Old Trafford.Liverpool endured a frustrating afternoon at Old Trafford after failing to beat a Manchester United side ravaged by injury.The home side had to make three substitutions in the first half because of injuries to key players, but still managed to prevent Liverpool from scoring.In fact, Klopp's side barely threatened, managing just one attempt on target despite enjoying 65% of possession.The draw took Liverpool above Manchester City and back to the top of the table but only by a single point with 11 games remaining.Points: Liverpool 66, Manchester City 65March 3: Everton 0-0 Liverpool Liverpool's Mo Salah was unable to find a way through Everton as his side was held to a 0-0 draw at Goodison.Everton took great delight in preventing Liverpool from returning to the top of the Premier League table after holding its near neighbor to a goalless draw at Goodison Park.Salah was twice denied as Everton goalkeeper Pickford and his defense frustrated Liverpool's attempts to find a breakthrough.The result left Liverpool in second place on 70 points, one behind City, with nine league games remaining.Points: Manchester City 71, Liverpool 70April 20: Manchester City 1-0 TottenhamCity midfielder Phil Foden scores the only goal of the game in the 1-0 win over Tottenham.City returned to the top with a narrow 1-0 win over Tottenham just days after the London club had ended Guardiola's hopes of winning the Champions League.In a tight contest, Phil Foden's fifth minute header was enough to secure all three points for the home side.Spurs had chances of its own but failed to find a way through, despite having scored three times at the Etihad days earlier on its way to securing a 4-4 draw on aggregate to qualify for the Champions League semifinal.City's victory took its tally to 86 and a point clear of Liverpool with four games remaining.Points: Manchester City 86, Liverpool 85April 24: Manchester United 0-2 Manchester City Bernardo Silva celebrates scoring his team's first goal during the 2-0 win at Old Trafford.Manchester City eased to a 2-0 victory over struggling neighbor Manchester United in a game that once again highlighted the gap in quality between the two rivals.Goals from Bernardo Silva and Leroy Sane secured the points as Guardiola became the first manager to win three consecutive away Premier League games at Old Trafford.The win took City back to the top on 89 points, one ahead of Liverpool, with three games remaining.It was the 28th occasion that the lead had changed hands at the top of the Premier League, the joint-most alongside the 2000/2001 campaign.Points: Manchester City 89, Liverpool 88May 4: Newcastle 2-3 LiverpoolDivock Origi heads home his side's winner in the 3-2 victory at Newcastle.Few Premier League clashes have provided such entertainment as Liverpool's battles with Newcastle and this fixture didn't disappoint.Leading through Virgil van Dijk's early header, Liverpool were caught cold by the home side with Christian Atsu firing home from close range to send St James' Park into a frenzy.Salah's clever finish gave Liverpool the lead for the second time before Newcastle hit back nine minutes after the interval when Salomon Rondon's fierce effort flew into the corner of the net.But with the clock beginning to tick down, Divock Origi, on in place of the injured Salah, headed an 86th minute winner to secure a priceless victory for the visiting side and take it back to the top of the Premier League table.Points: Liverpool 94, Manchester City 92May 6: Manchester City 1-0 Leicester CityVincent Kompany celebrates scoring in his side's dramatic victory over Leicester.Few Manchester City fans will ever forget this victory over Leicester with Vincent Kompany's astonishing 30-yard strike taking his team to within one victory of retaining the Premier League title.Kompany's 70th minute effort broke the tension as Leicester threatened to steal a point and leave Liverpool in pole position with just one league game of the season remaining.But Kompany's goal secured a 13th consecutive Premier League win for his team and took City back to the top of the league, a point ahead of Liverpool.It was the Belgian's first goal from outside of the penalty area for the club since arriving in English football 11 years ago.Points: Manchester City 95, Liverpool 94Final chapterOn Sunday, Manchester City will win the title if it defeats Brighton.Should it fail, Liverpool can capitalize by beating Wolves and leapfrogging City into top spot to claim the crown.Whatever happens though, the events of the past week should tell you one thing: Expect the unexpected.",

At the top, Robin Frijns -- the winner last time out in Paris -- now holds a one-point lead over Andre Lotterer, with Antonio Felix Da Costa another 10 points back in third ahead of other drivers still in title contention.\"Complicated and random\"DS Techeetah driver Jean-Eric Vergne describes this season's title fight as \"complicated, difficult and random.\" The open nature of the championship doesn't help if -- like the Frenchman -- you are trying to defend a title. \"No-one will take control of the championship,\" Vergne, who is sixth in the standings, tells CNN. \"Last year I took the lead quite early on and never left it, this year it changes all the time. Last year I won (the title) a race before. I don't think that's going to happen this year, it's just too complicated, just too difficult, a bit too random as well. \"I actually believe that a guy that doesn't win a race this year can win the championship.\" Photos: Techeetah partner DS, which is sponsoring the Formula E team this season, has released its \"dream\" car the X E-TENSE.Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Slated for a 2035 release, the all electric supercar has been designed with two different engines, one for race tracks and one for road use.Hide Caption 2 of 6 Photos: It boasts a driverless mode which will allow the passenger to kick back inside the comfy 'cocoon.'Hide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: Tesla expect its electric supercar, the Roadster, to be ready as early as next year and claim in will be able to complete 620 miles per charge, while boasting a top speed of 250mph.Hide Caption 4 of 6 Photos: The Rimac C_TWO slightly edges the Roadster for speed, boasting a top speed of 258mph, but will do 403 miles in one charge.Hide Caption 5 of 6 Photos: Though not a supercar, Aston Martin's Lagonda expects to revolutionize road travel with its vast, luxurious interior.

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool's stunning comeback against Barcelona in the Champions League semifinals has been described as the greatest in European history. But how did the English Premier League side overcome a 3-0 deficit to win 4-3 on aggregate and stun the La Liga champions? CNN Sport looks at five key reasons why the match turned in Liverpool's favor. READ: Liverpool stuns Barcelona to reach Champions League finalAn atmosphere like no otherAnfield under the floodlights tends to inspire. There is always hope on European nights when Liverpool plays in the iconic stadium, nestled among back-to-back terraced houses.The city of Liverpool and the Anfield district has had its fair share of economic and social problems and the football club is seen as key to the area's redevelopment.Read MoreIt's estimated that the Premier League team boosted the local economy by $644 million during the 2017/2018 season, with 1.5 million fans coming to Anfield. On Tuesday one of those fans was Australian Mark Calleja, who had traveled from Sydney to watch the second leg semifinal. He told CNN Sport that it was \"rare to get an opportunity\" to witness what unfolded.Ahead of major European games the Anfield district rocks. Thousands of fans gather in the streets surrounding the  stadium. Songs are sung and flares are lit as opposition teams are given a taste of what to expect once they get on the pitch.Another warning for the opposition that this might be a stadium like no other is the \"This Is Anfield\" sign that's hung in the players' tunnel. It's the last thing a player would see before a game.Fans belt out the club's anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" ahead of kickoff to further pump up the volume. Originally written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, Liverpool supporters adopted the song after Merseyside band Gerry and the Pacemakers released a cover version in 1963.It's because of the crowd's ability to galvanize that progress to the Champions League final was never entirely dismissed despite the 3-0 first-leg deficit Jurgen Klopp and his men had to overcome. Even the most experienced visitors can become paralyzed when in the middle of the Anfield din.Liverpool fans at Anfield during Champions League semifinal against Barcelona.\"If I have to describe this club then it's a big heart and tonight [Tuesday] it was pounding like crazy,\" said Klopp after the miracle match. \"You could hear it all over the world.\"The Liverpool faithful has roused its team to achieve the unlikely before -- there was the 2004 victory over Olympiakos and the 4-3 thriller over Borussia Dortmund in 2016 -- but nothing compares to the astonishing 4-0 win over a team led by Lionel Messi, their tormentor at the Camp Nou. At a shaking Anfield, when the lights are at full wattage and the crowd is making eardrums ring, even some of the greatest footballers the world has seen can be rattled.\"I don't think I'll see or hear an atmosphere like this again,\" said Alan Shearer, commentating on BBC Radio 5 live. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos Messi looks dejected as the scoreboard reads '4-0' at Anfield.From sidelines to starring rolesEven with a history of defying the odds in Europe -- the \"Miracle of Istanbul\" when 3-0 down at halftime to AC Milan in the 2005 final to name but one -- Liverpool was not really expected to knock out a Barcelona side which had just won La Liga and was chasing a treble. There was no Mo Salah or Roberto Firmino for Barcelona to contend with. How could replacements Divock Origi -- a player who had not scored in the Champions League -- and Xherdan Shaqiri trouble the visiting defense to such an extent that it would concede four? Well, they did. It was the Belgian -- who has twice scored match-winning goals in the EPL this season -- who sparked the revival, tapping in from close range, sowing seeds of doubt, causing the decibels inside Anfield to rise some more. Origi (right) and Shaqiri celebrate after the Belgian scores Liverpool's fourth. And, of course, it was Origi who lasered the winner into the net after Trent Alexander-Arnold's quickly taken corner, described as a \"genius\" moment by his manager. Powerful, tireless, pacy, the 24-year-old was part of a front three which left Barcelona gulping for breath. Shaqiri, starting a match for the first time since January, harried and hurried the frazzled men in yellow, which is not usually his forte. When a player known more for guile than grit works tirelessly then anything can indeed happen. And it did. Summer signings a forceIf the Reds were without two of their prolific front three, in Sadio Mane, the lone representative of Liverpool's famed forward line, they had an indefatigable forward who was a constant threat.  At the other end of the field was Alisson, briefly the world's most expensive goalkeeper when he joined from Roma for $84 million last summer, and playing as much a part in the astonishing victory as the men who formed the red wave in front of him. Twice he produced fine saves from Messi, and also kept out Philippe Coutinho, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez, to deny Barcelona a precious away goal. Neither was the Brazilian the only summer signing to shine. Fabinho was a force, Virgil van Djik dominant. Henderson put in captain's performance for Liverpool against Barcelona. And then there was the academy product Alexander-Arnold, who is just 20, providing the creativity from the right flank missed in the first leg, and captain Jordan Henderson, surging forward, leading by example despite being hindered by a knee injury. \"Winning is difficult but with a clean sheet, I don't know how they did it,\" said Klopp afterwards. \"I said to the boys before 'I don't think it's possible but because it's you I think we have a chance' -- they are really mentality giants. It's unbelievable.\" Klopp the charismatic leaderMohamed Salah, Jurgen Klopp and Virgil van Dijk celebrate after Liverpool's remarkable win.This was 90 minutes of red rage, a heavy metal match in the Klopp mold.  In his three years at Liverpool, Klopp had already overseen enough sensational European nights to put him into Anfield folklore -- the triumph over Dortmund, last season's victories over Manchester City and the drubbing of Roma. But there had been nothing quite as joyous as this. \"I'm not sure if it will happen again because it's so special,\" said the German. \"When I saw the boys after the game and saw the tears in their eyes, that's football. This club touches you like crazy, it's like you feel much more than others in these moments.\"JUST WATCHEDJurgen Klopp's Anfield tour for MLB playerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJurgen Klopp's Anfield tour for MLB player 04:00Only twice before had a team recovered from three goals down in a Champions League/European Cup semifinal. That an injury-hit Liverpool did it against one of the defining teams of the age makes it all the more remarkable. Former Real Madrid and Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho said the Liverpool boss was the driving force behind the victory. \"I have to say that for me, this has one name -- Jurgen,\" said Mourinho on beIN Sports. \"I think this is not about tactics, this is not about philosophy, this is about heart and soul, and a fantastic empathy he created with this group of players.\"Though this will be a fourth major final under Klopp -- and a second successive in the Champions League -- he has yet to win silverware as Liverpool boss.\"I know what people say about me and losing finals, that's absolutely right,\" said Klopp. \"But it's the fourth final in that time as well we are in, that's pretty special already.\"Wijnaldum outshines MessiWijnaldum celebrates after scoring Liverpool's third goal. \"I was really angry that the manager put me on the bench,\" admitted Georginio Wijnaldum, a player who may not have been introduced at half-time had Luis Suarez's studs not made contact with Andy Robertson, forcing off the left-back prematurely. With fire in his belly, a player who had previously only scored once in the Champions League morphed into a ruthless predator, scoring twice in 122 seconds to draw Liverpool level at 3-3. It was the first time the Dutchman had scored a brace for the Reds. His first goal squirmed underneath Marc-Andre Ter Stegen's arm, his second was a sublime header. \"I would have been proud of that one,\" Shearer, the most prolific striker in EPL history, said of the midfielder's third. Wijnaldum came off the bench, adjusted to the pace of the chaos before him, and inflicted lethal wounds on a Barcelona side which was capitulating in the knockout stages of Europe's premier cup competition for a second successive season. For the Catalans, there will be an inquest. For Liverpool, Madrid awaits in June after a comeback for the ages. CNN's Sean Coppack in Liverpool contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Two alleged Russian intelligence agents have been convicted on terrorism charges for their role in an attempted 2016 coup in the small European nation of Montenegro. Both were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are unknown.They and eleven other people from Montenegro and nearby Serbia were sentenced on Thursday at the high court in the capital Podgorica, Reuters reports.  Judge Suzana Mugosa ruled that the group tried to take over the country's parliament on the eve of elections in October 2016, and to kidnap then- Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic with the aim of derailing the country's NATO membership bid. Eduard Shishmakov and Vladimir Popov received 15- and 12-year jail terms respectively. Interpol has issued a red notice for them.Shishmakov was also tried for inciting acts against the constitution and safety of Montenegro. Read MoreThe prosecution marked the pair out as the coup's masterminds, claiming that they were Russian intelligence agents, which the Kremlin denies. Moscow has repeatedly called the allegations about their role in the coup \"absurd.\"\"Moscow must desist\"After the verdict was read out in court, which lasted for six hours, the Montenegrin government said that \"the judiciary has shown its adherence to its constitutional position of autonomy and resilience against every kind of pressure and external influence,\" via Twitter. \"Montenegro has once again shown that its statehood and independence rest on solid foundations of the rule of law, which no one can or will be able to shake,\" the Government added. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the 2016 coup attempt the most \"outrageous examples of Russia's attempts to undermine European democracy,\" in a statement on Thursday. \"Russia is a great country and central to European civilization. Moscow must desist from any attacks that undermine the territorial integrity and democratic processes of its neighbors or other sovereign states,\" he added. \"The UK calls on Russia to choose a different path -- to uphold the security of Europe, respect the rules based international system that keeps our societies safe, and to work together with us to fulfill our common responsibilities as permanent members of the UN Security Council.\"Montenegro became NATO's newest member in June 2017. Its formal invitation to join the alliance in 2015 spurred threats from Russian officials, who are at odds with NATO over a multitude of issues, including Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane in December 2015.CNN's Milena Veselinovic reported from London.

Trailing youthful upstart Ajax 1-0 going into the second leg in Amsterdam, Spurs' tails were down and hopes of the club's first UEFA Champions League final looking bleak. The final 3-3 aggregate scoreline seemed unfathomable 35 minutes in, when Ajax moved two goals ahead on the night courtesy of Matthijs de Ligt's header and Hakim Ziyech's fine strike, but a stunning Lucas Moura hat-trick turned the night around in spectacular style, with Spurs winning thanks to the away goals rule.Tottenham's Brazilian forward Lucas Moura celebrates with teammates at the end of the UEFA Champions League semifinal second leg match.As the game moved into the final minute of stoppage time with the game poised at 2-2 on the night, Moura produced his final moment of magic to send Tottenham through and leave the young Ajax side stunned, and football fans -- and commentators -- delirious.\ud83e\udd2f \"I've never seen anything like this!

JUST WATCHEDAllez Allez Allez: Liverpool's European anthemReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAllez Allez Allez: Liverpool's European anthem 02:44Read MoreComing back from a three-goal deficit to inflict a stunning 4-3 defeat on the Catalans, it had shades of the northwest club's famous 2005 Champions League final win over AC Milan, in which it came back from three goals at half time to stun the Italians in a penalty shootout to raise the cup for the fifth time. Liverpool stun Barcelona: Where does Champions League 'classic' rank in competition's great games?The Champions League heroics were the icing on the week which began with Manchester City's stunning rescue in the English Premier League, at the unlikely hands of captain Vincent Kompany. The club legend is known as a stalwart defender, but it was at the other end of the pitch that he made the difference -- his wonder strike against Leicester, a screamer from outside the box into the top right hand corner -- looked all but set for City to retain the Premier League title under Pep Guardiola. Kompany said he'd been telling people for years that he'd score a goal \"like that\" -- a potential candidate for goal of the season -- and it could prove decisive to Manchester club lifting the trophy come this weekend.  \"I could hear people saying 'Don't shoot, don't shoot!'. I've not come this far in my career to have young players tell me when to shoot!\"For 15 years, I've told people I'll score one like that\"- @ManCity match-winner @VincentKompany pic.twitter.com/8vgN6KKUWm\u2014 Premier League (@premierleague) May 6, 2019\n\nCan the momentum be sustained?English clubs' European adventures continue Thursday evening, with both Chelsea and Arsenal vying for a spot in the Europa League final. The two London clubs each hold a respective advantage -- Chelsea scored a potentially decisive away goal against Eintracht Frankfurt in its 1-1 first-leg draw ahead of the return fixture at Stamford Bridge -- while Arsenal came from behind to wrap up a 3-1 first-leg win over Valencia to give it a slim cushion for the other semifinal second leg in Spain. If the cards fall right for the two English Premier League teams, and they come through the Thursday night games triumphant, they will meet in Baku, Azerbaijan, on May 29 -- just days before the all-English Champions League final at Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano stadium. If it comes to pass, it would be an unprecedented display of strength from a single country -- no domestic league has ever provided all four finalists for Europe's top two competitions.JUST WATCHEDCopa90: Guardiola reveals coaching secrets - to pub teamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCopa90: Guardiola reveals coaching secrets - to pub team 05:00Curtain call on thrilling seasonBefore the European showcases, however, the incredible English Premier League week will culminate Sunday, when the league wraps with all 20 teams simultaneously kicking off at 3 p.m. local time (10 a.m ET). City's Monday night triumph kept it in pole position for the Premier League title, one point clear of Liverpool, which has kept the pressure up on its title rivals in its dogged pursuit of first a title since 1990.Few would bet against City putting Brighton to the sword on Sunday to retain its crown, especially with Liverpool handed a trickier draw against Wolves, which sit in seventh place after a surprisingly robust season, including wins against Chelsea, Spurs, Man United and Arsenal.Tim Howard: 'I hope Liverpool never win a title while I'm still breathing'Next year's Champions League places, awarded to the top four finishers, are all but decided, with City, Liverpool and Chelsea guaranteed the top three slots. But Arsenal fans will be hoping a high-scoring away win at Burnley, coupled with a Spurs collapse at home against Everton will see the Gunners pip fourth on goal difference and leapfrog its arch rival into the final Champions League spot. A back door to Europe for the north London teams, should either finish in fifth, could come in the form of winning their current European competition -- the Champions League for Spurs; Europa League for Arsenal -- as the cup winners are given an automatic bye to next season's premier European football competition. The glamor ties of Europe's top table are beyond Manchester United now -- the Red Devils have endured a torrid run since manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer inked a permanent contract, but depending on results could climb to fifth and automatic entry into the Europa League. As it stands the Manchester team will have to play through the qualifying rounds of that competition.",

The prince is now in the Netherlands to promote the fifth international sporting competition for wounded veterans and members of the military, which he founded in 2014.Prince Harry speaks with athletes during a sports training session at Sportcampus Zuiderpark.On Thursday he was met by Princess Margriet of the Netherlands at Sportcampus Zuiderpark, along with chairman of The Invictus Games, Lieutenant General Mart de Kruif, according to Britain's Press Association (PA) news agency.Spectators shouted well wishes to the prince as he arrived, some of whom had brought gifts for Archie, according to PA.Read MoreDuring his visit he was given a baby toy decorated with rabbits by a young girl, as well as an Invictus Games onesie from Princess Margriet. The Duke of Sussex was presented with an Invictus Games onesie for his newborn son Archie by Princess Margriet of The Netherlands.Later on, during a bike ride of the park, the prince was also spotted wearing a jacket embroidered with the words \"Invictus Family Daddy.\"Harry was then asked if he would bring his son to the Invictus Games in 2020, to which he replied, \"I've no idea,\" reported PA.Former Dutch military sodlier and athlete Dennis van der Stroom, Britain's Prince Harry and host Lieutenant General Mart de Kruif ride bides during the presentation of The Invictus Games in The Hague.'Our bundle of joy'On Wednesday the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared in front of selected media to introduce their first child to the world, who was born at 5:26 a.m. Monday morning.Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, during a photocall with their newborn son, in St. George's Hall at Windsor Castle.Harry said becoming a parent was \"amazing,\" while cradling the newborn at St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle.\"We're just so thrilled to have our bundle of joy. We're looking forward to spending some precious time with him as he slowly starts to grow up,\" he said.Why Archie is just what the US and UK needMeghan, meanwhile, said their son has the \"sweetest temperament.\"\"It's magic, it's pretty amazing. I mean I have the two best guys in the world. So I'm really happy,\" she gushed.Later on Wednesday afternoon, the couple shared an image of Queen Elizabeth II meeting her newest great-grandchild, along with the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan's mother Doria Ragland. They also used this post to reveal their chosen name.Archie was born Monday at 5:26 a.m. at an as-yet-undisclosed location.\"Instead of a traditional royal name, they chose a name they loved,\" said CNN's royal correspondent Max Foster. \"What they are very much doing is reflecting their generation. They are not looking to history, they are looking to now.\"Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, joined by her mother Doria Ragland, show their new son to Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.Archie Harrison may not have any precedent in the royal family, apart from Archibald Douglas. He was the 6th Earl of Angus and Scotland's King James V's stepfather until Margaret Tudor, the elder sister of England's Henry VIII, divorced him in the 16th century. But digging further back to 1066, using data from Britannica Academic and the monarchy's official website, CNN has not found the name Archie or Harrison among the names of any British monarch and their immediate offspring.Archie Harrison is seventh in line to the throne and does not qualify immediately for the title of prince. Buckingham Palace told CNN on Wednesday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had chosen not to use any title at all for their son, even though Archie will have the right to use his father's second peerage title, Earl of Dumbarton.     While not currently a prince, when Prince Charles becomes King, Prince Harry's son will automatically become His Royal Highness Prince Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.",

This is definitely a \"we let them score three unanswered goals to kick us out of the tournament\" look if we've ever seen one. Meanwhile, just a day earlier, Liverpool beat Barcelona to advance, when all Barcelona had to do was not let Liverpool win by four goals. Four goals is A LOT.  They lost 0-4. Read MoreLuis Suarez looks like he's going to be sick. For any sports fan, these moments of epic upset hit way too close to home. What we're seeing here is the universal language of defeat, the sudden primal urge to double over in despair, lay flat out on the ground, or otherwise surrender to the Big Sports Sadness. Perhaps the most famous of these \"I can't believe we lost/are losing\" poses is the surrender cobra. What causes fans and athletes to suddenly lift their hands atop their head in helplessness when facing a crushing loss? Is it some ancient biological urge? Are we exposing our soft, vulnerable underbelly to our opponent, resigned to death? Massive upsets like the recent Champions League victories are prime opportunities to spot universal tableaus of defeat. Observe, a University of Virginia basketball player, physically protecting himself from the crushing weight of the fact his #1 seeded team is about to lose to a #16 seeded team, the UMBC Retrievers, for the first time in NCAA Tournament history in 2018. And sometimes, when the unexpected comes to pass and you, the champion, become the loser, there's really nothing left to do but sit and contemplate your place in the universe. Even if the place where you sit is, you know, directly down on the field where you just watched victory slip away. New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is especially good at this. Here he is, deep in thought, after the Patriots lost to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI in 2012. Is there such a thing as a signature moment of defeat? Because here he is again, after losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII in 2018.Granted, it's not as dramatic as Ajax players splayed out on the ground like broken marionettes. But in the throes of defeat, there are no rules left to break. Mourn as you see fit.",

I wish my dad could be here today to watch me play,\" Nagalakshmi said through tears, revealing her father had recently passed away.Her story typified the unimaginable stresses put on the 150 million children thought to be surviving on the streets worldwide, but was just one of 80 unique and often harrowing stories that played in the finals on Tuesday. There was plenty of tears and laughter during the tournament. By giving a voice to children who have all spent time living in poverty, Street Child United aims to put pressure on communities and governments to protect the rights of vulnerable kids. Nepalese captain Nisha, who had never played cricket before, demonstrated the initiative was working. The tournament gave her the chance to develop her confidence in public speaking and she now plans to continue the fight for equality when she returns to Nepal. \"It's been a fantastic journey to teach other young people and I'm very excited to meet other young people from different countries,\" the 16-year-old told CNN Sport.\"Language wasn't a barrier, it was good to learn, hear their experiences and share mine as well. When I get back home, I plan to share this with a lot of other people.\" It's a mission shared by West Indies player Tishoria.\"They will look at us as role models, trend setters, an example for other street children out there,\" she told CNN Sport. Eight teams from across the world were invited to take part. 'Girls are equal to boys'There was plenty of hard work to be done in order to fly the majority of children to the United Kingdom for the event, which kicked off in Cambridge, England, before the finals were held in London. Many of the 80 children participating did not own a birth certificate or passport until getting involved with the initiative, which worked with multiple children charities across the eight participating nations: England, India South, Tanzania, Bangladesh, India North, Mauritius, Nepal and West Indies. \"It's virtually impossible but somehow it all turned out well,\" John Wroe, co-founder and CEO of Street Child United, told CNN Sport as he reflected on the challenges of organizing the event.Importantly, the majority of teams also invited both boys and girls to compete together -- breaking gender barriers which has often amplified the hardship of young street girls around the world. \"It's a platform to prove that girls are equal to boys, I want to prove we can compete with the boys,\" said a steely Nagalakshmi. Nagalakshmi (left of trophy) and her India South team lifted the Street Child Cricket World Cup.

Played in front of an enthusiastic crowd and to the beat of a live drumming band, the eight teams competed in a round-robin tournament which culminated in an enthralling final. The accolades eventually went to a dominant India South team who beat host England in a highly competitive affair -- victory was sealed with an enormous six.The boundary sparked huge celebrations, with tears of joy spilling from the eyes of players and spectators alike. The young people bonded during the week together and shared their own stories. Assembled by Centrepoint, a charity which looks to combat youth homelessness, the unfortunate runners-up were able to see the bigger picture. \"Cricket means a lot to me, I feel comfortable playing cricket and it can change the lives of other people,\" said England's Sabeha Salam.  \"We have heard other people's inspirational stories, we must respect them and stand for them to.\"'They're no longer invisible'Former England bowler Monty Panesar attended the event as an ambassador for Street Child United and hoped cricket could be a driver for change for the children.\"I think cricket is a powerful tool and you can see how this charity is helping kids get off the streets globally,\" said the 37-year-old, who has 167 Test wickets for England. \"Cricket has done wonderful things for me and it's great that these children are getting this opportunity that they probably won't get again in their lifetime.\"We are sometimes fortunate for what we have in our lives but to see these kids loving it is so refreshing.\" England player Siraj Qazi (R) said the tournament \"showed the children how talented they are.\"As the participants celebrated their achievements, an emotional Wroe was confident that the World Cup was an effective way of improving the lives of millions of children.\"Ultimately, I want no child to be living on the streets anywhere in the world. This can help start that and bring change about. It's going to happen country by country, we've already has some great results in Pakistan and India,\" he said.\"What this does is get people from their country on their side, to make them be proud of these children so they're no longer invisible. They are wearing their countries shirt at Lord's in a World Cup. It will make people take responsibility.\"",

With its high bounces and often long and grueling rallies, clay-court tennis can be an added grind on the body. It is also the surface that least helps Federer's particular brand of attacking, first-strike tennis, even if has won 11 titles on clay, including the French Open in 2009.  Federer last played at Roland Garros in 2015, when he lost in the quarterfinals to fellow Swiss and eventual champion Stan Wawrinka.

He missed the second half of the season to recover from a knee injury, having already had arthroscopic left knee surgery earlier the same year for a torn meniscus. In the past two years, he has given the clay a miss to focus on Wimbledon.But the 20-time Grand Slam champion is still firing on all cylinders, and keen to have \"no regrets,\" he opted to make a return to the clay.

We don't see it from the outside, but to control this slide there is instability in the knee, the foot, the ankle. And that in some cases can be bad for the knee or joint in question.\"Playing on clay, particularly in damp conditions, \"places more stress on the player's cardiovascular system and also muscular endurance,\" because the balls become heavier, and the rallies longer, Ian Prangley, physiotherapist and physical coach for British No. 1 Kyle Edmund, told CNN Sport.  \"If a player hasn't maintained their aerobic fitness and endurance capacity during the hard court season, then that transition to longer clay-court points can be a problem,\" added Prangley.READ: Roger Federer's tears for former coachJUST WATCHEDRoger Federer muses on retirement planningReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoger Federer muses on retirement planning 03:18'Ready for long rallies'Ahead of his opening match in Madrid, Federer said: \"You have to put in the hours on clay again. \"You have to get used to sliding. It's about the different pressures that clay puts on your thigh and calf muscles compared with grass, for example. When you're playing on grass it's more about explosivity. \"Here, it's a bit more about endurance. You just have to work on that. The work is difficult and it's hard.

So the knee has been long gone, to be honest. That was all done by mid-17, I'd say, after I won Wimbledon.\"Prangley said the five-week preparation to the clay-court season will have allowed Federer to get his body in shape for the particular rigors of the surface, adding that he would have been working on his aerobic and endurance base, and strength.READ: Nadal suffers shock defeat by Fognini in Monte CarloJUST WATCHEDRoger Federer: My dream opponent would be...ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoger Federer: My dream opponent would be... 01:41'Efficient mover' Throughout his long career, Federer has remained relatively injury free, especially compared to his rivals Nadal, top-ranked Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.\"Roger is a very efficient mover on a tennis court, and those players who are most technically proficient and therefore efficient when moving and hitting a tennis ball are at a lower risk of injury,\" said Prangley. \"This only comes with great technical training from excellent coaches, particularly when developing as a junior.\" Federer's clever scheduling of tournament blocks, followed by time off for rest and recovery, will also help him in his clay comeback.   \"Remaining injury free is knowing when to train and when to rest, so that your body can recover,\" said Prangley. \"When you have a good team of coaches, trainers and physios that work together well, they can plan out a training and competition schedule to maximize performance while reducing injury risk.\"READ: 'It's a start:' Andy Murray returns to court after surgeryJUST WATCHEDRoger Federer remembers life changing kissReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoger Federer remembers life changing kiss 03:54Nadal re-match?For years, Federer was one of the best clay-court players in the world, second only to Nadal, the winner of 11 French Open titles against whom he is 0-5 in Paris.

        "content": "Brisbane, Australia  (CNN)\"This is the climate election,\" declared Queensland Greens Sen. Larissa Waters at a Brisbane forum, weeks before the Australian election this month.  It's unsurprising that Waters would say this: The environment is always at the heart of the Greens' policy. But a series of natural disasters has forced many other Australians to take notice.Fires, floods and the worst drought in living memory have ravaged Australia in the past year, laying waste to thousands of homes, devastating the livelihoods of farmers and wreaking millions of dollars' worth of damage. In January, record-breaking temperatures soared so high, for so long that asphalt roads started to melt.\"When I was first elected in 2010, scientists were telling us it was the critical decade,\" Waters told the audience. \"It's nearly the end of that decade and we've bloody wasted it.\"The electorate is aware. Concern about climate change is now at a 10-year high among Australians, with 64% believing it should be a top priority for the government, according to an Ipsos poll released in April. Read MoreThousands of climate striking students recently walked out of class, while Extinction Rebellion activists are stopping coal trains and blocking roads.The Greens have long campaigned for action but remain a minor party without the numbers to govern. But as climate change becomes a key issue in the May 18 election, Australia's two major parties agree that something needs to be done. The questions are what, when -- and crucially -- how much is it going to cost? JUST WATCHEDUndeniable climate change factsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUndeniable climate change facts 02:24No clear climate policyAustralia is getting hotter. The rise in temperatures, once a future threat, is now an ever present danger, raising the risk of severe droughts, bush fires and intense rainfall across the country, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. On paper, at least, the country is taking action.In 2015, Australia was among the nearly 200 nations that gathered in the French capital and pledged to take decisive action on climate change, under the Paris Climate Agreement. Specifically, Australia agreed to cut its carbon emissions to 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.  The government's doing that by encouraging businesses and the public sector to cut emissions through its Emissions Reduction Fund, while promoting investment in new technologies like renewable energy.     Currently, investment in renewable energy is growing fast and renewables -- mostly hydropower, wind and solar -- provide around 21% of Australia's energy needs. In the United States, it's closer to 17%, and in the United Kingdom it's about 20%.Despite this, in its 2018 Emissions Gap Report, the United Nations said there had been \"no improvement\" in Australia's climate policy since 2017, noted that emission levels for 2030 were projected to be \"well above\" target. Prime Minister Scott Morrison insists Australia will meet its Paris Agreement targets. But critics say that's only because it's carrying over credits obtained under the Kyoto Protocol, and it's not doing enough to cut emissions now.\"Australia has certainly been lagging behind on climate change action, by which I mean the effort to decarbonize the economy and reduce emissions,\" said Frank Jotzo, director of the Center for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University. Locals and pro-Adani supporters gather outside the Commercial Hotel to protest against anti-Adani activists as they arrive in Clermont by convoy on April 27.Efforts have been held back, he said, by intense political wrangling that has seen policies introduced then revoked.  But in this election politics might also help. The opposition Labor Party has seized on climate policy as one of the few points of difference with Morrison's ruling Liberal Party. If elected, it's promising to cut Australia's carbon emissions by 45% on 2005 levels, compared to the government's minimum pledge of 26%. Earlier this year, when it became clear the government's perceived inaction on climate could cost it votes, it introduced a climate policy, which includes a $2 billion Climate Solutions Fund, as well as plans for the world's second largest pumped hydropower station. While climate change expert Jotzo said the new climate policy was light on details, he saw it as a \"positive sign.\" \"It's an acknowledgment that a mainstream party in Australia needs to have a climate change policy in order to be electable,\" he said.  The coal face of the issueWhile both main parties are talking a big game on climate change, their commitment to action is being tested by the prospect of a large, new coal mine planned in north Queensland.The government has long argued that Australia needs coal to sustain its world-leading run of economic growth. In February 2017, Prime Minister Scott Morrison -- then treasurer -- made his position clear when he brought a lump of coal into Parliament.\"This is coal. Don't be afraid, don't be scared,\" he said, to jeers from the opposition. \"It's coal that has ensured for over 100 years that Australia has enjoyed an energy-competitive advantage that has delivered prosperity to Australian businesses.\"   For years, Indian mining conglomerate Adani has been pushing for approval for its Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin, in Queensland. The mine would ship coal to India, China and Vietnam to feed the growing energy needs of those nations and create much-needed jobs in Australia.     The Galilee Basin is one of the world's largest unexploited coal reserves and covers 274,000 square kilometers (105,792 square miles) -- an area bigger than the United Kingdom.  The issue has divided voters into pro-Adani or anti-Adani camps in Queensland, said Maxine Newlands, political scientist at James Cook University.\"But that's really a trope for the whole debate about where does Australia go and its climate change policy,\" she added.Economy versus environmentWhen the mine was proposed in 2010, the prospect of 10,000 new jobs caused a rush of excitement in Townsville.That opportunity could have helped solve the north Queensland coastal city's high-profile unemployment problem: about 8% of Townsville is unemployed, compared to the national average of 5% -- meaning that about 8,000 people are jobless.Since then, fierce protests and a lack of access to funding and state subsidies have downsized the capacity of the proposed mine from a behemoth producing 60 million metric tons of coal a year to a more modest 27.5 million metric tons per year facility. That cut the job creation prospects, too.  No party wants to lose voters in regional seats by appearing to condemn the unemployed. So both parties are trying to avoid the issue.Environmental protesters, however, are facing it head on.A convoy of Stop Adani protesters recently drove up the east coast of Australia from Hobart in Tasmania to the mine in central Queensland, some in electric cars, to spread their message to voters. Campaigners and locals attend a rally against the Adani mine in Airlie Beach, April 26.\"If this mine goes ahead, there are half a dozen mines that will surely follow and that will render us with no chance of turning around climate change,\" Greens Party leader Richard di Natale said when the convoy stopped in Brisbane.Protesters say more mines in North Queensland could boost traffic from coal ships near the Great Barrier Reef, which has already suffered damage from higher emissions caused by warming seas. The natural wonder runs 2,300 kilometers (1,500 miles) down the length of the coast, 350 kilometers (217 miles) from the mine.JUST WATCHEDThe race to save the Great Barrier ReefReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe race to save the Great Barrier Reef 03:49Adani company says that in stage one, the mine will produce only a small fraction of Australia's annual coal output, and argues that if Australia isn't mining the coal, other countries will step in to meet growing demand from Asia.The government cleared the way for the mine just before calling the election. Now, Labor -- running on its pro-environment platform -- needs to give final approval, at a local level. But the timeline for approval isn't clear.Whatever happens, there is likely to be anger -- and potentially protests -- on the losing side.Climate change expert Jotzo said he hopes that the next Australian Prime Minister, whoever that might be, will soon realize that a faster transition to renewable energy won't lead to economic ruin -- it could, potentially, have the opposite effect.\"There is an interesting vision of Australia as the renewable energy superpower, as an exporter of renewable energy. That is a realistic prospect and one that holds significant economic opportunities,\" Jotzo said. \"What you'd see is very large solar parks in the north of Australia producing very large amounts of hydrogen that are then being shipped to east Asia and potentially Europe.\"Of course, that would take money, time and political will. Right now, the country seems to be short of all three.",

That meant manager Jurgen Klopp turned to players like Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri, who for much of the season have been confined to the substitutes bench.Perhaps that's the greatest tribute to Klopp's man management skills, because both Origi and Shaqiri were vital to Liverpool's 4-0 win.

Liverpool looked to be on the end of a drubbing after an early goal from Paolo Maldini and a brace from Hernan Crespo, the second of which saw the Argentine latch onto one a sublime through ball from the Brazilian international Kaka, gave pre-match favorites Milan a 3-0 halftime lead.But a rousing 15 minutes at the start of the second period saw Liverpool's captain-fantastic, Steven Gerrard pull one back before Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso leveled matters.Extra time couldn't separate the sides so penalties were required. Serginho and Andrea Pirlo missed for Milan before Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek saved the decisive kick from Andrei Shevchenko to give Liverpool an unlikely and remarkable win.JUST WATCHEDJurgen Klopp's Anfield tour for MLB playerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJurgen Klopp's Anfield tour for MLB player 04:00Deportivo La Coruna 4-0 AC Milan, 2004 quarterfinalSorry Milan fans, here's another match you'd probably rather forget.

        "content": "Story highlightsLiverpool 4-0 Barcelona (Agg: 4-3)Liverpool reach Champions League final (CNN)On a frenetic, nerve-shredding night at Anfield, Liverpool completed one of the great Champions League comebacks to knock out Barcelona and reach a second consecutive final.Trailing 3-0 from the first leg and without two of its star strikers, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino, few had given Liverpool even a glimmer of hope.But at Anfield, and especially in Europe, never count Liverpool out. Somehow, Jurgen Klopp's team conjured up four goals to win the semifinal 4-3 on aggregate. As they attempted to take on board the enormity of their achievement, a succession of players uttered the word \"unbelievable.\" Klopp used a different word: \"overwhelming,\" he told BT Sport.The greatest comeback?Read MoreFor Liverpool to qualify for the Champions League final, it would have to eclipse every great European night Anfield had ever seen.Liverpool fans have seen their fair share of improbable European comebacks to know that Tuesday's second leg against Barcelona wasn't entirely a lost cause.There is the 2004 victory over Olympiakos and Steven Gerrard's half volley, the 4-3 win over Borussia Dortmund in 2016 and Dejan Lovren's header.There is something in the air at Anfield that offers hope in even the bleakest of situations.Once the compulsory rendition of \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" had been belted out before kick-off, it would have taken somebody brave to tell those 50,000 Liverpool fans this tie was already over.Lionel Messi was powerless to stop the Liverpool onslaught. READ: Was this the greatest ever comeback?There was emotion and electricity in the air and Barcelona would have been desperate to weather any early storms and prevent the memories of last year's nightmare quarterfinal against Roma to start flooding back.Having earned a 4-1 lead at the Camp Nou, Barcelona traveled to the Italian capital with one foot already in the semifinals. But an early Edin Dzeko goal set the Catalan nerves jangling, before a second-half capitulation completed the most unlikely of comebacks for Roma.As predicted, and as was required, Liverpool began at a blistering pace as their makeshift front three of Sadio Mane, Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri hassled Barcelona's backline with the support of Jordan Henderson from midfield.It became immediately obvious that Jurgen Klopp's favored high press might yield success, as first Clement Lenglet and then Sergi Roberto gave the ball away under pressure.That Liverpool played well at the Camp Nou a week ago, despite the first-leg result, will have no doubt given the team and fans a glimmer of hope. Three gilt-edged opportunities squandered by Liverpool and another Lionel Messi masterclass perhaps gave the scoreline more gloss than Barcelona deserved. READ: Mo Salah ruled out of Barcelona clash with concussionREAD: Manchester City returns top of Premier League after stunning Kompany strikeNo chance?The men in red started as though they genuinely believed they had a chance and it took just seven minutes for them to force a Barcelona error and light the touch paper at Anfield.Joel Matip's wayward long ball was intercepted by Jordi Alba but the left back's weak header, intended for Lenglet, found only the feet of Mane.Mohamed Salah and Jurgen Klopp take in the adulation of the fans.The Senegal forward exchanged passes with Henderson, who showed impressive poise to dance his way through a crowded penalty area and force a save from Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, but Origi was on hand to tap home the rebound.While it was certainly uncharacteristic of Barcelona's usually composed backline to give away an opening goal, the magician at the other end was causing Liverpool problems at regular intervals.With his first meaningful touch of the ball, Messi went on a powerful run, shrugging off Fabinho and laying a precise pass into Philippe Coutinho.In front of the Kop, the fans who as recently as last season would celebrate his goals, Coutinho struck a weak shot to allow Alisson to palm the ball away.Messi would go on to have three efforts on goal of his own, the first forcing Alisson into a smart save before two wicked, low drives had the Brazilian scrambling across his line.Halftime would have come as a welcome break for both sides, though the omens -- if you believe in them -- were looking good for Liverpool. Or rather, bad for Barcelona.At half time in the second leg against Roma, Ernesto Valverde's side also trailed 1-0. Liverpool couldn't, could they?Unlikely heroAn enforced halftime substitution, Georginio Wijnaldum for the injured Andy Robertson, initially looked as though it would unsettle the home side.Instead, it unexpectedly turned this tie on its head.Barcelona fans could scarcely believe what they were witnessing.Within 10 minutes of the second half starting, in what felt like the blink of an eye, Liverpool found itself level in the tie for the first time since the 26th minute of the first leg.Trent Alexander-Arnold's low cross was deflected into the path of Wijnaldum, whose low shot squirmed through the Ter Stegen's arms and into the net.Now Anfield was rocking and really starting to believe.Then, just two minutes and two seconds later, just 31 seconds after Barcelona had restarted, Liverpool had another.It was Wijnaldum again, this time popping up at the near post and guiding Shaqiri's cross into the top corner with his head.For the first time in the game, the frenetic pace of the match slowed as Liverpool naturally sank back towards its penalty area and Barcelona pressed forward.But with 10 minutes to go, a moment of genius from Alexander-Arnold unlocked the Barcelona defense for a fourth and final time.The 20-year-old walked away from the corner kick as if conceding the set piece to Shaqiri, only to spot Origi unmarked at the near post.Ter Stegen was still trying to organize his defenders by the time Alexander-Arnold's low cross had made contact with Origi's foot.By the time he had realized what was happening, it was too late. The ball was in the back of the net and Liverpool were 4-0 ahead.Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson fought back tears at the final whistle.Even for Liverpool this comeback was beyond comprehension. Mane was interviewed pitchside after the game, but could not find the words to explain what had just happened.Henderson, his captain, came over and fared little better. He puffed his cheeks out, held his hands on his head and had tears in his eyes.And he wasn't alone. As the camera panned across Liverpool's playing squad and backroom staff, all linked by the arms and being serenaded by the Kop, James Milner struggled to fight back the tears.Anfield had seen a lot, but it had never seen anything quite like this.",

The British armed forces banned LGBT service members until 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights ruled that it was unlawful. Ousalice, a former lead radio operator, served in the Falklands War, carried out six tours of Northern Ireland and traveled with the navy to Hong Kong and Egypt. He was awarded a long-service medal and good conduct badges. \"The navy wasn't just my job, it was my life,\" he said in a statement. \"But to do it I had to hide another important part of me, which I did because I loved the navy life so much I didn't want to give it up. But I shouldn't have been asked to choose.\"Read MoreOusalice concealed his sexuality from others in the navy but feared he was under surveillance by its Special Investigation Branch. Supreme Court allows transgender military ban to go into effectEmma Norton, head of legal casework at the human rights organization Liberty, which is representing Ousalice, told CNN: \"At the time, the Ministry of Defence were actively seeking out LGBT people and submitting them to surveillance and hounding them out.\"\"Liberty has been contacted by a lot of LGBT people who would describe things like their (mail) being opened, their friends and family being questioned, being followed around town when on leave, being followed into pubs. They had to live a secret life,\" Norton said. While on shore leave in 1992, Ousalice was charged with and convicted of indecency in a civilian court, a charge he denies. Later, the navy accused him of indecent assault. Although he was subsequently cleared at a court martial hearing, he was convicted of \"conduct prejudicial to good order and naval discipline\" and compelled to state publicly that he was bisexual. Ousalice was dismissed from the navy and his medal and badges were cut from his chest directly after the trial. \"I was made to feel like I was disgusting and in the end I was hounded out on some trumped-up charges, and told that because I was attracted to men, my 18 years of service counted for nothing,\" he said in a statement. \"It was heartbreaking. It took me years to recover.\"Pentagon transgender ban goes into effectCNN has contacted the Ministry of Defence for comment. Norton told CNN that Liberty has informed the ministry of its intention to sue if Ousalice's medal and badges are not returned. His case, she said, is \"a consequence of the decades of discrimination that lots of LGBT people suffered at the hands of the MoD.\" \"So many LGBT people were affected by this policy,\" she added. If the medal and badges are returned, she said, \"it will send a very strong message to LGBT people that their work is valued and what they gave the forces is valued.\"Ousalice said now he just wants his \"medal and badges back, and recognition from the government and the Royal Navy for all the years of service and hard work I gave them.\"\"And I also want other LGBT veterans to know they're not alone, and that we all deserve the same recognition,\" he said.",

What is racketeering? The crime, explainedAsked whether he was referring to \"Gomorrah,\" the Sky Atlantic hit series adapted from Roberto Saviano's blockbuster book on the Camorra mafia, De Magistris said the show's influence was the subject of \"a heartfelt debate in Naples.\"\"It's not only my opinion -- even though I worked 11 years as a prosecutor and eight years as mayor -- but it's also the view of doctors, police officers, and teachers.\"Read More\"Let's talk about the fact that in the evenings after the TV series is aired, episodes of violence increase, and that happens often,\" he went on. \"It means there's a theme of the negative model or symbolism of the evil. If one wants to deny it and say 'long live Saviano' regardless, it makes a resounding mistake.\" The mayor has often clashed with Saviano, who he accused in 2017 of \"building an empire off the backs off Naples and Neapolitans\". It is not clear what statistics de Magistris is referring to. CNN has contacted the mayor's office for comment. His comments came after a 3-year-old girl named Noemi was wounded by a stray bullet along with her grandmother in a shooting in Naples last Friday. The girl is in a serious condition at the local hospital, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. \"A bullet passed through her lungs from right to left, without injuring her heart, sticking in her ribs,\" said the general manager of the Santobono Hospital, Anna Maria Minicucci. Mafia don Frank Cali's killing is a reminder the mob is alive. Just not as flashyIn a long Facebook post after his radio interview, de Magistris doubled down on his criticism of the TV show, while attacking far-right interior minister Matteo Salvini who he says \"made Italy less secure and more violent.\"He appealed to the state to \"help us destroy the ... model -- for some a shamefully winning one -- of the (st) heroes of Gomorrah.\"It \"is likely to corrode the brains, souls, and hearts of hundreds of very young people,\" he added. The Italian mob series, which just finished its fourth season, is set in Naples and is a crude, gritty depiction of life in the Camorra mafia.",

        "content": "(CNN)Manchester City returned to the top of the English Premier League after a scintillating strike from Vincent Kompany secured a vital 1-0 win against Leicester City. With the hosts struggling to find a way past a stubborn defense, the club captain stepped up to send the Etihad Stadium into a frenzy with a stunning shot from distance with just 20 minutes left on the clock. With his side now just one win away being crowned champions, the goal promises to be yet another iconic moment in this incredible title race. Pep Guardiola's team can secure its consecutive title, at the expense of Liverpool, if it wins against Brighton on Sunday.Vincent Kompany celebrates scoring the winning goal against Leicester City.READ: Jadon Sancho ranked as European football's most expensive youngsterRead MoreAn emotional Kompany demonstrated just how important the goal was after a nervy night in Manchester.The Citizens were frustrated for much of the match by an impressive Leicester side which managed to snub out the host's impressive array of attacking talent. However, when the game looked to be heading toward a goalless draw, Kompany sent a missile into the top corner. \"I hadn't scored this season but I always feel in big moments that I'm going to do something, I don't know if it's a header or what,\" Kompany told Sky Sports after the game.\"Today was a little bit of frustration, everyone was saying 'don't shoot, don't shoot' and I could really hear it. I thought hold on a second, I've not come this far in my career for young players to tell me if I can take a shot, and I just had a go!\".Time and time again Kompany has stepped up to inspire Manchester City to victory in big games. He must now be considered as one of Manchester City's greatest ever players. His strike secured Manchester City's 13th consecutive victory in the league and was its 100th goal at home this season. Kompany had tears in his eyes at the full-time whistle. READ: Mo Salah ruled out of Liverpool's Champions League clash against BarcelonaNervy nightHaving had eight days to rest since its last match -- a narrow win over Burnley -- Manchester City started the game at a typical high tempo but it was an intensity matched by its visitors.  Leicester City has been rejuvenated under new manager Brendan Rodgers -- winning five out of nine games since the former Liverpool manager replaced Claude Puel in February -- and looked sharp during the early stages of the match. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, just as the home crowd began to grow restless, Sergio Aguero reminded everyone of his team's infinite attacking talent as he almost gave his side the lead. The Argentine powered his way to the front post to meet a corner with a flicked header that rebounded off the woodwork, before goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel cleared off the line. Goal-line technology, which had awarded the hosts the winning goal in its last game, showed just how fine the margins are in this season's title race. Despite a sustained period of pressure from Manchester City, an entertaining first-half ended goalless giving hope to Liverpool fans across the globe. The second-half started in a similar vein, with the hosts dominating but failing to get the better of a resolute Leicester back line.In search of the breakthrough, Guardiola rolled the dice and sent on Leroy Sane as part of a front four which initiated an all-out assault on the Leicester goal. Aguero once again came agonizingly close before Kompany defied the odds with one of the moments of the season.Sergio Aguero had his effort cleared off the line in the first-half. Down to the wireThe result sets up a mouth-watering prospect for the last day of the season, with Manchester City just one point ahead of Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool. The Reds must win at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers and hope Manchester City drop points away at Brighton.Such has been the form of both teams this season, the side that finishes second will have amassed the most points of any runner-up in Premier League history. \"We are in the last game and it is in our hands. We are going to prepare well,\" Guardiola told BBC Sport after the match.\"We'll see if Brighton defend deep or will be more offensive. It will be tough, but hopefully we will have the performance to be champions.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Carved into the north east coast of Kyushu, Japan's southern island, Fukuoka Prefecture is known for its ornate gardens, a majestic 17th century castle, a newly renovated art museum and some mouth-watering seafood. It will also play host to this year's Rugby World Cup.But a less prominent feature of this emerging tourist destination could add another attraction to this list in years to come: the unassuming Kitakyushu Kartway race track.  It was there that a rising Japanese MotoGP star first took to the circuit.In March, at a thrilling season opener in Qatar, 19-year-old Kaito Toba made history as the first Japanese rider to win a Moto3 race, and the first in the sport's entry-level lightweight class in 12 years. He is the standout talent in an exciting crop of young Japanese racers and tipped for big things. Slight, fresh faced and quietly spoken, Toba patiently recounts his first experiences on two-wheels to CNN Sport.  \"When I was a child my father and mother rode motorbikes, and I liked riding with them,\" he explains.  Read More\"I wasn't aware of racing or MotoGP or anything like that, but my parents bought me a small pushbike, and after that I would go to the park, and I liked that a lot.\"Toba is one of the most exciting crop of young Japanese racers.READ: MotoGP -- The King of COTA is deposedREAD: How to drive a 225kph electric race carPocket bikeLike so many successful riders, Toba's step up to motorized transport began early. \"When I was about three years old I started to like motorbikes,\" he said.\"My family tried to find a real motorcycle, like a pocket bike. When we found one, and the first time I rode it, it was an incredible feeling, I liked it a lot. Then I started wanting to practice a lot, and that was really the start.\"By the age of five, Toba was riding his pocket bike around Kitakyushu's curves.  \"At first it was really just for fun. But by the time I was six, I started to become aware of racing and MotoGP, and I found out we had a race in Japan,\" he recalls. Just a year later, Toba paid his first visit to Motegi and the Japanese MotoGP. He smiles broadly at the memory. \"It was then I thought 'I want to ride here, I want to be a MotoGP racer.'\"Kaito TobaToba's ascent to the MotoGP circus has come via the sport's grass-roots development 'Road to MotoGP' program.  It was through this that he was exposed to the sheer scale of the championship in Europe. \"I saw the tracks, the hospitality, it really was amazing,\" he grins. \"And then I realized, more than ever before, that I wanted to be part of this. In Spain and Italy especially, you see incredible numbers of fans coming to races.\"Toba won the Idemitsu Asia Talent Cup in 2014 and clinched two race wins among four podium finishes in the Red Bull Rookies Cup in 2015 and 2016. As such his maiden Moto3 victory brought considerable satisfaction to Carmelo Ezpeleta, the CEO of MotoGP's administrators, Dorna. \"After many years working behind the scenes and seeing so much promise from the ranks ... it was a great moment to see Kaito winning in Qatar -- becoming the first former IATC Champion to win a race.\" Ezpeleta told CNN Sport.  \"[Qatar] was also a very tight race and he demonstrated some great race-craft under pressure. We were really proud.\"MotoGP is headquartered in Spain, where the sport is followed obsessively, while Italy's Ducati and Aprilia, as well as riders like the legendary Valentino Rossi, ensure the sport is second only to soccer in Italians' hearts.  However, Japan's Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha have dominated the MotoGP grid as well as the championship for many years. Interest in Japanese motorcycles has been on the decline. Sharp decline Given the ubiquity of Japanese motorcycles, it might be safe to assume that bike culture has a strong footing in the country, but as in the United States, motorcycle sales have been in sharp decline of late.\"Even though you have Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha, actually there's maybe a little less interest in motorcycles in general (in Japan),\" Toba says. \"You notice more people riding bikes when you travel internationally than you do in Japan. I don't know why that is, maybe it's people thinking about the danger, and I think also you see motorcyclists being a little crazy in the streets, and that puts people off.\"In this context, Tetsuhiro Kuwata, Honda Racing Corporation's Director, recognizes the importance of a successful Japanese rider. \"We're really happy with Kaito, he's a talented rider and we've trusted him for a long time. We're working hard with the young Japanese and Asian riders, because it's important for us from the sporting point of view, but also the market. We hope that with Toba and guys such as (LCR Honda MotoGP rider) Takaaki Nakagami they will help to grow even more.\" Ezpeleta agrees: \"It's always important to have riders representing Japan and if one of those is a frontrunner, that's even better for the World Championship. This country is truly a point of reference for MotoGP because Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki are a huge presence in the market.\" JUST WATCHEDConquering the sand dunes with e-bikesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHConquering the sand dunes with e-bikes 01:53READ: Iconic Ayrton Senna photo up for auctionREAD: Valtteri Bottas claims Azerbaijan GP as Mercedes continues to dominateDedicated fansWhile bike sales may be in decline, attendances at the Japanese MotoGP have actually increased in recent years.  More than 96,000 came to Motegi for 2018's race weekend, up from 89,000 in 2017, and fans there are renowned for their dedication. \"You can see that the Japanese fans are extremely committed to our sport and they make the pilgrimage to Motegi every year,\" Ezpeleta says. After his Qatar win, Toba did notice an uptick in attention. \"I suddenly got a lot of new Instagram followers, lots of fans sent me messages, and I got a lot of messages from Japanese people,\" he grins. \"When I saw this I thought, 'okay, Japanese people are looking,' I was a little surprised at that.\" He also got recognition from other riders, including current world champion Marc Marquez, and Toba's childhood idol, Casey Stoner.  \"Marquez came up to me and talked to me, congratulated me. My hero was Casey Stoner, and he sent me an SMS congratulating me. I was really happy.\"JUST WATCHEDMotorbike veteran Capirossi goes electricReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMotorbike veteran Capirossi goes electric 01:03For Toba the next step is to cement his place in Moto3, then make the step up to the top class. \"My target is to win the world championship.

That is my target.\" He also hopes any success will reignite Japanese passion for bikes. \"My hope is that I can make MotoGP a little bit more famous in Japan, because now, not so many people are following it. I hope I can make it a little bit more famous, especially because so many MotoGP factories are Japanese companies.\"",

Their Royal Highnesses' son weighs 7lbs. 3oz. The Duchess and baby are  both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives.  More details will be shared in the forthcoming days. A post shared by  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex (@sussexroyal) on May 6, 2019 at 6:37am PDT\nWhen it comes to the name of their son, the world will have to wait.

For us, we'll be seeing you guys [in] probably two days' time as planned,\" he added. Read MoreThe Duchess's mother, Doria Ragland, was with Meghan on Monday at her home, Frogmore Cottage, in Windsor, and was \"overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild,\" the palace said.      The boy will be the eighth great-grandchild for Queen Elizabeth II and the seventh in line to the throne behind Prince Charles, Prince William and his three children and Prince Harry. Hours after the Palace's statement, a ceremonial easel holding a framed notice of birth was placed in the forecourt of London's Buckingham Palace. \"The Queen and the Royal Family are delighted at the news that Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex was safely delivered of a son,\" the notice read. The display of the ceremonial easel, and framed notice of birth, is a royal tradition.The couple, who also announced the birth of their son with a post on their official Instagram page, added a second post thanking the public for its \"support and kindness.\"Among Monday's well-wishers were Prime Minister Theresa May, opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Meghan's \"Suits\" co-stars, and Charles Spencer, who is the brother of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana. Thomas Markle, Meghan's father, expressed his delight over the birth of his grandson to British tabloid newspaper The Sun.\"I am proud that my new grandson is born into the British royal family and I am sure that he will grow up to serve the crown and the people of Britain with grace, dignity, and honor,\" said Markle, who is reported to have developed a contentious relationship with his daughter since her marriage. Harry and Meghan announced they were expecting a baby in October -- the news came as they touched down in Australia for their first overseas tour as a married couple.Harry and Meghan's new baby: What we know so farBut the couple ultimately preferred to keep details of the pregnancy under wraps, in line with their repeated requests for privacy since they began dating years ago.Meghan declined to follow in the footsteps of her sister-in-law, Duchess Catherine of Cambridge, who stepped into the intense glare of the media spotlight, newborns in arm, hours after giving birth at a hospital in central London.Meghan and Harry's new baby will make history by becoming the first biracial British child in the royal family, a significant milestone both across the Commonwealth and within British society.But trailblazing is nothing new for the royal couple. The new, modern approach brought to the family by the pair was underlined by their groundbreaking wedding ceremony last May.Almost every piece of that star-studded ceremony at Windsor Castle -- broadcast to hundreds of millions around the world -- seemed to make a statement.In a striking image, the outspoken American divorc\u00e9e walked unescorted, followed by her 10 bridesmaids and page boys.Opinion: This royal baby is nothing less than a revolutionHands clasped, the couple then listened to a stirring, soulful address by Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American head of the Episcopal Church in the United States.His impassioned speech was then followed by a performance of the Ben E. King classic \"Stand by Me\" by The Kingdom Choir, a group of 20 gospel singers.The birth of Meghan and Harry's baby is certain to again capture the imagination of British society, marking the start of a new era for one the world's most famous and most loved couples.This story has been corrected to reflect that the new baby is the Queen's eighth great-grandchild.",

        "content": "(CNN)At the tender age of just 19, Joao Felix is already breaking records, not to mention attracting admiring glances from Europe's biggest clubs and comparisons to some of Portugal's greatest players. The Benfica forward became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Europa League when the Portuguese league leaders defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 4-2 in the first leg of their quarterfinal tie in Lisbon (although they would subsequently lose the tie on aggregate).On Monday, he grabbed a brace against Maritimo in the Primeira Liga, while a long list of suitors -- which is reported to include Juventus, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Manchester United -- are said to be tracking his performances, with Benfica reportedly having inserted a $135 million release clause in the teenager's contract.Not bad for a player that only made his competitive first team debut last August. Joao Felix celebrates after scoring against  Eintracht Frankfurt.For those who have worked with Felix from an early age, however, his rapid progress comes as no great surprise.Read More\"He's a very talented player, very technical player,\" Joao Tralhao, who coached Felix in the Benfica youth ranks before moving to become assistant to Thierry Henry during the Frenchman's spell as manager at Monaco, told CNN Sport. \"(Felix's) decision making qualities are absolutely amazing, outstanding. Elite level for sure,\" Tralhao adds.Jorge Mendes: The man behind soccer's 'craziest deals'Tralhao says Felix was long a standout during training games with Benfica's senior squad when he was still a youth team player, marking out his clear potential. But talent does not always equal progress and the fact that he is \"very humble, likes to work, likes to listen ... (and) has a competitive mentality\" has aided his progress, Tralhao adds.READ: The rise of Son Heung-MinREAD: The stats that 'prove' Lionel Messi is the world's bestDifferent from RonaldoTall but graceful, Felix is strong in the air and skilful with the ball at his feet.His exquisite balance, vision and languid running style have earned comparisons to former Brazil international, Kaka, as well as Benfica stalwarts such as Rui Costa.Thirteen goals in 22 league appearances this season, meanwhile, puts Felix among the top scorers in the Portuguese top flight -- an impressive return for a player so young, not to mention one that does not always play as an out-and-out striker.He appeared emotional after scoring his third goal against Frankfurt, further endearing him to Benfica fans who quickly took to the teen after he scored against arch-rivals Sporting in one of his first games. And Felix brought yet more smiles when he scored against Maritimo, hugging his younger brother who was positioned behind the goal and working as a ball-boy.Joao Felix reacts after scoring against Eintracht Frankfurt.Being Portuguese Felix has, perhaps inevitably, been labeled by some as the next Cristiano Ronaldo.The teenager has spoken of his admiration for Ronaldo in the past, telling Spain's Marca he was an \"exemplary footballer\" and the \"best in the world.\"For Nuno Gomes, a former Benfica player and 79-cap international for Portugal, however, such comparisons are not entirely fair. \"They are different,\" Gomes says of the two players. Ronaldo is the best in the world, aged 34. Felix is still only 19.\" Cristiano Ronaldo (R)  Joao Felix train for the Portugal national team.Gomes became the general manager of Benfica's youth department shortly after Felix was signed from rivals Porto's youth ranks. He has watched his development closely and offered him a first professional contract at the age of 16.Reports suggest that Porto were unsure about Felix when he was there given his slender frame. But Gomes says Benfica were quickly convinced by his potential once he began to work with the club's coaches. \"It was clear for everybody that we were in front of a young special talent,\" he says.\"His relationship with the ball, his first touch, his intelligence\" marked him out as a completely \"different kind of player.\"Joao Felix is pictured playing for Benfica.'He is already a star'Porto's loss is certainly Benfica's gain. They not only have an outstanding talent, potentially helping them towards the latter stages of the Europa League, but an asset Europe's richest clubs look set to battle it out for the right to buy.Benfica has traditionally produced some of the most exciting, young Portuguese players. It has also developed a reputation for signing and developing talented individuals from outside Portugal before selling them on to clubs in Europe's biggest leagues at a profit.Recent big money sales include Ederson, David Luiz, Nemanja Matic, Victor Lindelof and Angel Di Maria. Bernardo Silva, Renato Sanches and Joao Cancelo also came through the ranks at Benfica.That model suggests Felix will also be sold in future too.Joao Felix (R) celebrates with his Benfica teammates.Both Gomes and Tralhao see Felix signing for one Europe's biggest clubs for a considerable sum of money one day. Gomes played in Serie A for Fiorentina, as well as Blackburn Rovers in England's Premier League, and says it will be important that Felix keeps his feet on the ground in the months and years ahead.He adds that Felix -- who he describes as \"reserved\" and an often quite \"shy\" individual, but one who can also be extremely \"funny\" -- has the intelligence, character and support of a strong family not to get carried away.\"Even if he is a star already, he is a young boy that has humility, he's a nice guy, he's a nice person,\" Gomes says.Tralhao concurs and says that although football will \"create obstacles,\" his former youth player has the intelligence to navigate them.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos In the meantime, Benfica will hope to reap the benefit of  Felix's cleverness and ability on the park.While the Europa League may now be out of the question after being eliminated by Frankfurt, the battle with Porto for the Primeira Liga title remains very much on.",

He has never committed a violent act, he's an innocent person,\" Anderson said in a statement outside the jail afterwards.She said the WikiLeaks founder has been \"cut off from everybody,\" including his children, and does not have access to any information.\"He's a good man, he's an incredible person, I love him and I can't imagine what he's been going through,\" Anderson said, who visited Assange several times during his near seven-year stint inside the embassy, creating speculation about their relationship.US actress Pamela Anderson leaves Belmarsh Prison in southeast London, after visiting WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.On Tuesday, Anderson was accompanied by WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who said the pair were \"quite emotional\" following the visit. The 47-year-old has been forced to spend 23 hours a day in his cell, he added.Read MoreJulian Assange's legal battles have only just begun\"It is for me shocking to see my friend, an intellectual, a publisher, a journalist. A man who has transformed the world of journalism with his work sitting in a high-security prison,\" Hrafnsson said.\"Someone said that you could judge the civilization of a society by visiting its prisons and frankly I have to say from my heart that this visit did not reflect well on this society here.\"Assange's stay in the embassy was brought to a dramatic close on April 11 when Ecuador withdrew his asylum and invited in British police, citing his bad behavior. He was then forcibly removed by officers.The Australian was handed a jail term of almost a year on May 1 for skipping bail in 2012 when he sought political asylum in the embassy. Assange was arrested on April 11 after Ecaduor withdrew his asylum and invited British police into its embassy.Assange was wanted in Sweden for questioning over sexual assault and rape allegations, The whistleblower has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and said he sought refuge in the embassy over fears of being extradited on from Sweden to the US due to his work with WikiLeaks.He is battling against extradition to the United States on a computer hacking conspiracy charge, in which proceedings have been adjourned until May 30. Belmarsh prison in Thamesmead, southeast London, where Assange is being held, is known to have housed some of Britain's most notorious terror suspects including Abu Hamza al-Masri and Anjem Choudary. It has the capacity to hold more than 900 inmates.Hrafnsson said Assange was \"bent but not broken\" following the arrest and that \"his spirit is strong.\"\"He is an extremely resilient person and I want you to think about the fact that such resilience usually comes from the fact that he knows that he is innocent,\" he said.WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being held in London's high-security Belmarsh prison.Assange's lawyers previously told CNN that, in the two weeks since his arrival at the jail, they were only permitted to meet their client in person once. A spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Justice -- the government body responsible for the justice system -- said it does not comment on individual cases. The spokesperson added that prisoners at Belmarsh are usually able to start receiving visitors \"within a matter of days.\"",

Flea medication for people and other new tools to combat malariaYvan Assioma, the union's Paris regional secretary, told CNN the fleas had probably been brought in by people taken into the station for custody or questioning,  Assioma added that the police station was disinfected a week ago but that was \"close to useless.\"\"What is needed in order to control a flea invasion is to disinfect the whole building and even the cars of the people who work there. The higher authorities are putting band-aids on a wooden leg.\"The union is demanding a total disinfection of the station, which could take at least 48 hours.Assioma said authorities were hesitant about closing the station, \"but the truth is that it isn't such a big problem.\" \"Colleagues can take their service elsewhere for a day or two, in neighboring stations for example, and detectives can work perfectly fine anywhere thanks to the internet,\" he said. In 2017, the same station had to be evacuated because of an invasion of lice and fleas, Le Parisien reports. CNN has contacted the French Interior Ministry for comment.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A woman who wanted to break the Guinness World Record for running a marathon dressed as a nurse has been told her successful attempt does not count -- because she was wearing scrubs and pants, rather than a skirt.Jessica Anderson, a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, ran the city's marathon last Sunday in the outfit she wears at work.But she was told beforehand by Guinness World Records that she would need to wear a blue and white dress, apron and a traditional nurse's cap for her effort to be valid, Britain's Press Association reported.Full-body scrubs are too close to the organization's definition of a doctor's costume, officials added.London Marathon investigates reports runners were called 'fat' and 'slow'\"Their definition is just so outdated,\" Anderson told the magazine Runner's World. \"Some of the nurses I work with do wear dresses but mostly we wear scrubs or a tunic and trousers. I've certainly never seen a male nurse wearing a dress to work.\"Read More\"I'm sure Guinness World Records don't intend to cause offence but it would be nice if they decided to revise their criteria instead of reinforcing old gender stereotypes,\" she added.Anderson had asked the organization to reconsider, but her request was denied. They have since said they would review their rules.\"Inclusiveness and respect are values that Guinness World Records holds extremely dear, and while we always need to ensure we can differentiate between categories, it is quite clear that this record title is long overdue a review, which we will conduct as a priority in the coming days,\" the body said in a statement. CNN has contacted Anderson for comment.Anderson would have claimed the record had her costume been accepted; her time was 3 hours, 8 minutes and 22 seconds, beating the previous record by 32 seconds.British Red Cross nurses in more \"traditional\" outfits, during World War II.The run is one of the world's most famous events and receives hundreds of thousands of applicants each year. More than 400,000 applied to join this year's marathon, setting a new record, organizers said.But last Sunday's race was not free from controversy, with organizers investigating claims that runners towards the end of the pack were called \"fat,\" \"slow\" and told to hurry up by contractors. Anderson, who was worked at the London hospital for seven years, set a fundraising target of \u00a3500 ($660) for her race but smashed the target, with many contributors donating money after the race, having heard about the decision. By Sunday morning, her fundraising page showed contributors had pledged \u00a32,400.\"We have previously used the charity fund to buy equipment for the ward such as dementia friendly clocks and signage, a bladder scanner and some furnishings for the staff room and day rooms,\" she wrote on her page.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge will once again attempt to become the first athlete to break the two-hour marathon barrier in an event being staged in London later this year.Dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge, this race against the clock -- to be staged in late September or early October -- is being backed by Britain's richest man Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire owner of chemical firm INEOS, which recently purchased British Cycling's Team Sky.\"It's human nature to push boundaries,\" said the INEOS 1:59 Challenge website. \"The drive to learn and achieve more is in our DNA. In Autumn this year Eliud Kipchoge, with support from INEOS, plans to redefine the limits of human achievement by breaking the last great barrier of modern athletics -- the two-hour marathon.\"Last week Ratcliffe and INEOS were accused by environmental protesters of \"sportswashing\" -- using sport to enhance reputation -- an accusation the Briton completely rejects.Speaking to reporters ahead of cycling's Tour de Yorkshire, Ratcliffe took aim at those who criticized his company's fracking project, claiming the majority of environmental groups he has met are \"ignorant\" of the process, adding it remains a cheap source of energy.Eliud Kipchoge is expected to take part in the event in September or October 2019.Read More'In-out pacemakers'Current world record holder Kipchoge recorded a time of 2:00.25 during a similar event at Monza -- home of the Formula One Italian Grand Prix -- in 2017 wasn't recognized as a world record as it did not adhere to the rules laid out by athletics' governing body, the IAAF, notably in the way he was helped by \"in-out\" pacemakers. The London attempt will also not be ratified.The 34-year-old Kenyan set a new record time for the London marathon earlier this month as he claimed a fourth triumph in  the event -- a record for a male athlete.His time of two hours, two minutes and 37 seconds was the second fastest marathon of all time -- just behind his own world record of two hours, one minute and 39 seconds which was recorded in Berlin in September 2018.JUST WATCHEDJustin Gallegos Nike Breaking2ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJustin Gallegos Nike Breaking2 00:46\"This would really surpass everything because this will go in the history as far as the human family is concerned,\" Kipchoge told reporters ahead of Monday's event launch, which took place 65 years to the day since Britain's Roger Bannister became the first man to break the four minute mile.According to reports, Kipchoge's attempt in London will use a number of pacemakers who run laps, while dipping in and out of the action, in order to maintain the astonishing pace of two minutes, 50 seconds per kilometer needed to go under two hours.\"It is not about recognition or ratification but to make history and to pass on a message that no human is limited. Running the fastest-ever marathon of 2:00.25 was the proudest moment of my career,\" added KipchogeBritain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, is flanked by men's race winner Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge (L) and women's race winner, Kenya's Brigid Kosgei (R) at the medal ceremony at the 2019 London Marathon.READ: Kipchoge wins a record fourth London MarathonREAD: The race for a sub-two-hour marathon'Worthy sporting endeavors'Ratcliffe's move into cycling has been fiercely criticized by environmental groups who disapprove of INEOS' practice of fracking -- a controversial method of extracting gas, and led to protests at last week's Tour de Yorkshire cycling event. Ratcliffe also had to defend INEOS over its use of plastics after its acquisition of Team Sky, which had been leading a campaign against single-use plastics and Ocean Rescue campaign.\"We've spent 30 years working on the INEOS project and made it very large and very profitable,\" Ratcliffe said.\"We make $5-7 billion a year in profit so there's no harm in investing a modest amount of that into very worthy sporting endeavors which we enjoy.\"If they inspire people towards a healthier lifestyle, that's a good thing but there's also nothing wrong in investing money in something simply enjoyable. I like the theatre, I like opera. But I prefer sport.\"Ratcliffe, a keen cyclist and a well known running enthusiast, also sponsors children's running charities, GO Run For Fun and The Daily Mile, with the aim of getting more young people into the sport.INEOS Group chairman Sir Jim Ratcliffe is backing the event.\"If Eliud has got a fantastic crowd cheering him on, its going to make a bit of difference and we don't need to make a lot of difference to make up 26 seconds,\" he told reporters. \"I was in the pace car in front of Eliud for the London Marathon and he was looking very serene and comfortable. He's still getting better.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"Eliud is the finest marathon runner there has ever been and I think it will be very inspirational, to get kids putting running shoes on. \"It would be an extraordinary achievement. It's almost super-human, isn't it really? To break two hours in a marathon is quite unthinkable.\"",

Col. Guglielmo Trombetta of Italy's paramilitary police, the Carabinieri.Pang arrived in Italy in mid-February and rented a bed and breakfast in the village of Capodimonte, the officer said.\"He was gentle with everyone and always greeted everyone,\" Trombetta said, adding that the young man doesn't speak Italian and used his mobile phone translator to communicate. But he was arrested over the killing of Fedeli, who was struck with an iron stool and had his face trampled with a shoe, in a crime committed in daylight that has stunned the normally quiet town. Read MorePang is pictured on surveillence footage after the killing.Investigators say Pang had already purchased clothes for 600 euros (about $673)  in the shop, mainly sweatshirts and brand-name jeans, on April 30 and May 2, using credit cards.But the payments were blocked so \"probably ... when the boy returned and the shopkeeper refused to sell him the merchandise, they started fighting,\" Trombetta said.Pang was born in South Korea on March 22, 1997, authorities said. He was identified in security camera footage after the killing, according to Trombetta.CCTV footage appears to show Pang walking in the street out of the shop with a plastic bag covering his left foot. Investigators say they found the wallet of the victim and many new garments from the victim's shop in Pang's room.Trombetta added that Pang, now in prison in Viterbo, declined to answer magistrates' questions. His court-appointed lawyers did not respond to CNN's request for comment on Sunday.Paolo Auriemma, a prosecutor in Viterbo, told journalists that Pang had no criminal records during his two and a half months in Italy.",

        "content": "(CNN)With a rip-roaring English Premier League title race entering its final week, Liverpool returned to the top of the table with a thrilling victory over Newcastle which ensures the EPL title will be decided on the final day. In an entertaining encounter at a raucous St James' Park, a late goal from Divock Origi secured a crucial 3-2 win for the visitors which leaves Manchester City needing to beat Leicester City on Monday to overtake Liverpool at the top of the table once again. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAs one of the closest EPL title races in years comes to a conclusion, just two points separate Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola's men with the Reds, on 94 points, having played one more game than the defending champions. Liverpool had endured a torrid time in Barcelona on Wednesday, losing 3-0 in the first leg of the Champions League semifinal despite at times dominating, but Klopp's men could not reflect on what could have been at the Camp Nou as victory against Newcastle was imperative to maintain the pressure on defending champions City. The visitors were far from their best, twice allowing the lead to slip, and worryingly leading scorer Mo Salah was stretchered off with what looked like a head injury after clashing with Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Klopp later said that the striker needed to be assessed but revealed he did watch the end of the match in the dressing room. Read MoreREAD: Salah 'OK' after collision Salah left the pitch injured in the second half.\"What can I say?\" said Klopp on Sky Sports. \"With the way Newcastle played, it was just difficult to deal with. \"What the boys put in was unbelievable. It's heartbreaking, really. Mo goes down, we had to change and the decisive goal is [Xherdan] Shaqiri and Origi. It was a tough game against a powerful and physically stronger team than us. We had to fight and I couldn't be more proud.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhile the visitors were unfortunate to lose Salah, the league's leading scorer with 22 goals, they were also fortunate to have 11 men on the field with Trent Alexander-Arnold handling the ball on the line as Newcastle equalized at 1-1 in the first half. The Reds had started brilliantly, taking the lead in the 13th minute as the unmarked Virgil van Dijk headed home from a corner for his fourth league goal of the season. Such was Liverpool's dominance at this early stage, a routine win seemed on the cards. But slapdash defending allowed Newcastle, managed by former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, back into the game and raised the decibels inside the stadium. Christian Atsu scored from close range, slotting in from the rebound after a Salomon Rondon effort was cleared off the line by Alexander-Arnold, who used his arm to keep the Venezuelan's strike out of the net. Had Atsu not scored, it would likely have led to a penalty for the hosts and an Alexander-Arnold sending off.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosNewcastle striker Rondon was impressive throughout the match.  Lifted by the roars of the crowd, and by Liverpool's errors, Newcastle went close with Ayoze Perez's rasping strike hitting the crossbar, before the visitors breached the defense once more.As has often been the case for Liverpool over the last two seasons, it was Salah who hit the back of the net, delicately sweeping the ball in from six yards after a delightful cross from Alexander-Arnold. The striker's goal was his 26th of the season and extended his lead in the race to finish as the league's top scorer. But Newcastle also had an impressive striker on the pitch and it was the Magpies' No9 Rondon who leveled the match, lasering in a brilliant strike after Liverpool had failed to deal with a corner. In an attacking move, Klopp brought on Shaqiri, making only his third substitute appearance since February, for Georginio Wijnaldum. He later brought on James Milner and Origi as the need for a third goal became more urgent. As the game neared its conclusion, the visitors became more nervy and looked to be heading to a disastrous draw -- until the Reds were awarded a dubious free-kick, which Shaqiri curled into the box for Origi to head home from close range in the 86th minute.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Dwyane Wade was a 12-year-old shooting jumpers on the playgrounds of Chicago, a movie came out that would help navigate him through his future Hall of Fame career.Released in 1994, \"Hoop Dreams\" shadowed the bumpy fortunes of Arthur Agee and William Gates, two inner-city Chicago youths dreaming of NBA stardom.Wade's path to the Final Four with Marquette and championships with the Miami Heat would be lined with the same challenges faced by Agee and Gates, including the pressures of injury and young parenting, and the avoidance of drugs and gun violence. Twenty-five years since its premier, \"Hoop Dreams\" still impacts Wade. \"I watched it many times, and it resonated with me because we all have hoop dreams,\" the recently retired three-time NBA champion tells CNN.  \"Growing up in Chicago you struggle,\" he adds, \"I look at \"Hoop Dreams\" and I can see myself in those individuals at the time.\"Read MoreFilm critics like the late Roger Ebert lauded the three-hour documentary for exposing a side of America rarely depicted at the time: A class system stacked against the poor, coinciding with rising corruption in youth basketball.Filmmakers Steve James (left), Peter Gilbert (center) and Fred Marx worked on a very thin budget until three years into \"Hoop Dreams,\" when they were able to secure enough funding for the project. So what has changed since then? College basketball is coming off a thrilling season, but faces intense scrutiny as a second corruption trial involving shady figures and illicit payments around the sport unravels in court. Meanwhile, Agee and Gates remain close -- bonded not just by their fame from \"Hoop Dreams,\" but two devastating murders in their families. \"You can't script this stuff,\" says Gates, 47, a youth basketball coach in San Antonio, Texas, to CNN. \"Our stories continue to (overlap) like that, because he lost Bo and we lost Curtis.\"Gates' brother Curtis, a former high school star who flamed out, and Agee's father Bo were both featured on screen. Curtis was shot in 2001, reportedly in a dispute over a woman, while Bo - whose redemption from crack addiction and jail time  was a seminal part of the film - was killed in a robbery three years later. \"It was very heartbreaking,\" adds Agee, who still lives in the West Side of Chicago, not far from where he grew up. \"It's so eerie that me and William always say \"Hoop Dreams\" was a gift and a curse, and we both lost people that played a big part of our lives.\"And then for both of us not to make the NBA, you know, that eeriness, that gift and a curse is there.\"Though neither athlete played in the NBA, both received college scholarships -- no small feat coming from the dire housing projects they grew up in.Agee, 46, who attended Arkansas State, went on to play professionally in the now-defunct USBL and had a stint with the Harlem Globetrotters. He then turned to acting, with small parts in a film and commercials.Agee remains tied to \"Hoop Dreams,\" which provides his motivational speaking platform in schools, and still inspires viewers to send warm messages from places as far off as Australia and China. He also sells apparel inspired by the film, including a throwback jersey from his school days.Gates was the more heralded of the two, receiving interest from top college basketball programs and a grant to attend the prestigious St. Joseph's high school -- the same school that is shown releasing Agee, seemingly for not playing well enough as a freshman.    But Gates blew out his knee at 16, then rushed back to the court after surgery and reinjured it. Though he played at Marquette University, the injury crippled his pro potential. \"For me, it's bittersweet on many levels,\" says Gates about the film which he has not watched in over 16 years. \"It was a constant reminder of what could have been and what didn't happen, and also a reminder that Curtis is no longer here to hear his voice.\"Nevertheless, he looks back on \"Hoop Dreams\" as a \"life turning situation,\" one that led to an allegiance with Michael Jordan, who invited him to pickup games before his comeback with the Washington Wizards. (An injury derailed Gates' own tryout with the Wizards, however.)\"It has opened doors,\" he says. \"It has done things that I never thought would happen in my life.\"Dwyane Wade is pictured dunking the ball.READ: Dwyane Wade takes last steps on 'One Last Dance' finale 'The first reality show'What began as a short film idea from director Steve James and producer Frederick Marx to shoot Chicago playground basketball in 1987 with a budget of $2,000 quickly took on greater ambitions.The pair hired Peter Gilbert as a cinematographer (later added as a producer), and the trio followed Gates and Agee on and off for nearly five years. With 250 hours of footage to edit, the production took seven years in total, eventually raising the $750,000 necessary for completion. When it was finally released in 1994, \"Hoop Dreams\" went viral, though the term had not yet been coined. It was nominated for best film editing at the Oscars, but snubbed for best documentary and picture, which had critics like Ebert up in arms.\"I've actually gotten way more mileage personally as a filmmaker out of not being nominated than I ever would have by getting nominated,\" says James, who stays in contact with Agee and Gates. \"Over the years a lot more people seem to be upset on our behalf than I was personally.\"By the time it ended its theatrical run, \"Hoop Dreams\" became the then-highest grossing documentary of all time, paving the way for hundreds of sports documentaries and streaming series currently on air.\"I call it the first reality show,\" says Gates. \"I think it was groundbreaking.\"Gates' enrollment in Marquette was mirrored exactly 10 years later by Wade, who also struggled to qualify academically for an NCAA scholarship and sat out his first year for academic reasons, the university confirmed. Wade shared other similarities with both Agee and Gates, including feeling the pressure to rush back to action after knee injury which required surgery at Marquette. Though the operation was successful, Wade later said it led to complications as a pro.\"I watched it when I was at Marquette from a different (angle), knowing that (Gates) was staying in the same dorm that I was standing in,\" says Wade, who -- also like Gates -- was caring for a child (son Zaire) while in college.Wade was separated from his mother Jolinda at a young age when she succumbed to drugs, leading to spells in jail. Like Agee's father Bo, she turned to religion after getting clean, now serving as a church minister.\"Obviously, I was able to make it,\" but there are challenges, he adds. \"What I learned at the time is you learn a lot about other people sharing their story.\"William Gates was a 17-year-old high school junior when his daughter Alicia was born. READ: NBA stars open up on paying college players'Controlled corruption'Rewatching \"Hoop Dreams\" 25 years later lends perspective to how fast top college recruits are forced to grow up, and how much is at stake early on.Gates' daughter was born when he was 17, during his junior year of high school. Trying to be a father and student while rehabilitating from two knee surgeries to make it as the next Isiah Thomas -- the former St Joe's and NBA star who makes a cameo in the movie -- became too much to bear.  By the movie's final scene, with his passion for the game already waning, Gates remarks, \"When somebody says, 'When you get to the NBA, don't forget about me,' I should say to them, 'Well if I don't make it, you don't forget about me.\"It's no wonder he needed a break from the sport by his third year at Marquette. \"I didn't feel like a 19 or 20 year-old-kid, I felt like a kid who had been working 10 to 12 years at a job,\" Gates says, estimating that basketball practice and travel would take up to 60 hours a week in college. \"I had a lot on my plate.\"Agee had his own growing up to do, with his academics thrown into disarray after his brief spell at St Joe's, followed by Bo walking out and his mother Sheila losing her job.In one scene, Sheila cannot pay her electricity bill and the family is left without power, while a clearly humiliated Agee broods at the camera.(The filmmakers pitched in to get the power back on, leaving that detail out of the film. \"We didn't want to look self-serving, but we felt an obligation to do that much for them,\" says James.)        Agee transferred to Marshall High, leading the team on an improbable city championship and state semifinal run. In recent years the public high school has been rocked by gun violence, leaving seven former basketball players dead and two paralyzed, including Agee's ex-teammate Shawn Harrington.   \"I didn't let St. Joe's defeat me; I didn't let my neighborhood and my environment pull me in to gain drugs, carrying the guns -- that whole lifestyle,\" Agee reflects.It helped that the teenagers had the right people on their sides. Gates and Agee admit they were given cash during their basketball ascent by the likes of so-called street agents, drug dealers and university affiliates who often helped promising players. In \"Hoop Dreams\" Agee pays for Air Jordan gear at a store with money received from drug pushers. While at Arkansas State, he says a \"big street pharmacist\" whose team he played for in a high school summer league bought him a car.  \"That was part of the deal,\" says Gates of being offered gifts from universities as a highly touted recruit, before committing to Marquette.  \"It was like, 'Hey, you need anything let us know.' And you let them know and they took care of stuff.\"Hey I need transportation, hey I need clothes, I need shoes. They figured out how to get it to you,\" he says. \"They did it through a friend of the program that you didn't even know was a friend of the program. That's the way it was.\"In response, Marquette said it \"is committed to the highest ethical standards for the recruitment and retention of our student-athletes,\" while Arkansas State said it had no knowledge of Agee's car purchase and that \"there are too many unknown variables to comment further about a relationship from approximately 25 years ago.\"Arthur Agee was recruited to play at St Joseph's prep school as an eighth grader. A year later he was asked to leave, and his parents were billed for tuition they struggled to pay for. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSomewhat fittingly, Gates is now a full-time coach in the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), the collection of summer leagues that insiders say has replaced high school basketball as the launching pad for college prospects.    Among the players that have passed through Team Hoop Dreams are all three of Gates' sons, William Jr., a recent graduate of Houston Baptist University, Jalon, a junior guard at Houston Baptist, and Marques, currently in high school.AAU has come under fire by an ongoing FBI investigation involving sneaker companies funneling money towards recruits to land at big university programs. The AAU told CNN it does not fund its teams, calling the situation an \"apparel company scandal, not an AAU scandal.\"\"People are buying and selling players; it's a human trafficking market.\" says Michael Sokolove, author of \"The Last Temptation of Rick Pitino,\" which sheds light on college basketball corruption.Multiple federal investigations  have led to guilty pleas from four college assistants on bribery charges, the conviction of an Adidas executive, and the firing of Pitino from Louisville. Pitino maintains he had \"no knowledge\" of infractions during his tenure as Louisville's head coach. James Gatto, Adidas' former head of global sports marketing, is appealing his nine-month prison sentence for wire fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with a $100,000 offer to the father of a Louisville recruit.    With athletic wear companies paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to support top AAU programs, the potential to use them as a means to distribute money to the families of top players or an influential coach is high, says Sokolove. \"Some of this is laundered money. These teams can be used as pass through,\" he says, adding that the ultimate goal is to breed loyalty with players who become walking advertisements for the shoe companies on the court.The stakes have become much higher to land top recruits like Gates was in the days of \"Hoop Dreams,\" notes Sokolove. \"There are more people with their hands in the cookie jar and the kids are largely pawns in this whole endeavor.\"In 2017 the NCAA surpassed $1 billion in revenue, mostly through TV rights, while top players like Zion Williamson of Duke are limited to a compensation of tuition, room and board with a modest stipend.Like many around the sport, Gates thinks college players need to get paid. He suggests universities contribute $100,000 towards a \"graduation fund\" for the player if he stays in school four years \"to get prepared to live life.\"Gates sees the current NBA age requirement of 19 as an obstacle towards paying black athletes, calling it a \"controlled corruption\" not seen in mostly white sports like baseball, tennis, golf or soccer.\"The two sports that are heavily dominated by African-Americans, it seems like there is always an issue when it comes to money,\" he says. (The NFL enforces a three-year rule before most college football players can turn pro.)NCAA president Mark Emmert told the Associated Press this month that the organization has \"serious issues which require serious change,\" but paying players will remain unlikely.    William Gates (center) is now an AAU coach in Texas. His sons William Jr. (left) and Jalon played together at Houston Baptist University. 'Part of a bigger story'Coinciding with the movie's anniversary, Gates and his wife Catherine just celebrated their 25th year of marriage. The eldest of their four children Alicia, who was born during filming, is 30 and works as a dental hygienist.For years Gates would not allow his sons to watch all of \"Hoop Dreams,\" fearing the scenes of his injuries would spook them. He finally relented, though Will Jr underwent four knee procedures of his own in college.  Agee has fathered five children, with his youngest Devin a budding youth basketball player in his own right. Devin's mother Jennifer Genovesi stood by Agee in the wake of a 2017 arrest after a woman accused him of battery.Agee was quick to call James -- who he refers to as an uncle -- to assure him of his innocence.  The charges were dropped shortly afterward.   \"I'm part of a bigger story in this film. I never want to bring any despair or negativity into the story,\" Agee says. \"He was like, 'We'll get through it together,' and that was good as that.\"\"I feel like they know that I'm here for them,\" says James, the film's director. The special bond between the parties involved in the film was reflected once \"Hoop Dreams,\" which was never expected to be a commercial success, caught fire. In a highly unusual step, Agee and Gates were made equal partners by the producers.\"They weren't just filmmakers,\" says Agee. \"They came in over a period of time and got to know me and my family, and then stayed in touch.\"Arthur Agee bought his mother Sheila a house with royalties earned from \"Hoop Dreams.\" He now uses the film as material for his job in motivational speaking.  Gates and Agee first received nearly $200,000 each, and Agee promptly brought his parents a four-bedroom house in a suburb. His mother, Sheila Agee, who was seen at the end of the movie graduating tops in her nursing class, relocated to Alabama in the wake of Bo's death.After Curtis' murder, Gates was given an unlikely last shot at the NBA at age 29 with a tryout with the Chicago Bulls. But bad luck struck again when he caught the flu on the day of the workout.\"I said maybe God doesn't want me to play basketball,\" he reflects. \"That's when my ministry life began to open up.\"Gates received his master's in biblical studies and worked as a pastor at the Cabrini Green housing project he grew up in before settling in Texas.He is thankful that Curtis got to meet Jordan before he was killed -- another imprint tied to his fame from the film.\"What came along with that was the responsibility to teach, educate, be a friend, have some compassion and show some understanding,\" Gates says.  \"I've been very honored, privileged and grateful to be part of \"Hoop Dreams,\" he reflects. \"It's been super amazing to be a part of something that has withstood the test of time.\"",

So when the NBA Turkey Twitter account seemingly subbed him after a solid playoff performance this week, Kanter noticed.So did the NBA.The league is cutting ties with the Turkish vendor that ran its Turkish-language Twitter account, NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum said on Thursday, after Kanter alleged that the account was censoring him.\"The NBA Turkey Twitter account was managed by a local vendor and we are terminating that relationship,\" Tatum said in an email statement released by the NBA.In the backdrop of this episode is Kanter's longstanding criticism of the Turkish government, and that government's public desire to arrest him.Read MoreBut the tweets in question relate to the Trail Blazers' 97-90 win against the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday in the second game of their second-round playoff series.Kanter had 15 points, tied for second most on his team. He also had nine rebounds,  two blocks and two steals.The NBA's main Twitter account announced the game's result and top scorers -- and it included Kanter's name and picture.The NBA Turkey account had a similar post with all the same names, except Kanter's. The center's image also was missing.Kanter wasn't impressed, and tweeted a side-by-side comparison.What a messed up country lead by #TurkishDictator @RTErdogan Only Turkish player out here tonight, and the official @NBA for Turkey @NBAturkiye is censoring me.

Tens of thousands of people were imprisoned in Turkey after the failed coup.Turkey has accused Kanter of being part of a terror organization because of his ties to US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Erogan has accused of masterminding the coup attempt -- a charge Gulen has denied.Kanter has dismissed the allegations against him as absurd.Earlier this year, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Turkey submitted an extradition request for Kanter, and requested an Interpol red notice for his arrest. Kanter said Turkey revoked his passport in 2017.CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.",

The accused minister resigned a day later.Mart Helme, Minister of the Interior and Chairman of far-right Estonian Conservative People's party, (EKRE), made the remark during a news conference on Thursday. Helme said the President acted like a woman incapable of keeping her emotions in check, according to Estonian Public Broadcasting (ERR), a publicly funded news outlet.\"An emotionally fired-up woman can allow herself that,\" Helme told reporters. \"But Kersti Kaljulaid isn't just a woman, but rather the President of the Republic. She reads one article, is so emotionally upset as a woman that she immediately passes judgement on the fly.\"President Kaljulaid has yet to respond to the criticism of her. CNN reached out to her office but have not received a response.  Kaljulaid exited the chamber on Monday as Marti Kuusik was taking the oath of office, leaving him to salute an empty chair. Read MoreKuusik was sworn in as IT and foreign trade minister shortly after the weekly investigative newspaper Eesti Ekspress first reported the allegations of domestic abuse against him. Police swiftly launched a criminal investigation into Kuusik and, on Tuesday, Kaljulaid said she had relieved the EKRE politician of his duties. Kuusik, who has denied any wrongdoing, said in a statement that the accusations against him were \"slanderous.\"\"I am not someone who engages in violence,\" Kuusik said after announcing Tuesday he would step down. \"As of now, the decision of the prosecutor's office to start criminal proceedings against me has been added to the terrifying media attack launched against me in recent days. In a situation like this it is not possible for me to carry out my work as minister. Furthermore, the rest of the government is not able to work normally.\"Helme called the saga that led to Kuusik's ouster an \"unconstitutional witch hunt,\" expressing doubt over the President's actions.But Prime Minister J\u00fcri Ratas, leader of Estonia's Centre Party and the country's new coalition government, said Kaljulaid was free to act as she wished.\"How the president wanted to act during the swearing-in of the government is her right,\" he said, adding that, after being briefed by the Estonian police and Prosecutor's Office, he was sure Kuusik's resignation was the right call.",

After becoming only the sixth horse to win the Derby with an unbeaten record, Barbaro looked like he could be on the way to the Triple Crown when disaster struck in the Preakness Stakes two weeks later -- he shattered his leg shortly after getting out of the starting gates. Barbaro was put down by his owners eight months later, unable to overcome the complications he had suffered after the accident.Justify crosses the finish line at last year's Kentucky Derby. In 2015, American Pharoah became the first horse to win the coveted Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. The horse made the cover of Sports Illustrated and was photographed by US fashion magazine Vogue.Last year, Justify became only the 13th horse to clinch the coveted Triple Crown. He was retired, unbeaten, in July, with his hall-of-fame trainer Bob Baffert saying the chestnut colt was struggling from fluid in his left front ankle. Justify retired to a lucrative stud career with $3.9 million in earnings on the track, which is not a bad return for a horse that cost $500,000.

Someone slipped something into her drink when she wasn't paying attention.\"Dales said Greenlaw, who is from Fayetteville, knew her from high school but that Greenlaw didn't know the guy, \"who was all over her.\"\"And when that guy tried to steer my daughter out the front door, he stopped the guy and said, 'She's not going anywhere,'\" Dales wrote.Read More\"He was a starter on the Razorbacks,\" Dales said of Greenlaw. \"His place was not secure. He was underage and at a kegger. He wasn't drinking, but if there was a fight he was risking getting thrown off the team. In some ways, he was risking everything.\"And he risked it for my daughter. The guy backed down, and no one saw him again. No one at the party seemed to know who he was, and my daughter and her friends never saw him again.\"Dales said he previously never told this story because he was worried someone might say Greenlaw shouldn't have been at that party.\"So, do me a favor,\" Dales said. \"Root for Dre. He's a good kid with a good heart.\"On Thursday in a session with reporters at 49ers rookie mini-camp, Greenlaw, now 21 years old, acknowledged the story.\"When she said she needed help and then I saw how the dude was kind of grabbing at her, trying to get on her a little bit, I felt like I need to kind of step in,\" Greenlaw said.According to ESPN, Greenlaw said the woman went to a hospital to get her stomach pumped to remove the Rohypnol, commonly known as \"roofie,\" from her system and that she called him the day after the incident to thank him. Recently, she called him again after her father's tweets went viral to thank him and congratulate him on being drafted.\"I was just looking out for a friend,\" Greenlaw said.According to CNN affiliate KARK, Greenlaw moved from one foster home to another while growing up. It was through football where he found family. Brian Early, who then was an assistant football coach at Fayetteville High School, and his wife Nanci took Greenlaw in. He was adopted by the family last year, according to ESPN.",

But a series of injuries led him to see rugby as a potential alternative to the country's most popular sport. \"In 2003 I was a national-style wrestler and a freestyle wrestler at the same time,\" Ganbold tells CNN.Read More\"Due to injuries, I spent a lot of time and hardships at hospitals.

It takes perseverance through hardship.'\"I was not sure if I could become that strong and healthy. But I followed my dream and started to train.\"That was six full years before Mongolia had even played an international match. But Ganbold took to the sport almost instantly, moving over to Hong Kong to play the game professionally before returning to his homeland to spread the gospel of rugby.Ten years on from Mongolia's first competitive game, there's been some progress. But in this part of the world the obstacles to growth lie as much with the landscape as the on-field challenges.\"The main key for success in any sport is training and it's hard to do proper training in Mongolia where there is a six-month-long winter,\" Ganbold says.\"Normally during midwinter its -30C ... and it's hard to play on snow, even for guys who love the sport,\" he adds.Notre Dame: Toulouse rugby to raise money with commemorative shirtREAD: The 9/11 hero whose legacy lives on through rugbyREAD: The female rugby coach blazing a trail in New York'Snow rugby'Despite the challenging climate, rugby is beginning to prosper in Mongolia.

This year the event was helped along by an early spring which boosted turnout.\"Rugby is one of the fast growing sports in Mongolia,\" Ganbold says. \"Right now there (are) eight male clubs, five female clubs, with over 300 athletes competing.

And I said, 'yes you are. You had the greatest team in the greatest sport in history and the greatest coach -- Genghis Khan.'\"Genghis is considered one of history's greatest conquerors, and the empire helped to build remains the largest the world has ever known.At one time, Genghis ruled over everything that lay between the eastern coast of China and the Caspian Sea.A stuntman performing during the World Nomad Games.

And rugby itself is a team combat sport. I think it appeals to a lot of people in terms of their appetite to watch the sport,\" he says. \"I think that now the Rugby World Cup (which will be hosted by Japan later this year) is coming to Asia, it's a really big boost in growing the audience in Mongolia,\" Gansukh adds.Shane Williams: Ex-rugby international braced for world record attempt on Mount EverestFor Ganbold, however, rugby has the power to be about more than just a recreational activity or sport through which a lucky few can make a living.In his younger days, he says he \"used to smoke, drink and wasn't a very well behaved kid\" before he started playing rugby.Now, he hopes the sport can help others experiencing their own challenges.\"We have had young athletes who have experienced a harsh life and upbringing, made some bad decisions in the past. They know the cruelties of life and even some of them have been seriously injured. But this sport changed them,\" he says.\"It gives them hope, courage and to some of them a second thought about the problems in their lives.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Former Major League Soccer star Taylor Twellman knows the dangers of head injuries and their lingering effects better than most.Now 39 and working as media pundit for ESPN, the former New England Revolution forward was forced to retire from the sport due to multiple concussions following a devastating 2008 collision with LA Galaxy goalkeeper Steve Cronin.And as he looks back at the injury suffered by Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen in Tuesday's Champions League semifinal, Twellman, who set up a foundation to raise awareness of the dangers of concussion, is troubled by what he saw.Vertonghen was left bloodied and dazed after colliding with teammate Toby Alderweireld as the pair challenged Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana for the ball.\"I got sick to my stomach,\" the 39-year-old Twellman told CNN about his reaction to the collision and the aftermath.Read MoreAfter being treated on the field for some time, Vertonghen was initially cleared to continue playing, before staggering to the touchline just moments later. There, he stood retching and had to be helped from the field by the team's backroom staff.Jan Vertonghen was initially given the all-clear to continue playing, before being helped off the field just moments later.\"Hopefully no one has to die,\" said Twellman of what he sees as football's troubling record on responding to head injuries.\"It's irresponsible, it's disgusting, and quite honestly it's pathetic that we're still having this conversation in 2019.\"Tottenham said its medical team strictly followed the English Football Association concussion guidelines in caring for Vertonghen. In a statement, the club said, \"Following testing he was judged to be alert and answered all questions correctly and lucidly, deeming him fit to return to the field of play.\"All available video footage was relayed to our on-pitch medical team and they were able to confirm that he had suffered no loss of consciousness.\"Speaking earlier on Thursday in a press conference, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino reiterated his defense of his medical team, stating: \"We followed the protocol.\"He added: \"Our doctor and medical staff behaved very well, they were excellent, followed the protocol. I respect [their decisions] because I think I'm professional about football, not medicine. All decisions about health are for medical staff.\"The assessments on concussion were negative, that's why the player was allowed to play. A few seconds after that was a completely different thing, he [started] to feel no good. After that, we changed in that moment, and he was out of the pitch.Vertonghen had to be helped off the pitch by his manager, Mauricio Pochettino.\"I think the most important thing for us, is and always will be the health of the player. The game, the result, or that it's the semifinal of the Champions League, what's more important is the health of the player. That's our priority always.\"You can ask the referees. They were in Spanish, talking about the situation. The referee for me was fantastic.\"I want to praise him for his amazing behavior. His priority was the health of the player. He said to me 'Mauricio, are you sure he's in a condition to play?' I said, 'Ask the doctor, not me'. 'Doctor is he in a condition to play?' 'Yes', 'ok, go in.'\"The club added in a later statement on Thursday that Vertonghen had undergone further tests and had seen an independent neurologist, as is standard procedure, and it had been concluded that the defender did not suffer a concussion. The club said: \"The Belgium defender suffered an injury to his nose due to a challenge during the game which resulted in heavy bleeding. He was deemed fit to continue playing after an on-field assessment. All Football Association concussion guidelines were followed.\"Jan was immediately withdrawn as a result of the player informing medical staff that symptoms were developing suddenly and that he no longer felt stable standing up. We have been advised that this was the result of a presyncopal episode, a near faint.\"Vertonghen will not be available to play for Spurs in their Premier League game against Bournemouth on Saturday.READ: How do you stop Lionel Messi?READ: Messi nets 600th goal as Barcelona crushes LiverpoolJan Vertonghen collided with teammate Toby Alderweireld and Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana.Europe's governing body UEFA, which runs the Champions League, also defended the actions of the officials and Tottenham's medical staff, saying: \"Based on the reports of UEFA's officials at the match, the concussion procedure was respected during the game, as the referee immediately stopped the match after the incident.\"The doctor was at no point under time pressure from the referee and was given time to make his medical assessment. The stoppage was longer than the three minutes mentioned in the procedure.\"In accordance with the procedure, before letting the player come back onto pitch, the referee went to the touchline to approach the team doctor, who informed the referee that the player is fine to carry on and keep the player on the pitch.\"Football has often been accused of lagging behind other sports in terms of the way that head injuries -- and specifically concussions -- are treated.In other sports, the case is different. Since the 2015 Rugby World Cup, teams have been able to make a temporary substitution for any player suffering from a head injury.In English domestic cricket, temporary substitutions were introduced in 2018. Meanwhile, the NFL -- a sport long linked to head injuries -- has a \"Play Smart. Play Safe.\" protocol, with doctors monitoring player welfare on the sidelines using videoIf found to be showing any signs of impact seizure or fencing responses -- both independent signs of loss of consciousness, the players have to be replaced, according the NFL's concussion protocols developed alongside the NFLPA.Former Watford midfielder played for Morocco at the 2018 World Cup while wearing a scrum cap -- just five days after being substituted due to concussion against Iran.READ: Appie Nouri: 'You never know how good he could have been,' says Danny BlindREAD: From Cruyff to de Ligt: The evolution of Ajax's $500 million football factoryYet, in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, Germany's Christoph Kramer was allowed to continue after a clash of heads, only to be forced off by concussion later in the game. \"Shortly after the blow, Kramer came to me asking: 'Ref, is this the final?'\" World Cup final referee Nicola Rizzoli later told La Gazzetta dello Sport.At last year's World Cup in Russia, Morocco's Nordin Amrabat suffered concussion during a defeat against Iran, only to play five days later in headgear, which he discarded early on in the match. After Amrabat's return, Morocco manager Herve Renard described the former Watford player as a \"warrior.\"At the time Morocco team doctor Abderazzak El Hifti said he had respected the recommendations of FIFA \"point by point.\"Nonetheless the decision went against FIFA's suggested six-day concussion break. However, the governing body does not have the authority to officially enforce the advice.\"Until FIFA takes its head out of the sand and out of other places, we are going to still be having this conversation,\" Twellman added. \"If FIFA wants to do something about it and be proactive, then we may be talking about real evolution for the sport and real change.\"If we're going to be waiting for FIFA, then we'll be waiting forever.\"In response to CNN's request for comment, a FIFA spokesperson said: \"FIFA regularly monitors the situation of head injuries, maintaining constant contact with current and on-going studies on this matter and reviewing our protocols.\"As mentioned in the concussion module of FIFA's Emergency Medical Manual, \"if, at any stage of the concussion assessment, the medical team cannot make a definite decision regarding whether concussion is present or not and a doubt exists, it is recommended that 'when in doubt, sit the player out' and he or she should be removed from play.\"",

The three-plus-page letter, signed by one of Hill's attorneys and obtained by ESPN, says the two-time All-Pro will cooperate with the league's investigation into allegations Hill abused his 3-year-old son. Chiefs owner says Tyreek Hill is not with the team for the 'foreseeable future' but a final decision hasn't been made After audio was made public last week purportedly of Hill's fianc\u00e9e, Crystal Espinal, suggesting the Chiefs player broke their son's arm, the team announced he will not participate in team activities indefinitely.CNN has not authenticated the audio, which was obtained and published last week by CNN affiliate KCTV. Its release follows the announcement by a Kansas prosecutor that Hill and Espinal will not be criminally charged in connection with an investigation into their child's welfare. CNN has reached out to Hill's attorney and Espinal for a comment.Read MoreIn a letter to Lisa M. Friel, the NFL's special counsel for investigations, attorney N. Trey Pettlon writes that Hill denies he has ever punched his son, grabbed his arms, or otherwise touched the boy mean-spiritedly to discipline him.Hill does sometimes tap his son on the chest and tell him to man up or not to cry, the letter says, and the father and son also play fight.Pettlon writes that Espinal punishes the child and that there are text messages about her spanking the boy so hard it left marks. The attorney did not provide screen shots of the purported texts, nor does he give a date when the exchange took place.Tyreek: 'Crystal you know I didn't cause any bruising or harm to (our son.) But for some reason I still may be charged.' Crystal: 'I know you didn't. I did. I hurt (our son), I'm the one that did it. I was hurt and mad at you so I blamed you for everything.' In the audio made public last week, Hill and Espinal appear to discuss the police investigation of alleged abuse of their son, whose name is bleeped out.Espinal asks, \"Why does (the unnamed child) say, 'Daddy did it?'\"Later in the recording, she states, \"A 3-year-old is not going to lie about what happened to his arm.\"Hill denies breaking his son's arm in the recording. He also says, according to the recording, \"I'm the one that gets physical with him,\" referring to the child.\"He is terrified of you,\" Espinal says of their son, according to the audio. Hill responds, \"You need to be terrified of me, too, b----.\"Pettlon says that comment was inexcusable, and Hill didn't ask him to defend it. He also notes the criminal investigation has concluded with no charges. Johnson County, Kansas, District Attorney Steve Howe said last week that his office would not press criminal charges in the case.\"We are deeply troubled by this situation and are concerned about the health and welfare of the child in question,\" Howe told reporter. \"We believe that a crime has occurred. However, the evidence in this case does not conclusively establish who committed the crime against this child.\"Despite this decision, there will be continued involvement by State officials to ensure the safety of the child,\" the prosecutor said.Howe declined to discuss who has custody of the child, but added, \"What I can say is that the child is safe.\"Copies of Hill's letter were sent to the players' union, the Chiefs and agent Drew Rosenhaus.CNN's Sheena Jones contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The memory of Gino Bartali, the champion cyclist who risked his life to save hundreds of Italian Jews during the Holocaust, is set to be honored with the establishment with a youth leadership school in his name.Italian Bartali, one of the world's leading cyclists during the 1930s winning three Giro d'Italia titles and the 1938 Tour de France, used the handlebars on his bike to hide counterfeit identity papers, delivering them to Jews in hiding and handing over exit visas which allowed them to escape transportation to the death camps.Bartali rides uphill in the Col de la Forclaz on his way to winning the 15th stage of the Tour de France between Aix-les-Bains and Lausanne (Switzerland) on July 18, 1948. Bartali, who passed away at the age of 85, is credited with saving the lives of 800 people.The announcement of the new venture was made Thursday, on Yom Hashoah, a day where Israel remembers the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War II.The school, which will be based at Ben Shemen Youth Village in Israel, south east of Tel Aviv, will officially open in September 2019.Gino Bartali: The man who helped save Italy's JewsRead MoreThe program will offer children between the ages of 14-17 the opportunity to apply to attend a course dedicated to training riders in mountain biking, road cycling, BMX and track cycling.Up to 24 children from across the world will be accepted onto the course with the program dedicated to involving participants from all different faiths and socio-economic backgrounds.'Pride and hope'The new program has been welcomed by the Bartali family. Granddaughter Gioia Bartali said the new initiative \"fills our hope with pride and hope.\"\"The values that led my beloved Grandfather are values of goodwill, diligence, modesty and helping those in need. I hope that his story and his exceptional personal example can truly serve as an inspiration for the students in the school for many years to come,\" she said in a statement.The school is the latest chapter in Bartali's story, a story that he rarely spoke about before he passed away in 2000.\"Good is something you do, not something you talk about,\" Bartali once explained. \"Some medals are pinned to your soul, not to your jacket.\"JUST WATCHEDGiro D'Italia: Biggest sports event in IsraelReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGiro D'Italia: Biggest sports event in Israel 02:30In the 1930s, Bartali, Italy's very own version of Babe Ruth, was one of cycling's leading stars.Born in Florence in 1914, Bartali was a devout Catholic whose parents were married by the local Cardinal, Elia Angelo Dalla Costa.It was Dalla Costa who recruited Bartali into his secret network at a time where much of Italy had been ceded to the Nazis.In 1938, Italy's Fascist regime, led by Benito Mussolini, enacted a series of anti-Semitic laws which prevented Jews from working within government or education, banned intermarriage and removed them from positions in the media.Woman cyclist forced to stop race after catching up with menWhile some of the country's Jews fled the country before the outbreak of World War II, those who stayed behind remained largely unscathed until the Germans began deportations in 1943.It was at this time that Dalla Costa, working with Rabbi Nathan Cassuto, created a system which involved convents, monasteries and members of the general public hiding Jews in all kinds of ingenious ways.Even after Cassuto was arrested by the Germans, deported and sent to his death, the secret network continued to operate.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosUsing the guise of long-distance training, Bartali would ride for hundreds of miles delivering documents while the Fascist secret police simply let him pass given their admiration for the cyclist.Whenever he was stopped, he would simply ask that his bike not be touched since the technical set up was arranged to achieve maximum speed. After the war, he returned to competition, winning the 1948 Tour de France.In September 2013, Bartali's wartime heroism was honored in Israel when he was named as a \"Righteous Among the Nations\" by Yad Vashem -- Israel's official memorial to Holocaust victims.According to Yad Vashem 7,680 out of 44,500 Italian Jews perished during the Holocaust.",

Fleek, blud and yowza all make the first updated list since 2015. Plus, you can now play Scrabble with bae (5 points), which will delight any wordie (10).Cisgender, agender and misgender are also included, as is transphobia -- showing how issues relating to gender identity have taken a larger role in discourse around the world over the past four years.Commuters' frustrations have been listened to, with manspreading -- the act of a man spreading his legs across multiple seats -- and shebagging -- when a woman places her bag on the seat beside her -- each earning 18 points.Read MoreMerriam-Webster adds new words that'll make English teachers cringe (but you'll be perfectly fine with them)Mansplaining has also been added. In case you're confused, that's when a man explains something in a condescending manner, and it will earn 13 points. Understand now?The new additions join the existing 276,000 words in the Official Scrabble Words book, and reflect terms used in the US, UK, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The updated dictionary was released by Collins on Thursday, and forms the official basis for international Scrabble tournaments.Many new phrases serve as a reminder of themes that have appeared in the news in recent years. Antivaxxer and postfact are added to the list, as is kompromat -- a Russian term for compromising material held on someone else.Remainer and omnishambles have entered common parlance in the UK during the Brexit process and have now been added to the dictionary, while anti-fascism group Antifa has also been recognized.Upskirting, which was made illegal in the UK after a lengthy campaign, is included. So is burquini -- the full-body swimming costume that made headlines after it was controversially banned by a French court in 2016.Instagram, bingeable, overshare and sharenting all reflect modern lifestyles, while foodies can tuck into new additions like bao and sriracha.But most importantly for serious Scrabble players, OK is now okay. The two-letter abbreviation has been excluded from the game's officially dictionary for years, causing consternation among some players. It was added to Merriam-Webster's Scrabble dictionary for US players last year, and international players can now follow suit. Philip Nelkon, a four-time UK Scrabble Champion, said two-letter words are the \"lifeblood\" of the game.Ew is also added, while ze -- a gender-neutral pronoun -- adds to the list of short words that could get players out of a bind.\"Not only is the list fascinating in itself, with many areas of contemporary life in evidence, but the inclusion of high-scoring words like 'dox' and 'zen' means Scrabble enthusiasts at every level can improve their game,\" Helen Newstead, language content consultant at Collins, said in a statement.Hench, preggo, and fatberg are included, while hackerazzo and equivocacy are game-changing additions -- all score over 26 points.

        "content": "(CNN)The UK should aim to cut its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, according to its chief advisory committee on climate change. If adopted, the target proposed in a report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) would be the most ambitious emissions reduction goal set by any large economy. Net zero means that any emissions are balanced by an equivalent amount taken from the atmosphere.Read More The UK government doesn't have to act on the findings, but it commissioned the report after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned last year that the world has less than 12 years to slash emissions and avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The IPCC says global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero around 2050.Climate change: Do you know the basics? The CCC says the new target is \"necessary, feasible and cost-effective\" but that it requires drastic action, including phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles completely by 2035, planting 30,000 hectares of trees each year and cutting beef, lamb and dairy consumption by 20% by 2050.At a briefing ahead of the report launch, Lord Deben, CCC chairman and former secretary of state for the environment, said, \"This net-zero target puts us at the top of the pile. We say to the government: this can be done, you have the proof, but it won't happen unless you take the lead.\"It comes a day after the UK parliament declared \"an environment and climate emergency,\" making it the first country in the world to do so, according to the opposition Labour Party. Combat climate change by cutting beef and lamb productionTo achieve the net-zero target tens of billions of pounds will need to be invested in renewable energy, electric vehicles, capturing and storing carbon emissions, and planting trees, according to the CCC. Currently the UK has a target of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. Emissions had fallen by 42% in 2016.The CCC report suggests a 2045 target for Scotland as the country has \"greater potential to remove pollution from its economy\" and said Wales should aim for a 95% emissions reduction by 2050 due to its large sheep farming industry.Following the release of the report, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would commit to the new target and continue its \"global leadership in tackling climate change.\"Wind and solar power accounted for 18% of UK electricity generation in 2017. Pictured: Wind turbines stand in the Irish Sea, north Wales, March 2016. The new target encompasses all greenhouse gas emissions, including those from international aviation and shipping -- two industries that do not fall under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which calls on countries to reduce their carbon output and halt global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.Can weighing passengers at airports help cut carbon emissions?  Costs to reach the 2050 goal will total 1-2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, the same amount estimated for the current target, the report said. The recommendations come as climate activism is sweeping the globe. In March, hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren walked out of class to protest their governments' failure to curb emissions. Last month, Extinction Rebellion activists glued themselves to trains and blocked major landmarks in London to demand climate action.Extinction Rebellion want to get arrested to fight climate change Extinction Rebellion activist Rupert Read told CNN that the 2050 target would not mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change and that the UK should aim to eliminate emissions by 2025. \"We [the UK] started the industrial revolution. We started the path that has lead us to this precipice. We have a responsibility to help lead a common way out of this looming catastrophe,\" he said.More than half of British adults, 54%, believe that \"climate change threatens our extinction as a species,\" according to a ComRes poll of 2,037 Great Britain adults online on 26-28 April 2019. Data were weighted to be representative of all adults.Drax power station provides about 6% of the UK power supply, with four of its six generators powered solely by biomass.Fish are disappearing because of climate change Professor Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said that a net zero UK economy is \"technically achievable\" but that it relies on the treasury monitoring \"emissions as closely as we monitor GDP growth and employment.\" He added that a zero emissions strategy should provide \"the right incentives for businesses and have justice at its heart.\"The Committee on Climate Change recommends the UK phase out petrol and diesel cars completely by 2035. \n\nPictured: Hybrid and electric cars in London, February 23, 2017. Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at University College London, said that the 2050 target is \"too far in the future.\" \"As one of the leading countries in the fight against climate change, Britain must adopt a 2030 zero-carbon target, giving us 10 years to put in place win-win solutions that reduce carbon emissions, save money and make Britain a better, cleaner place to live,\" he said. In its motion to Parliament on Wednesday to declare a climate emergency, the Labour Party called for the government to achieve net zero emissions before 2050, while the UK Green Party has said it wants to achieve net zero by 2030.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, was introduced to the world, cradled in Princess Diana's arms, at a photo call on the steps of the Lindo Wing, the private maternity ward at London's St. Mary's Hospital, just days after his birth in September 1984.As Harry prepares to become a father himself, however, he and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, don't plan to expose their newborn son or daughter to the glare of the world's press in the same way. Harry and Meghan have broken with modern convention by choosing to keep all details of the new arrival private. We don't even know where the birth will be, whether at hospital or at home.Royal baby announcement: What to expect whenThe couple said in a statement on April 11 that they \"look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.\" We will be informed when the Duchess has gone in to labor and again, once the baby is born. Then, when the couple is ready, a small group of journalists, photographers and camera crews will be invited to capture the first images of the new family.Read MoreAs in many other areas, Harry and Meghan are doing this in their own way, but their decision to avoid a high profile public \"unveiling\" for baby as soon as possible has become a talking point in itself.'Every inch the princess'Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, departs the Lindo Wing with her newborn son, Louis, just hours after his birth on April 23, 2018.Meghan's sister-in-law Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, has chosen to introduce all three of her babies to the world's media on the steps of the Lindo Wing shortly after their arrival.\"She looked every inch the princess,\" Emily Nash, royal editor of UK celebrity magazine Hello!, told CNN. \"She looked like a royal on a royal engagement would and, as a mum myself, I found it slightly incredible that she was looking so fresh,\" added Nash, who was among the many reporters waiting for the duchess outside the hospital.Kate's glamorous look attracted criticism as well as flattery, however. Actress Keira Knightley lambasted the duchess in a 2018 essay for the book \"Feminists Don't Wear Pink and Other Lies.\" Knightley argued that Kate was setting unrealistic expectations for other women with her immaculate postpartum appearance. Meghan and Harry's royal baby: What we know so farReferring to the birth of Princess Charlotte in 2015, Knightley wrote: \"She was out of hospital seven hours later with her face made up and high heels on. The face the world wants to see... Don't show. Don't tell. Stand there with your girl and be shot by a pack of male photographers.\"Others have argued that Kate was simply fulfilling her duty as the mother of future heirs to the British throne.\"We have to remember Catherine is going to be the Queen Consort in the fullness of time,\" Bonnie Greer, American playwright and commentator, told CNN. \"The baby she brought out the first time, George, will be king. So, in a sense, she had a duty to come out and show us, here he is, this is the next King at the end of the century.\" Duty callsOf course, Kate wasn't the first royal mother to appear on the steps of St. Mary's with babe-in-arms. The Queen's second grandchild, Zara Tindall, was the first newborn to be pictured there, with her mother Princess Anne in 1981. Princess Diana then appeared with Prince William outside the hospital in 1982.Diana and Charles leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London with Prince Harry's elder brother, William, in July 1982. Dickie Arbiter, the princess's press spokesman at the time, told CNN there was no question whether Diana would present her baby to the media after his birth.\"She was aware of what the royal family is all about and what the certain traditions are attached to it and what is expected,\" Arbiter said. \"What is expected at the end of the day is all about duty. Prince Harry and Meghan right to skip that newborn photo op\"And if you're giving birth to the second in line to the throne then yes, it is your duty to come out and show him off, which she did. And then she did the same with Harry two years later.\"  Asked how physically challenging this must have been for Diana, Arbiter said: \"Yes, it would have been painful but she put on a brave face and she smiled. She did what she thought was expected in front of the cameras and then got in the car and went back to Kensington Palace. Difficult to do straight after birth but it was something that she felt had to be done, and it was done.\"Leading the way?Meghan, though, is having none of this. In their April 11 statement, she and Harry said that while they are \"very grateful for the goodwill they have received,\" they have decided \"to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.\" Greer believes that in doing so, Meghan is setting a positive example for other expectant mothers. \"Hopefully women won't feel the pressure to look like they're ready for the cover of Vogue after they've given birth,\" Greer said. \"And I think Meghan is leading the way with that, which I think is great.\"JUST WATCHEDHow Harry and Meghan may break from royal baby traditionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Harry and Meghan may break from royal baby traditions 02:15Perhaps Meghan is following royal custom in her own way by deciding to keep the birth out of public view. Home births, which by their nature are more private, were once the norm in the royal family. As Arbiter explained, \"the Queen's four children were born at home -- Charles at Clarence House (and) Anne, Andrew and Edward at Buckingham Palace. Princess Margaret's two children were born at home.\"As seventh in line to the throne, Meghan and Harry's baby is much further removed from needing to comply with any royal duties obliged of more direct heirs to the throne, such as their cousins, William and Kate's children. Greer believes that by keeping the birth private, Meghan may be sending a message to the world that \"her baby, even though it's born into a very public family -- one of the most public in the world -- is not a public baby. 'This is our baby and we'll let you see this baby when we're ready to show you.'\" Whenever Harry and Meghan decide to introduce the new royal arrival, the world will be ready and waiting.",

I think my will is even stronger than I believed it was. It's a testament that God is good. When I woke up and I couldn't talk or walk I never thought I would be here. I never thought I would play basketball again or talk to you. Just to be here is a win for me.\"Odom's interview with the Los Angeles Times took place in Las Vegas -- where the BIG3 held its annual draft on Wednesday.\"It's crazy because I have so much history with Vegas,\" Odom said to Markazi. \"I almost went to school here. I almost died here. It's crazy that this is happening for me now here. A lot of life-changing situations happened for me in Vegas. Hopefully this will prepare me to go play one season overseas. That's what I really want to do, and then I'll hang it up over there. I want one more run.\"This year, the BIG3 will visit 18 cities -- up from 10 each of the two previous years. Three games will be played at each location, two days per weekend, for a total of six games.",

CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won't get you high, and is marketed to help relieve pain, reduce inflammation and lessen symptoms of anxiety.Watson, who recently celebrated his 40th birthday, revealed he uses such products in order to ease the rigors of playing professional golf and credits it for keeping him free of injury. \"I see Phil Mickelson winning at 48, so I've got at least eight more years of having a shot of winning some tournaments,\"  Watson told CNN Sport's Don Riddell. \"So for me it was about how I create longevity in the game of golf and spending time with my kids running around. CBD was easily a fit for me.\"Read MoreREAD: Tiger Woods' Masters win has Jack Nicklaus 'shaking in my bootsREAD: Tiger Woods on 'surreal' Masters victoryBubba Watson reveals he uses CBD to help ease golf injuries. 'I've done my research'The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed the compound from its list of banned substances last year but, due to its link with cannabis, it still holds a certain stigma in sport. The PGA Tour, on which Watson plays, issued a warning to all its players in early April, saying: \"As with all supplements, the PGA Tour warns players who inquire about CBD products that there is no guarantee a supplement contains what is listed on the label, therefore there is a risk that a supplement may contain a prohibited substance.\"Emotional Bubba Watson reveals quit thoughts last year.However, Watson is confident that his use of the product is well within the legal framework of the game. \"I've had doctors involved to do my research and see what companies out there make a product that's safe for me and safe for my family. It was a no brainer,\" said the 12-time PGA Tour winner. \"There's no bad stuff in it, there are no chemicals in there that will mess you up or make you fail a drugs test. There are certain companies we trust.\" The American has recently entered into a partnership with cbdMD, a company which produces a variety of cannabidiol goods. In December, US President Donald Trump signed the Farm Bill into law, which among other things, legalized the production of hemp, which contains high levels of cannabidiol, or CBD.The product is marketed for everything from helping to relieve pain and inflammation to reducing stress and anxiety.However, the Food & Drug Administration still hasn't decided how to regulate CBD products. In a recent interview with Brookings Institution, outgoing FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said it could take several years before the agency fully legalizes CBD for use in food products and dietary supplements.So far, little clinical research has been conducted to prove CBD's effectiveness. Last year, the FDA approved the first drug containing CBD for the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy, but no other drugs have been approved since.",

It is her thirteenth birthday, and she writes about her dreams of becoming a journalist and marrying an Englishman.The Hungarian Jewish teenager began her journal in February 1944, just one month before Nazi forces invaded Hungary. Its pages soon became a young girl's account of her world transforming around her. \"Dear Diary, you are the happiest because you cannot feel the great misfortune that happened to us,\" she wrote on March 19.Her journal was published decades ago but, until now, had received scant attention, apart from a small memorial in the town of what is now Oradea, Romania.Anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe.

She writes about many of the incremental moments that lead to the inevitable.Read MoreOn March 31, 1944, she wrote: \"Today an order was issued that from now on Jews have to wear a yellow starshaped patch. The order tells exactly how big the star patch must be, and that it must be sewn on every outer garment, jacket or coat. When Grandma heard this, she started acting up again and we called the doctor.Eva has never had the name recognition of Anne Frank, whose diary is required reading in many schools around the world. But now her story has been brought back to life on Instagram.READ MORE: CNN reveals depth of anti-Semitism in Europe.

Once complete, \"Eva's Story\" will remain online in perpetuity.The videos were created by father-daughter pair Mati and Maya Kochavi from Haifa, Israel. \"We were looking for a way to deal with (Holocaust) memory and manage this memory in a way that is going to be relevant for a younger generation today,\" says father Mati, a 57-year-old tech entrepreneur whose ventures include founding the media company Vocativ.They brought in dozens of actors, with hundreds of extras, and created Nazi-era scenes in Lviv, Ukraine for the project, then recorded everything -- as a teenager might -- on an iPhone. Father-daughter pair Mati and Maya Kochavi brought in dozens of actors to recreate Nazi-era scenes, and recorded everything on iPhone.\"One of the strongest ways to really convey what happened in the Holocaust is to speak to a survivor who went through it,\" says 27-year-old Maya Kochavi. \"We have to think of more creative and stronger ways to convey the horrors of the Holocaust to the newer generation that won't have the chance to speak to a survivor.\"Each day from Eva's diary has been turned into a new Instagram story added to the account. On May 10, 1944, she wrote in her journal, \"I have no idea how it will be later, I always think this is the worst, then I realize on my own that everything can become even worse, actually much worse. Until now, there was food to eat, now we won't have any.\" Eva Heyman at 13.\nMore than 70 years later, memories of the Holocaust are preserved in documents and museums. Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, has put the last letters of Holocaust victims online so that the public can read the powerful personal notes.Not everyone has been thrilled with the social media lesson. \"The path from 'Eva's Story' to selfies at the gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau is short and steep,\" wrote civics teacher Yuval Mendelson in a column in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz.\"At the end gather all the tongue-clickers and head-shakers, and each in turn will tell us about our lost and disconnected youth, devoid of values and shame.\"A statue of Eva Heyman in Romania.The project's creators reject that criticism. \"Social media, especially Instagram, is shallow, especially if you're looking for content that is shallow,\" says Maya Kochavi. \"And if you're looking for content that is powerful and has magnitude and can cause revolutions even, you will easily find it there.\"Netanyahu joins world leaders in lamenting results of CNN poll on anti-SemitismOn May 30, she wrote her final entry: \"Dear Diary, I don't want to die, I still want to live, even if it means that only I remain behind from this entire district.\"Three days later, Heyman was deported from Hungary, then to Auschwitz, according to Yad Vashem. She died in a gas chamber on October 17, 1944.As the number of living Holocaust survivors dwindles, the Kochavis hope that Eva will become a fresh face for those memories of the event that no one wants to remember, and the world should never forget.",

        "content": "(CNN)When your team is about to face Barcelona there is a question that is always asked of the opposing manager: \"How do you stop Lionel Messi?\"For 74 minutes of the first leg of its Champions League semifinal on Wednesday, Liverpool appeared to have found an answer. Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor much of the night, Messi was on the periphery of the contest, struggling to find a way to make an impact on a highly charged contest at the Camp Nou.And yet, in seven second-half minutes, it all changed. Two goals from the magician, his 599th and 600th for the club, ensured Barcelona claimed a 3-0 victory and all but ended Liverpool's hopes of making a second successive final. Messi scores his second goal in the 3-0 win over Liverpool.Messi's first may have been fortuitous, but his second, an exquisite free kick that defied belief, was pure box office. Read MoreThe scoreline was cruel on Liverpool, which had chances to score throughout the contest, but was ultimately made to pay the price for its profligacy in front of goal. Even at 3-0 down, Liverpool had chances with Roberto Firmino's effort hacked off the line and Mohamed Salah striking the rebound against the post.But this was not Liverpool's night. Instead, it belonged to Messi. The Argentine, whose goal guaranteed Barcelona's eighth domestic title in 11 years last weekend, has now scored 48 times in 46 appearances. Few would be willing to bet against him reaching 50 before the end of the season.READ: Advantage Ajax in Champions League semifinalREAD: How do you stop Lionel Messi?Suarez ends droughtAnd yet, for all the the talk about Messi, it was a more familiar figure who inflicted the first blow.  Luis Suarez, once of Liverpool, had not scored in the Champions League all season, and so, rather predictably, chose this contest to end his drought.Suarez celebrates his first Champions League goal of the season.Jordi Alba found space on the left and his exquisite pass split the Liverpool defense wide open, allowing Suarez to ghost through and send a fine finish into the far corner.It was refreshing to see Suarez ignore the convention of players refusing to celebrate after scoring against their former club. Such a goal deserved a celebration, and Suarez was keen to ensure everybody was aware of his delight.Liverpool had, until then, appeared comfortable against the movement of Messi, Suarez, and another of its former players, Philippe Coutinho. Indeed, it should have drawn level before the interval through the in-form Sadio Mane.Messi struggled to make an impact in the early stages of the contest.Few players have been as impressive in front of goal as Mane in recent months, the forward having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season. So when Jordan Henderson's inch perfect through ball fell into Mane's path, it was perhaps even more surprising that the Senegalese could only lift the ball over the crossbar when most would have expected the net to bulge. READ: Porto goalkeeper Iker Casillas suffers heart attackREAD: Salah hits back over 'diver' claimsIt was the kind of opportunity Liverpool needed to take in a game of such magnitude. History suggested that the visiting side would need to be clinical in front of goal given Barcelona's astonishing home record in the competition of 31 home games without defeat.Liverpool, though, persevered. First, James Milner's fierce drive was tipped away by Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. The German then produced an even better save, this time turning Salah's effort behind after the Liverpool forward had fired towards goal. \n\n\n\n\nSuddenly, Barcelona, which had seemed so confident in the first half, began to appear vulnerable. Liverpool, playing with the confidence that has been so evident throughout its attempt to win a first domestic title since 1990, looked a far more dangerous proposition as it dominated possession.That domination should have yielded a far greater reward just before the hour mark when the visiting side scythed Barcelona wide open only for Milner to fire straight at the goalkeeper when he appeared certain to score.Messi magicIt was a miss that Liverpool would rue and, of course, it was Messi who administered the pain. The Argentine, on the periphery for much of the contest, drove towards goal before his pass was deflected into the path of Suarez, whose effort hit the crossbar before rebounding into the path of Messi to tap home.Liverpool's Salah hit the post late on after his side fell 3-0 behind.Seven minutes later, there was more pain for Liverpool. Messi, seemingly unperturbed after being upended in rather agricultural fashion by Fabinho some 35 yards from goal, produced an astonishing effort by curling the ball past the wall and beyond the reach of Alisson into the top corner.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosIt was a moment that made you sit bolt upright and exhale. At 31, many had thought Messi's best days may already be behind him, and yet, at the tensest of moments, when history beckons, he arrives with impeccable timing.For Barcelona, a place in the Champions League final is all but there for the taking. For Messi, scorer of his 600th goal for the club, more history surely awaits.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Julian Assange appeared in a London court by videolink from a high-security prison on Thursday as his battle against extradition to the United States on a computer hacking conspiracy charge got underway. The WikiLeaks founder, speaking from Belmarsh prison, wore a sports jacket and was not handcuffed.Asked by Judge Michael Snow if he wished to surrender himself for extradition, Assange said: \"I do not wish to surrender myself for extradition for doing journalism that's won many, many awards and affected many people.\"Lawyer Ben Brandon, representing the US government, said that the provisional arrest warrant for the 47-year-old was based on an indictment filed in Virginia for \"one offense of attempting to access a computer without consent and accessing a computer without authorization.\"Julian Assange's legal battles have only just begun\"Chelsea Manning (a former US Army intelligence specialist) downloaded a vast amount of classified documents. This included four databases with nearly 90,000 Afghan war reports, 400,000 Iraq significant activity reports ... (and) 250,000 state department cables,\" Brandon said.Read MoreManning then provided the documents to WikiLeaks, Brandon continued. He added that evidence collected during the course of the US investigation showed the pair \"unlawfully conspired to effect these disclosures\" and that Assange \"agreed to help Manning crack a password that was connected to a government server.\"Brandon said the maximum sentence for this type of offense is five years, adding that the full request from the US government had not yet been received. Judge Snow said proceedings would be adjourned until May 30, when another procedural court date will take place. \"The full extradition hearing is many months away where the substance of your case is likely to be argued,\" he added. Outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, dozens of Assange supporters -- including around 80 \"yellow vest\" protesters visiting from France -- rallied, waving signs and briefly blocked a main road nearby. A large truck with a billboard that read \"#FreeSpeech\" and showing Assange and Manning with American flags covering their mouths also disrupted traffic. The road was reopened after police arrived at the scene.Supporters outside Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday during a hearing into the US extradition request of WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange. This was the second court appearance of the week for the Australian, who on Wednesday was handed a jail term of almost a year for skipping bail in 2012 when he sought political asylum in the London's Ecuadorian embassy. Assange was wanted in Sweden for questioning over sexual assault and rape allegations. The whistleblower -- who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing -- said he sought refuge over fears of onward rendition from Sweden to the US due to his work with WikiLeaks.His near seven-year stint in the embassy was brought to a dramatic close on April 11 when Ecuador withdrew his asylum and invited in British police, citing Assange's bad behavior. He was then forcibly hauled out by officers.  Extradition 'where the real battle begins'Thursday marked the start of what will likely be a long and protracted extradition fight. While Assange is presently only facing one charge, US prosecutors have signaled more charges could be on the way.UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid told Members of Parliament on April 11 that the US has up to 65 days -- or until mid-June -- to send full extradition papers.\"They have the ability to add more charges before the 15th of June but our main concern is the fact that the allegations that are being made engage protected journalistic activities,\" Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Assange, told CNN after the court adjourned on Thursday.Assange's health seemed to be 'deteriorating rapidly' before arrest, says friendShe continued: \"The allegations boil down to, as we heard in court, not about hacking, there is no suggestion that Julian Assange had actually hacked anything. What this is actually about, is the fact that he had conversations with a source about releasing information, encouraged that source to provide more information, and talked to that source about protecting their identity.\"\"This is what journalists do all the time, and if he's going to be extradited and prosecuted for that activity, then that sets a great chilling impact to all journalists,\" she ended.A day before, WikiLeaks' Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said the US extradition claim is \"where the real battle begins.\"\"Although the extradition is based on a lower level of offenses, we think that is basically a snaring strategy to get him to United States where additional charges will be added,\" Hrafnsson explained.Mounting a defenseExtradition requests to the UK from outside the European Union are governed by Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. When reviewing the US extradition claim, it will not be for the UK courts to determine culpability. A judge only determines whether the US request satisfies the \"dual criminality\" legal requirement -- meaning that the alleged crime is illegal in both countries. The judge would also consider if granting extradition would breach Assange's human rights.If satisfied that the claim meets procedural conditions, the case would be sent to the British home secretary for a final decision on ordering the extradition.On Wednesday, Robinson told CNN they wanted to wait to review the full extradition request before revealing their defense strategy. \"We need to wait to see the final extradition request from the United States to determine what our arguments will be,\" Robinson said outside Southwark Crown Court. Omissions in Assange case and ongoing investigations signal broader charges to comeAssange's lawyers are likely to argue that the extradition request is politically motivated and that he would not be able to receive a fair trial in the US, according to Nick Vamos, the former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service where he was responsible for the case. \"It's going to be one of those where he throws the kitchen sink at it, I think that's clear,\" Vamos told CNN. Vamos added that \"a whiff of political motivation\" would not be enough to prevent extradition.\"What you need to prove is that the entire proceedings are corrupted and tainted by politics and that the person who is being prosecuted solely or primarily on the basis of their political beliefs, their political opinions, or political activities,\" he explained.CNN's Claudia Rebaza and Nina dos Santos contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A scout leader in England has resigned after members of his troop were found to be distributing political campaign leaflets. The unidentified leader stepped down after a complaint was sent to Lincolnshire Scouts about the 1st Marshchapel Scout Group delivering information for Conservative Party candidates in the local elections, which take place on Thursday. Several other volunteers for the troop in eastern England have now also resigned, a spokesman for the Scout Association said in a statement. The leaflets were promoting candidates Paul Rickett and Daniel McNally, who are both campaigning for spots on the East Lindsey District Council.Adventurer Bear Grylls is Chief Ambassador for the global scout movement.Reports in the British media suggest the children were enlisted in exchange for the chance to rent an allotment space for a year. They planned to grow vegetables on the plot, which would help run a soup kitchen, Sky News reported.

Girl Scouts sue Boy Scouts over name changeTurnout for local elections tends to be low, while the Conservative Party is currently riddled with divisions over the government's handling of the Brexit crisis. In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the Scout Association described the episode as a \"genuine error,\" saying: \"Following receipt of this complaint the local volunteer manager spoke with the Group Scout Leader of the Scout Group concerned and it was clear this was a genuine error on behalf of the Group and one they have apologized for.\"He continued: \"In accordance with Scouting's rules the matter was reported to the Charity Commission by the local volunteer manager. Subsequently the Group Scout Leader of the 1st Marshchapel Scout Group submitted his resignation after taking full responsibility for the incident. Other volunteers have also since resigned. No volunteers have been asked to leave the Scout Movement because of this incident.\"WSJ: Boy Scouts may file for bankruptcyThe troop will continue operating, the spokesman said. Ian Lavery, chairman of the opposition Labour Party, described the episode as bribery.In a statement to CNN, he said: \"With the Tories having so few supporters, they've now resorted to bribing scouts groups to deliver leaflets for them. This has led to committed local volunteers quitting the scouts over this scandal. If any Tory councillor thinks that bribing children to deliver leaflets is appropriate, how can we ever trust them to manage our local authorities.\"CNN has contacted the candidates and representatives of the Conservative Party for comment.",

For now, the network remains largely theoretical though, with few practical details disclosed.New law lets Russia jail people who 'disrespect' the government online In concept, the new law aims to protect Russia from foreign online restrictions by creating what the Kremlin calls a \"sustainable, secure and fully functioning\" local internet. The legislation takes effect in November, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.According to a summary from RIA-Novosti, the law calls for the creation of a monitoring and a management center supervised by Roskomnadzor, Russia's telecoms agency. The state agency will be charged with ensuring the availability of communication services in Russia in extraordinary situations. During such situations, it would also be empowered to cut off external traffic exchange, creating a purely Russian web.In addition, information from state entities and state-owned enterprises on the Internet will be protected via encryption, RIA-Novosti reported.Read MoreWhile Russia's internet has faced restrictions in the past, it has tilted hard in the direction of greater domestic censorship in recent years.

Read More\"I am sorry that you feel recent leaks from the National Security Council originated in my Department. I emphatically believe this was not the case,\" he said.\"I strongly deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position.\"Williamson added that he chose not to accept Prime Minister May's offer for him to resign because it would have suggested that he was guilty.pic.twitter.com/beAQiM8gyn\u2014 Gavin Williamson MP (@GavinWilliamson) May 1, 2019\n\nThe Daily Telegraph's leaked story was controversial because of allegations by some Western countries, including the United States, that Huawei products could be used by China for spying. Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecom equipment, has repeatedly denied the accusations. While Australia has already barred its equipment from the country's 5G networks, Huawei has fought hard to convince the United Kingdom that its products are safe for use.Following the leak, an inquiry was launched by Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill after the information from the secret discussions on April 23 was published in the paper. In a letter to Williamson, May said it was an \"extremely serious matter, and a deeply disappointing one.\"\"It is vital that I have full confidence in the members of my Cabinet and of the National Security Council. The gravity of this issue alone, and its ramifications for the operation of the NSC and the UK's national interest, warrants the serious steps we have taken, and an equally serious response.\"British Prime Minister Theresa May leaves Number 10 Downing Street for Prime Minister's Questions in Parliament on May 1.Following the announcement, several MPs called for Williamson to face criminal charges. Opposition Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said the former Defense Secretary \"should be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act\" and \"should forgo his ministerial severance pay,\" according to Britain's Press Association (PA) news agency.Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable also argued that Williamson should be referred to London's Metropolitan Police \"for a thorough criminal investigation,\" PA added.However Scotland Yard, the headquarters for the Met Police, said in a statement that they were aware of the leak but were not carrying out an investigation at this stage, according to PA. \"Clearly if at any stage we receive any information that would suggest criminal offences have been committed, then we will look into that,\" it added.May shortly after Williamson was fired that Minister for Women and Equalities Penny Mordaunt would replace him.

        "content": "(CNN)An \"uphill battle\" won't stop Julian Assange from fighting his extradition to the United States. That's according to his friend and self-proclaimed computer hacker Lauri Love. British police on April 11 dragged the WikiLeaks founder out of the Ecuadorian Embassy where he had been living since 2012. In an interview with CNN, Love said when he visited Assange a few weeks before, he appeared to be \"deteriorating rapidly\" and  knew he would soon be arrested. Julian Assange's legal battles have only just begun\"He puts on a very brave face, but it was clear he was very worried,\" said Love, who lives with his parents in rural England. \"This was weighing heavily on his mind and soul.\"Love knows a thing or two about waging a successful extradition fight. In 2013, American officials accused him of hacking multiple government agencies, including the US Army, NASA, and US Missile Defense. He was charged in three federal indictments and faced up to 99 years in an American prison. \"It was very scary and very worrying, anxiety causing, depressing, almost mind-boggling,\" said Love.Read MoreAt his extradition hearing, Love argued he would not survive the US prison system and should be tried in the UK. His extradition was initially approved, but last February, a British judge reversed that decision, ruling he should instead stand trial in the UK. Prosecutors in the UK have yet to file new charges against Love. Love is urging the public to \"overcome a carefully cultivated distaste for Julian as a character\" and to look at the spirit of the US indictment against the Australian whistleblower, which he calls \"vindictive retribution\" for the WikiLeaks disclosures.\"It is a pretext to send the message that if you are going to report on things there is a line and you do not go beyond that line,\" Love said. \"They are making an example of him.\"  Lauri Love arrives at the Royal Courts of Justice in London to appeal the decision to extradite him to the US on November 30, 2017.A defense against extraditionOn Wednesday Assange was sentenced to just under a year in a UK prison after he was found guilty of violating his bail conditions when he entered Ecuador's London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden in 2012.Assange faces his first extradition hearing on Thursday. Prosecutors in the US have charged Assange with helping former Army intelligence specialist Chelsea Manning break into US Defense Department computers. \"The Americans don't need to prove their case to the UK extradition court,\" said Nick Vamos, the former head of extradition at the Crown Prosecution Service where he was directly responsible for Assange's case. \"They just need to prove that there is sufficient evidence that if the offense occurred here, somebody could be arrested for it.\"Vamos said Assange's lawyers are likely to make three arguments. The first is that the extradition request is politically motivated, the second being retribution for Assange's WikiLeaks disclosures. Vamos said a third argument Assange's team could make is that he won't be able to receive a fair trial in the US, and that extradition could violate his human rights due to inhumane American prison conditions. \"It's going to be one of those where he throws the kitchen sink at it, I think that's clear.\"In an interview last month, Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson told CNN that her team would \"of course be raising the politicization of the case.\"Robinson told reporters after Assange's bail violation sentencing on Wednesday: \"We've been saying since 2010 that this threat [of extradition] is real. The focus of our energies will now be on fighting that extradition request and that fight starts tomorrow.\"In the weeks since his arrest, Assange has been held at HMP Belmarsh in Thamesmead, southeast London. Vamos said Assange's case will be a tough one to win. \"A whiff of political motivation in the background is not going to be enough to stop somebody's extradition if the courts also think this is a proper offense which has been properly charged,\" Vamos said. \"What you need to prove is that the entire proceedings are corrupted and tainted by politics and that the person who is being prosecuted solely or primarily on the basis of their political beliefs, their political opinions, or political activities.\" Photos: WikiLeaks founder Julian AssangeJulian Assange gestures from a police vehicle on his arrival at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on April 11, 2019.

Hide Caption 23 of 23 A troubled history of UK-US extraditions Love is not the only alleged hacker that US officials have struggled to extradite. In 2012, Theresa May, in her role as Home Secretary, controversially blocked the extradition of a British unemployed computer system administrator accused of breaking into US military computers. The defendant, Gary McKinnon, is autistic and admitted to committing the crime, saying he was trying to find out if the US was covering up the existence of UFOs. McKinnon threatened to commit suicide if he was extradited, and May overruled a court order in order to keep him in Britain.After the McKinnon case, UK extradition law was changed to limit the amount of influence politicians could yield in the process. Extradition decisions now primarily rest with judges. According to Love, public sentiment played a role in his extradition being blocked. \"The media actually helped vastly to bring about this mutual sense of understanding of people that were following my case that this is an abuse of the extradition procedure process and this is something we do not want to happen,\" Love said. \"I think it allowed the judges enough space to consider the law carefully enough to do the right thing.\"Don't expect Assange to be given the same leeway, said Vamos. \"Really when it comes down to it, the UK doesn't have any skin in the game with Assange,\" Vamos said. \"He's not a UK citizen, he's not a UK resident, so there's no great national interest on a political or policy or a legal basis to say we need to protect Julian Assange,\" Vamos explained.\"There is a high-level argument about journalism and freedom of speech, and that's a great argument to have but it's not ultimately, I think, going to prevent his extradition because the UK doesn't have that personal interest in protecting him.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A landmark ruling concerning one of the most contested issues in sport -- gender identity -- has sent shockwaves through track and field in setting out new parameters for female athletes.On Wednesday, double Olympic champion Caster Semenya lost her appeal against the introduction of new rules regulating the testosterone levels for athletes with a difference in sex development (DSD). The 28-year-old South African, who is hyperandrogenous -- meaning she has elevated levels of testosterone -- will now need to take medication to reduce her testosterone if she wants to compete internationally at events between 400 meters and one mile. Semenya is the dominant force in women's middle distance running.Follow @cnnsport\n\nIn its ruling the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) announced that its three-person panel had rejected Semenya's challenge against athletics' governing body -- the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) -- \"by majority\" but did add that it had \"serious concerns as to the future practical application\" of the new rules.  Under the IAAF's policy, which will now come into effect on May 8, all DSD athletes, who are usually born with testes, would have to reduce their blood testosterone levels to below five nmol/L for a continuous period of at least six months, and maintain those levels continuously for the rest of their athletic career, if they want to compete internationally at middle-distance events.Read MoreSemenya wins the women's 800m final during the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition estimated to occur in 5% to 10% of women.An excess of testosterone has been found to increase muscle mass within females and cause increased strength, stamina and physical energy.Some critics argue that skews what should be a level playing field in women's athletics.The IAAF believes DSD athletes have a competitive advantage -- findings that were disputed by Semenya and her legal team.A CAS statement said the panel was unable to establish that the DSD regulations were \"invalid.\" Although the Swiss organization also found the policy was discriminatory to athletes with DSD, CAS said \"such discrimination is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the IAAF's aim of preserving the integrity of female athletics in the Restricted Events.\"It was a conclusion Semenya -- who has 30 days to appeal the CAS ruling to the Swiss Federal Tribunal -- described as disappointing. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/FHmm10npfx\u2014 Caster Semenya (@caster800m) May 1, 2019\n\n\"I know that the IAAF's regulations have always targeted me specifically. For a decade the IAAF has tried to slow me down, but this has actually made me stronger,\" Semenya, the most dominant middle-distance runner of her generation, said in a statement released by her representatives. \"The decision of the CAS will not hold me back. I will once again rise above and continue to inspire young women and athletes in South Africa and around the world.\" Semenya's representatives said the Olympian was pleased that CAS had found the IAAF rules to be discriminatory against DSD athletes, but was disappointed that two of the arbitrators had deemed such discrimination to be necessary. \"Ms Semenya is reviewing the decision with her legal team and considering whether to file an appeal,\" the statement continued. Whether Wednesday's decision draws a line in the sand for track and field's governing body over such a complex issue remains to be seen.Within the statement, CAS expressed some concerns over the application of the IAAF regulations, which included: the unintentional non-compliance of the strict testosterone levels, the absence of concrete evidence on the advantage higher testosterone gives athletes at distances over 1500 meters and the \"practical impossibility\" of compliance. Referring to potential health issues, CAS said: \"The side effects of hormonal treatment, experienced by individual athletes could, with further evidence, demonstrate the practical impossibility of compliance which could, in turn, lead to a different conclusion as to the proportionality of the DSD Regulations.\"READ: Navratilova criticized for comments on trans women in sportREAD: Semenya needs to be treated fairly - MosesREAD: IAAF accused of 'blatant racism' Semenya is pictured competing at the Rio Olympics in 2016.The South African Ministry of Sport has told CNN it plans to appeal the CAS ruling to prevent the implementation of the new rules.\"We are naturally very disappointed with the decision. This is not only against human rights but also a blow to all South Africans. We are committed to lobby other athletics bodies to stand behind us. This wasn't only Caster Semenya's case but also Athletics South Africa and we plan to study the report in detail. We plan to appeal this decision,\" a spokesperson said.On Twitter, the South African government quoted sports minister Tokozile Xasa as saying that the IAAF's rules \"trample on the human rights and dignity of Caster Semenya and other women athletes.\" In a statement, the IAAF said it was \"grateful\" and \"pleased that the regulations were found to be a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the IAAF's legitimate aim of preserving the integrity of female athletics.\"The rules were due to come into effect in November last year -- with IAAF President Sebastian Coe saying at the time in a statement that the federation had a \"responsibility to ensure a level playing field\" -- before being delayed by Semenya's CAS challenge.In a move which could have a wider impact, a statement to CNN from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was working with a group of experts on creating guidelines to help international federations \"shape sport specific policies and regulations in relation to fairness, safety and inclusivity and non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sex characteristics.\"Seismic impactWhile the current number of hyperandrogenic and transgender athletes competing at international level is thought to be relatively low, Wednesday's ruling is likely to have a seismic impact on the future of sport.Tennis great Martina Navratilova said the CAS verdict was \"dreadfully unfair\" and \"wrong in principle.\"The IAAF has said it will make an exception for athletes wishing to compete under the new regulations at the World Championships in Doha this September.Though the event is less than six months away, Semenya and other similar athletes will be allowed to begin taking medication before the end of this week to be eligible.A statement from the IAAF said that no athlete \"will be forced to undergo any assessment\" and that any treatment was up to the individual athlete.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and featuresA career in the limelightSemenya burst onto the scene as an 18-year-old at the 2009 world championships in Berlin where she won a first major gold, but she was unable to compete for much of 2009 and 2010 after undergoing gender verification tests, the results of which were never officially released.The South African was eventually cleared to compete again, but a new rule which enforced testosterone limits was introduced in 2011. Yet that directive was subsequently overturned by CAS in 2015.Semenya went on to win Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 -- adding to a gold medal belatedly picked up in London four years earlier after her silver was upgraded because of a doping violation by the winner, Mariya Savinova of Russia.British athlete Lynsey Sharp was reduced to tears after watching Semenya storm away to victory in Rio. Sharp stated at the time that it was \"difficult\" for others like her to compete.On Friday, Semenya won gold in the 5,000 meters at the South African Athletics Championships. This represents a new event for the Olympic champion and one that would not be covered by the new IAAF rules.",

        "content": "London  (CNN)Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK's opposition Labour Party, has come under fire after it emerged that he wrote a foreword to a century-old book that has been branded anti-Semitic. The 1902 book, written by the English economist and critic of imperialism John A. Hobson, claimed that Europe's financial and political institutions were controlled by \"men of a single and peculiar race\" who were in a \"unique position to control the policy of nations.\"\"There is not a war, a revolution, an anarchist assassination, or any other public shock, which is not gainful to these men; they are harpies who suck their gains from every new forced expenditure and every sudden disturbance of public credit,\" he wrote in \"Imperialism: A Study.\" Hobson also referred to the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish family who established a banking empire in the 1700s, and questioned whether a \"great war could be undertaken by any European State\" if the family or its connections \"set their face against it?\" Corbyn wrote his foreword for the 2011 edition of Hobson's work. He added that every \"great political act involving a new flow of capital\" requires the \"sanction and the practical aid\" of these men, whom he described as a \"little group of financial kings.\" Read MoreIn his foreword to a 2011 edition of the book, Corbyn -- who was then a backbench Member of Parliament -- described the work as a \"great tome\" and noted that Hobson's analysis of the pressures pushing for the expansion of the British Empire was \"brilliant and very controversial at the time.\" Eight years later, the Labour leader is facing sharp criticism from politicians and Jewish groups alike for his perceived endorsement of the work and its anti-Semitic statements. The Jewish Labour Movement, an affiliate of the Labour Party since 1920, expressed shock at the revelation and said Labour members had once again found that their leader \"has endorsed antisemitic propaganda.\"  JLM's statement on tonight's revelations about Jeremy Corbyn's foreword to an antisemitic book. pic.twitter.com/5luH73uoP7\u2014 Jewish Labour Movement (@JewishLabour) May 1, 2019\n\n\"Given how much he says he abhors anti-Jewish racism, Jeremy Corbyn must be the unluckiest anti-racist in history,\" a spokesman wrote in a statement posted on the organization's Twitter account.  \"But in truth, it's no accident that he's praised an author who peddled what we would recognize today as left antisemitic tropes. \"Any other Labour member would have been suspended after this. He should consider his position.\" Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, has written to Corbyn expressing \"grave concern\" over the foreword, according to a statement on the board's website. She said segments of the work are \"pure and unequivocal racism\" and noted that \"there can be no apology for it.\" The Labour Party defended Corbyn, telling CNN in a statement that the foreword \"praised the Liberal Hobson's century-old classic study of imperialism in Africa and Asia.\"My advice to any Labour MP today: refuse to defend Jeremy Corbyn lauding a book containing classic antisemitic tropes. If he wants to defend the indefensible he should go on the airwaves and defend himself. He has a responsibility to explain himself. https://t.co/ioOVhJJ1O3\u2014 Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) May 1, 2019\n\n\"Similarly to other books of its era, Hobson's work contains outdated and offensive references and observations, and Jeremy completely rejects the anti-Semitic elements of his analysis,\" the party said. Corbyn indeed praises Hobson within his foreword for \"railing against the commercial interests that fuel the role of the popular press with tales of imperial might,\" which in turn led to \"racist caricatures of African and Asian peoples.\" In recent years, Labour has been accused of turning a blind eye to the resurgence of anti-Semitism within British politics and the party itself. Corbyn himself has faced sharp criticism as an outspoken critic of Israel and campaigner for Palestinian rights. Jeremy Corbyn endorsed book that peddles racist stereotypes of Jewish financiers and imperialism as \"brilliant\" and a \"great tome\". He attacked the USA and Nato, but defended the Soviet Union and Venezuela.He is completely unfit to lead the Labour Party. https://t.co/76zU2xzx4y\u2014 Ian Austin (@IanAustinMP) April 30, 2019\n\nHe also drew condemnation for being present at a 2014 wreath-laying ceremony in Tunisia at the grave of the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich attack, in which 11 Israeli Olympians were killed by Palestinian militants.Numerous Labour politicians have since turned against Corbyn, including Member of Parliament Wes Streeting, who called on other Labour parliamentarians to \"refuse to defend\" him over the foreword. \"If he wants to defend the indefensible, he should go on the airwaves and defend himself,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"He has a responsibility to explain himself.\" Ian Austin, an independent MP who quit Labour in part over its failure to tackle anti-Semitism, added that Corbyn was \"completely unfit to lead the Labour Party.\"",

The 2019 Classic season kicks off Saturday with the 2,000 Guineas over the turf of the Rowley Mile racecourse in Newmarket, Suffolk, traditionally known as the home of English Flat racing.The first recorded race in the town was a match for \u00a3100 between horses owned by Lord Salisbury and the Marquess of Buckingham in 1622.The 2,000 Guineas is a straight mile test for thoroughbred three-year-old colts and fillies and was first run in 1809. It was instigated by Sir Charles Bunbury, who had earlier established The Derby at Epsom.The name refers to the original prize fund -- a Guinea was equivalent to 21 shillings or \u00a31.05. The purse is now \u00a3500,000 ($682,800) with \u00a3283,550 ($365,600) going to the winner.\"He's 15 lengths clear!\"#OnThisDay in 2011, Frankel took the stage in the QIPCO 2000 Guineas - and blew us all away... \ud83d\ude2e#Guineas pic.twitter.com/gHL41y5AUq\u2014 Newmarket Racecourse (@NewmarketRace) April 30, 2019\n\nThe 2,000 Guineas Stakes, as it is properly known, represents the first leg of the English Triple Crown, alongside The Derby and the St. Leger. But the demands for both speed and stamina -- from the mile of the Guineas to the mile-and-a-half of The Derby and the mile-and-three-quarters of the St. Leger -- mean the feat is rarely attempted.The last to horse to clinch the Triple Crown, and the only one since World War II, was Nijinsky in 1970.   Since then only Nashwan (1989), Sea the Stars (2009) and Camelot (2012) have won the Guineas and the Derby.

The course -- the same as for The Derby the following day -- is roughly U-shaped with a climb from the start, followed by a sweeping left-hand turn (Tattenham Corner) into a mostly downhill straight, finishing with a stiff climb in the last few hundred yards. Enable, which went on to win back-to-back Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe titles in Paris, holds the race record of two minutes 34.13 seconds.The purse is \u00a3500,000.

        "content": "London (CNN)He entered Ecuador's London embassy in 2012, lauded by some as a charismatic defender of truth and journalistic collaborator, fleeing what he claimed were the crosshairs of the United States. Cut to almost seven years on, the extraordinary scenes of a disheveled Julian Assange dragged from his diplomatic sanctuary exposed the damaging impact of his time in self-imposed exile. The 47-year-old WikiLeaks founder put his legal problems on hold during the 2,488 days he spent in the Ecuadorian Embassy. And now he's out, they are more complicated than ever.Where is he now? Following his abrupt eviction from Ecuador's tiny embassy in Knightsbridge two weeks ago, UK authorities sent Assange to Her Majesty's Prison Belmarsh -- one of the most secure facilities in England and Wales. Read MoreThe prison in Thamesmead, southeast London, has the capacity to hold more than 900 inmates. Within the facility, there are four main residential blocks as well as a high-security unit -- known for previously housing some of Britain's most notorious terror suspects including Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0and\u00a0Anjem Choudary. Andy Keen-Downs, chief executive of Pact, a rehabilitation charity that provides family services at prisons across the country, described Belmarsh as an \"intimidating\" facility. \"Like most prisons, conditions in Belmarsh are austere,\" Keen-Downs told CNN. \"Conditions are very basic.\u00a0Prison staff work hard to keep prisoners safe, but like\u00a0most\u00a0prisons there are occasions when there could be violence. It could be a very intimidating atmosphere.\"During the night, the atmosphere could be very daunting with a lot of noise,\" he explained. Related: Why did Ecuador give up Assange? WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is being held in London's high-security Belmarsh prison.Keen-Downs said the facility receives a mixture of prisoners, allocating them single or shared cells. \"In the middle of the prison is the area built for high-security prisoners,\" he added. CNN has been unable to verify where Assange is being held within the prison while on remand. During his time at Belmarsh, Assange will be entitled to receive visitors. While on remand he will be entitled to three one-hour visits a week, Keen-Downs said.However, his lawyers told CNN that in the two weeks since his arrival, they were only permitted to meet their client in person once on Friday. A spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Justice -- the government body responsible for the justice system -- said it does not comment on individual cases. The spokesperson added that prisoners at Belmarsh are usually able to start receiving visitors \"within a matter of days.\" What are the charges Assange is facing? Here's where things get tricky. In the UK, Assange was wanted for skipping bail back in 2012. Days before he entered the embassy, the country's top court upheld a decision to extradite the Australian to Sweden over allegations of sexual assault and rape. The violation of those bail conditions remained throughout the almost seven years Assange was squirreled away in his diplomatic bolthole. And so in the hours after his dramatic eviction, a judge declared Assange guilty and ordered him to appear at Southwark Crown Court for sentencing at a later date. For this, Assange is facing up to 12 months. Assange gestures to the media from a police vehicle upon his arrival at Westminster Magistrates court on April 11.Then there's the American action. The UK stunned the world with its revelation Assange had also been arrested \"in relation to a provisional extradition request from the United States of America.\" Shortly after, the US Justice Department\u00a0unsealed a 2018 indictment for one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion with Chelsea Manning in 2012. This charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. And his worries don't appear to end there as US prosecutors have already signaled more charges could be on the way. Here comes Sweden ... again? Possibly complicating matters further is the prospect of the Swedish case being resumed. On the heels of Assange's arrest, a woman who accused the WikiLeaks founder of rape during a visit to the country in August 2010 called for the Swedish investigation to be reopened. Prosecutors acted quickly and assigned the case for review. We are going to do everything we possibly can to get the swedish police investigation re-opened so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape. No rape victim should have to wait 9 years to see justice be served.\u2014 Elisabeth Massi Fritz (@ElisabethMFritz) April 11, 2019\n\nAssange has always feared that once in Sweden, he could be extradited to the US for his work with WikiLeaks and has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Under Swedish law, any charges related to the rape allegation must be made by August 2020.\u00a0When contacted by CNN on Wednesday, the prosecuting authority said it was still reviewing the request to reopen the case. Will he be extradited? And if so, where to?As it stands, there is officially one provisional extradition request for Assange -- from the US. Extradition requests to the UK from outside the EU are governed by Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. Once an extradition hearing has been set, it will not be for the UK courts to determine culpability. A judge would only determine whether the US request satisfies the \"dual criminality\" legal requirement -- meaning that the alleged crime is illegal in both countries. The judge would also consider if granting extradition would breach his human rights. If satisfied that the claim meets procedural conditions, the case would be sent to the Home Secretary for a final decision on ordering the extradition.  UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid told members of parliament on April 11 that UK law dictates that the US has up to 65 days to send full extradition papers to the judge. In the meantime, Assange is scheduled to appear via videolink from Belmarsh before a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 2 over his possible extradition -- which could take years to decide. Jennifer Robinson, one of the lawyers on Assange's legal team told CNN on Saturday: \"It is a matter of international concern that a publisher is being held in a high security prison facing extradition to the US for his work that has won journalism awards the world over. We are very concerned about his health.\"Robinson added, \"He is grateful for the solidarity shown around the world.\" Pro-Assange demonstrators protest outside Westminster Magistrates Court on the day Assange was arrested. In the event that Sweden chooses to continue legal procedures, it could refile a European Arrest Warrant (EAW). Sweden previously issued a warrant for Assange's arrest in 2010, which he said forced him to seek protection from Ecuador years later. Valid across the European Union since 2004, the EAW was designed to speed up lengthy extradition operations and allows EU members to ask for the arrest and surrender of criminals in other member states. Giovanna Fiorentino, an extradition lawyer at the criminal law firm Lansbury Worthington, told CNN that EAWs are \"much simpler as opposed to the more convoluted Extradition Request which are quasi judicial and political as the Secretary of State has the ultimate decision.\"Julian Assange: Bond villain or cyber-messiah? It's complicatedIf competing extradition claims do emerge, Javid will be left to make a call over which petition takes precedence, according to extradition lawyer Rebecca Niblock of Kingsley Napley. \"[Javid] would make that decision based on four things which are: firstly, the relative seriousness of the offenses; secondly, the place where the offense is committed; thirdly, the date the warrant was issued and when the request was received and fourthly, whether the person is accused or convicted.\"She continued: \"It would be a very difficult decision for the Home Secretary to make because he would then have to decide on the seriousness of the offenses ... rape against the computer intrusion. In my view the offense of rape would the more serious one -- it carries a sentence of life imprisonment in this country.\"Already more than 70 British lawmakers have urged Javid \"to stand with the victims of sexual violence\" and offer Sweden the UK's full support. Could Assange end up in Australia?Meanwhile in Australia, Assange's parents have ramped up efforts to have the free speech activist brought home. Greg Barns, a lawyer for Julian's father John Shipton, told CNN, \"Both John and Julian's mother Christine are concerned about their son being held in a maximum-security prison, as any parent would be. But the situation in the embassy became intolerable and unbearable.\" FREE ASSANGE RALLYCANBERRA  Australia!Tomorrow!

Hick's father fought a tireless campaign to have his son brought back to his home country, and eventually the Australian government intervened. After being held for five years there, Hicks was transferred to Australia to serve the remaining nine months of a seven-year suspended sentence. The conviction was vacated in 2015.\"10 years ago, the Howard government, under pressure, had David Hicks brought back to Australia. Pressure from his father, his legal team and because of the way Australia perceived his treatment [at Guantanamo],\" Barns explained.That is why, Barns said, the prospect of having Assange brought back to Australia is \"not an unrealistic goal.\"\"Julian's case is different but there are some similarities here that there is a view among Australians that the US justice system is political and there is a level of discomfort with that,\" he added.A change.org petition calling for the Australian government to intervene in Assange's legal quagmire has grown in support since his arrest, garnering more than 124,000 signatures by Friday evening. Julian Assange is an activist, not a journalistAustralia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison was cautious following Assange's arrest but stressed that support would be offered. \"Julian Assange will get the same consular support and assistance that any other Australian would receive,\" Morrison said on April 12, adding that a person's fame would not affect how decisions are made. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told CNN on Saturday that the government \"continues to provide consular assistance to Mr. Assange including visiting him in prison and communicating with his next of kin in Australia.\"For the time being Assange's fate rests with the UK courts. However his case develops, one thing is certain: Leaving the embassy was not the end of his story, if anything it was just the beginning. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify the nature of the investigation Julian Assange is facing in Sweden.",

        "content": "(CNN)The first time Marija Lukic met her former boss, he locked the office door, groped her, and forcibly kissed her on the lips, she said.It was June 2015, and the married mother-of-two had come for a job interview with the powerful head of Brus municipality, located 240 kilometers south of the Serbian capital Belgrade, hoping that her education and work experience would get her hired.\"I felt so angry and told him I won't sleep with him to get the job. I asked him to unlock the door so I could come out. I told him -- forget about this, I don't need this job, I don't need anything,\" Lukic told CNN.It was the start of two years of sexual harassment she says, during which Milutin Jelicic allegedly sent her 15,000 Whatsapp, Viber and text messages, repeatedly groped her, and told her she could only advance at work if she had sex with him, Lukic alleged. Jelicic, 57, has repeatedly denied all accusations, via Serbian media. Read More\"The opposition is using this to unjustly soil the name of the President of Serbia and the Serbian progressive party. My justice and truth I will prove in court.\"He and his attorney have not responded to CNN's questions. The case has culminated in a high-profile #MeToo trial that's rocked Serbia's socially conservative society, where a law criminalizing sexual harassment was introduced only in 2017.It also shed light on the disproportionate power wielded by local officials who hold the keys to what is often the only source of employment in small and poor communities like Brus -- government jobs.The former mayor of Brus, Milutin Jelicic is welcomed by supporters as he arrives at court on May 27 to attend his trial for sexual harassment.Serious and professional -- at firstLukic, 31, said the flood of inappropriate messages from Jelicic started immediately after she stormed out of his office. She ignored them for several months but got in touch with him when her sister and friends asked her to inquire about an internship payment they were expecting from a government fund, she told CNN.\"I was reluctant because I was worried he will start coming on to me again, but my sister and her colleagues were trying to reach him for a month and were counting on that money,\" Lukic said.Jelicic was responsive and offered her the job of his secretary -- reassuring Lukic that he wanted nothing more than a smart and motivated employee. She still had no work and decided to accept, hoping that her previous conduct had set boundaries.During their next meeting, Jelicic was serious and professional, Lukic recalled.\"Really, at that moment I believed that because I batted away his messages and attention, it would be different now, he would not pester me again.\"Her boss's good behavior lasted three weeks, up until the moment they were in an empty office together and he again groped Lukic and tried to forcibly kiss her, she alleged.\"I felt so angry and burst into tears. I told him, we didn't agree to that, everything was ok so far, what's this again? He said he just couldn't control himself, and that it would never happen again,\" she said.It did, however -- whenever they were alone, Lukic alleged. Afterwards Jelicic would send her messages -- seen by CNN -- in which he apologized, but also continued to put pressure on her to sleep with him. A message Lukic submitted to court, and translated here by CNN to English, read: \"I am sorry I kissed you today a little bit by force and against your wishes and desires. I won't do it any more, it's stupid that I am doing this one-sided.\"Another message said: \"I love you, I desire you, when are we going to make love, it's been two years already.\"Jelicic denied he wrote the messages, telling the Serbian newspaper Blic last year: \" I never sent her anything. That phone was in the office being charged, and she sent the messages to herself.\" Lukic said she had agreed for the court to cross-check mobile phone records. The thought of being left alone with Jelicic gave Lukic nightmares, she said, and she was prescribed Xanax for stress and anxiety.\"Most mornings I would be sick and throw up before going into the office, then cry for half an hour once I got there,\" she said.Her family and friends noticed something was wrong, but she didn't tell them the truth in fear of making the situation worse.At the same time, her boss's demands on her increased, she said.\"He said quite explicitly - 'if you want a better job, if you want a promotion, the only way to do it is to have sex with me, because I can't trust you unless you love me. It won't work any other way -- that's the way I operate with all my employees.\"'     Silent permissivenessLukic said she appealed to Jelicic's friends for help, but their response was -- resign or give him what he wants. \"They said I wasn't the first or the last,\" she said.This silent permissiveness toward sexual harassment is prevalent in Serbia, according to Tanja Ignjatovic of the Autonomous Women's Center, a Belgrade NGO.\"There clearly is a high tolerance of sexualized interactions, speech, behavior, and that has been normalized as a type of commonplace communication in the workplace, seen as a joke, and not something that represents serious harassment,\" she said.Even though more than a third of Serbia's MPs are women, as well as the country's Prime Minister, this doesn't translate into more equality, Ignjatijevic pointed out. The latest report on Serbia by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, a United Nations body, stated concern over \"misogynistic statements that are expressed in the media and also by high-ranking politicians, religious leaders and academics with impunity.\" \"It's also much harder when sexual harassment happens in small places, like Brus, where local politicians control everything -- whether you have a job, whether you will lose it, whether the institutions will do their job or will abuse the authority,\" Ignjatijevic said.A woman holds a banner reading \"I trust you\" during a rally in support of Marija Lukic in front of court.Other accusersIn March 2018 Lukic could take it no longer, she told CNN, and informed her boss that she was going to report him to the police. She posted some of his messages on Facebook, and shortly after, she said she received an ominous call telling her that if she didn't delete her post her \"head would be on the line,\" she added.She said she was asked to meet a group of unknown men at a Brus restaurant, who sat next to her and watched her delete the post, asking her to write that she was only joking. Lukic said she met the men because she was afraid of what would have happened if she didn't, and wanted to ask them for assurances that she would be safe if she deleted her post. Despite the alleged threats, Lukic filed a police report, and was fired the next day.\"I knew that if I were in conflict with him, all doors in Brus would be closed to me, like they are closed now, I still can't find a job here.\"But I wanted to make sure he knew he was not the one in control of me. I wanted him to know that I can drive this to the end, and that I felt strong,\" Lukic said.Six more women came forward to accuse Jelicic of sexual harassment after Marija Lukic reported him, but the prosecution decided to press charges only in her case -- for unauthorized sexual activity with the abuse of authority, and sexual harassment. CNN contacted Jelicic through his lawyer, but did not get a response to any questions.The politician, who resigned this March and is a member of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party, said that the charges against him were politically motivated.He told Serbia's Tanjug news agency: \"This case is being used as a direct attack on the President Aleksandar Vucic, and in order to destroy the party to which I belong.\" The case has garnered national attention and wall-to-wall coverage in Serbian media. At the latest hearing in May, scores of Jelicic's supporters came out to cheer on him, wearing T-shirts which said Justice for Jutka, his nickname. In turn, the supporters of Marija Lukic held banners which read \"I believe you.\" \"I think the #MeToo campaign in Serbia had virtually no impact before Marija Lukic came out with this case, and all of its dramatic details,\" Tanja Ignjatovic, with the Autonomous Women's Center.Its outcome is closely watched in Serbia, she added, and could affect whether other women decide to report abuse.'I will fight 'til the very end'So far, four out of five hearings have been postponed, and the local court has asked for the case to be transferred to the capital Belgrade.Marija Lukic's lawyer Borivoje Borovic says there is always a danger that the process could drag on long enough to breach the statute of limitations, which in this case is six years. \"But we won't let that happen,\" Borovic insisted.Lukic says that she and her family have endured continuous threats and harassment on social media, including having her personal and medical details posted online. She doesn't know who was behind that, but suspects the politician's allies were the culprits.  \"If I can't get justice in this country -- which I believe I can because I have so much evidence -- I will go to European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on foot if I need to,\" she said.\"I will fight 'til the very end -- I will not give up after everything I've been through. If I made it this far, I will make it to the end.\"",

        "content": "London  (CNN)Ahead of this weekend's G20 summit in Japan, an elderly idol group called Obachaaan released a music video welcoming the new visitors to their city, Osaka. The energetic seniors dance and rap through the port city in the slapstick rap-style video, called \"Oba Funk Osaka\" -- which charmed at least one world leader. \"Like Japan, Singapore too has an aging population,\" Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in a Facebook post in reference to the demographic issue being on the global agenda at the G20 for the first time this year. \"Staying active and engaged with current affairs is certainly one lesson we can learn from these obachans (grandmothers).\" Policy-makers, like Lee, are puzzling over how to deal with world's aging population. The over-60s are growing faster than all younger age groups, thanks to people living longer, healthier lives and declining birth rates in many countries. Read MoreIt's an issue that is feared to have a swathe of socio-economic consequences -- such as lower economic growth, high public debt burdens, intergenerational tensions, higher health care or pension costs. And if you delve into the regional data, it is Europe that is leading the demographic change. According to United Nations population data, the continent is home to the oldest populations in the world where one in four of all Europeans are aged 60 and over. The European Union's birth rate is at 1.6, far below the average 2.1 births per women needed for a population to sustain itself from one generation to the next. A gendered issueAccording to Umberto Cattaneo, an economist at the International Labor Organization (ILO), the rise in short-term employment contracts, the gender pay gap and lack of affordable childcare are some of the reasons why couples are opting against having children in Europe.And the situation poses a Catch-22 for women, with the burden of elderly care potentially falling on them if policy-makers fail to provide long-term programs for the elderly. \"In Europe and Central Asia women perform 67% of the total care in unpaid care work in the region,\" Cattaneo said. \"The risk is that if there is not enough investment in this sector basically women will take up the additional unpaid care work.\"The aging population feeds into a broader trend in Europe, the only region in the world whose population is falling. In the next 30 years, the United Nations projects the global population will reach nearly 10 billion people; in Europe though it will fall by as much as 26 million by 2050. According to UN projections, between 2015 and 2017 countries in eastern Europe saw the biggest decreases in population -- with Bulgaria, Latvia, Ukraine, Poland and Hungary falling the most.      \"I would say it's dire in eastern Europe,\" said Brienna Perelli-Harris, a lecturer in demography at the University of Southampton, adding that the trend began after the collapse of socialism in eastern Europe -- with fertility rates declining to 1.3 or lower. \"Eastern European countries have the added burden of emigration,\" where people are moving to richer European nations for work, she said. But financial incentives and public awareness campaigns can come across as overbearing. A Polish government public awareness campaign, which called on couples to \"breed like rabbits,\" was widely criticized in Poland, according to AFP. While a 2007 policy in Russia, which gave maternity capital of up to $10,000 for mortgages for mothers with a second child resulted in black market trading of the capital. \"Many of the couples just wanted the cash,\" Perelli Harris said.Immigration has been cited as a way to plug the elderly care gap and even out population decline, but it has turned into too toxic an issue for governments to advocate for in recent years.\"Germany allowed refugees in partially because there is awareness they needed more workers and higher labor force,\" Perelli Harris said, but the issue has faced backlash from more nativist elements in Europe.      The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, made ethno-nationalistic appeals in a 2017 election poster that showed a pregnant white woman with a caption, \"New Germans? We'll make them ourselves.\" It was a campaign that was criticized for echoing Germany's Nazi past. But aging should not be cause for pessimism, said Lars Sondergaard, the World Bank's program leader for education, health social protection and jobs for EU member states. It is instead an \"opportunity,\" he said. \"At the heart, you've got to make individuals more productive to offset aging,\" he said.  The ILO estimates that doubling investments into the care economy by European and Central Asian countries would be lucrative.  \"It would result in 83 million jobs, with 70 million in care sector and 30 million indirect jobs by 2030,\" ILO economist Cattaneo said. \"But they need to start investing now.\"Sondergaard said a holistic approach is needed for an individual country's needs. Solutions could include keeping the older population in the labor force with greater skills training, ensuring pension inequality does not crop up and raising the retirement age.  All of which could prove -- as the Osaka-based Obachaaan dancing group already knows -- that life certainly does not stop at 60.",

The mercury reached 45.9 degrees Celsius (114.6 Fahrenheit) in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the Gard department in southern France, according to the French national weather service M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.This is 1.8 degrees higher than the previous record from 2003. It's so hot in Spain that manure self-ignited, sparking a 10,000-acre wildfireAround 4,000 French schools were closed on Friday and the opening hours of parks and public swimming pools were extended. French authorities have taken a number of radical steps this week to prevent a repeat of the tragic consequences of the 2003 heat wave that left around 14,000 people dead.Read MoreParis activated its heat emergency plan last weekend, put together in the aftermath of the 2003 heat wave. Cooling rooms were opened in some municipal buildings and mist showers were installed in the streets. Climate scientists have warned that heat waves such as this one are becoming more frequent and increasingly severe because of the climate crisis. M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France said the frequency of such events is expected to double by 2050.Tourists walk under umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun on a warm summer day in Barcelona on June 28.Heat emergencyEurope has been battling the heat all week, with Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic each recording their highest-ever June temperatures on Wednesday.The German Weather Service said temperature of 38.6 degrees Celsius (101.5 Fahrenheit) was recorded at 2:50 p.m. local time on Wednesday in Coschen, on the country's border with Poland.The previous record stood at 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), which was measured in 1947 in B\u00fchlertal, which lies close to France.How your health is at risk during a heatwaveIn Spain, firefighters have been battling a 15,000-acre wildfire near Tarragona in the country's northeast since late on Wednesday. According to the Catalan Fire Brigade, the fire likely started after an improperly stored pile of manure spontaneously combusted, causing sparks. The firefighters said the blaze was one of the worst in Catalonia in the last 20 years. Many European cities are not designed to deal with such temperatures. Air conditioning is less common and public transportation systems often struggle. Climate change blamedWhile temperatures around 100 degrees Fahrenheit may not seem too high, they are way above seasonal averages for the region, and episodes of intensely hot weather are more common during July and August. The heat wave is also unusual because of its timing. Such episodes of intensely hot weather are more common during July and August. On Friday, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said, \"Beyond this extreme episode and with climate change, there is one observation: these episodes are getting closer, the abnormal becomes the normal\".\"We must prevent the fact that it will be even worse in the coming years,\" he added.Earlier this week, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France linked the country's increasingly frequent heatwaves with greenhouse gas emissions, warning that without significant cuts to carbon emissions, heat waves could be stronger and last longer than in the past.\"With these temperatures going higher, our entire society must think about adapting to climate change. It's the problem,\" said French Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn.Mounting heatwaves are exactly what climate scientists predicted because of rising global temperatures caused by increases in greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and gas, according to Stefan Rahmstorf, co-chairman of Earth system analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and professor at Potsdam University in Germany.\"Heat waves are on the rise,\" Rahmstorf said in a statement earlier this week, comparing recent extreme heat with 500 years of records. \"The hottest summers in Europe since the year 1500 AD all occurred since the last turn of the century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.\"CNN's Antoine Crouin contributed reporting.",

But those streaks came to an end Saturday as Sweden upset the second-ranked team in the world 2-1 in Rennes, France, to set up a Women's World Cup semifinal against the fast-improving Dutch. Goals from Sofia Jakobsson and Stina Blackstenius gave the Swedes -- downed by Germany in the 2016 Olympic final in Rio -- victory in the evening kickoff after Lina Magull's brilliant opener. \"We looked at Germany and knew there would be a bit more space behind their back line to exploit with Blackstenius and Jakobsson,\" Sweden boss Peter Gerhardsson was quoted as saying by FIFA. \"Today it worked well, sprinting past the defensive line.

The top three European nations at the World Cup locked up berths, with England's performance putting GB through. Germany, meanwhile, missed out. \"I don't even think that Sweden played that well today,\" German captain Alexandra Popp was quoted as saying by FIFA. \"We should have done more. We lost balls too easily and were looking to play the long ball too often. We lacked that final, killer pass in front of goal.\"Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosIt was a familiar name, Vivianne Miedema, who scored the winner for the Oranje in the 70th minute courtesy of a glancing header before another header from Stefanie van der Gragt 10 minutes later put the game away.  \n\n\n\n\nGermany hadn't even conceded a goal in France prior to Saturday, so when Magull netted in the 16th minute on a scissor-kick volley it felt like the floodgates would open. Team Sweden celebrates after beating Germany at the Women's World Cup Saturday. The opposite happened, however. Sweden on the counterA single ball over the top regularly unlocked the German defense, with the ever threatening Jakobsson denied by Almuth Schult before the forward made no mistake in the 22nd minute. For all of Germany's possession, ninth-ranked Sweden continued to cause havoc. Schult had to push another shot over the bar and a scramble in the box almost put Sweden ahead. But Sweden did go ahead for good in the 48th minute as Blackstenius, who ended her scoring drought against Canada in the last 16, scored on a rebound following Schult's fine save. Germany wanted a foul in the buildup but it wasn't given. Jakobsson had three more chances but was either stopped by Schult or shot wide. Sweden ultimately had to hang on, with an offside ruling that went to VAR negating a possible penalty when keeper Hedvig Lindahl clattered into Popp. VAR finally took a backseat in the quarterfinals following taking center stage in the group stage. Sweden keeper Hedvig Lindahl was fortunate not to give away a penalty in the second half against Germany at the Women's World Cup. Marina Hegering's header with Lindahl stranded in the dying minutes flashed wide to the relief of the underdogs. Lindahl's struggles came after saving a penalty against Canada. Germany -- yes, Germany -- was the last team to lose a lead in the quarterfinals, against the US 20 years ago. Its surprise elimination followed the men's team crashing out in the group stage at the Men's World Cup last year in Russia as the defending champion. Tough times. Keeps on scoringMiedema at 22 has tallied a remarkable 61 goals for the Netherlands, which has quickly become one of the world's strongest teams. The Netherlands pulled off an upset by winning the European Championships on home soil two years ago, beating Sweden in the quarterfinals, and has maintained the momentum in France. \"I'm not really surprised with how far we've come, but I'm very proud of the team,\" Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman was quoted as saying by FIFA. \"I think we have very good players but things have changed so much since the European Championships. We've gained a lot of confidence but we also needed to improve our game to perform on the level that we're at at this World Cup.\" France recorded its highest ever temperature Friday amid a heat wave that has struck much of Europe, hitting 45.9 degrees Celsius (114.6 Fahrenheit) in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the south of the country.

It was slightly cooler for the game in Rennes, though drink breaks in each half were still in use. The Netherlands actually asked world governing body FIFA for the kickoff time to be changed beforehand. Italy wanted a later start time, too. But it didn't happen. Cooling breaks in heatThe contest was the lone quarterfinal played in the afternoon, while the rest were scheduled for the evening local time. The way the game ended, perhaps the Netherlands didn't mind playing in the afternoon, although there might be a knock-on effect for the semifinal. The USA and England meet in the other semifinal. Netherlands players celebrate during Saturday's 2-0 quarterfinal win against Italy at the Women's World Cup. Italy has captured the imagination of its home public with record viewing figures in the millions in their first World Cup appearance since 1999. But Italy paid the price for not taking two good opportunities in the opening interval. Winger Valentina Bergamaschi chested down with aplomb in the 18th minute when in the box but shot tamely at keeper Sari van Veenendaal.  Two minutes later, Bergamaschi danced into the box but, in a promising position on the right, scuffed her effort. The Netherlands was often in promising positions -- notably down the right flank -- but did little to test keeper Laura Giulani. Took over second halfThat all changed in the second half, when the Dutch took over. READ: The real reason Trump sets Rapinoe offREAD: Rapinoe, the US Soccer star who irked TrumpSherida Spitse's free kick from a central position from just outside the box was a clear warning sign. The Netherlands opened the scoring shortly thereafter.  Italy exited the World Cup after conceding from two set pieces in the second half against the Netherlands. Miedema cleverly got between Italian defenders and headed into the corner from former world player of the year Lieke Martens' free kick, the first goal outside penalties Italy conceded in France. Off another set piece, van der Gragt made it 2-0, with Giuliani getting a hand to the effort but unable to keep it out. There might have been a frantic finish had Daniela Sabatino scored in the 82nd minute, but the substitute was denied by Veenendaal. Still it was Italy's best finish at a Women's World Cup since making the last eight 28 years ago. \"The way they played and approached matches and their passion, they've shown people back home that football can be a sport where you have enjoyment, helping one another, unity and all these values,\" Italy coach Milena Bertolini said. \"I think that's why the public have fallen in love with this team.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Much like America in 2016, reality doesn't carry much weight in the United Kingdom right now. Facts, figures, real comments made by real people. Just as in the last US presidential election, none of them seem to have much impact on how the political class is behaving, nor how the general public views them.The contest to replace Theresa May as prime minister next month has quite reasonably focused on the Brexit plans of the final two contenders, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Ford is cutting 12,000 jobs as part of its European overhaulSpecifically, it has focused on what both hopefuls would do differently to May in order to deliver Brexit.However, both candidates are promising things that the evidence of the past two years suggests are impossible. Read MoreBoth men seem to believe that they can convince the European Union to renegotiate the deal that Theresa May secured. They believe that they can get the EU to tweak or remove the Irish border backstop, which has, to date, been the main reason that May failed to get her deal approved by the UK parliament. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt say they are willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal.Vague policy, flawed logicOfficials at all levels of the EU have been consistent in saying that this is not going to happen. And the EU has been remarkably consistent on its red lines during the whole Brexit process. In the likely event that no concessions will be made to the deal -- formally called the Withdrawal Agreement -- both Johnson and Hunt say they are willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. This is an extraordinary thing to say, when you consider that Hunt only this week said that he knew that doing so would cost jobs. Remarkably, these claims have not attracted the scrutiny one might hope, given the gravity of the situation. Instead, the candidates have been able to present vague policy and flawed logic on why they will make the EU budge as concrete reasons that they are the right person to lead the UK through its most serious crisis since World War II. Johnson seems to think that his charm, enthusiasm and popularity will be enough to open up the negotiations; Hunt thinks that his history as an entrepreneur means he has a track record of brokering deals. Meanwhile, the EU looks on in astonishment. JUST WATCHEDNew-look Boris Johnson emerges as Tory frontrunnerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew-look Boris Johnson emerges as Tory frontrunner 02:51It's not just the leadership hopefuls, nor the hardline Brexiteers, who are living in this parallel universe. The continuity-remainers who regret that Brexit ever happened and want to scrap it are entering their final push to convince the official opposition Labour party to back a second referendum. There's two problems here. First, the party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his hard-left inner circle, are not exactly enamored with the European Union. Corbyn, it mustn't be forgotten, voted to leave the European Economic Community (which became the European Union) in 1975. Second, while everyone in this bitterly divided nation can point to opinion polls that back up their preferred outcome, the reality is that polling on a binary question is difficult. However, if you look at the most recent national election results in the UK, the picture is clear. In last month's EU elections, both Labour and the Conservatives finished behind the pro-no deal Brexit party (30.5% of the vote) and the pro-remain Liberal Democrats (19.6%). So, with no hard evidence that remain could win a second referendum, continuing to oppose the only deal that the UK and EU have put on the table only serves to delay Brexit and leave everything murky. All of which makes a no-deal crash out on October 31 more likely. The lack of clarity is already having an impact on the UK. Manufacturing jobs have already been lost.And a less told story is the precarious position the UK's economy is in at the moment. Productivity is stalling, consumer credit is growing, wages are stagnant and current projections show the economy going into reverse in this current fiscal quarter. If a no-deal Brexit is as catastrophic as predicted, this could create a perfect storm of job losses, citizens unable to pay off their debts and the economy tanking. This in turn, could lead to a run on the pound and interest rates rising -- which is bad news for those with large debt. Starbucks has nearly 1,000 stores in the UK. They're losing moneyBut no one is talking about this. Instead, the nation is in denial, trapped in its Brexit paralysis and chest beating over the politics of the situation.It's all getting very serious as the Halloween deadline approaches. The reality is that without a public vote Brexit cannot be stopped, that without changes to the Brexit deal it will not pass through parliament and that the EU is still not willing to make changes. However, what might be possible is the new prime minister selling a fudge. The EU wants the UK to leave with a deal. Contrary to what many remainers believe, the EU's preferred option is that the UK leaves under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, then the two sides can talk about a future trading relationship. It's here that the new PM might be able to get concessions from Europe, then try to sell those concessions as a huge victory to parliament. It will be difficult, and it could become very messy. If a Brexiteer like Johnson ultimately ends up trying to pass Theresa May's deal, the sense of betrayal among hardliners will be palpable. But right now, the UK's options are limited. Meanwhile, all of the aforementioned is ignored as the UK distracts itself with a pantomime, as though facts are meaningless. If all this sounds familiar, you could be right. The UK might be living through its very own post-truth Trump moment.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italian police have arrested the captain of a rescue ship carrying dozens of migrants rescued near Libya, after a weeks-long standoff between the vessel and authorities came to a climax off the island of Lampedusa.Carola Rackete, the German captain of Sea-Watch 3, was led off the ship in handcuffs after forcing the vessel into the Italian port without permission in the early hours of Saturday morning.The ship had been stranded in the Mediterranean Sea for more than two weeks, and had defied an order from Rome blocking it from coming ashore given the desperate situation of the 40 migrants aboard. It will receive a fine between 20,000 and 50,000 euros ($23,000 and $57,000) and will be confiscated, Italy's Interior Ministry announced in a statement.Carola Rackete is arrested after disembarking from the vessel.Italy's populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini celebrated Rackete's arrest, declaring \"Mission accomplished,\" while the country's foreign ministry said five EU countries had agreed to take in the migrants.\"Even though in the afternoon the prosecution has opened an investigation against me, at the same time they notified us that they will not help to bring the rescued off the ship,\" Rackete said in a video posted to Twitter shortly before docking the ship. \"I have decided to enter the harbor, which is free at night, on my own.\"Read More\ud83d\udd35 Statement of our Captain, #CarolaRackete, before entering Port with the #SeaWatch3.\"We are proud of our captain, she did exactly the right thing.

It brought to an end a lengthy dispute between Salvini and Rackete, who knew she faced arrest when she docked but had remained determined to take the rescued migrants to safety. Salvini had said that the responsibility over the German-owned ship, which flies under the Dutch flag, lay with the Netherlands. \"Happy Saturday folks,\" Salvini wrote on Facebook, alongside a picture of Rackete being arrested. \"Shame on the silence of the Dutch government,\" he added.On Saturday morning, a few hours after Rackete's arrest, the 40 migrants disembarked from the vessel. Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal will accept them, the foreign ministry said.Sea-Watch 3 was one of the first migrant rescue vessels to test new Italy's newest hardline migration laws.Under Salvini, the country closed its ports to migrant rescue vessels in June 2018. And earlier this month, it adopted a decree that could see ships docking without authorization facing fines of up to $57,000.Although the decree does not mention migrant rescue ships specifically, it is a clear attempt to deter such vessels -- which pluck thousands of migrants from the Mediterranean each year -- from docking in Italian ports.CNN's Eliza Mackintosh, Valentina Di Donato and Duarte Mendonca contributed to this report.",

And of course, the internet immediately adopted the photo as a meme and symbol of patriotism for an American athlete and activist in her prime.

        "content": "Joensuu, Finland  (CNN)It's baseball, but not as you might know it.Pes\u00e4pallo, as it is called, is considered the national sport in Finland. It has a die-hard following, particularly in the country's rural towns, where spectators in stadiums often outnumber the local population. And, for those who may find baseball's sluggish pace of play a drag to watch, the Finnish alternative offers a welcome change: non-stop action.Pushed to compare the two, many Finnish players go so far as to describe the American game as, well, dull.\"Maybe I could use the word, a little bit boring,\" Jussi Pyysalo, chief executive of Superpesis, the top professional Finnish league, told CNN, with a laugh.       At least that's what former Finnish Olympic track and field star Lauri \"Tahko\" -- \"grindstone,\" in Finnish -- Pihkala thought. According to historians, Pihkala dreamed up pes\u00e4pallo nearly 100 years ago, after attending an apparently lackluster baseball game in the US.Read MoreHe brought the Frankenstein sport back to Finland in the 1920s, where he developed it as a military training program -- a strike in pes\u00e4pallo is known as a \"wound.\"The sport survived wartime in Finland, and its popularity has only grown in the decades since. Today, as Major League Baseball is struggling to attract younger fans, with attendance rates at the lowest levels in years, it's Finnish counterpart is experiencing its best numbers to date.At the opening game of the season in Joensuu, home to last year's Superpesis champions, Joensuun Maila, the stadium was packed with Finnish fans young and old. Caps for a few MLB teams dotted the crowd, but most were decked out in red \"JoMa\" jerseys.To an untrained eye sitting up in the stands, the scene looked much like a regular ballgame. But, while both American baseball and pes\u00e4pallo are played with a bat and a ball, the similarities end there. The variations range from the tactics to kit, terminology to the playing field itself.      One of the most obvious anomalies: there's no mound. Pitchers stand across from the hitter, crouching low before launching the ball vertically above the plate -- at least one meter overhead. The field itself is also laid out differently: long and narrow, compared to the traditional diamond. Knock one out of the park? That's not a homerun, known as a \"kunniajuoksu\" here, it's a foul ball.Batters do still get three strikes, but if they get a hit on the first two, they don't have to run.And if they do, it's not counter clockwise around a diamond. Instead, players run in a zigzag pattern along increasingly longer paths -- sprinting to the left to get to first base, then cutting across the infield to slide into second on the right, and finally left to third before running home.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's much more active because almost with every pitch you have a strike and the ball is on the move and the runners are on the move so there are no empty moments in the game,\" Pyysalo says.Joensuun Maila's coach flashes a peacock-like fan to signal to players.There's so much going on, it's difficult to know where to look.As the first player on Joensuun Maila went up to bat, his teammates circled around home-plate to jeer at the pitcher and shout instructions of when to run. In this arena, hitting is transformed into an aggressive art of imperceptible bunts and long balls, with nearly every pitch put into play.Standing to one side, the team's coach thrust his hand in the air, gripping a rainbow-colored fan resembling the feathers of a peacock to signal to the hitter and base runners. And with the crack of the bat, the hitter was off, racing across the synthetic turf and diving across a layer of sand into first base.       The stadium roared.\u00a0It's about the most emotion you'll see from stereotypically stoic Finns. For many here, coming to a game is almost like going to church, says Joensuun Maila CEO Jonne Kemppainen -- a place to release emotions \"good and bad.\"\"In the small cities, pes\u00e4pallo culture comes with the blood,\" Kemppainen, who retired from Joensuun last year, says.Pes\u00e4pallo has become an intrinsic part of the culture in villages across Finland, where it's taught to school children and played on fields during the summertime, when the sun almost never sets in northern parts of the Nordic country. Just like in America, it's also an excuse to crack open a can of beer.\"JoMa\" fans cheer after Joensuun Maila scores a run.From the most elite divisions of Superpesis, to rural teams, pes\u00e4pallo is supported through a mix of local business sponsors, government funding and a deep roster of enthusiastic volunteers, who live and breathe the sport.The big leagues for both men and women are televised, but the highest salary is only around $55,000 -- far less than the multimillion dollar MLB contracts -- so many players have second jobs. And, even though they may not be full-time pros, the prowess of these Finnish athletes' has even piqued the interest of MLB scouts.\"When you see the size, the speed, the strength, the explosiveness, just the quickness those guys had. Whether it's fielding a ball, throwing a ball, hitting a ball, running, everything was very high level,\" Troy Williams, a New York Yankees scout for Europe, Africa and the Middle East, told CNN Sport. \"There were several guys who threw the 92 mph to 97 mph range.\"Williams made headlines in Finnish papers a few years ago when he turned up at an All-Star pes\u00e4pallo tournament just outside the capital Helsinki. He said he was shocked to see fielders throwing fastballs at speeds comparable to MLB pitchers.Tuomas Jussila (center), the league MVP, grabs his bat in between innings.\"I was even surprised by how hard those guys did throw and how quick and explosive and fast and powerful they were at very similar skills that we have in baseball.\"One of the most skilled players in the game is Tuomas Jussila, a two-time league MVP, who helped lead Joensuun Maila to the championship last season.Despite not making an MLB-level salary himself, Jussila says he isn't tempted to trade his carbon-fibre bat for a Louisville slugger.\"I have followed and do occasionally watch baseball, but since I've gotten so used to the speed and dynamics of pes\u00e4pallo, baseball seems more sluggish,\" Jussila, who plays pes\u00e4pallo full-time, said.And most of his teammates agree.\"In our towns these guys are stars. They are not superstars, no. They don't need to make a lot of money, no. But, still they are proud of it and their hometowns are proud of them too,\" Pyysalo said.Joensuun Maila superfan Tuomas Kinnunen shows off his tattoo of one of the players.Fanatically proud in some cases. Tuomas Kinnunen, a taxi driver and Joensuun superfan, just inked Tuomas Jussila's likeness across his shoulder to celebrate the team's victory last season.\"It really was a dream come true,\" Kinnunen said of the win. His whole family was out in force to root on their team in the opening match in early May, their youngest son banging away on a drum.Asked whether the MLB's efforts to attract new audiences in Europe will work, these fans say that, in Finland at least, they're happy to stick to pes\u00e4pallo.But, up above the crowds, surveying the field from a VIP box, Kemppainen says he still sees at least one reason to tune into the American sport.\"I have MLB TV in my phone and I watch it every night,\" Kemppainen said, a smile spreading across his face.\u00a0\"Because I think that's the best way to get sleep.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Just hours before the kick-off of this week's G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, Vladimir Putin previewed his hopes for a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May, in a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times on Thursday.At the summit in Osaka, one of the Russian leader's most-anticipated events will be a bilateral meeting with the outgoing May, with whom Putin hopes to make \"a few preliminary steps\" toward a better UK-Russian relationship, he said. Relations between the UK and Russia have been frosty since a high-profile 2018 poisoning incident on UK soil: Former Russian spy Skripal, 66, was found slumped on a bench in Salisbury on March 4, 2018, along with his daughter, Yulia, after being exposed to novichok, a military-grade nerve agent. The UK government blamed the poisoning on Russian intelligence officers, which Russia denied. \"This spy story, as we say, it is not worth five kopecks. Or even five pounds, for that matter,\" Putin told the Financial Times' Lionel Barber, comparing it to the scale of relations between nations. Because the G20 is expected to be one of May's last outings as leader on a global stage, Putin reasoned that this might improve the odds of progress in their talks at the G20, because \"she is leaving and is free to do what she thinks is right, important and necessary and not to bother about some domestic political consequences.\"Read More\"I think that both Russia and the UK are interested in fully restoring our relations,\" he also said.But a Downing Street spokesperson told CNN Wednesday that May and Putin's G20 meeting Friday \"does not represent a normalization of relations\".\"The Prime Minister's position on Salisbury and Russia's wider pattern of malign behavior is well-known. As she has said, we remain open to a different relationship but that can only happen if Russia desists from activity that undermines international treaties and our collective security,\" the spokesperson added.\"This meeting is an important opportunity to deliver this message leader-to-leader to ensure the UK's position is fully understood.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The most anticipated match of this Women's World Cup did not disappoint. In a colossal contest on a summer night in Paris, the US prevailed over host France to move a step closer to successfully defending its title. Every blockbuster needs a fine storyline and the script for this quarterfinal is one that will stand the test of time because it was Megan Rapinoe -- the USWNT co-captain who had irked US President Donald Trump earlier in the week -- who was the match winner, scoring in each half to secure a hard-fought 2-1 win.\n\n\n\n\nA knockout tie between arguably the two best teams in the world was always going to send a favorite packing. The reason why ticket prices went in the same direction as the temperature in the French capital for a match billed as \"Le Grand Match\" was because no one could confidently predict how a match between such two strong teams would unfold. A drilled Rapinoe free kick gave the defending champion the lead in the fifth minute, and the midfielder doubled the advantage after the break by directing a Tobin Heath cross home. With a team of the US' know-how enjoying a two-goal advantage, the match seemed set for a straightforward conclusion but an 80th-minute Wendie Renard header raised the decibels inside the stadium and sowed some seeds of doubt. Read MoreLes Bleues were denied a late penalty appeal against a US side in retreat but, after a pulsating 90 minutes, the experience, composure and ruthlessness of the US proved decisive against an opponent which has never been beyond the last eight of a World Cup. READ: The real reason Trump sets Rapinoe offREAD: Rapinoe, the US Soccer star who irked TrumpRapinoe celebrates scoring her team's first goal against France. Rapinoe, who had picked a fight with the US President for saying she would not go to the White House if the US were to win the tournament, had said she hoped the match would be a \"total sh*tshow circus.\" It was certainly a spectacle with plenty of talking points, many of which centered around Rapinoe herself, a player who the focus of much attention during the pre-match build-up.Jill Ellis, who in this match overtook April Heinrichs' record for the most appearances as US head coach, described Rapinoe's performance as \"fantastic.\" \"It's almost as if it just feeds her,\" Ellis told reporters when asked about the controversy which had surrounded Rapinoe this week. \"She's a big personality both on and off the pitch and I think she honestly thrives in these moments. There's a never-say-die attitude, she loves and lives for those moments. She's a big-time player and the bigger the stage the more she's going to respond.\"The 33-year-old Rapinoe, likely to be playing her last World Cup, has now scored five goals in France, moving her level with teammate Alex Morgan and England's Ellen White at the top of the scoring charts. To illustrate the worth of Rapinoe's creativity to her country, since her World Cup debut in 2011, she has scored seven times in the tournament and provided seven assists. Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosRapinoe is now the World Cup's joint top-scorerEven before referee Kateryna Monzul had blown her whistle to start the match, US captain Morgan had raised eyebrows by not singing the national anthem. Perhaps it was Morgan's way of responding to Trump's criticism of her teammate. The USWNT's star striker had sung the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" with gusto, and had also placed her hand on her heart, in the US' first four matches of this tournament. But on Friday she stood silent along with Rapinoe -- who has previously said she will probably never sing the anthem again -- in Parc des Princes. On a day where France had experienced record-breaking temperatures, the heat did not appear to affect the tempo of a match which started at a frantic pace. After conceding early, France worked its way back into the match, with Kadidiatou Diani posing problems on the right flank. Despite dominating first-half possession Les Bleues could not draw level, a mistimed Diani header being as close as the host got. READ: The match that changed women's footballUS players huddle at the end of the match. The US began the second half aggressively, with Heath drawing a fine save from French goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi at the near post. But France created chances and looked to be gathering steam until its defense was breached in the 65th minute. Heath was given the freedom to burst down the right wing and picked out Rapinoe who was unmarked at the far post. In the 74th minute, Heath thought she had scored her team's third of the night, but the goal was ruled out for offside and from there on in France took over, giving the impression that it might stage an unlikely comeback. The towering Renard, unmarked inside the box, headed home Amel Majri's free-kick for the defender's fourth goal in five games. With the full-time whistle looming, France appealed for a penalty when Amel Majri's cross hit the arm of Kelley O'Hara, but the referee, rightly, ignored France's pleas and the US held on for its 10th straight World Cup win. France, which monopolized possession, had caused the US problems, forcing Jill Ellis' into a more defensive formation in the second half, but as has been the case for France in previous tournaments, a lack of bite in attack proved to be its downfall. The US will face England in the July 2 semifinal in Lyon. The Lionesses swept away Norway 3-0 in their quarterfinal.",

'Great attitude'Despite making three finals, Roddick never did win that Wimbledon title to add to his 2003 US Open crown, but the American \u2014 whose serve was as quick as his wit \u2014 kept in touch with Federer after quitting tennis at the US Open in 2012. Federer attended a fundraiser for Roddick's foundation in Austin, Texas last September -- sandwiched between the US Open and Laver Cup -- and the way the American remembers it, showed little pretention. This from one of the world's most recognizable names who has pocketed more than $120 million in prize money and landed plenty more in endorsements, not to mention having nearly 13 million followers on Twitter and even more likes on Facebook.  \"I mean I don't know how he has enough hours in the day, but he did,\" said Roddick. \"Landed, great attitude. He's very insightful. On the car ride to our events that we were doing, most people would say, 'Hey, what time am I leaving? I need to have a plane.' \"He goes, 'What can I do to help the most today?

But his legend will tell of an artist who had all the shots while simultaneously making things look simple much of the time, something the more workmanlike Roddick noted. \"I don't think he's naive enough to say, 'Oh, I'm just another guy playing tennis,'\" said Roddick. \"He doesn't think that and he shouldn't, because he's not. But I think he understands the power that he has and I think he is inherently a really, really true, honest, good person.  \"But my biggest source of jealously is watching him practice, and it's free and it's easy.

He was also good friends with the coach who shaped Federer and his game, Peter Carter, before his fellow Australian died in a car accident while holidaying in South Africa in 2002.

'Icon of a new generation' Osaka's dramatic rise to world No.1 -- she has since been usurped by Australian Ash Barty -- means she can now barely walk the streets of Japan without getting ambushed.

Naomi simply loved going home.\" Fellow Japanese tennis superstar Kei Nishikori also hailed Osaka's \"crazy mental strength.\" \"She is very calm, she tries very hard,\" Nishikori told CNN Sport in an interview at the French Open. \"And she is a very funny person.\" Nike historyAlthough Osaka has won more than $11 million in prize money, according to the WTA website, the bulk of her future earnings is set to come from a host of lucrative sponsorships, which include Japanese racket maker Yonex, All Nippon Airways (ANA), broadcaster WOWOW, food brand Nissin, watch company Citizen and Mastercard, according to her official website. In April, Osaka signed a deal with Nike, joining the likes of Roger Federer and Serena Williams. But unlike them, Osaka is the only Nike athlete allowed to wear three patches from her existing sponsors (Nissin, ANA and Mastercard) on her tennis outfit, according to her management company IMG. Although Nike allowed Li Na, the first Chinese grand slam singles champion, to wear two different patches, Osaka is the only one with three. \"Nike are prepared to be a bit more flexible because they clearly see her as a huge star,\" Currie said. \ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udf5c\ud83c\udf5c pic.twitter.com/gYZJsbisxQ\u2014 NaomiOsaka\u5927\u5742\u306a\u304a\u307f (@NaomiOsaka) October 28, 2018\n\n'Japanese essence'\"With her unique heritage and background, you could make a case for her as one of the the world's most global athletes -- relevant on every continent,\" Osaka's agent at management company IMG, Stuart Duguid, said in an email. \"She plays under the Japanese flag and is therefore a superstar in Asia, she grew up in the US and holds the US Open title, she's revered in Australia where she holds another major title, and in Europe tennis is big business and at the forefront of sport twice a year, hosting half of tennis's majors.\"Osaka may be on a stellar trajectory, but she still has a \"very Japanese essence,\" according to Uchida. \"She is very down to earth, and the way she behaves, like when she bows, that looks really Japanese,\" said Uchida. \"Every time, even during a match, when she gets a towel from a ball boy, she does like that [bows].

        "content": "(CNN)When heavyweights collide, the impact is always colossal. First, there's the anticipation, and for feverish excitement, no match at this Women's World Cup has yet to compare to Friday's quarterfinal clash between the US and France. There is a reason why ticket prices have gone in the same direction as the mercury during this week's European heat wave. \n\n\n\n\nThis is the world's top-ranked team going head-to-head against the fourth best team in the world. The defending champion versus the host. An irresistible attack against an uncompromising defense. It is \"Le Grand Match.\" It is a match that is helping propel women's football even further into the sporting mainstream. Megan Rapinoe, the USWNT co-captain, said it best: \"I hope it's wild and crazy. I hope the fans are crazy and there's tons of media around it and it's just a big spectacle.\"Read MoreThe winner of this last eight super tie not only will move closer to winning one of the biggest prizes in sport, they will be overwhelming favorites to do so. Does the US start as favorite? Perhaps, but neither would jaws fall to the floor if France were to knock out the defending champion. Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosA fearsome attack but a fragile defense?There is much in America's favor. No country has the three-time winner and current title holder's pedigree in this tournament. Never have the Americans failed to progress to the semifinals. Then, there is the roster. For athleticism, for speed, for attacking prowess, the US is without equal. There is much to back up Abby Wambach's claim that this is the best USWNT side in history. After all, no team has scored more in the group stages of this competition than the 18 goals netted by the title holders, and no previous US side has progressed to the knockout stages without conceding a goal.      All other coaches in this competition would hanker for a front triumvirate of Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath. Morgan scored a record five goals in the US' 13-0 thumping of Thailand but has not found the net since, coming off early against Spain after taking a knock. Rapinoe, in the eye of a Donald Trump tweetstorm in recent days, did not sparkle against Spain but scored twice, while Heath has caused problems for every defense that has come up against her in France. In Rose Lavelle, Jill Ellis has one of the most impressive young players in this tournament at her disposal, while Julie Ertz, still only 27, has the experience of winning four years ago and adds ballast to the midfield. Questions were being asked about the US' defense before the start of this tournament, and the debate became louder after Ellis' team conceded a sloppy goal against Spain in the last 16, the first time the US rearguard was breached since April. \"You never want to see a goalkeeper make the type of error that Alyssa Naeher made in the build up to Spain's goal,\" former USWNT goalkeeper Hope Solo wrote in her Guardian column earlier in the week, referring to the undercooked pass that led to Becky Sauerbrunn losing possession on the edge of her box, which Spain pounced upon to score. But coach Jill Ellis said her goalkeeper was in a good place. \"I don't think she's blinked,\" Ellis said Thursday. \"She's got incredible confidence internally.\"France, the heartbeat of women's footballThe formidable hostThe US has not beaten France in three years. Their most recent contest, a friendly in January, ended in a 3-1 win for the French. Indeed, the World Cup host has won 17 of its last 18 matches. Coach Corinne Diacre played down her team's chances, saying Thursday, \"We won't be able to match the Americans, that's for sure. But football is magical, and it's not always the best team that ends up winning. That gives us hope.\"But a partisan Parc des Princes will be the ultimate stress test for the US' weakest links because France too possess players of world-class caliber. The core of the team is made up of Lyon's all-conquering side, Europe's best women's team and four-time Champions League winners. Renard celebrates after scoring against Nigeria in the group stages. Captain Amandine Henry is one of the world's best defensive midfielders, striker Eugenie Le Somer is closing in on France's all-time scoring record, and Wendie Renard, at 6 feet, 1 inch the tallest player in the tournament, is a central defender who has scored three times in this tournament. Four years ago, Les Bleues crashed out at the quarterfinal stage against Germany on penalties, and they have not gone beyond the last eight in any recent major tournament, but a team that had always struggled to flourish in attack is now a threat in the final third. Only the US has scored more in this tournament.Like the US, France has been a touch inconsistent this year. After impressively beating South Korea 4-0 in the opening fixture, Diacre's side has been the beneficiary of several VAR decisions -- including a contentious penalty retake against Nigeria -- and needed extra time to see off Brazil in the round of 16. Rapinoe said both countries are better than they were in 2015, when the US won the title. \"From where we were four years ago and from where France was four years ago, I think both of us are much stronger teams,\" she said. \"The women's game in general has grown tremendously, and I guess the task for each team is to try to be the team that is growing as fast as the game is and keeping up and even being the one that's pushing the game forward, and, I think, France has done a very good job.\"Jill Ellis will have coached the USWNT for a record number of times when she leads out the US on Friday. Will football be the winner? Early Friday, StubHub was selling tickets for 10,000 euros ($11,368), significantly more than other last-eight matches. There were still tickets available for Saturday's quarterfinal match between Germany and Sweden on FIFA's official site for 15 euros ($17). \"These are why you play all these friendlies a thousand times, training on your own for hours and hours, and grind through the rest of it so you can get to this moment,\" Rapinoe  said of the anticipation surrounding the match. Is there more pressure on the US? Ellis did not think so, explaining that there was always pressure on the team that had won the sport's biggest prize three times. \"The US team lives in pressure,\" said Ellis, who on Friday will overtake April Heinrichs' record for the most appearances as US head coach. \"When you're young and you come into this program, there's always a target on your back, so it's almost a place where we live regularly. \"This is a big game, and the players know that, but it's that expectation of being ready for this moment. We talk a lot about it. They are wired for this. They are built for this. You don't come into the US program and hide in the shadows. You come in, and you're in the spotlight right away.\"But whether it is France or the US that marches on to the semifinals, with the eyes of the world on this match, women's football will be the beneficiary. \"It's a big game. It's a global game. This is a magnificent showcase piece for our sport,\" added Ellis, aiming to become the first coach to win the Women's World Cup twice. \"I've said it's the most popular sport now, I believe, for women. This game makes it bigger. The attention, the fanfare around it and behind it just draws more attention to it. \"If we can garner more support, more sponsors, more fans, more little girls going out willing to kick a soccer ball from watching this [Friday] night, that's fantastic. That's a great fallout.\"",

And in between a 12.42-mile public toll-road comprised of 156 turns to negotiate as competitors climb 4,720 feet, from the 9,390 feet start line to the 14,115 feet finish line at the mountain's summit.Arguably nobody knows the twists and turn of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb as well as Carlin Dunne, who has won the legendary race -- also known as the \"Race to the Clouds\" -- four times and will defend his title on Saturday.\"After the race, it can take weeks to come down,\" Dunne told CNN Sport's Don Riddell of the emotion of winning. \"The experience is second to none.\"The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is an annual automobile and motorcycle hillclimb to the summit of Pikes PeakReaching the pinnacleThe Ducati racer -- who is also a stuntman -- has been riding two-wheelers almost since he could walk. His father was a professional rider, while Dunne started his career as a bike salesman.Read MoreThe 36-year-old Dunne says he allocates at least six months to prepare for the race. \"It really is something else to work so hard throughout the year to come to this,\" he told CNN Sport. \"Because it's not just like you just load the truck up and come out here.\"And to get to the finish line at 14,000 feet, to be standing at what seems to be the top of the world, it's very hard to explain, it's hard to put into words.\" It takes just under 10 minutes to complete the race, but Dunne's preparation is as much psychological as it is physical.\"For me personally, I meditate, I practice, I run the course through my head and I definitely try to leave a little bit on the table for that X-Factor when you come around the corner and there's a giant marmot or something in the middle of the racecourse.\"A couple times, I've even got caught out. I thought I knew where I was at, I came around the corner and it was a completely different corner. \"You can never take it for granted here. You have to be very humble.\"There's not one but 156 corners to negotiate in the \"Race to the Clouds.\"Not to be taken lightlyPikes Peak is the second oldest motorsport race in the USA, dating back to 1916 -- the oldest being the Indy 500 which began in 1911. Staged in Colorado, if the race takes just under 10 minutes to completes it's notorious for demanding high skill levels if you're going to win.

You really have to do your homework.

Everything was under a microscope because anything could set light to that fuse.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosRead MoreWells was at the scene of one of the most well-known fracases of the 117-year old rivalry, and limped away with a freakish injury as a result.In a melee during Game 3 of the 2003 American League Championship Series (ALCS) at Fenway Park, Boston's ace pitcher Pedro Martinez shoved 72-year-old Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer to the ground.Wells, who was conservatively listed at 250-pounds and rested that day, charged onto the field towards Martinez in defense of his coach -- only to pull a groin muscle a few steps into his sprint.\"I'm limping over there and I almost had Pedro. I almost had him. I was going to beat the (heck) out of him,\" he recalls, using a colorful expletive. \"You don't throw Zimmer down on the ground like that; he was an old man.\"JUST WATCHEDBaseball in BritainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBaseball in Britain 02:39Changing of the guard This weekend, Londoners will experience a pair of Yankees-Red Sox matchups featuring a crop of far more congenial stars than those of Wells' era, led by the Yankees' Aaron Judge and Red Sox's Mookie Betts.The games will take place a few miles from the north London soccer enclave of the city's most comparable rivals, Arsenal FC and Tottenham Hotspur.Like Arsenal, the Yankees held the upper hand for decades -- 86 years to be precise -- before the Red Sox beat their nemesis in the playoffs en route to winning the World Series in 2004. Since then, Boston has won three more, including last year's title. Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez (R), throws 72-year-old New York Yankees coach Don Zimmer to the ground during an altercation in Game 3 of the American League championship series in Boston in 2003. Martinez called the incident the biggest regret of his career. Zimmer was shaken up but not seriously injured. He recounted the fight with zeal in the locker room the next day. 'Whatever happens is going to stick'After that bench-clearing brawl in 2003, the Yankees eked out the series win on a seventh game, 11th inning home run by Aaron Boone -- the current Yankees manager.But Wells, the winning pitcher in a pivotal Game 5, nearly cost his team dearly with his impulsive act.\"During the rest of the game, I'm in the training room getting treatment because I can't even pick my leg up,\" he says. \"Thank God that injury didn't get in the way.\"Teammate Bernie Williams chuckles upon learning of the incident. \"He did that in true David Wells fashion,\" he says, shaking his head.The 16-year Yankee center fielder was on the field during the Zimmer takedown. While it was frightening at the time, he was amused to see Zimmer -- who had previously managed the Red Sox, and died in 2014 -- receiving treatment for his wounds the next day, still pumped about the fight.\"Bernie, I apologize,\" Williams recalls Zimmer telling him. \"You know, if I was still in the same (shape) as I was 25 years ago, I would have kicked his ass.\"Martinez, who was not available for an interview for this story, has called the incident the biggest regret of his playing days.\"He throws a punch ... I had no choice but to defend myself,\" the Hall of Famer said last year to the Maine radio show The Ticket. \"I regret it only because of his age. It's the only blemish I have, and something that I would like to take away from my career.\"But I would never get away, because it happened between the Yankees and the Red Sox, and whatever happens there, I'm sorry but it's going to stick.\"Former New York Yankees pitcher David Wells played one inning of a game wearing an authentic Babe Ruth cap in 1997. Like Ruth, Wells played on both sides of the century-old New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox rivalry.  'It was pandemonium' In a storied career that saw his number retired by the Yankees, Williams played in 203 games against the Red Sox and belted 27 home runs. In the opening home game against Boston in his second season, he realized the matchups took on a different meaning.\"I was just a young pup coming into the league,\" he says. \"This was the first day of the season ... It felt like the seventh game of the World Series. It was just pandemonium. It was insane.\"Back then, Williams explains, the rivalry was more fan-driven, but tensions flared between the players beginning with the Yankees' record-setting 1998 championship run.\"In that five-year period, it became more personal, because we were facing each other (in crucial games) every year,\" he says. \"At that point you start getting a lot of bad blood.\"\"How do you deal with this?\" Williams would ask Yankees legend Yogi Berra, who won 10 World Series as a catcher in the post-World War II era. \"Relax,\" Berra told him, \"they've been playing us for 80 years. They can't beat us yet.\"Berra was referring to the fabled Curse of the Bambino that plagued the Red Sox after selling Ruth to the Yankees in 1919 for $100,000.But that curse was dramatically broken in the ALCS rematch in 2004. The Yankees became the first -- and still only -- team in MLB history to blow a 3-0 lead in a seven-game series.Boston's scrappy four-game comeback was capped by a bizarre play in a pivotal Game 6 involving a tense reunion between Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez and Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo.Earlier in the season, Arroyo hit Rodriguez's left shoulder with a pitch, igniting a brawl that resulted in Boston catcher Jason Varitek shoving his mitt in Rodriguez's face -- a moment enshrined on the walls of Boston sports bars ever since.With the season on the line, Arroyo was brought on in relief to preserve Boston's lead going into the 8th inning. Rodriguez hit a grounder back to Arroyo, then awkwardly slapped the ball out of his glove as he tried to tag him out, to score Derek Jeter from first base. After a delay, the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and nullified the run. The Bronx crowd pelted the field with trash, while helmeted police were called in as protection. On the next at-bat Yankees slugger Gary Sheffield popped out to end the inning, and Arroyo completed a career highlight.\"If I give up a run there the season's over, because you're on death's door,\" he reflects. \"In Red Sox mythology, those were two of the biggest plays that year. It just happened that I was in the middle of both of them.\"Bronson Arroyo of the Red Sox has the ball knocked out of his glove by Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees on a tag-out as first baseman Kevin Millar looks on in the eighth inning during Game 6 of the American League Championship Series on October 19, 2004 at Yankee Stadium.Fans throw items onto the field at Yankee Stadium after Rodriguez was called out for interference during the play.READ: Can baseball crack the British market?READ: MLB protective netting gains traction as another fan hit by ball Rodriguez has a hazier recollection of those clashes with the Red Sox.\"Oh, it was a long time ago,\" he told CNN during a promotional tour for the MLB last year. \"I mean they were just plays that were full of a lot of intensity, and in the heat of the moment you get into it, you are competing, and that's about it. That's all I remember.\"Weeks before the Yankees acquired him in 2004, Rodriguez was courted by the Red Sox in a secret meeting with then-general manager Theo Epstein, he recently revealed.The reigning American League MVP became irate when his trade from Texas to Boston was blocked by the MLB Players' Association over a voluntary salary cut.\"I was trying to give away tens of millions of dollars and the union did not let me,\" he explained on the Pardon My Take podcast. \"It was like this (freaking) big buzzkill ... I knew that (the Red Sox) were going to win and win big, so I kind of wanted to be a part of it.\"Instead, he went to New York and was immediately cast as a villain in Beantown, leaving him no choice but to embrace the rivalry. \"Because of that, when I go to Fenway for the first time as a Yankee -- I mean come on nothing could be meaner or more cruel -- I think that's where the emotions started,\" he added.Rodriguez did win a World Series with the Yankees in 2009, though the team avoided facing Boston that postseason. \"The greatest thing that ever happened to me as a professional was becoming a Yankee,\" he said.Images of the 2004 dust-up between Rodriguez (L) and Boston's Jason Varitek have been enshrined on the walls of Boston sports bars ever since.  'It was like a party after every game' Built in 1912, Boston's Fenway Park is the oldest Major League stadium and one of the smallest by capacity.It is also the least welcoming to opposing pitchers, says David Cone, who won four championships in his six years with the Yankees, before moving to the Red Sox for one season in 2001.\"That is by far the most intimidating bullpen to warm-up in,\" says Cone, now an announcer for the Yankees' YES Network. \"The fans are very close, so you can hear every heckler right on top of you within a few feet.\"Wells and Cone both threw perfect games for the Yankees -- only the 15th and 16th in MLB history, respectively -- allowing no batters on base over nine innings. The close friends were embraced as Yankees like few others, until they came back to the Bronx in Red Sox uniforms.\"It was a little bittersweet,\" recalls Cone of his return. \"There were some cheers and there were some boos; it really goes back to the old saying that most baseball fans cheer for the laundry.\"David Cone was hoisted on the shoulders of his teammates at Yankee Stadium after pitching the 16th perfect game in MLB history in 1999. Cone won four of his five World Series with the Yankees and was a fan favorite.    Nevertheless, Cone received a testy greeting in his return to Yankee Stadium in a Red Sox jersey in 2001. \"It was a little bittersweet,\" he said. Wells felt the brunt of it from Yankee Stadium's ardent Bleacher Creature fans in 2005. \"I got people throwing (stuff) at me in the bullpen, coins, hot dogs, cookies,\" he recalls. \"I was villain number one.\"Wells, however, didn't mix with Bostonians in the same way that Arroyo did, who spoke of fans standing and cheering as Red Sox players walked into restaurants.\"I hated it,\" Wells says. \"I became very rude to people when I was in Boston because I didn't have any privacy. In New York I went out everywhere and nobody bothered me.\"As a Yankee, Wells relished the Big Apple's nightlife, famously throwing his perfect game in 1998 on a 5.30 a.m. hangover -- \"I did a facial on my bed, annihilated,\" he admits -- but Boston's locker room was far more suited to his personality.That Boston clubhouse featuring the loose personalities of Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz and Johnny Damon (who would join the Yankees the following season and have money thrown at him on his return to Fenway), was more amenable to the ear-crushing volume of Wells' Metallica CDs.\"It was like a party after every game,\" he says. \"The Yankee locker room was pretty much business.\"David Wells (L), Roger Clemens (C) and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre celebrate in Yankee Stadium with the plaque of Babe Ruth after defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 7 of the ALCS in 2003. The Curse of the Bambino would be broken the following year in a playoff rematch between the teams.  Yankee manager Joe Torre, it turned out, was no fan of Metallica. His objections to the blasting of \"Enter Sandman\", which was later adopted by Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera as his theme song, caused frequent arguments in the locker room, says Wells.\"He would go turn it down. I'd go turn it back up,\" he recalls. \"Joe and I would fight on it, and it was unbelievable.\"What aggravated Torre further was Wells donning the 1930's Babe Ruth cap, which he purchased for $35,000, during a game in 1997.Wells, who owns a world-class collection of Babe Ruth memorabilia, was forced to take it off after the first inning. \"Torre fined me $2,500 for wearing it,\" he says.Wells got the last laugh, however. At an auction in 2012, he sold the Bambino's now doubly-legendary hat for $537,278.",

        "content": "(CNN)Two people were arrested on Thursday morning over the murder of pro-migrant mayor Walter L\u00fcbcke, according to Germany's federal prosecutor, just days after a suspect already in custody confessed to the killing. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor, Kerstin Wacker, told CNN that the two alleged perpetrators will be questioned by the judge leading the investigation.L\u00fcbcke, 65, was shot in the head at close range on the terrace of his home in the small village of Istha, in central Germany, in the early hours of June 2. A German security source told CNN earlier that a far-right supporter, identified only as Stephan E., confessed to L\u00fcbcke's killing on Tuesday.The source added that Stephan E. said he killed L\u00fcbcke because of the politician's views, in particular his liberal position on migration and refugee policies.Read MoreThe 45-year-old man was arrested shortly after the killing based on traces of DNA evidence from the crime scene, according to the Hesse state office of criminal investigation and Kassel's public prosecutor. Police have previously said the suspect had a long criminal record and had \"openly expressed opinions and public views\" that linked him with the far right.An honor guard stands at a portrait and coffin of murdered German politician Walter L\u00fcbcke at his memorial service on June 13.L\u00fcbcke was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democrats and an outspoken supporter of the government's pro-migrant policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. The 65-year-old politician was the president of the Kassel regional council in central Germany.According to the police, L\u00fcbcke first received death threats after a YouTube video emerged of him defending the country's immigration policies at a public meeting in Kassel in October 2015. The meeting was also attended by members of Pegida, a far-right anti-Islam movement.Angela Merkel warns against dark forces on the rise in EuropeIn the video, L\u00fcbcke says: ''You have to stand up for your values. If you don't share those values, then anyone is free to leave this country if they don't agree.\" Some members of the crowd could be heard shouting \"get out, get out\" in response.Merkel opened Germany's doors to more than 1 million migrants in 2015. But her policy, hailed by humanitarians, also attracted fierce criticism from the right, particularly following a number of terrorist attacks across the country in summer 2016.CNN's Nadine Schmidt and Sheena McKenzie contributed to this article.",

They're not the biggest folks in the world, but they pack a punch and that's most important. They've been totally different in aspect of outlook to what the game is all about.\"Virat is more up front and Sachin will sit back just a little bit, but that doesn't take anything away from both of them and what they've achieved so far in the sport.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Britons have long been accustomed to sitting through lengthy, drawn out sporting events, with action often only occurring in short bursts. It took Novak Djokovic five hours and 16 minutes to reach the Wimbledon men's tennis final in 2018, beating Rafael Nadal in five sets in the semifinals. The final of the 2019 World Snooker Championships, held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, took place over four sessions, spanning two days. Then there's cricket, which takes things to a whole new level. Test matches last up to five days -- interlaced with lunch, tea and drinks -- and even then, much to the amusement of the majority of non-cricketing nations, the result can still be a draw. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosRead MoreThis summer British fans of slow sport will get an additional taste of bat and ball action -- the MLB is coming to the UK with the New York Yankees taking on the Boston Red Sox in a two-game series across the weekend of June 29-30 at West Ham United's London Stadium.Keeping fans interestedCultivating an appreciation of baseball in the UK is very much top of BaseballSoftballUK CEO John Boyd's agenda.Boston fans ask for an autograph from 10\u00d7 All-Star David Ortiz.\"The experience isn't just relying on the atmosphere in the stadium and idea of 'Americana' or hotdogs and crackerjack,\" Boyd told CNN Sport. \"But it is important to get fans to value and appreciate the product on the field for what it is. \"Crudely put, the Yankees vs. Red Sox are notoriously long games. They're also very skilled teams. So there is a potential for it to be a five-and-a-half hour game. \"And if you fill that stadium with the new generation of fans who are only there for the NY logo and looking cool, then will they really be returning fans? And how do we make sure that their experiences are topnotch and appreciative of the sport?\"Team GB's first pitcher to play in the MLB is Michael Roth, who played for the Los Angeles Angels and the Chicago Cubs. Born in Greenville, South Carolina to an American father and an English mother -- Roth admits that baseball \"isn't the most accessible sport for kids and families compared to some of its counterparts.\" Michael Roth was drafted in the 9th round by the Los Angeles Angels.He adds: \"I think baseball as a whole is in an interesting point in its life. Baseball can be a long game with few spurts of action and it has struggled lately to increase its fans in the younger demographic.\"I think baseball will need to come up with new ways to market the game and its players while sticking with the rich tradition.\"New groundIn bringing the Red Sox and the Yankees to London, the MLB has  decided to follow the path previously trodden by the NFL and NBA in showcasing those sports with competitive matches in the UK.The two games will be held in the  London Stadium, the  home of West Ham United.Between them, the Red Sox and Yankees have won 36 World Series, (the Red Sox are the reigning champions), and they represent two of the most highly recognized brands not only in the US, but also in world sport. \"There is no better baseball than when the Red Sox play the Yankees,\" Joshua Mills-Knutsen, co-director of youth baseball at the London Mets -- a baseball team based in Britain's capital -- told CNN Sport. \"I mean that not just from the quality of players, but because of the history and drama that these two teams bring to the field. \"People should be excited they get to see this game in a location that's neither New York nor Boston, and they are. \"People in our club are arranging holidays around the Series, and when people I just met find out I coach baseball, the Series is the first thing they want to talk about. It's a very big deal, and I think the British public understand that and are responding.\"Reconnecting with the historyAlthough baseball is a major sport in the US, its origins lie in Surrey, England, with the first recorded mention of 'bass-ball' being dated to 9th September 1749. MLB hosted a 'Battlegrounds' event featuring baseball superstars and England international cricketers competing in a home run derby in 2017.In an attempt to honor that heritage, BaseballSoftballUK will install a blue plaque -- a permanent sign to link the people of the past with the buildings of the present -- in Walton-on-Thames on July 7 to mark where the first baseball game was ever played. Despite baseball's relatively low profile in the UK, Mills-Knutsen believes that there is a huge untapped market here for the MLB.\"I'm a bit biased, of course, but there's room for baseball in the UK,\" said Mills-Knutsen. \"Because baseball is a fantastic sport that combines intellect and athletics in a unique way.\"I suspect anyone who enjoyed cricket would find common ground with baseball, but what really matters is that the British are generally sports fans. They've taken to the NFL because it's has a great product. \"MLB has a great product too and the more the British get to know it, the more they'll love it.\"Mills-Knutsen has been going to MLB games in San Diego since he was three years old.  But when he moved from Jeffersonville, Indiana to London, he was concerned that his young son wouldn't be able to find a place to play the game.As it turns out, he needn't have worried.\"The longer I'm here, the more I see signs of the sport,\" he said. \"Not only do the Mets host both youth and adult players, but there are quite a few clubs around southern England for us to play. \"More than that, within our youth, you can see what was once mostly expats, is giving way to homegrown British kids taken with the sport. The internet has helped with that of course, and with MLB coming we see excitement stemming from those games as well.\"Getting people involvedAs the development agency for baseball and softball in the United Kingdom, BaseballSoftballUK's key objective is to develop and increase the levels of participation, skill and achievement in the sports.  And having helped found BaseballSoftballUK and join as an inaugural member, Boyd has seen a steady growth in the number of players participating.  Fans watching the home run contest at Hyde Park in 2017.\"There were 10,000 players when we started our new calculation process in 2009,\" Boyd explained. \"We're currently sitting at 25,000 players playing three formats. And within that as well, it's 42% female and it's 14% LGBT which is twice the national average.\" While acknowledging that baseball is still a minority sport in the UK, Boyd says it's become more popular in the UK than sports such as volleyball and fencing. He explained: \"We've been climbing by between 1,500 and 3,500 people year on year and that's just been through our own growth initiative. \"While we haven't set a specific target of success from the London Series because it's quite hard to do so, we have expectations that would climb at a rate that significantly better than our best years yet.\"Liam Carroll has been head coach of Team GB since January 2015, and during that time, has seen a dramatic increase in the popularity of the sport.\"It's grown significantly in terms of MLB fans,\" he said. \"We've always had a hardcore niche fan base but with the growth of MLBTV and MLB's efforts to grow the game, we've seen a lot more fans. \"I think that's evidenced by the social media presence. I think every MLB club now has its own Twitter fan account in the UK and it's been great to see the fans having meet-ups around the country. Then I think there's been growth in participation at the adult level. It's been fascinating to see more and more adult teams pop up.\"Whilst Carroll has lived in the UK for the majority of his life, his family are from Chicago. His dad -- a fanatical Brooklyn Dodgers fan -- introduced Carroll to the sport at the age of four. Like other British baseball players, Carroll went to the US to play college baseball, spending three years in California and then another five coaching in Nevada.\"Many people say that baseball will remain at the mercy of people choosing to play the more traditional British sports,\" reflected Carroll. \"And while I think baseball will always remain a relatively minority sport, I think there's enough people to go around that will choose baseball over cricket or even football.\"Using the NFL as an exampleTickets for the Red Sox and Yankees games in London sold out fast when they were first released with secondary ticket seller StubHub saying that they are the \"best-selling game(s) of the 2019 regular season.\"According to StubHub general manager Jill Krimmel, fans from 44 different states in the US and 27 different countries have already purchased tickets for the MLB London series.The NFL has been playing regular season games in the UK since 2007 and not only has the sport developed a significant following in the UK, British players such as Jay Ajayi and Efe Obada are starting to break through into NFL teams.Jay Ajayi won Super Bowl LII with the Philadelphia Eagles.To further fuel this progress, the NFL has announced their UK based Academy which aims to create a pathway for more international players to play gridiron. Having an icon playing in the MLB would benefit the popularity of baseball in the UK, according to Carroll.\"I think what one of the things that's happened with the NFL is the opportunity to go to college in the States and get a scholarship and even to sign with an NFL team can be a life changing opportunity,\" he explained. \"And that does exist in baseball, but it will be so much easier to tell that story if we have a British player sign a professional contract.\"I think it would absolutely be a game changer if one of our players, whether it's someone who's involved now or someone who's going to pick up a ball and a bat because they see the Games next month, will absolutely do wonders for our sport.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosAnd Boyd echoes Carroll's sentiment in believing something more long-term must come from the London Series to get more British people playing the sport. \"There needs to be a legacy left by these games,\" he said. \"Unlike American football, I think the expectation is there would be some kind of playing outlet left behind by these games, some form of opportunity to take part. \"The need for that is paramount for the Series not just look like a business proposition.\"",

Frederiksen was due to meet Queen Margrethe II of Denmark on Wednesday afternoon in order for her to be formally appointed as Prime Minister. On Thursday Frederiksen was also expected to present the monarch to her new ministers, Reuters reported.A shift to the right on immigrationAfter four years in opposition, the resurgence of the Social Democrats has been credited to Frederiksen tacking left on socio-economic issues -- by promising to boost welfare spending and tackle climate issues -- while shifting right on immigration.Denmark imposes first fine on woman for breaching veil banThis legislation includes a controversial law banning face coverings, a moratorium on accepting a UN refugee resettlement quota, and plans for so-called \"ghetto laws\" targeting disadvantaged areas where more than half the inhabitants originate from non-Western countries.Denmark's election results marked a stunning collapse for the DPP, which swept into second place during the 2015 elections, and was credited with transforming Danish politics with its anti-establishment and anti-immigrant message over the last several decades.\"Many of these popular right voters, who have supported DPP for the last 20 years, are turning their backs on them,\" Kasper M. Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CNN earlier in June, referring to the voters flocking to the Social Democrats or to a new crop of smaller far-right parties.\"What we are witnessing here is a really interesting experiment for European center-left parties,\" Madsen added.CNN's Tara John and Arnaud Siad contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Australians' trust in China has hit a 15-year record low despite the two country's growing demographic and economic ties, a new report by an Australian think tank has found.But more Australians still trust Chinese President Xi Jinping than his US counterpart, President Donald Trump.The 2019 Lowy Institute Poll, which measures Australians' attitude to other countries, found that only 32% of those surveyed said they trusted China either a \"great deal\" or \"somewhat\" to act responsibly in the world.It was a massive 20-point drop on the results of the 2018 survey, as a trade war ratchets up between China and the US, a close Australian ally.Lowy Institute research fellow Natasha Kassam said the survey showed a \"rapidly declining trust in China and Xi Jinping,\" which she attributed to cooling relations between Beijing and Canberra.Read More\"Over the past two years in Australia, there has been a fierce debate about potential Chinese interference in Australian politics and economic coercion,\" she said.Australian Governor General Peter Cosgrove (R) stands with President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in Canberra on November 17, 2014.Diplomatic relations between China and Australia began to sour after Canberra announced new legislation in December 2017 designed to crack down on foreign interference in the country's politics.Beijing saw the legislation as directed squarely at them and the two country's relationship deteriorated.Australians' increasingly negative view of China could also be rooted in concerns about Chinese strategic ambitions in the region, Kassam said, including regional infrastructure funding and the South China Sea.\"Chinese involvement in the South China Sea is covered heavily in Australian media,\" she said.Economically, Kassam said the survey showed Australians were feeling \"increasing vulnerability\" about China's economic rise, despite Beijing being Australia's largest trading partner.According to the report, 74% of Australians believe that their country is \"too economically dependent on China\", while 68% said Australia allows \"too much investment from China\".Australian helicopters targeted by lasers in South China Sea Kassam said the uncertainty was partly due to the trade war and concern about how it would affect Australia. \"Australians have no confidence that Australia's economic interests will be protected in this conflict,'' she said.However despite cooling sentiment towards China, Australians still expressed more trust in the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, than in US President Trump. The Lowy Institute survey found that 30% of Australians reported that they have \"some\" or \"a lot\" of confidence in President Xi Jinping to do the right thing in world affairs.In comparison, President Trump gained the trust of just 25% of Australians -- a five point drop from 2018. Trump's trust levels only just topped the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un.  Two-thirds of those surveyed believing that President Trump weakened the US-Australian alliance.\"The US's policy of strategic ambiguity leaves Australians feeling vulnerable\", Kassam told CNN.But although Australians cast doubt on the US leadership, about 70% still believed the alliance with Washington was either very or fairly important for their nation's security, the report says.\"The US-Australia alliance is a part of Australia's DNA,'' Kassam said.",

US captain Megan Rapinoe expects it to be a \"wild and crazy\" ride so strap in and enjoy the show. These are the teams still vying to get their hands on the trophy in Lyon on July 7 -- a record seven of which are European. Quarterfinal 1 -- Norway vs England (Thursday)Norway reached the last eight after ousting Australia in a pulsating encounter that was eventually decided by penalties, and Martin Sj\u00f6gren's side proved unflappable, dispatching four spot kicks to Australia's one. Read MoreREAD: Megan Rapinoe says she's 'not going to the f*g White House'Without Ada Hegerberg, the world's best player who is abstaining from international duty over a disagreement with the country's football federation, Norway has battled hard through its first four matches, and to good effect. The group stages saw victories over South Korea and Nigeria and a narrow defeat to host France.Caroline Graham Hansen has led the attack, while the country's all-time record goal scorer Isabell Herlovsen has found the net twice so far this tournament. Having crashed out of Euro 2017 with no points and no goals, Norway appears to have rediscovered its big tournament groove in France.

A heated round of 16 game against Cameroon had no shortage of controversy. England's opponent made clear its views on the video assistant referee's interference by staging on-field protests, while defenders Steph Houghton and Millie Bright are \"major doubts\" for the match. Houghton is battling to recover from an injury suffered towards the end of the last-16 game, while Bright has a bug which manager Phil Neville said was \"going through the camp a little bit.\"England is favorite to beat Norway in Le Havre on Thursday, but there's no let-up for whichever side prevails -- France or the US will lie waiting in the semifinals.

Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosWith five goals, Morgan is currently the joint-top scorer at the Women's World Cup. A further penalty from Megan Rapinoe, however, ensured that the world's top-ranked side progressed to the quarterfinals, as has been the case at every previous edition of the tournament. Never, in fact, has the US finished lower than third.\n\n\n\n\nCould France be about to tarnish that record?\"This is the game everyone had circled,\" said Rapinoe of the prospect of facing the host. \"This is incredible for the women's game. You have two heavy-hitters meeting ... I hope it's wild and crazy. I hope the fans are crazy, there is tons of media around it and it is just a big spectacle.\"France's campaign began in ruthless style with a 4-0 thumping of South Korea, but it hasn't been plain sailing since then. Corinne Diacre's side has been the beneficiary of several VAR decisions -- including a contentious penalty retake against Nigeria -- and needed extra time to see off Brazil in the round of 16. Les Bleues have, however, been profitable in front of goal. Only the US has scored more so far this tournament, and the Americans showed against Spain that their backline can be breached. Head coach Diacre maintained that fans are yet to see the best from the home side.\"I know my players inside-out, I know they weren't at 100 percent [against Brazil], but the target is to hit that 100 percent for the next game,\" she told reporters. Quarterfinal 4 -- Italy vs Netherlands (Saturday)Italy's players celebrate reaching the quarterfinals. The first time the country has done so since 1991. Italy, competing at a Women's World Cup for the first time in 20 years, is regarded as the competition's dark horses and with good reason. For years an afterthought in a country where men's football is treated like a religion -- the men are four-time World Cup winners -- the form of Italy's women has been impossible to ignore. Le Azzurre topped a group which contained Australia and Brazil -- two teams ranked inside the world's top 10 -- and disposed of former finalist China in the last 16 to equal its best performance in the tournament.Both the defense and attack is strong. Two Italians, Aurora Galli and Cristiana Girelli, have scored three goals, while the rearguard has conceded only twice. Italy coach Milena Bertolini put her players' performances down to talent and one further reason. \"They have a mission. Their mission is to try and have the Italian public to discover and appreciate the women's game,\" she told reporters after victory over China. \"I really believe this side has allowed the women's game to break new ground back home. We can see that from the viewing figures, what we see in the press and from the messages we receive from back home.\"The Netherlands, the last team to qualify for the quarterfinals, needed a 90th-minute penalty to see off Japan in a tense 2-1 win to reach the last eight for the first time. The country's previous best performance in the tournament was reaching the last 16 in 2015 on its World Cup debut, falling to defeat by eventual finalist Japan. The Dutch were holding on for much of the final 20 minutes of Tuesday's last-16 tie, but as reigning European Champion the world's eighth-ranked team is the favorite to prevail.  READ: The match that changed women's footballThe Netherlands became the seventh European country to qualify for the last eight. Quarterfinal 3 -- Germany vs Sweden (Saturday) With most of the limelight so far being shone on a free-scoring US side, Germany has gone about its business with quiet efficiency in France. The only side yet to concede a goal, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg's team has slowly grown into the tournament, scoring seven of its nine goals in the past two games, against South Africa and Nigeria. Star player Sara Daebritz, who next season will complete a high-profile move from Bayern Munich to Paris Saint-Germain, has been lively going forward in this German side contesting its eighth consecutive World Cup quarterfinal. \"We've played four very tough match in very difficult conditions ... we've dealt with all that very well,\" Voss-Tecklenburg told reporters after defeat of Nigeria. \"I'm very happy that we now have one week to relax and prepare for the quarterfinals. Part of that will be working on improving our performance in certain phases of the match, gaining more ground, becoming more confident and not allowing ourselves to get frustrated by small details.\"Sweden's Lindahl produced a brilliant penalty save in the last 16 against Canada. The good news for Germany is that star playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan is nearing a return to injury and likely to feature in the quarterfinal against Sweden. As for Sweden, which reached the final eight after a tight victory over Canada, success against Germany would be its fourth semifinal appearance. If penalties are needed to decide matches later in the tournament, then Sweden has one of the best in the business in Hedvig Lindahl. Her superb save against Janine Beckie was pivotal in taking Sweden to the quarterfinals, and with VAR awarding an abundance of spot kicks at this World Cup, there's a strong chance Lindahl could be called upon again. The winner in Rennes will face either Italy or the Netherlands on the all-European side of the draw.",

The jet, which is just over 51 feet (15.5 meters) long with a wingspan of 35 feet, flew alongside Typhoon aircraft over the skies of Iraq and Syria on Sunday, \"as part of the ongoing fight against Daesh,\" the UK Ministry of Defense confirmed. The operational debut follows Exercise Lightning Dawn, which saw the jets build up their capability as part of a training exercise in Cyprus. After what the Ministry of Defense describes on the government's website as the \"exceptional performance of the aircraft, pilots and support staff\" during training, the planes left for action from the Akrotiri Royal Air Force (RAF) base in Cyprus.

        "content": "(CNN)Scientists have discovered a new type of plastic pollution -- \"plasticrusts\" -- a layer of plastic encrusted onto ocean rocks. Researchers from the Marine and Environmental Sciences Centre first observed the plastic patches on the Portuguese island of Madeira in 2016. \"We discovered the plasticrusts for the first time in 2016. At that moment, we were already quite surprised and concerned about the phenomenon,\" marine ecologist Ignacio Gestoso Garc\u00eda told CNN. \"We revisited the same study site some more times during 2017 and 2018,\" he said. \"Earlier this year we noticed that these plasticrusts were more abundant and have therefore initiated a more rigorous monitoring of the phenomenon.\"Researchers have discovered 'plasticrusts' -- a layer of plastic encrusted onto rocks on the coast of Madeira. After sampling rocks along the coastline, researchers found that by 2019 the crusts now covered 9.46% of the rocky surface. Read MoreTests revealed that the crusts were made of polyethylene -- one of the most commonly used types of plastic, used in plastic packaging, construction materials and medical devices. How not to trash the planet at a music festivalIn a paper, which was published in the Science of The Total Environment journal, researchers concluded the plastic pollution could have come from a number of sources, including fishing and tourism. \"We are convinced this is not a case exclusive of Madeira, and most likely this new phenomenon will be reported in other global regions. However, we would like to remake that for now, plasticrusts are confined to a particular site of the island and future surveys need to be conducted to evaluate and quantify the relevance of plasticrusts,\" Garc\u00eda added. Scientists warned that the potential impact of these new plasticrusts was still relatively unknown, but had the potential to affect the island's animals.Researchers thought that the plasticrusts were \"very unlikely\" to have an impact on human health. \"Future studies should focus on evaluating whether marine invertebrates cohabiting in the same habitat where plasticrusts are present, can assimilate plastics -- and if that's the case, whether these plastics can have implications for the health of these animals,\" Garcia said. \"Plastic debris is one of the most extensive pollution problems our planet is facing today and a particular concern for marine environment conservation,\" the study said. The researchers first noticed the crusts in 2016.Richard Thompson, a professor of marine biology who was not involved with the study, said \"Whatever their background -- the plastic industry, policymakers or members of the public -- people are agreed: There is too much plastic in the oceans and we need to do something about it.\"At the moment, most of the cost of the waste plastic is not borne by the plastics producers, it is born by local authorities,\" Thompson said. \"Or the cost is borne by the environment.\"India's trash mountains are a fetid symbol of the country's plastic problem\"We need to make sure that that cost of the plastic waste is internalized and is borne by the people that are making the plastic items. Until the cost is brought to bear at the origins and the design stage of the plastic, we will continue to see this problem because there is no incentive at the moment on the industry to design things with responsibility in mind,\" Thompson added. \"Plastics have great potential to bring societal benefit, but we need to accept the true cost rather than just the cost of production.\"",

By the time they took their leave, only the sound of Australian celebrations remained after an emphatic 64-run victory over England secured a place in the semifinals of the Cricket World Cup.Australia's Steve Smith was booed and jeered by England supporters at Lord's.Facing arch rival England for the first time since returning from a 12-month ban for ball tampering, both men walked out to boos and jeers, though the most forceful were reserved for Smith. Not that the extra attention from the crowd appeared to bother either man. Warner hit 53 to become the leading run scorer in the tournament, while Smith, whose dismissal was celebrated with a huge amount of glee by those in the stands, battled to 38.Read MoreBoth men played their part in Australia reaching 285-7 from its 50 overs before helping to skittle England out for 221.READ: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says Viv RichardsAustralia's David Warner received some sledging from the home supporters.For England, yet more frustration. A third defeat in seven group games leaves its participation in the final four of the 2019 Cricket World Cup in severe jeopardy.It must now defeat either India or New Zealand, both unbeaten in the tournament so far, to ensure it does not suffer a similar fate to the last time it hosted the tournament in 1999 when it crashed out at the group stage.As so often in an international competition, the ability to peak at the right time is crucial. For England, so dominant in one-day cricket over the past few years, it appears that peak is now fading out of view.Already under pressure following two disappointing defeats by Pakistan and Sri Lanka, England was up against it from the start as Australia made a fast start at Lord's.Aaron Finch, the Australian captain, struck a century and his opening partnership of 123 with Warner allowed the visiting side to take control of the contest.READ: Why India vs Pakistan is the 'biggest game in world sport'JUST WATCHEDCricket legend Viv Richards on the 2019 CWCReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCricket legend Viv Richards on the 2019 CWC 02:54England, victorious in 10 of its past 12 one-day games against Australia, appeared rattled.

Sri Lanka, two points behind but with a game in hand, will also fancy its chances of gatecrashing the semifinals. What was unthinkable only weeks ago -- that the top-ranked host nation could not make the final four -- is now becoming a more realistic possibility.And if that happens, you can bet you'll hear some boos.",

He coached four teams over his 30-year career, but he was best known for his time with Golden State, where he won 422 games. Nelson is largely credited with building the groundwork for the modern dominance of the Warriors, including drafting Stephen Curry in 2009.His imprint on how the game is played today is felt elsewhere, too. He was the first coach to give a 7-footer the greenlight to shoot from three-point range. He was the first to introduce the concept of sacrificing height for pace-and-space small-ball basketball -- notably with the \"Run TMC\" trio of Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin -- that now dominates the NBA.And he just might be the first retired NBA coach to grow his own marijuana.",

The previous record stood at 38.5 Celsius (101.3 Fahrenheit), which was measured in 1947 in B\u00fchlertal, which lies close to France. The longevity of the previous record -- 72 years -- shows just how unusual and intense the current heat wave is in Europe. Any sign of quick relief is not on cards either.

Hot air from Africa is bringing a heat wave to Europe.A new June temperature record was also set in neighboring Poland, where meteorologists measured 38.2 Celsius.While 100 degrees Fahrenheit might not sound like an exceptionally hot weather to some, such temperatures are far above average across central and western Europe.Human-induced climate change makes heatwaves 30 times more likely\"When summer temperatures are routinely in the 70s, like in northern Europe or the West Coast of the US, many places do not have air conditioning. This can turn deadly fast if heat waves strike and last for several days,\" CNN senior meteorologist Brandon Miller said.National weather authorities in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland have issued heat warnings, advising people to avoid strenuous activities at midday and in the afternoon, drink plenty of water and stay out of the sun.

(CNN)The winner of Istanbul's mayoral election re-run has issued a thinly veiled warning to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to respect democracy, and that whoever \"decides not to serve the people and prioritizes their political future\" will be exposed.JUST WATCHEDWatch the full interview with ImamogluReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch the full interview with Imamoglu 09:06Speaking exclusively to CNN's Christiane Amanpour, days after his decisive nine-point victory over Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu said the race was  an \"extraordinary test\" of Turkey's democratic tradition. \"June 23rd showed us that no one, no individual or power, can stand in the way of the will of the people, no politician has the luxury to ignore that fact,\" said Imamoglu, who dealt Erdogan's ruling party a humbling defeat on Sunday. \"That is not a threat. It is how things should be.\"I hold the view that we have passed that test successfully,\" he said of his win, which was seen as a damning indictment of AKP's long reign by Istanbul residents, many of whom blame Erdogan for the economic crisis, double-digit unemployment and Turkey's plummeting currency, the lira.Imamoglu, who emerged from relative obscurity to become the star of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), had to run twice after AKP challenged the outcome of the first vote in April claiming fraud.Read MoreSunday's victory saw how \"the people of Istanbul demonstrated the legitimacy of the election and the election was protected. No one will be able to interfere with elections to such an extent again,\" he said.Celebrations lasted into the night at Kadikoy in Istanbul after results came in from the election re-run.'Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey'Erdogan has cast a long shadow over Turkish politics during more than a quarter-century in politics. He has consolidated power in his person to what many say is the detriment of Turkish democracy, but his legitimacy is based on his uncanny ability to win elections.The President was not a candidate in this election, but the loss is still personal. Istanbul is his birthplace and the city where he launched his political career -- often saying \"whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey.\" The city has become a concentrated source of wealth and power for Erdogan's party, oiling the rest of Turkey's political machine. Losing control of it means losing funds and resources that subsidize pro-government media, businesses, contractors and the AKP apparatus at large.Erdogan's catchphrase is something Imamoglu has no time for. \"What I am interested in is serving Istanbul successfully, and ensure that Istanbul wins in return.\" When asked whether he would be investigating the alleged cronyism and corruption from AKP officials, Imamoglu said his first business as mayor will be tackling allegations of municipal corruption to the \"the scrutiny of auditing companies with international experience.\"The 49-year-old did not think the allegations referred to \"Erdogan as an individual,\" but added \"they may relate to his party or to the administrators of his party. How the process would progress is a matter for the judiciary, not my personal responsibility, of course.\"Erdogan congratulated the new mayor on his win in a Twitter post Sunday, saying \"the national will has appeared once again today. I congratulate Ekrem Imamoglu, who has won the election, according to unofficial results.\"Imamoglu hopes Erdogan will shrug off the loss of Istanbul. \"I do not believe Mr. Erdogan would continue to hold political gain as his priority after this juncture. Extending the hand for peace would be to the benefit of the country.\"",

A fan at Dodger Stadium was struck in the head by a foul ball off the bat of the Dodgers' Cody Bellinger in the first inning of Los Angeles' game against the Colorado Rockies.The female, who was sitting just beyond the protective netting that extends to the end of the dugouts, initially stayed in her seat and was given an ice pack. She later was taken to a hospital for precautionary tests, according to the Los Angeles Times.\"I saw it literally hit her face,'' Bellinger said. \"It was tough.\"Bellinger -- who was visibly upset during the at-bat -- said he went to check on her between innings.Read More\"I went over the next half-inning just to make sure,\" he said. \"She said she was alright and gave me a thumbs-up. Obviously, it was a scary situation.\"Dodgers' team President and CEO Stan Kasten told the Orange County Register plans will be announced in the next few weeks.\"Fan safety is of the utmost importance to the Dodgers and during the offseason, we began the process of studying how the netting at Dodger Stadium could be configured to provide better protection for our fans,\" the Los Angeles Dodgers said in a statement issued Monday. \"Once this study is completed, the team will implement the recommended changes and extend the netting at Dodger Stadium. The team will provide more information on the project timeline and scope when available.\"Recently, the White Sox and Nationals announced they will also be extending the netting down to the foul poles. This comes after a series of incidents involving fans around the league being struck by foul balls, most notably at the Houston Astros game last month.A sharply hit foul ball struck a girl during the Houston Astros' game against the Chicago Cubs, prompting calls for increased safety measures at ballparks. The girl was hospitalized; her family earlier this month requested privacy.The same day the girl was hit in Houston, a fan was struck by a foul ball at Dodger Stadium along the first-base line in a game against the New York Mets. TV footage showed the fan, a man, dabbing a red spot on his head with a napkin, remaining in his seat as he talked to people near him.On June 10, when the White Sox were hosting the Washington Nationals, a female fan was struck by a foul ball during an at-bat by Chicago outfielder Eloy Jimenez in the bottom of the fourth inning. The White Sox said the fan was conscious and coherent when transported from the ballpark to a hospital, where she was later released.Last year, Major League Baseball announced that all 30 ballparks were extending protective netting to at least the far ends of both dugouts -- that is, the ends farthest from home plate -- intending to enhance fans' safety. Some franchises go beyond those dimensions.CNN's Martijn Edelman contributed to this report.",

The coastguard sent rescue boat Salvamar Acrux to the yacht's position, which was a few mile southwest of Mallorca's Port Adriano, Chicon said. Since the yacht's crew had already put down the fire, the rescue boat decided to tow the boat to Port Adriano. \"We called the firemen on shore, so they were prepared to assist in case there were other problems with the fire,\" he said. At one point during the towing, smoke was coming up from the engine room, so the crew was evacuated aboard the rescue ship, Chicon added.No medical assistance was needed for the yacht's occupants, he said.Klitschko, 43, retired after winning 64 of his 69 fights and retaining his heavyweight title for over nine years. His last match, in April 2017, was a knockout defeat by Anthony Joshua.",

Now, the 23-year-old Australian is bidding to become the first Australian women to win Wimbledon since her idol and mentor Evonne Goolagong Cawley won her second title in 1980.\"Evonne has been an incredible champion of our sport, she is the most genuine human being you'll ever meet and even to be mentioned in the same conversation with her is a little bit mind-boggling to me,\" said Barty, who is only the second Australian woman to occupy the No. 1 ranking and first since Goolagong Cawley in 1976.Read More\"She has been an inspiration of mine, a mentor of mine, and a friend of mine, and anything that even goes close to what she achieved in her career would be unbelievable.\"READ: Rafael Nadal ready to conquer Wimbledon againREAD: Naomi Osaka can win 10 grand slams, says Li Na Ashleigh Barty clinched the French Open title in Paris in June 2019. Love of grassBarty's 6-1 6-3 victory over Czech teen Marketa Vondrousova in Paris made her the first  Australian to win the French Open since Margaret Court in 1973.But completing the French Open-Wimbledon double is one of the toughest feats to achieve in tennis, as players have to make the transition from the high-bouncing clay to the low-bouncing grass. The last player to win back-to-back titles at Roland Garros and Wimbledon was Serena Williams in 2015.However, Barty has form on the grass, as a junior Wimbledon champion at the age of 15 and a losing doubles finalist in 2013. \"I've never found the change from clay to grass too difficult,\" said Barty, whose victory in a grass-court event in Birmingham, England Sunday took her to world No.1. \"I love the grass-court season, and I feel very comfortable on the grass court.\"She's confident she can go beyond the third round in the main singles draw for the first time in her career. \"It's a slam that I've had incredible success in through the juniors and through doubles,\" she said. \"I would love to try and make a little bit of my own history, and do well in singles.\"Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosAshleigh Barty poses with the WTA world No.1 trophy.'Finding myself'In the past three weeks, Barty's unusual path to tennis glory has captured the imagination of the international sporting world.

Suffering from burn out and the weight of expectation, the young Australian walked away from tennis in 2014. The following year, she joined the Brisbane Heat women's cricket team in Australia for the inaugural 2015-16 Women's Big Bash League. Although she was an outstanding player, she missed the competitive nature of tennis. After 14 months away, Barty returned to the women's tour in 2016, with a ranking of No. 623.The break gave her a new lease of life. \"I am almost certain that I wouldn't be playing [now], if I am being honest,\" Barty said. \"I needed to take that time away just to refresh and kind of find myself.

In 2019 its CO2 emission total for business travel was 3,344 tonnes, compared to 1,687 tonnes in 2018.The family's overall greenhouse gas emissions grew by 3% to 8,393 tonnes, with the travel increase offset by a 22% reduction in output from heating, lighting and vehicles, the financial statement noted.\"Total greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3% overall, due to the in-year impact of foreign business travel outweighing the reduction from heating and lighting,\" it read.Meghan and Harry spent \u00a32.4m of taxpayers' money on new homeRead MoreThe statement said the travel emissions were higher \"due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel.\"It added that compared to just one overseas trip in 2017-18, which involved a large fixed wing aircraft, the royal family took part in five in 2018-19. Most journeys were carried out by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who visited the Caribbean, Africa and Europe on behalf of the Queen, the report said.Charles has long used his position to warn about the effects of climate change and to campaign on a variety of environmental issues.

        "content": "(CNN)Football can be cruel, and Japan was at the receiving end of perhaps the cruelest blow the game can offer. It was ultimately a 90th minute penalty in Rennes that handed the Netherlands a 2-1 win and its first ever Women's World Cup quarterfinal, sending 2015's finalist home in heartbreaking fashion.The result means that seven European countries will take up the eight quarterfinal slots in France after Italy -- the Netherlands' next opponent on Saturday -- defeated China 2-0 to reach its first quarterfinal since 1991.Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor much of the second half, it seemed like Japan would produce the game's winning goal with the match evenly poised at 1-1. But a rare Dutch foray into the Japanese box drew a handball from Saki Kumagai and with less than a minute left on the clock, Lieke Martens delivered the killer touch. \"It was so close and during the second half they were very, very attacking and created a couple of really nice opportunities to score,\" Dutch head coach Sarina Wiegman told reporters after the match.Read More\"We were standing in a circle after the match and we were obviously so happy. We were yelling at each other and saying okay, let's just continue writing history. For the first time we've got to this stage of a World Cup and all the players use this mantra.\"Martens celebrates opening the scoring.Martens had given the European champion the lead after just 16 minutes with a deft flick from a corner, but Japan, which has taken time to grow into this World Cup, soon began to find its feet and produced an equalizer just before halftime.A well-weighted through ball from Mana Iwabuchi found Yui Hasegawa in space in the Dutch box, and the forward coolly finished over the head of Sari Van Veenendaal. READ: World Cup stars record their journeys to FranceBuoyed by the goal, Nadeshiko played with greater energy for much of the second half, their fast interplay causing Netherlands -- who fell to Japan at this stage in 2015 -- plenty of problems at the back. Hasegawa, Hina Sugita and substitute Yuka Momiki all came close, but it was the Oranje that ultimately sealed the match as Martens dispatched her second goal from the spot. \"We created many chances. However, we just couldn't capitalize and towards the end we [made a] crisis for ourselves,\" Japan coach Asako Takakura told reporters after the game. \"But now we have VAR, sometimes cruel decisions have been made watching other matches and it happened to us towards the end of this match. We have to look forward and we have to accept the decision.\"Martens prepares to take her spot kick in Rennes.Italy -- World Cup dark horses?It's been a record breaking year for Europe's World Cup participants and Italy had set the trend earlier on Tuesday by defeating China in Montpellier, equaling its best ever performance in the tournament.The Italians are regarded as the competition's dark horses and with good reason. Though competing at the Women's World Cup for the first time in 20 years -- and having made it through to the last 16 for the first time since 1991 -- Italy has impressed in France. For years an afterthought in a country where men's football is treated like a religion -- the men are four-time World Cup winners -- the form of Italy's women has been impossible to ignore. Le Azzurre topped a group which contained Australia and Brazil -- two teams ranked inside the world's top 10 -- and has now disposed of former finalist China. \n\n\n\n\nAfter the match, Italy coach Milena Bertolini told reporters: \"This squad is made up of girls who have a lot of quality. They are good footballers and they're performing well here because of that. But there's a further aspect. They have a mission. Their mission is to try and have the Italian public to discover and appreciate the women's game. \"This aspect helps you because it allows you to find that extra energy and motivation. I really believe this side has allowed the women's game to break new ground back home. We can see that from the viewing figures, what we see in the press and from the messages we receive from back home.\"The Italians started brightly with Valentina Giancinti, the highest scorer in Italy's top division last season, particularly impressing on a summery evening in Montpellier. She had one effort disallowed for offside and took another aim at distance before eventually finding the back of the net, pouncing from close range after goalkeeper Peng Shimeng Elisa Bartoli's shot into the striker's path. Giacinti (C) was the top scorer in last season's Serie A. China, which has only once failed to progress to the last eight prior to this match, grew into the match as the first half progressed. Wang Yan forced a fine save from Laura Giuliani while the Steel Roses also hit the woodwork before the break, though replays showed a goal would have been disallowed for offside. But in the 49th minute substitute Aurora Galli doubled the advantage with a shot from the edge of the box, her fourth goal in five appearances, to secure a meeting with either the Netherlands or Japan. China edged possession and completed nearly double the number of passes than its opponent but again scoring proved to be a problem -- the Steel Roses only found the net once in France.",

Co-op has pledged to no longer sell \"hard to recycle\" own brand plastic packaging and products by 2023. The festival has a purpose-built recycling center to process litter from its 135,000 guests. Breige Donaghy, food director at Co-op, said: \"It's a priority to find new ways to reduce plastic packaging. We've successfully unveiled compostable carrier bags but it's difficult to replace plastic packaging for sandwiches and keep the product fresh. These sandwiches have two days shelf life from the moment they are made and we have to deliver directly to the store.\" Read MoreGlastonbury was an ideal setting to test the new technology, Donaghy added.Glastonbury Festival bans single-use plastic bottles In February, Glastonbury announced a ban on the sale of single-use plastic bottles. Headlined by Stormzy, The Killers and The Cure, this year's festival will also prohibit single-use bottles in the backstage, dressing room, catering and production areas. Co-organizer Emily Eavis said in a statement, \"It's paramount for our planet that we all reduce our plastic consumption, and I'm thrilled that, together, we'll be able to prevent over a million single-use plastic bottles from being used at this year's festival.\"Amid growing worldwide concern over plastic pollution, the UK government has joined a number of others in announcing bans on some single-use plastics. Its prohibition of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds will go into effect in April 2020, while the EU parliament has voted to implement a bloc-wide ban on plastic cutlery, cotton buds, straws and stirrers from 2021.Environmental organisations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have called for a global ban on all single-use plastics by 2025.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Five years into a knife-crime crisis, Britain is still scrambling for solutions.Few weekends pass without reports of violence in the country, while flowers laid on London street corners serve as a near-daily reminder of its results.The latest outbreak saw two teenagers die moments apart from each other on a bloody Friday night in the capital. And while London is the worst-affected region, the problem is a national one; police recorded a total of 40,577 offenses involving a knife or sharp instrument last year -- 10,000 more than in 2011 -- while knife offenses have risen for five consecutive years.The issue has turned into a political football; it frequently captures the attention of US President Donald Trump, who blames London's Mayor Sadiq Khan for violence in the city. Khan, for his part, points the finger at police cuts mandated by the Conservative government, while outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May has vehemently denied suggestions that her cutbacks are to blame.Read MoreKnives and gangs: What's driving Britain's broken boys to crime?But as the problem gets worse, lawmakers and officials have tangled themselves in a patchwork of short-lived policies and hastily proposed approaches.Earlier this month, a regional police force was ridiculed for issuing knives with blunt edges to domestic violence victims, believing it could reduce the risk of attacks within the home.Scott Mann, a Conservative MP, suffered a similar fate in March when he called for every knife sold in the UK to be fitted with a GPS tracker.The Children's Commissioner, Anne Longfield, floated keeping schools open in the evenings and at weekends to prevent attacks, which have been linked in frequency to closing times -- but observers questioned how such a plan could work, with numerous schools across the UK already struggling to keep up amid funding cuts.Even supermarkets have joined in the search for a solution, with some, including Asda, refusing to sell individual knives in a bid to prevent them being used for violence.Forensic police officers investigate after a 23-year-old man was fatally stabbed in London in February.A plan to track offenders when they leave prison is also being tested in London, while the Home Office announced in January that children as young as 12 could be hit with social media bans or curfews to prevent them joining gangs. But despite all the efforts, knife crime continues to rise. And for those who understand the effect of violence first-hand, the attempts are doomed to fail.'The solution is in the people doing this'\"They're missing the point,\" said Patsy McKie, founding member of campaigning group Mothers Against Violence, of the various fixes put forward  by politicians and authorities. \"They don't know any better, so they're trying some things out ... but we have to look at things from a different perspective.\"McKie knows the effects of violence more than most; her son, Dorrie, was shot dead in Manchester in 1999. \"The pain I felt for my son, he was part of me and then ripped away from me -- even now it's unexplainable,\" she tells CNN. \"I don't think there's words to explain that.\"How London's homicide rate stacks up against major US citiesBut McKie has turned her pain into action, meeting schoolchildren and prisoners who have become involved with knife crime -- and she believes policymakers should do the same.\"I believe the solution is in the people who actually are doing this,\" she said. \"Sometimes they don't even realize why they have done it ... until you get deeper with them.\"\"But because of my openness and my answers to their questions, they started unloading,\" she said. \"I just go in and I'll listen.\"McKie has noticed a number of similarities in the backgrounds of young people involved in crime -- unstable home lives, fear of peers carrying knives, drug use, a desire to allievate pain -- that she feels should be informing top-down approaches.\"They don't really talk to the young people enough,\" she said, adding: \"would they listen?\"Police cuts leading to quick-fix approach?Nottinghamshire's approach to domestic knife crime was met with widespread disbelief earlier this month.Police in the county, which has struggled to shake a reputation as a hot-spot for violence, issued blunt knives to domestic violence victims -- a move panned on social media and covered with derision in international publications including the New York Times.The knives issued to domestic violence victims by Nottinghamshire Police.But for many within policing, such left-field efforts are an inevitable symptom of a far wider problem.\"We need investment, and I'm talking billions,\" said John Apter, National Chair of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. He went on to criticize the \"devastating cuts\" that have come to define the program of austerity pursued by Conservative-led governments since 2010. \"We are struggling to answer 999 calls, let alone investigate crimes,\" Apter told CNN. \"We do the best we can with the little we've got -- which is why we see some initiatives which are little more than papering over the cracks.\" That program of cuts to policing numbers was spearheaded by Theresa May, who served as home secretary (interior minister) before she became Prime Minister, and has frequently sparred with Apter's federation over the issue. May will leave office next month, after being ousted by her party over her failure to take the UK out of the European Union.Four graphics that help explain Britain's knife crime crisisBut the course she followed, in Apter's view, has sparked a culture in which authorities and politicians are forced to reach for radical short-term solutions -- some of which are ridiculed as soon as they're implemented.\"The legacy that the Prime Minister leaves on policing and violent crime is nothing to be proud of at all,\" he said. \"She has left a broken police service.\"\"There are some really good people in politics who want to do the right thing. Theresa May is not one of those people,\" Apter adds. \"I think the best thing for the country was when (she) announced she was moving on.\"Apter is not alone in blaming cutbacks for the problem: opposition lawmakers, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, have been similarly scathing in their views. \"We cannot hide from the fact that efforts to tackle violence have been made much more difficult by the government's devastating cuts to the police and youth services, local councils and charities across our city. Cuts have consequences,\" a spokesperson for Khan's office told CNN.     When CNN approached Downing Street for comment, it pointed to May's previous statements on the issue. On May 1, in response to questions in parliament by Corbyn, the Prime Minister said on the whole \"crime is down by a third\" adding that around \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) \"more money (was made) available to the police this year.\"\"Police and crime commissioners plan to recruit 3,000 more police officers. But, to tackle knife crime and serious violence -- yes, we are concerned about it, which is why we brought forward the serious violence strategy,\" she added. \"We also need to deal with drug crime, turn young people away from violence and ensure that the police and others have the powers to do their job.\"But that is easier said than done when funding is under such pressure, according to Patrick Green, CEO of leading anti-knife crime charity the Ben Kinsella Trust.\"If you lose police officers and you lose youth workers and youth centers, you're creating a cocktail for disaster,\" he said. \"We've seen three prime ministers come and go, five home secretaries come and go, two London mayors come and go ... and we still have the same problem.\"\"Nearly every one of those politicians has done something reactive to address the (knife crime) situation, but it's only ever been reactive. We really should be asking, what are the root causes of this,\" he said.The answer could lie close to home.Scotland stemming the tideAs violent crime continues to rise in most of the UK, one part of the country is writing a different narrative.The homicide rate in Scotland is at its lowest since the 1970s. Knives are still the most common instrument used in violent crime -- but just 59 murders were recorded north of the border in the past year, compared to 97 a decade ago.The figures are no accident, Scottish authorities say. They're the result of a sustained, patient approach that dismissed short-term fixes, instead treating knife crime as a public health problem. And for those involved in the project, the reactive approaches taken in England show that a similar attitude needs to be adopted.     \"Are you looking for long-term solutions or are you looking to short-term fixes?\" asked Will Linden, the Co-Deputy Director of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, which has worked since 2005 to reduce rates of knife crime.\"There's a number of things out there -- knife blunting, GPS trackers -- and there's nothing necessarily wrong with that,\" Linden told CNN. \"But where we come from, we ask: why do you feel you had to pick up the kitchen knife in the first place?\"A knife is a tool,\" he said. \"Some people use it to make dinner, other people use it for violence -- and if that didn't work they would use something else.\"So what you have to do is address that behavior -- and that takes a long-term approach,\" he added. England's knife crime epidemic sees 54% rise in young stabbing injuries in 5 yearsThe Scottish strategy borrowed from plans in US cities such as Boston, which have seen a reduction in violence over recent decades. It saw officers talking directly with gang members, included a heavy emphasis on education -- and crucially, it took years before an improvement was noticed. \"These are complicated issues and challenges that we face -- you're never going to fix it first time,\" Linden said.But the results are clear now, and Green is urging British leaders to show a similar patience. \"The Scottish model bucked the trends for a number of reason -- they really embraced the preventive and early intervention model,\" he said.\"We hope that they would take same approach\" in England, he added. \"It shouldn't all be about quick fixes, it has to be about tackling key features that create and drive knife crime.\"\"The next prime minster needs to show leadership, bring all the parties together, and look for a solution to this that goes beyond the short-term fixes -- that looks 10, 20 years ahead,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to stop this immediately.\"",

As the economic crisis hit much of the Western world, foreign investors poured their money into Turkey, looking for high returns from the emerging economy. The election on Sunday was a rerun of a vote from March.But the flow of money started to dry up as the US economy got stronger again. Turkish economic growth flattened, inflation reached double digits and unemployment soared.The struggling economy has turned some residents of Istanbul against AKP. Following a failed military coup attempt in 2016, Erdogan and his government have clamped down on civil liberties across the country, gutted public institutions and universities, heavily restricted the media and ordered mass arrests of activists, journalists and the political opposition.",

        "content": "(CNN)It wasn't easy, and at times there was doubt, but the defending champion United States can look ahead to a mouthwatering quarterfinal clash against host France after a 2-1 win over a resolute Spain. In the United States' toughest challenge at the Women's World Cup so far, two Megan Rapinoe penalties, one in each half, secured progress to the last eight. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt was widely believed that the Americans would not be sternly tested until the quarterfinals, at an anticipated clash in Paris on Friday, but Spain was far from the obliging opponent many had expected. The US' defense wobbled, an attack regarded as the most potent in the competition was stifled, and for much of the match, Spain was the US' equal. So successful was Spain in frustrating the Americans that Jill Ellis' side had to rely on a late -- and much-questioned -- penalty to see off a team competing in the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time. \n\n\n\n\nEllis described the performance as a \"lot of grit, a lot of resolve.\" Read More\"You can have all the tactics in the world, but that essence of self-belief, that's critical, and these players have that,\" she said after the match. \"Spain came out and wanted to physically mix it up. At times, our movement could've been a little better to deal with that, but you want to make sure that you have a person in the middle who can take care of the game and control those situations as well.\"It's part of this level, in terms of the intensity and the physicality of the matches, and I think it will actually get us ready for the next match.\"Rapinoe scores her first penalty of the match. When Spain conceded a fifth-minute penalty -- Maria Leon bringing down Tobin Heath in the box -- it seemed as if the United States would go on to accrue another healthy scoreline, just as it did in the group stages. Ellis' team had qualified for the last 16 having scored 18 goals in three games and not conceded, becoming the first team in World Cup history to qualify for the knockout stages with a +18 goal difference. But before this tournament, questions were raised about the US' defense, and for the first time, it was put through its paces and breached. France, a team with forwards who could cause the Americans a number of problems, will undoubtedly have taken note. In trying to play out from defense, Becky Sauerbrunn lost possession on the edge of her box, and Spain pounced with a delightful finish from Jennifer Hermoso. The defending champion created more chances -- Rapinoe twice missed opportunities to regain the lead -- but so too did Spain, catching out the Americans' high defensive line on a couple of occasions. Spain's ploy of slowing the pace of the game by keeping possession worked until Virginia Torrecilla challenged Rose Lavelle inside the box and the referee, without hesitation, pointed at the spot. Though it appeared to be the slightest of contacts, a VAR check rubber-stamped the decision, and Rapinoe coolly slotted home for her third goal of the competition. Referees and VAR under the microscope in France1999 and the match that changed women's soccer Referee Katalin Kulcsar argues with Spain's defender Leila Ouahabi (2ndL) and Spain's goalkeeper Sandra Panos (R) after giving a penalty kick.In theory, it should have been a far simpler assignment for the US, the most successful country in the competition's history. Spain may be a passionate football nation -- the men won the World Cup in 2010 -- but for the most part, the women's game has been an afterthought.After the 2015 Women's World Cup, the national team players called for the sacking of then-manager Ignacio Quereda, and after 27 years at the helm, Quereda stepped down from his post that summer. Under his successor, Jorge Vilda -- at 37 the youngest coach at the tournament -- much has changed, and the tenacity and talent of the players in only the country's second Women's World Cup was testimony to the improvements made in recent years. After defeat by two-time champion Germany in the group stages, Spain goalkeeper Sandra Panos said her team \"can play with any team in the world,\" and so it proved on a balmy evening in Reims. \"I really feel that we all should be proud of what we did,\" Vilda said after the match. \"I am very proud indeed. In terms of competitiveness, we gave the best team in the world a run for their money. \"It was a great effort on part of all the players. We're going to grow from this defeat, and I'm really sure all the players on the team have ensured their future.\" Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosRapinoe said Spain was a \"bit heavy in the challenge.\"For the US, focus will now turn to Friday for a heavyweight contest many would deem a worthy final. France hasn't always been convincing on home soil in recent weeks, coming through in extra-time against Brazil, but Les Bleues, ranked fourth in the world, undoubtedly have some of the world's finest players at their disposal. \"This is the game that everyone had circled,\" Rapinoe said of the tie. \"It's going to be a great match. I hope it's wild and crazy, I hope the fans are crazy and there's tons of media around it and it's just a big spectacle. \"It's incredible for the women's game. You have two heavy hitters meeting in the knockout round. This is everything you want from these two sides.\"Sweden sets up Germany clashIn Monday's other game, Sweden set up a quarterfinal clash with Germany on Saturday after defeating Canada 1-0 in Paris. After an uninspiring first half, it took 55 minutes for the game's first real chance to emerge when Sweden counterattacked dangerously from its own half. A perfectly weighted pass from Kosovare Asllani found Stina Blackstenius, who finished via a deflection from Shelina Zadorsky to score her first World Cup goal.Stina Blackstenius celebrates scoring against Canada. With Sweden holding a slender advantage, the game sparked into life. Asllani almost turned from hero to villain after a consultation with the video assistant deemed she had handled in the area.Hedvig Lindahl, however, came to her rescue when she produced a stunning save low to her right to keep out Janine Beckie's penalty. Beckie's effort was the 22nd penalty of the tournament, the same number seen in the whole of the previous World Cup in 2015.There was more drama to come -- Sweden was awarded a penalty which was chalked off for an earlier offside, before Desiree Scott cleared a shot from Asllani off the line -- but no more goals as Sweden marched into its seventh quarterfinal.",

        "content": "(CNN)Martin Fuchs kept cool under pressure as he clinched the Cascais leg of the Longines Global Champions Tour  (LGCT) for the world's top show jumpers.The Swiss rider and his horse, Chaplin, won an 11-rider jump-off in a clear round of 37.64 seconds in the vast, grassy arena of the Hip\u00f3dromo Manuel Possolo in Cascais, near Estoril in Portugal. Britain's Ben Maher and Explosion W, the defending overall LGCT champions, finished in second place, while Ireland's Michael Duffy and Mullaghdrin Touch the Stars were third. \"I do love turf,\" Fuchs told LGCT television. \"My horse, Chaplin, is great in the big rings, and he was amazing today again.\"READ: Global Champions Tour 2019 schedule and resultsRead MoreBirthdayIt was Fuchs' second victory of the season following his win in Madrid. He was watched by his family and his mother, who had been celebrating her birthday. \"They made a vacation here, and I hope they are happy to see  my win,\" said Fuchs.Just like on the grass in Madrid last month, Fuchs earned a double victory in the coastal resort of Cascais. Earlier in the day, the Swiss rider teamed up with Maher to win the Global Champions League team event.READ: Jessica Springsteen on the secrets of her successJump-offHaving taken the lead with a clear round in 39.56 seconds as the second rider to go in the jump-off, Irish rider Darragh Kenny and Important de Muze watched five combinations fail to match his achievement. Riding in eighth spot, Maher found another gear aboard Explosion W as they shaved almost 1.5 seconds off Kenny's time in a lightning quick round. Could Maher, who dominated the LGCT last year with four victories, finally score his first win of 2019? Although Ireland's Michael Duffy was faster than Maher at the halfway point, his horse lost momentum in the second part, and they eventually finished in third place at half a second behind the Briton. The 10th rider, Marcus Ehning of Germany, set the fastest time with 36.21 seconds, but his horse dropped a pole.Riding last, Fuchs went for broke, and he kissed his riding hat as he beat his team mate Maher by 0.45 seconds. \"I saw Ben go, so I knew a bit what I had to do,\" said Fuchs. \"I turned very short for the double, and then to the last fence, I could just keep cantering. I think Chaplin is just a very quick horse, and so is Explosion, but today, the luck was on my side.\"With Fuchs already guaranteed a spot, Maher became the ninth rider to qualify for the season-ending GC Prague Playoffs November 21-24, which will see all individual LGCT winners battle it out in the season finale. Although he finished in ninth place in Cascais, Belgian Pieter Devos climbed to the top of the overall rankings with 206 points after nine of 19 LGCT legs. Germany's Daniel Deusser, the previous leader, dropped to second as he wasn't competing in Portugal. Maher, a six-time LGCT winner, moved up into third, with 187 points.

Valkenswaard United, with Ehning and Ireland's Bertram Allen, finished second, with four penalties. Belgian Gregory Wathelet and Ireland's Kenny of the Paris Panthers finished third, also with four penalties, but almost 12 seconds slower than United. \"We have had a great season, we had a few weeks where it didn't go the way we wanted, but we've got momentum now,\" said Maher, who also rode his trusted gelding Explosion W in the team event. \"We tried hard...between last week and this week, hopefully, this is the change in our season.\"         View this post on Instagram           But it was @londonknightsgcl who power to the win at #GCLMadrid \ud83d\ude4c . . . \ud83d\udcf8 @gclofficial / Stefano Grasso \ud83d\udcf8 #gcl #league #horsesofinstagram #showjumper #instagood #madrid #spain #instadaily #wow #action A post shared by  GCL (@gclofficial) on May 19, 2019 at 3:43am PDT The Knights now lead the overall standings with 172 points, two points clear of previous leaders Shanghai Swans and 10 points ahead of Madrid in Motion.The first to go of the four teams on clear after the first round, Maher and Fuchs decided to go for it on the closing day of the competition. \"We both have very good and quick horses,\" said Fuchs, who competed with Chica B Z in the first round and Chaplin in the second round. \"So we were saying, we put the pressure on the other ones, we want to be fast and clear, and it turned out that way.\" A tactical change beforehand had made all the difference. \"I changed the order of the way we went today,\" said Maher, who was more than two seconds slower than his team mate in the second round. \"I thought Explosion, initially, he was overjumping a little bit, so I knew I would perhaps be a little bit slower than Martin today. I took the inside turns, I didn't take too much of a risk. That was a bit the game plan when Martin went second today, we put enough pressure on the other guys to force some mistakes.\" When asked about the team lineup for Monaco, the next stop on the  Global Champions Tour on 29 June, Maher said: \"We will have a little bit of a change up for riders and horses next week,\" before adding: \"You will have to wait for next week.\"",

That's the promise of Istanbul's newly elected mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.His slogan, \"Everything will be great,\" is on everyone's lips in Turkey.Imamoglu's win in the repeat of the mayoral vote invigorates Turkey's fatigued opposition. It breathes new life into a part of the Turkish electorate that had lost all hope of a victory at the ballot box, but still believed in safeguarding the country's democracy.The revote was less about the office of the mayor and more about the question of whether or not the most basic and indisputable part of the democratic process, the ballot box, would survive the tenure of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Not only did it survive, it also sent a very clear message by giving Imamoglu the power over Turkey's financial heart.Supporters of the opposition were celebrating in the streets.Read MoreBut to view his victory only as a win for the opposition overlooks the countless mistakes Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has made in the run-up to the elections. From the get go, the decision to rerun the elections drew widespread criticism. Coupled with a struggling economy, a political system that has in recent years skewed toward one-man rule and allegations of municipal corruption, voters sent a warning to the AKP that it is not invincible.

Istanbul is his birthplace and the city where he launched his political career.Erdogan is fond of saying \"whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey,\" and the city has become a concentrated source of wealth and power for his party, oiling the rest of Turkey's political machine. Losing control of it means losing funds and resources that subsidize pro-government media, businesses, contractors and the AKP apparatus at large.The opposition hopes that in Imamoglu they have found a political charisma to rival Erdogan's. Imamoglu's hopeful campaign messages and his calm and measured demeanor presented voters with an alternative they have not seen in a long time.Crowds of Imamoglu's supporters took to the streets of Istanbul.The opposition in Istanbul is celebrating, but the secondary governing body, the Istanbul city council, is still controlled by the AKP. They will have the ability to block Imamoglu from governing effectively, although in his concession speech AKP's candidate Binali Yildirim pledged his party would work with Imamoglu.This may yet prove to be a challenge to both: Imamoglu may have to navigate a potentially obstinate council and the AKP will have to prove that they can be effective in the opposition.The election result was seen as a vindication for the opposition.In his victory speech Imamoglu told his supporters: \"Of course you will be happy. But being happy does not mean breaking anybody's heart. This is not a victory, this is a new beginning.\"His victory may very well signal a shift in the political dominance President Erdogan and his party have grown accustomed to.",

        "content": "London  (CNN)Boris Johnson, the front-runner in the race to become Britain's next prime minister, was facing mounting calls Sunday to fully explain an incident in which police attended an alleged altercation at the London home he shares with his girlfriend. Johnson ducked repeated questions during a leadership hustings in Birmingham the day before. Questioned by journalist and CNN Talk host Iain Dale, he said: \"I don't think they want hear about that kind of thing,\" prompting applause from party members. \"I think what they want to hear is what my plans are for the country and the party.\"Jeremy Hunt, Johnson's rival for leadership of the Conservative Party, said in a piece for The Times of London on Monday that he was not interested in Johnson's private life, but challenged his opponent to provide an explanation to the public about both his policies and the incident.\"Scrutiny of the candidates matters. One of the strengths of our system is that we scrutinise our politicians with more intelligent ferocity than anywhere in the world,\" Hunt wrote. \"Don't be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.\"Read MoreInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC that while Johnson's private life \"does not concern me,\" he added: \"I think it is always easier to just give an explanation.\"Boris Johnson dodges questions on cocaine and BrexitFormer Conservative Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also told the BBC: \"If you are a candidate to be prime minister and the police have been called to your house -- fairly or unfairly -- the fact is there was a police visit. You don't just say 'no comment.'\"That implies you may have something you don't want to disclose.\"Rifkind, who has hinted he might back Hunt in the race to be the next Conservative leader and by extension the next PM, added: \"It was a lack of judgment to refuse to even make a short comment. All he could have said, quite reasonably, would have been that in all relationships there are occasionally outbursts of anger and disagreement.\"Labour opposition politician Andrew Gwynne said Sunday Johnson was \"completely unsuitable\" to be PM.He told Sky News: \"In one sense, of course, it is a private matter, but when you're running for public office, when you are wanting to be the prime minister of the UK, then these matters are in the public interest.\"But Gwynne added that Johnson's actions as a politician were more important. \"I just think his record throughout his time both as mayor of London -- wasting money on the garden bridge, wasting money on Routemaster buses, wasting money on water cannon that couldn't be used -- through to his disastrous tenure as foreign secretary just renders him completely, I think, unsuitable to be the prime minister of our great country.\"Was there ever a man less suited to be Prime Minister?https://t.co/GnxWGMwrKm\u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) June 21, 2019\n\nLabour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer tweeted the Guardian's initial story about the alleged dispute with the comment, \"Was there ever a man less suited to be Prime Minister?\"Boris Johnson attends the first leadership hustings on Saturday in Birmingham.Johnson evades questionsIn the town hall event in Birmingham, Johnson was asked at least four variations of the question by Dale, who finally suggested Johnson was simply not going to answer the question.\"I think that's pretty obvious,\" the former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer said.The Guardian reported late Friday that a neighbor of Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds had heard an argument from her apartment, knocked on the door, got no response, and called the police.The neighbor, who reportedly recorded the altercation, told the Guardian that Symonds could be heard telling Johnson \"get off me\" and \"get out of my flat.\"And then there were two: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in battle to lead BritainIn the recording, Symonds said Johnson had ruined her sofa with red wine. \"You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt. You have no care for money or anything,\" she said according to the Guardian. Johnson was also heard saying \"get off my f*ing laptop\" before a loud crashing noise, the paper reported.The Metropolitan Police issued a statement confirming that a \"caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour.\"The police arrived and \"spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well,\" adding: \"There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\"But they did not name Johnson or Symonds as being involved in the incident.Symonds has not made a public comment about the incident, which is reported to have happened in the early hours on Friday.Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in 2018 over Theresa May's Brexit plan.'Fictitious allegations'Johnson's neighbor Tom Penn declined to comment to CNN on the story, referring to a statement he issued to the Guardian in which he defended his decision to record the alleged argument.Penn said he was downstairs collecting food from a takeaway delivery driver when he heard \"shouting.\"\"I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone,\" he told The Guardian, explaining his decision to record the noise.\"To be clear, the recordings were of the noise within my own home. My sole concern up until this point was the welfare and safety of our neighbours. I hope that anybody would have done the same thing,\" he added.UK politician Mark Field suspended after grabbing Greenpeace protesterPenn said he contacted the newspaper because he felt \"it was of important public interest\".\"I believe it is reasonable for someone who is likely to become our next prime minister to be held accountable for all of their words, actions and behaviours,\" he explained Penn said he voted Remain in the EU referendum but since contacting the Guardian he and his partner have been the target of \"fictitious allegations\" by \"some areas of the press.\"Many of Britain's Conservative party-backing tabloid newspapers on Sunday suggested that Penn and his girlfriend reported the incident to police because of their political leanings. The Sun newspaper called the couple \"left-wing playwrights\" and the Daily Mail reported they had seen anti-Conservative tweets on her Twitter account, which has now been deleted.   'A non story'The story has shaken up the race to be next Conservative leader, and has led most British newspapers. Some of Johnson's backers tried to play the story down. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader, told CNN: \"This is a private matter.\"And Security Minister Ben Wallace, who nominated Johnson to be Conservative Party leader, was dismissive of the Guardian newspaper report in a tweet.\"What a non story 'couple have row.' Lefty neighbours give recording to Guardian. Newspaper reaches new low is a better news story,\" Wallace tweeted at Sun journalist Tom Newton-Dunn. Wallace deleted the tweet eight minutes after posting it, but it was archived by the Twitter feed Tweets MPs Delete.Johnson took part in the leadership hustings with his rival for the party leadership, Jeremy Hunt. The 160,000 Conservatives are preparing to vote for their favored candidate, with the winner due to be announced next month.Hunt replaced Johnson as Foreign Secretary after Johnson resigned in protest at UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. Until this weekend's story broke, Johnson was the favorite to win the leadership race, pitching himself as the only man to take the UK out of the European Union on October 31. Hunt has said he would also support a no deal exit if necessary.",

        "content": "(CNN)Even by the standards of the headline-hogging Video Assistant Referee (VAR) it was an extraordinary weekend at the Women's World Cup. What began in the shadows of the Alps on Saturday afternoon rumbled through to the north of France on Sunday, sparking anger, confusion and remarkable scenes.First to a crowded penalty box in Grenoble. With the score 0-0 in the first half, Svenja Huth is standing a few yards from her opponent's goalkeeper as Germany prepares to take a corner. Nigeria's goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie gives the forward a little push, but the German still remains in the teenager's eyeline as the ball comes flying into the box. \n\n\n\n\nEight green-shirted Nigerians are within six yards of goal. The defense should not be breached, but the ball hits the back of the net as Alexandra Popp is given the freedom to head home into the corner. Cue the use of VAR -- as has happened on numerous occasions in almost every match at the Women's World Cup -- cue minutes of delay and cue questions being asked about the ability of referees at a tournament being described as the most important in the history of the women's game. Read MoreEventually, referee Yoshimi Yamashita deemed Popp's header a worthy goal, giving Germany a lead it would extend over the 90 minutes, sealing a 3-0 win over the Super Falcons to march towards the quarterfinals. \"I genuinely cannot understand what's going on in this tournament,\" said Casey Stoney, Manchester United women's manager, who was in Grenoble working as a pundit for the BBC. Once all four weekend matches had been concluded, the former England defender was echoing the thoughts of many. READ: Germany beats Nigeria to reach quarterfinalsREAD: Australia knocked out on penalties in thrillerPopp scores for Germany while teammate Huth is in front of the last defender as the ball is played. Why was there such a brouhaha about Huth positioning herself a few yards from Nigeria's goalkeeper? Though in an offside position, she was deemed not to be interfering with play. The interpretation of that rule has not gone down well with many commentators -- though it is just one ingredient in the bubbling pot that is VAR at this tournament. \"I think it's poor refereeing,\" added Stoney. \"My interpretation is that's offside.\"It was not the first time in this tournament such a goal had been allowed to stand. Last week both Australia's Sam Kerr and the US' Carli Lloyd were deemed not to be interfering with play when in offside positions, resulting in crucial goals being given the green light. READ: Neville 'ashamed' of Cameroon reaction at World Cup'I'm questioning the ability of the officials'Stoney was also critical of the use of VAR to decide whether Evelyn Nwabuoku's foul on Germany's Lina Magull was a penalty. \"The referee has to see this,\" continued Stoney. \"If you're in a good position you see that's a penalty you should not need to go to VAR for that to be given and waste even more time so I'm questioning the ability of the officials at this tournament.\"Asked whether a referee at a Women's World Cup should be the best person for the job regardless of sex, Stoney said: \"I've said it for years as a player, where are these referees refereeing week in, week out under pressure having to make these decisions? Then we bring them and put them on the world's biggest stage. \"(It needs to be) the best person for the job to give the players the opportunity to play the football and let us be talking about the football, not VAR, not referees' decisions.\"Also speaking on BBC Two, former England defender Laura Bassett said referees were using VAR as a \"comfort blanket,\" while after his team's defeat, Nigeria coach Thomas Dennerby admitted the use of VAR had led to \"some strange situations\" during the match. But he had uttered those words before Cameroon and England took to the field on Sunday. READ: The Brazil great who defied a dictatorship to play footballNigeria players confront Yoshimi Yamashita after the referee awards a penalty to Germany. And, so to Sunday and to Valenciennes where England manager Phil Neville said he was \"ashamed\" by Cameroon's behavior as the last-16 tie descended into farce when Cameroon's players briefly refused to restart the game after an England goal was given by VAR. After the break, when a Cameroon goal had been disallowed by VAR, Cameroon's players delayed the game again by protesting. Neville later praised the referee, telling reporters when talking about an England penalty appeal which was denied that the referee was \"trying to protect football\" by not giving the spot kick or sending off a Cameroon player. \"I admire the referee unbelievably,\" the Englishman said. Ajara Nchout of Cameroon is distraught after her goal is ruled out for offside following a VAR check.But former England player Alex Scott told the BBC: \"When we are talking about the development of women's football and we're proud of it, we now need to think about the level of the referees. This is going out worldwide but we are being let down by the officials. There are some good ones but not enough.\"'Referees in line with expectation'Twenty-seven female referees and 48 female assistant referees are overseeing the matches in France. Some referees have officiated in men's top leagues, such as Bibiana Steinhaus (Bundesliga), Stephanie Frappart (Ligue 1), Claudia Umpierrez (Uruguay), Ether Staubli (Swiss men's second division), while assistant referee Chrysoula Kourompylia has officiated in Greece's top men's league. During the weekend it was the interpretation of the offside rule which was mainly in focus, while last week it was the way penalties were being used when both Scotland and Nigeria's goalkeepers were penalized by VAR after they were adjudged to have had stepped off their line before the ball was kicked during a penalty. The tournament was a guinea pig to a new penalty rule introduced at the beginning of this month which begs the question: is it the officials or the way VAR and a new law has been introduced at this major tournament?VAR was used at the 2018 men's World Cup and is being applied in Italy's Serie A and Germany's Bundesliga but it has not been used in any women's league in the world.A FIFA spokesperson told CNN Sport that VAR had been used competitively in the \"education phase\" for referees officiating in France, such as the Alkass International Cup -- an international Under-17 men's tournament -- and the Qatar Amateur League Cup. An LED screen shows a VAR review is in place over a penalty decision at the Women's World Cup.In the four preparation seminars held before the Women's World Cup in Abu Dhabi, Doha (twice) and Paris, practical training sessions with players and VAR simulator lessons were held on a daily basis. \"The education level convinced the FIFA Referees' Committee to suggest in March 2019 to the FIFA Council the use of VAR at the FWWC 2019,\" said the spokesperson. 'A high level of commitment'Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA's Referees' Committee, said in a press conference on Friday that the \"overall assessment\" of referees was \"in line with our expectations.\"\"The FIFA Refereeing department and in particular Kari Seitz, our project leader at France 2019, have worked very hard with the match officials during recent years,\" added Collina, regarded as the finest referee of his generation. \"Twenty-four different teams of referees from all six confederations were appointed in the group phase and they showed a high level of commitment and good qualities.\"The Italian went on to say: \"I am very pleased that VAR worked very well so far. Our referees started only after the FIFA World Cup 2018 to practise with this tool and they went through an intensive preparation process to be ready for the FIFA Women's World Cup.\"Nigeria's goalkeeper Nnadozie reacts as Honduran referee  Melissa Borjas decides France can re-take a penalty.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosIn England's Women's Super League, the standard of refereeing was put under the microscope last season as more attention than ever was placed on what has become a fully professional top division. As of yet, there is not a full-time group of referees in the WSL. It was only in 2016 that the English Football Association introduced an assessment system to oversee the quality of refereeing in the women's game. Earlier this year Umpierrez, who has refereed in Uruguay's men's top league, told FIFA.com that the path for female referees was tough, noting that she would not be able to \"put food on the table for my family in the country where I live\" if refereeing was her only profession.\"I would love to see more women refereeing men's football,\" added Umpierrez, who is also a lawyer. Women's football has made major progress in recent years. Standards have improved, investment has increased, and more eyes are on it than ever but for many involved in the game, the standard of refereeing has not moved quickly enough. Such is the life of a referee, he or she will never please everyone, but they will more often than not be in the eye of any storm.",

        "content": "(CNN)In the 1980s, Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson and Larry Bird were on opposite sides of one of the most heated NBA rivalries. They'll be sharing 2019's NBA lifetime achievement award Monday -- the first time the league has given the award to two people at once.The Hall-of-Famers duked it out for NBA supremacy over several seasons in the 1980s and brought more fans to the game in the process, making professional basketball must-see TV.And their rivalry touched on themes bigger than basketball. The NBA had been a majority-white league up until the 1980s, Doug Merlino wrote in his book \"The Crossover: A Brief History of Basketball and Race, from James Naismith to LeBron James.\" With more black players being signed, executives worried no one would watch or support a \"black\" league, Merlino wrote. Larry Bird's arrival to the NBA, playing for the Boston Celtics, led some to call him \"the great white hope.\"Johnson rips a rebound from Bird's hands during the first half on December 28, 1979 in Los Angeles.Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers were seen as the \"black team,\" while Bird and the Celtics were seen as the \"white team,\" Merlino wrote. The fact that both players were on two NBA dynasty teams on opposite coasts also played a role in the rivalry. Read MoreThat combination of race, geography, stardom and the overall need for a championship created a great television experience for fans. \"Not only were the duo part of the illustrious Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers rivalry, but they also constituted arguably the greatest one-on-one player rivalry in the history of the NBA,\" the league said on its website. The rivalry began before Johnson or Bird went proThe duo faced off in their first championship as college athletes in 1979.Johnson and the Michigan State Spartans went on to defeat Larry Bird and the Indiana State Sycamores 75-64 in the NCAA Championship. Johnson was named MVP. Bird said in a 2010 documentary that the game was \"the toughest loss I ever took,\" according to the NBA. \"Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies\" is an ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary that looks at NBA's greatest rivalry.Bird was also drafted first as the sixth overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 1978 draft, but he didn't play until he graduated from Indiana State in 1979. Johnson was the first overall pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1979 draft. One year after being drafted, a 20-year-old Johnson became the youngest and first rookie named NBA Finals MVP.That same year, Bird was named NBA Rookie of the Year. Johnson and Bird were socially polar opposites. Bird was quiet and reserved, while Johnson had a huge personality. Their high profile as star players on the Lakers and the Celtics would invite that comparison between them and emphasized their contrasts. During the 1980s, the Lakers went to the finals seven times and won four NBA titles. The Celtics went to the finals five times and won three titles.In total, Johnson and Bird met in the finals three times, in '84, '85 and '87. Johnson and the Lakers took home two of those championships. Their stories became entwinedDuring the '80s, it became impossible to discuss Johnson without Bird, or Bird without Johnson. And despite the intense rivalry, the two actually became friends in 1984, while shooting a Converse shoe commercial.They went on to play on the legendary \"Dream Team\" that won the gold medal in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Bird and Johnson answer questions from the media after practice for the men's basketball competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The two even followed similar post-NBA paths, with Johnson becoming involved in Lakers' behind-the-scenes operations and Bird going back home to Indiana to coach the Pacers and then act as the team's president of basketball operations. Their rivalry has inspired books, Broadway plays, and, most recently in 2017, a three-part documentary on ESPN called \"Celtics/Lakers: Best of Enemies.\"\"Your rival can bring out the best in you and also can make you a better player. Larry Bird did that for me. I would hope and I would think I did that for him,\" Johnson told CNN in 2012. The fact that the two will serve as the first co-recipients of the league's lifetime achievement award proves they're inseparable.",

        "content": "(CNN)Hundreds of climate change protesters broke into a huge open cast mine in western Germany Saturday to protest against the country's ongoing dependence on fossil fuels. The activists, many dressed in white overalls, evaded police officers as they crossed fields and roads, before descending into the vast Garzweiler lignite mine, located south-west of D\u00fcsseldorf. The mine, which covers 48 square kilometers, is operated by German electricity giant RWE (Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lisches Elektrizit\u00e4tswerk AG) and produces raw materials used in coal-fired power stations. Organized by the Ende Gel\u00e4nde (EG) alliance, a German environmental protest movement, the activists staged a blockade against the police, sitting down in the center of the mine, covered with reflective blankets to protect themselves from the sun. Lignite, a type of coal, is mined at Garzweiler, south-west of D\u00fcsseldorf, which covers an area of 48 square kilometers.\"We still have hope, the door is still open to a future within the 1.5 degrees C limit,\" Sina Reisch, a spokeswoman for the EG alliance, said in a statement. \"But we will miss this last chance if we don't act immediately. Read More\"Today, we set out with thousands of people towards a future without fossil fuels, without exploitation and without this destructive quest for infinite economic growth.\" Nike Malhaus, a fellow EG spokesman, added: \"Nothing less than our future is at stake. We will definitely not wait until 2038 to phase out coal, we are acting now. \"If we keep burning coal for another 20 years, it is impossible to stay within the 1.5 degrees C limit. Today we are taking the coal phase out into our own hands because the government is failing to protect the climate.\" The activists sat beneath reflective blankets to protect themselves from the sun. The protesters were quickly surrounded by police and many were forcibly removed. Kathrin Henneberger, an EG representative, reported that the final protesters were removed from the mine Sunday morning. \"It will continue all over Europe this summer,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Our resistance has only just begun.\" Saturday's protest came just a day after EG protesters blockaded the railway tracks leading to the Neurath power station, one of Germany's main coal-fired plants, halting the supply of coal. \"This weekend, we have completely shut down the CO2 source in Europe, the Rhineland lignite mining area,\" Henneberger wrote on Twitter. The German government has only committed to phase out coal-fired power stations by 2038. \"No coal train goes to the power plants anymore. No excavator works anymore in the opencast mines. It is amazing. Thanks to all the thousands of brave people.\"The Aachen Police force, which is responsible for the region in which the power plant is located, reported that individuals were detained during the blockade. They noted that protesters were given multiple opportunities to leave the tracks freely on being asked, but failed to comply with the order. The force also noted that a number of officers were injured as protesters attempted to break through police chains and avoid security measures. The protesters ignored warnings from the police and the energy company as they descended into the mine.Saturday's blockade was not the first time that the EG alliance has staged large-scale protests; in October 2018, approximately 6,000 activists blocked the tracks leading to a coal mine near the Hambach forest for 24 hours. As many as 8,000 protesters also took to the streets Saturday in the town of Keyenberg, located next to the Garzweiler mine, which is threatened with destruction by plans to expand the mine.Despite Germany's decision to abandon nuclear energy following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan, coal still plays a central role in its energy mix. The government committed in January 2019 to close all of Germany's coal-fired power plants by 2038, but coal still accounted for around 40% of the country's electricity in 2018.",

        "content": "(CNN)Tens of thousands of Czechs filled Prague's Letna Plain park on Sunday, taking part in what its organizers described as \"the biggest protest since the fall of Communism.\"They were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a controversial politician accused of fraud and collaborating with the Communist-era secret police, and his justice secretary Marie Benesova.The billionaire tycoon has been dubbed the \"Czech Trump\" by some Czech media outlets because of his vast business empire and populist leanings.Protesters rally at Letna Plain on Sunday. A crowd that was estimated by organizers to be around 250,000 people took over the plain overlooking Prague's historical center, the site of the mass protests that ultimately led to the fall of the country's Communist regime three decades ago. Read MoreA no confidence vote called for by opposition parties has been scheduled for Wednesday. A series of speakers denounced Babis and called for his departure. Several speakers also criticized the country's President Milos Zeman, and urged those in attendance to take steps to protect democracy.Babis' role in the European Union's failure to agree a net zero carbon emission target was also mentioned by one of the speakers. A plan to set the goal for 2050 was vetoed by four countries, including the Czech Republic, at a summit on Thursday.Babis told Czech media on Sunday that while he respected people's right to have an opinion, he didn't understand the reasons behind the protests. Czech opposition parties call for government no-confidence voteThe demonstration was part of a series of anti-Babis protests that have been going on for weeks.Babis has been accused of fraud related to EU subsidies received by his former agricultural business empire. An investigation ended in the police proposing criminal charges against him. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to indict the Prime Minister. He has denied the accusations.Separately, the European Commission is investigating whether Babis had a conflict of interest because of his role as the PM and the owner of a major business receiving EU funding. A draft report by the commission, leaked to Czech media earlier this month, said Babis' business should not have access to EU funding, and suggested that the money it had received in the past might need to be returned by the Czech Republic. The Commission said it would not comment on ongoing audits. The Czech Finance Ministry confirmed it had received a preliminary audit report, but would not comment further. Protesters in Prague are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Andrej Babis.Babis rejected the allegations and said the audit was \"an attack on the Czech Republic.\" Apart from the resignations of Babis and Benesova, the protesters are also demanding that Babis' business empire Agrofert stop receiving subsidies, tax breaks, investment incentives and public tenders. In addition to being Prime Minister and an agricultural tycoon, Babis is also the owner of Mafra, a major Czech publishing house that owns two of the nation's biggest daily newspapers. The protesters want to see him sell his stake in the media. They are also asking lawmakers to push for new safeguards for the country's justice system. Protesters at Letna Plain on November 25, 1989. Three decades later, the plain was again filled with demonstrators.Who is Babis?Babis is a divisive figure in the Czech Republic. The billionaire tycoon first stormed into Czech politics in 2012 and became Prime Minister in 2017. His populist ANO movement then received nearly 30% of the vote -- almost three times more than the conservative party ODS that came in second.Another Babis controversy relates to his alleged role as a secret agent for the Communist-era secret police, the StB. The Slovak-born politician was identified as an agent operating under the codename \"Bures\" by historians using archival documents. Party of billionaire Andrej Babis wins Czech electionBabis has rejected the claims and sued for defamation, but in 2018, a court in Slovakia dismissed his complaints, ruling that he was not wrongly identified as an agent in the archival documents. \"We think it unacceptable that ... 29 years after the Velvet Revolution, an StB agent would be the Prime Minister of our country. We will not pretend that that is normal, we demand his resignation,\" the organizers of the protests said.Despite the controversies, Babis continues to be relatively popular among Czech voters. ANO was the clear winner in the recent European Parliament elections, securing 21% of the vote.The organizers have already called for more protests.Tomas Etzler contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)On a recent afternoon at a coffee house in the Istanbul neighborhood where Turkey's president grew up, G\u00fcng\u00f6r Saytu\u011f was ruminating on his old friend's rise to power.    Decades ago, Saytu\u011f and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan were sitting in the locker room after an amateur soccer game when Erdo\u011fan announced out of the blue that he would someday become prime minister, and then president. Not long after that, Erdo\u011fan launched his political career as a self-styled man of the people, playing on his \"Kas\u0131mpa\u015fal\u0131\" roots to rocket from relative obscurity to mayor of Istanbul in 1994. To many voters here, he is still the local boy from Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa, a working-class neighborhood known for its naval tradition and its top-flight soccer team. Erdo\u011fan never made it to the pros, but the stadium now bears his name.\"He never gives up. If he sets his mind to something, he manages to achieve it,\" Saytu\u011f told CNN.President Erdo\u011fan sings at an AKP rally in Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa on March 5, ahead of the first vote. But in March, for what seemed like the first time in more than 25 years of political dominance, Erdo\u011fan suffered a devastating blow: his Justice and Development Party (AKP) lost the mayoral elections in Turkey's three biggest cities to the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP).Read MoreEspecially hard to swallow was the AKP's defeat in Istanbul -- considered, at least by Erdo\u011fan, to be the crown jewel of Turkish politics.Perhaps no one understands the significance of Turkey's largest city more than Erdo\u011fan, 65, who used it as a launch pad for his career. \"Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey,\" he is fond of saying. The president's birthplace has become a concentrated source of wealth and power for his party, oiling the rest of Turkey's political machine. Losing control of it means losing funds and resources that subsidize pro-government media, businesses, contractors and the AKP apparatus at large.  AKP supporters wave Turkish flags at a campaign rally in Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa in March.Rather than accept defeat, the AKP challenged the outcome of the race, claiming fraud. In a controversial ruling, the Turkish election board canceled the result and ordered a new vote, sparking outrage from the CHP, which described the move as \"plain dictatorship.\"The rerun, which will be held Sunday, is a pivotal moment. If the opposition defies the odds to defeat Erdo\u011fan's party for a second time, its supporters will hail the victory as a turning point for a country that is sliding into autocracy. And even if the AKP reclaims Istanbul, experts say the re-vote has already exposed a chink in Erdo\u011fan's armor. \"This is more than just a local election in the country. In many ways, it's a referendum on Erdo\u011fan and his reign,\" said Asl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f, a Turkey expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f, who covered Turkish politics as a journalist for years before becoming a senior policy fellow, said there has long been a misconception in foreign media that the rule of Erdo\u011fan -- who has been president since 2014 -- is iron-clad. \"The image of Erdo\u011fan here is not an almighty figure ... not the popular leader who is so safe and secure ... quite the opposite,\" she said.  A woman peers out from behind a giant poster of Erdo\u011fan during a March rally in Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa.Many residents of Istanbul are weary of the AKP's long reign, and blame Erdo\u011fan for the economic crisis, which is felt on the streets in soaring food costs, double-digit unemployment and Turkey's plummeting currency, the lira.But with the serious restrictions facing the opposition, including a ban on anti-government demonstrations in Istanbul, citizens have few remaining places to protest beyond the ballot box.The president's office did not return CNN's request for comment on Erdo\u011fan's involvement in the Istanbul election campaign.Fight for democracyAcross the city in Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y, an upper-middle class neighborhood overlooking the Sea of Marmara, people gathered last Sunday in bars and caf\u00e9s to watch the top two candidates for Istanbul's mayor face off in the first live televised debate Turkey has seen in 17 years.The debate pitted Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, of the AKP, against opposition candidate Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, of the CHP, who won the vote in March. \u0130mamo\u011flu, who is being backed by an energized array of opposition groups, called the re-vote a \"fight for democracy against those who violated our rights and the rights of 16 million people.\" Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a former prime minister, responded with the AKP's claim that the vote had been stolen.  Turkey's fractured opposition has rallied behind \u0130mamo\u011flu, leaving their differences to one side in a bid to beat Erdo\u011fan. But even with this coalition building, \u0130mamo\u011flu only narrowly edged out the AKP candidate, signaling the enduring power of the president's party.At an Istanbul caf\u00e9, people watch a live TV debate between Istanbul's main mayoral candidates.And while the matchup marked a historic moment for Turkey's electorate, whose daily news digest has increasingly consisted of pro-government programming on mainstream media outlets, few observers in a Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y caf\u00e9 felt that the broadcast signaled much in the way of change.Sitting at a table watching the debate with a group of friends, all in their 30s, Gizem S\u00fcrer said that while everyone she knows is talking about justice, she sees little way for young people like her to get it.\"Since the first day of AKP's ruling this country, I personally have been observing a deep aspiration for democracy among people. When we look at these places, coffeehouses in villages, in public squares, or party tents, people are frequently putting into words the notions of democracy and justice,\" S\u00fcrer said.\"But, when we look to the streets, we see bans for equal and fair debates, bans for people to express their opinion,\" she added. Those around her nodded.People walk past Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and \u0130mamo\u011flu election posters amid campaigning for the rerun.Since a failed military coup in 2016, Erdo\u011fan has consolidated his power and set into motion a sweeping crackdown on dissent, jailing opposition politicians and journalists. And, last year, he won re-election with even greater unchecked authority. In response, many Turks have opted to leave the country, prompting what has come to be known as the country's \"brain drain.\" \"Unfortunately, we are being forced to dream about going abroad,\" said \u00d6zg\u00fcr T\u00fcrker, who was playing Okey, a traditional Turkish tile-based game, and sipping coffee at a table near S\u00fcrer.'For our president, it's his campaign'Across the glittering blue Bosphorus in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, a residential district on Istanbul's Asian side, campaigners for both candidates have set up election tents, blaring political anthems and handing out flyers to passersby on their way to the ferry station.Nurettin Ad\u0131yol, an AKP volunteer, said that many of the people he speaks to on the street complain about the economy and tell him the government isn't working hard enough for its citizens. But Ad\u0131yol disagrees.\"We took [over] this city as a garbage city,\" Ad\u0131yol said, alluding to Istanbul's pre-Erdo\u011fan days. \"Did you forget about the days that you were carrying water in barrels? Children and youngsters do not know about those days.\"The battle is on for the swing voter, and Ad\u0131yol is trying to remind them just how much the AKP -- and, by extension, Erdo\u011fan -- has done for Istanbul over more than two decades.\"For our president, it's his campaign,\" Ad\u0131yol said. \"In everywhere that he is present, we will win the election.\"In reality, Erdo\u011fan has been noticeably absent in the lead-up to the June 23 rerun, forgoing plans to campaign in dozens of rallies for the AKP. Political pundits say that's because of fears that his involvement could cost his candidate the race.An AKP election banner featuring Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Erdo\u011fan hangs from an Istanbul building ahead of the March election.\"Erdo\u011fan has been told by a number of political advisers, as well as the Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m campaign, that his overwhelming presence in the city is actually a turn-off for some voters ... those that feel AKP is on the wrong path, that it's gotten too authoritarian, and that the government is responsible for the economic downturn,\" Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f said.But, in the days since the debate, Erdo\u011fan's presence has increased as \u0130mamo\u011flu appears to be pulling ahead of Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m. Erdo\u011fan met with foreign journalists on Thursday, claiming that polls putting the opposition candidate in the lead were \"manipulative.\"\"The real poll will be Sunday,\" Erdo\u011fan told reporters.The sense of wariness among voters is palpable at a farmer's market in the tangle of back streets above \u00dcsk\u00fcdar's ferry station.Two middle-aged women, who asked that their names not be used for fear of backlash from the government, said that they're reminded of just how bad things have gotten every time they go to do their grocery shopping.\"Everything is troublesome, prices are sky-high, everything is prohibitively expensive, we are having a hard time making ends meet,\" one of the women said, gripping a bag of produce.  Ahead of the initial mayoral election, Turkish authorities set up state food markets to sell subsidized fruit and vegetables amid a surge in food prices, which the government blames on retailers -- rather than inflation.

Backers of Johnson shrugged off media reports that neighbors heard \"a loud altercation involving screaming, shouting and banging\" at the couple's south London home. The opposition Labour Party's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer tweeted the Guardian's initial story about the alleged dispute with the comment, \"Was there ever a man less suited to be Prime Minister?\"Was there ever a man less suited to be Prime Minister?https://t.co/GnxWGMwrKm\u2014 Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) June 21, 2019\n\nJohnson ducked repeated questions during a leadership hustings in Birmingham Saturday about why police were called to his house. Being questioned by radio host Iain Dale, he first said: \"I don't think they want hear about that kind of thing,\" prompting applause from party members in Birmingham. \"I think what they want to hear is what my plans are for the country and the party.\"Read MoreDale asked at least four variations of the question during the event attended by Conservative Party members. \"I think what people want to know is whether I have the determination and the courage to deliver on the promises that I make,\" Johnson said.Dale finally suggested Johnson was simply not going to answer the question.\"I think that's pretty obvious,\" Johnson said.His office was not answering calls on Saturday. His campaign did not immediately answer an email from CNN.The Guardian reported late Friday that a neighbor of Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds had heard an argument from her apartment, knocked on the door, got no response, and called the police.Boris Johnson leaves his home in south London on Friday after he emerged as the front-runner in the leadership race.The neighbor, who reportedly recorded the altercation, told the Guardian that Symonds could be heard telling Johnson \"get off me\" and \"get out of my flat.\"In the recording, Symonds said Johnson had ruined her sofa with red wine. \"You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt. You have no care for money or anything,\" she said according to the Guardian. Johnson was also heard saying \"get off my f*ing laptop\" before a loud crashing noise, the paper reported.The Metropolitan Police issued a statement confirming that a \"caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour.\"The police arrived and \"spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well,\" adding: \"There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\"But they did not name Johnson or Symonds as being involved in the incident.Symonds has not made a public comment about the incident, which is reported to have happened in the early hours on Friday.Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in 2018 over Theresa May's Brexit plan.At least six major British newspapers splashed the story across their front pages on Saturday, all naming Johnson and Symonds, and all citing the Guardian as the original source of the story.More than half a dozen current or former Conservative Party lawmakers contacted by CNN on Saturday declined to reply or said they had no comment.Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader, told CNN: \"This is a private matter.\"Alan Duncan, who worked at the Foreign Office when Johnson was Foreign Secretary, dismissed CNN's question about whether the story would affect Johnson's leadership bid.And then there were two: Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in battle to lead Britain\"This is a na\u00efve question. The campaign will handle it,\" he told CNN by phone Saturday.Security Minister Ben Wallace, who nominated Johnson to be Conservative Party leader, was dismissive of the Guardian newspaper report in a tweet.\"What a non story 'couple have row.' Lefty neighbours give recording to Guardian. Newspaper reaches new low is a better news story,\" Wallace tweeted at Sun journalist Tom Newton-Dunn. Wallace deleted the tweet eight minutes after posting it, but it was archived by the Twitter feed Tweets MPs Delete.Johnson is taking part in the leadership hustings with his rival for the party leadership, Jeremy Hunt. The 160,000 Conservatives are preparing to vote for their favored candidate, with the winner due to be announced next month.Hunt replaced Johnson as Foreign Secretary after Johnson resigned in protest at UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. Johnson is the favorite to win the leadership race, pitching himself as the only man to take the UK out of the European Union on October 31. Hunt has said he would also support a no deal exit.",

The original ruling had been made on the grounds that Spanish law requires evidence of physical violence or intimidation to prove a rape charge, a stipulation that has since been brought into question.Prosecutors had called on the Supreme Court to upgrade the sentence, and the court agreed that the victim had indeed faced intimidation. \"The factual account describes an intimidating scenario, in which the victim in no way consents to the sexual acts carried out by the accused,\" the court said.Antonio Manuel Guerrero Escudero received an extra two years, as he was also found guilty of the theft of the victim's phone.According to court documents, WhatsApp messages circulated to the group by one of the defendants included \"us five are ing one girl,\" \"there is more than what I'm telling you,\" \"a ing amazing trip\" and \"there is video.\"",

Vettel was handed a five-second penalty after he was deemed to have rejoined the circuit in an unsafe manner after making a mistake during lap 48, pushing rival Lewis Hamilton off the track in the process. Despite holding off the Mercedes driver for the rest of the race and crossing the finish line in front, the time penalty ensured the 31-year-old Vettel finished second.FIA officials met with the team ahead of the French Grand Prix this weekend but ultimately rejected Ferrari's right to review the decision.Despite Ferrari being optimistic that they had \"overwhelming\" evidence, stewards concluded that there were \"no significant and relevant new elements which were unavailable to the parties at the time.\"Read MoreWith its right to appeal rejected, Ferrari is still looking for its first win of the Formula 1 season.

She's 6,\" said former F1 presenter Jake Humphrey.Meanwhile, others were sympathetic to the German and questioned the stewards' decision. \"Any of the stewards ever raced at the front in F1?

But she did not care.Follow @cnnsport\n\nSometimes her mother would drag her away by the ear, reminding her single-minded daughter that there was no future in Brazil for girls who wanted to play the beautiful game. That's just the way things were. \"I'm going to prove you wrong,\" Sissi, as she would more affectionately become known to the world, would boldly retort during the long march home, the boys continuing to play on in the background. \"I'm going to play for the national team.\" \n\nThere were times I had to pretend to be a boy. I knew there was a law, that we had a President who said girls shouldn't be playing soccer. I ignored it.\nSissi\nBut, at the time, there was no Brazilian national football team for women. In 1941, as women's football was growing in popularity, the Brazilian government pushed through a decree that said females \"will not be allowed to practice sports incompatible with the conditions of their nature.\" It meant women were banned from playing football, rugby, water polo and various track and field events. Brazil's military dictatorship would affirm the ruling when it came into power over two decades later. Read MoreUnder such circumstances, it was perhaps understandable that Sissi's father dreamed only for his son, Paulo, to become a professional footballer. With misogyny as much a fabric of Brazilian society as football, how could he have contemplated that it would be his daughter who would become one of the greats of the game? The young Sissi would watch father and son kicking the ball back and forth on the dusty streets, pretending to score goals for their beloved Brazil. It was here, \"in the middle of the jungle\" as she describes her hometown, observing the father she loved to impress, that the beautiful game captured her heart. Football's virtue is that it can be played anywhere, and not necessarily with a ball. While in the 16th century the English would kick around an inflated pig's bladder, a six-year-old Sissi used a doll's head. So good did she become, fights would break out between boys over whose team she could play for. \"The boys accepted me,\" Sissi, speaking from her Californian home, tells CNN Sport.  \"There were times I had to pretend to be a boy. I knew there was a law, that we had a President who said girls shouldn't be playing soccer. I ignored it. \"I was in the middle of nowhere -- who's going to know I was playing soccer with a bunch of boys? There were times I got into a lot of trouble.

The National Sports Council saddled players with rules like shorter game times and full-body protection, while women were not allowed to swap jerseys after matches but, nevertheless, the game grew. By now, Sissi's father had started a new job in the city and would return with tales of a women's team in Rio de Janeiro. Emboldened and inspired, the 14-year-old begged to be allowed to leave home to play for a team in Feira de Santanta,  he second-most populous city in her state and a three-hour drive from her hometown.\"Scared,\" is how Sissi describes her mother's initial reaction. \"But my dad was the one who said, 'this girl was born with a gift so let her go.' My mum was good at making sure I'd be a strong woman.\"As the youngest living with 10 other hopefuls, there were many adjustments to be made in the city, but Sissi's rise was rapid. Within three years the playmaker had moved to Salvador to play for a club that was paying her just enough to get by and had been invited to train with the national team.But for the-then 17-year-old to train with Brazil's new women's team, parental consent had to be given.

I remember my mum saying, 'what am I going to do?'  and I said 'I don't care, you have to find a way to sign my dad's name because I need to go. You have to fake his signature.'\" \n\nPutting on that jersey for the first time, I was crying like a baby.\nSissi\nHer obstinacy paid off. Sissi trained with the national team but it would be four years later, at FIFA's first invitational tournament for women hosted by China in 1988, that the player who would become known as the \"Queen of Brazilian football\" made her international debut. There was no talk of tactics or analysis, Sissi recalls, nor any focus on fitness. The first women to represent Brazil in the country's national game relied on their natural talent, of which they had plenty. \"We looked like dogs,\" Sissi jokes, referring to the ill-fitting kit the team wore for the 12-team competition. For a number of reasons, her first trip to China was memorable. It was the first time she had traveled on a plane, while the political climate of the time meant the team was accompanied by security wherever it went. \"It was definitely different,\" says Sissi, laughing. But the memory she cherishes the most is of those moments in the dressing room before her debut when she was given the No.10 shirt, becoming the first woman to wear the iconic number made famous by three-time World Cup winner Pele. Another picture from the Brazilian Football Museum archives. Sissi with the Brazilian national team in 1997.  \"Putting on that jersey for the first time, I was crying like a baby,\" Sissi says. \"I'm wearing the No.10 shirt and have no idea what that means and only later start to figure out what it represents, especially in Brazil. It was a lot of pressure, too. People comparing the No.10 with the men's No10. It was very weird.\"Sissi scored her first international goal in China, against then European Champions Norway, but it was over a decade later, at the 1999 Women's World Cup hosted by the United States, that Brazil's playmaker announced her talent to the world, scoring one of the great goals in the tournament's history.READ: Outraged by the lack of respect, Chile's female footballers fought for changeSissi (C) is engulfed by teammates after the quarterfinal victory over Nigeria. On a balmy summer evening in Washington DC, As Canarinhas (the female canaries, as Brazil's women are also known) had allowed a 3-0 lead slip in the quarterfinals against Nigeria. With the match locked at 3-3 in extra-time, the Golden Goal rule hovered over both sides like the sword of Damocles. A goal would immediately end the contest. It was sudden death. Thirty-five meters from goal, wide to the left, Brazil is awarded a free-kick. It is not the sort of position from which players usually score, but Sissi takes the ball. She closes her eyes and envisions the ball hitting the back of the net. \"I practiced a lot with the goalkeepers, making sure I challenged them after every session. That moment I said 'that's it,'\" she recalls.Nonchalantly almost, just as she had imagined a hundred times before, she curls the ball in at the near post.For a moment, in that pregnant pocket of time, she loses control, embarking on a wild celebratory run. She flaps her jersey, then waves her arms. Her heart is thumping, she is roaring. It all passes in a blur. \"I spent a lot of time working on that. Probably the best moment of my career was there in the United States,\" says Sissi, who would end the tournament sharing the Golden Boot with China's Sun Wen as Brazil secured a third-place finish. Sissi celebrates with teammates and fans after her match-winning free-kick.Three months before the start of the tournament which would define her career, on a rainy evening in Salvador, the midfielder had sustained an injury while playing futsal, threatening to end her participation before it had even begun. \"I hit my face on the floor and broke some of the bones on my face and the doctors said I had to have surgery,\" she explains. \"But I said there was no way I could have surgery because I would miss the World Cup. \"I went to the training camp. I basically didn't say anything to the medical staff. No-one knew exactly what happened besides some of my teammates. I didn't want to miss the World Cup because I knew something special was on the way. \n\nHaving people starting to pay attention to women's soccer was definitely something very special.\nSissi\n\"You have that feeling. I prepared myself well. I took care of myself and my body. I was mentally prepared. During the games, I was never the player who scored a lot of goals, I was the playmaker, so when I started scoring goals I was like 'oh my gosh.' \"The fans started noticing you. It was very different for me because I didn't have that experience in Brazil, people coming to the stadiums, bringing signs with your name, asking to sign autographs. Having people starting to pay attention to women's soccer was definitely something very special.\" Shy but comfortable in her own skin, Brazil's No.10 not only stood out during that celebrated World Cup  because of her touch and wit. There was also the shaven hair, too. \"For people in Brazil it was shocking,\" she says of the hairstyle which was the outcome of a promise she had made to her teammates. \"Everybody was in the bathroom and Formiga did it. 'Sorry Sissi, you promised, you got to do it,' she said. I guess I was the first female soccer player that decided to be bald during the World Cup.\"Sissi in action against Bettina Wiegmann of Germany in 1999.But there was another reason why she continued to sport a haircut which had shocked so many in her homeland. On arriving in America, the team manager had received a request from a school for the player to meet a 12-year-old boy who was being bullied because he had lost his hair as a side effect of the cancer treatment he was undergoing. \"That was life changing for me,\" says Sissi, who still has a picture in her home of her and Julius, who would later die when Sissi was on holiday in Brazil. \"I didn't speak English at all, but to be in that classroom with the boy, I had a chance to see and get in touch with his soul. It was definitely a moment that changed my life because I could see what he was dealing with because it was the same thing I had to deal with in Brazil, people were looking at me and saying 'what's she thinking?' \"To honor him, I said 'I will continue to shave my head.' But a lot of people had no idea what was going on. There were two reasons, one was special.\"Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosSissi in training during the 1999 Women's World Cup. Despite the disadvantages the team faced, Brazil went on to finish third at the 1999 World Cup. It was not easy for the Brazilians to excel, Sissi admits, but the sacrifice each player had made created an unbreakable spirit. In certain respects, she says, not much has changed in Brazil regarding attitudes to female footballers. France 2019 will be the first Women's World Cup where matches will be broadcast live in the country, but women's football is still in the shadows. CONMEBOL, football's governing body in South America, has scheduled Copa America, the continent's major men's tournament, at the same time as the Women's World Cup, just as it had in 2015. The finals of both tournaments will be held on July 7.  \"We didn't have a lot of support. We didn't get paid, we didn't get sponsors, we put our heart out there,\" she says of the 1999 team. \n\nMy generation opened the doors, but we cannot say now everything is perfect because it is not.\nSissi\n\"We wanted the same structure as the men. Not having the right uniform, or to have to sometimes change in the training center and go to the hotel because the men have the training center. The women always came second. It was not easy.\"We knew we didn't have the luxury to buy a lot of things, it was impossible. I had to save every penny to buy a house for my family because that's what I said the first thing I would do if I make money from soccer is provide a house for my family. \"It was $15 per diem from the federation -- it was not enough. You cannot even pay your bills to do that. We knew money was being given to them, but we didn't have a chance to see the color of the money whatsoever. Who knows where that money was going. \n\n\n\n\n\"My generation opened the doors, but we cannot say now everything is perfect because it is not. Even now in the United States they are still fighting. It's changed from when I was playing, but not much. \"In Brazil, we have talent, but it has to be more than talent for you to win something. It comes with our confederation. They are the ones who have the power to make the change. But, also, the girls have to make sure they get together, they have to be united if they want to make that change happen because if not we're going to be talking about this every year.\"For the last two decades home for Sissi has been California and her influence on the game continues. She coaches soccer at Solano Community College in Fairfield, California, where 2,000 girls are registered to play. She describes herlself as a demanding and intense trainer. Dissolving into laughter, she concedes she is addicted to football. \"I love this sport so much,\" she says. \"I gave everything to my country, to my sport, and now I'm giving as a coach. I'm still waiting for the day where we can look and say, 'we're getting paid well, we're having the recognition, we can watch on TV.' Who knows.\" Illustration \u00a9 2018 by Alexandra Boiger, from the book SHE PERSISTED AROUND THE WORLD. Originally published by Philomel Books, a division of Penguin Random House.

What's so interesting about me that I have to be in the book,'\" says Sissi, whose autograph was cherished as much as Clinton's during the book signing.\"My friend said 'Come on Sissi, I don't think you know who you are. I don't think you understand how many lives you've impacted. Take this moment. Enjoy.' \"That was a unique moment. I embrace that without changing. I'm still the little girl who came from the middle of nowhere, I'm still the same person.

        "content": "(CNN)The group stages have concluded, to the knockout stages we go. After 36 games, 106 goals, 84 yellow cards, and plenty of VAR controversy, 24 teams have been whittled to 16 and the pressure now turns up a notch or two at the Women's World Cup. The big-hitters have come through their opening tests unscathed, though there have been a few headlines along the way, while all four debutants -- Jamaica, Chile, South Africa and Scotland -- have now departed but left their mark nonetheless. From record-breaking matches to empty seats and ferocious debates, a lot has been learned from the group stages of the Women's World Cup. READ: The Brazil great who defied a dictatorship to play footballRead MoreUS still the ones to beat US fans are out in numbers in France. Questions were being asked about defending champions the US before the start of the tournament. Was the defense solid enough? Would a squad consisting of largely the same players which floundered at the Rio Olympics be able to defend its title? The defense hasn't yet been truly tested, but three group wins for a goal difference of +18 suggests that this is a team eager to make up for its quarterfinal elimination in Brazil, its worst showing in a major tournament. Jill Ellis, who is aiming to become the first coach to win the Women's World Cup twice, has chosen a blend of the old and the new and over the last three years has tinkered with, rather than overhauled, the team's style of play. So far, it has worked. For athleticism, for speed, for attacking prowess, the US is without equal. Indeed, no team has ever scored more in the group stages of this competition than the 18 goals netted by the title holders. Ellis has a wealth of attacking talents to choose from and, as the 13-0 walloping of Thailand in the team's opening fixture proved, the US forwards are ruthless. Alex Morgan -- a record five goals in that headline-generating win over Thailand -- and Carli Lloyd already have a healthy goal tally, which is ominous for opponents. Once the US goes into full throttle, Ellis' side could be impossible to stop.      READ: Can anyone stop the USWNT? READ: Sam Kerr -- Australia's million dollar playerWho has qualifiedThere are no surprises in the knockout stages. The top 10 ranked teams in the world are through -- US, Germany, England, France, Canada, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden and Brazil. Spain, ranked 13th in the world, has made it to the last 16 for the first time and must now play the US on Monday, while China has maintained its record of having never failed to progress beyond the group stages. Sara Gama of Italy is thrown in the air by her teammates.Italy caused the biggest upset of the group stages by beating Australia in the final minutes of its opening group match and the reward is progress to the knockout stages for the first time since 1991. The Italians could be the surprise outfit of the tournament and beating former finalists China does not seem out of the question. The last-16 fixtures are as follow: June 22: Germany vs. Nigeria; Norway vs. Australia June 23: England vs. Cameroon; France vs. BrazilJune 24: Spain vs. US; Sweden vs. CanadaJune 25: Italy vs. China; Netherlands vs. JapanVisit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosThe world's best top the chartsTwo players top the scoring charts and their names will come as no surprise. Alex Morgan -- who, during the defeat of Thailand, became only the second American to score five in a World Cup match -- and Sam Kerr, the first Australian to score a hat-trick at a World Cup, lead the way with five goals each. Following close behind is Brazil's Cristiane on four goals. The Brazil striker scored the first hat-trick of the tournament and became the oldest player in World Cup history to hit a treble as Brazil beat Jamaica 3-0 in Group C.Marta kisses her boot after becoming the first player to score in five Women's World Cup tournaments. Aged 34 years and 25 days, Cristiane beat the record held by Cristiano Ronaldo, who was 33 years and 130 days old when he scored a hat-trick in Portugal's 3-3 draw with Spain at Russia 2018.Brazil's Marta, who scored her 17th goal this week to become the most prolific scorer in World Cup finals history, has scored twice in France. A decent return considering the six-time FIFA Player of the Year was featured in just two of Brazil's three group games -- being on the pitch for a total of just 129 minutes.Bye Bye Jamaica, South Africa, Chile and Scotland      The story of Jamaica's journey to the World Cup captured hearts around the world. Twice disbanded, the Reggae Girlz became the first Caribbean team to qualify for the Women's World Cup and did so thanks to the financial help of Bob Marley's daughter. Though Jamaica leaves France without a win, the Reggae Girlz have certainly made their mark. They received a standing ovation from both Jamaican and Australian fans as they bade au revoir to the tournament following the team's final group match, which ended in a 4-1 defeat by the Matildas. South Africa, Chile and Scotland are other debutants to exit the tournament at the group stage, but their presence in France has been to the tournament's benefit. As South Africa captain Janine Van Wyk tweeted: \"Sometimes it's not about winning, to be seen or spoken about, sometimes it is about showing your worth & what value bring to the game with the 'NEVER SAY DIE' kind of attitude.\"Gulf exists between the elite and the restWhat Jamaica's story illustrates is that not only is there a gulf in funding between men's and women's national teams, but there is also a huge gap between the elite of women's football and the rest. Thailand's record 13-0 defeat to the US, the heaviest in World Cup history, proves there is still much need to be done to make the tournament more competitive. The Thai team is supported by a wealthy patron, the general manager Nualphan Lamsam, who is the chief executive of one of the country's largest insurance companies. Her tears as Thailand scored its first World Cup goal in a 5-1 defeat by Sweden showed how significant a moment that goal was for her, the team and women's football in Thailand. What a moment.There are tears on the sideline as Thailand score their first goal of the tournament.Watch #SWE v #THA on @BBCRedButton now!\ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/H8kQlL7o77 #ChangeTheGame #bbcfootball pic.twitter.com/DAxeHmQVXQ\u2014 Match of the Day (@BBCMOTD) June 16, 2019 Would Thailand or Jamaica have been able to compete in France without outside investment? The answer to that would be an emphatic no. That national teams rely on wealthy benefactors rather than support from their federations should compel FIFA, the sport's governing body, to do more. US striker Morgan said after the victory over Thailand that she hoped that the 13-0 scoreline \"encourages FIFA to put a bit of pressure on those respective federations to put more efforts into their women's sides.\" More investment is certainly needed. Urgently. Goalkeepers & VAR -- The big debateScotland's Lee Alexander wipes away the tears after the 3-3 draw with Argentina.During the opening weeks of the tournament, a number of interesting debates have been had. How much should a team celebrate scoring when thrashing minnows? Why don't all federations support the women's game? Also generating tweets and headlines are goalkeepers and VAR (Video Assistant Referee). Three penalty kicks have been retaken at this summer's tournament so far after VAR ruled that goalkeepers did not have at least one part of their foot on the goal line.While FIFA has yet to comment publicly on the penalty controversies, it is clear that officials are simply following the laws imposed by the sport's rule-making body, the International Football Association Board.\"We need to talk about this rule and the way it's impacting matches,\" Hope Solo tweeted after Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander was penalized by the video assistant referee after her dramatic penalty save during her team's game with Argentina Wednesday.READ: Christiane Endler -- the goalkeeper opening doors for other womenEndler's outstanding second-half performance against the US garnered praised around the world. Goal dimensions have also been discussed during the opening weeks of the tournament. Player-of-the-match performances from Argentina's Vanina Correa and Chile's Christiane Endler suggest goal sizes are fine as they are. But in a column in the English newspaper The Times, Chelsea manager Emma Hayes remarked that \"no one ever thought to question whether it makes sense\" for goal sizes to be the same for both the men's and women's game. Female goalkeepers have long been the subject of mockery by those who wish to pour scorn on the women's game, but goalkeeping standards have undoubtedly improved in recent years. But, as Katie Whyatt wrote in her column in the English newspaper the Daily Telegraph on the debate: \"We should at least have this debate, with nuance. To dismiss Hayes's suggestions out of hand does everyone a huge disservice.\"READ: The South American footballers who fought for changeCorrea saved a penalty against England and produced a string of fine saves against the world's No.3-ranked team.A sell out is not necessarily a sell out FIFA, the sport's governing body, has declared that ticket sales have exceeded the 1 million mark (1.3m were sold in Canada four years ago), but empty seats have been a feature of the early stages of the tournament, even in matches billed as sold-out by FIFA. Only 13,000 people turned up to watch England versus Scotland on the opening weekend in Nice's 35,000-capacity stadium, while empty seats were visible for US versus Thailand -- one of the 14 sold out games, according to FIFA, in this 52-match competition.      FIFA told CNN Sport that vacant seats at sold out games could be attributed to no-shows. \"Generally speaking when it comes to FIFA competitions, there is always potential for a certain discrepancy between the expected attendance and the actual match attendance,\" said a FIFA spokesperson. \"Such discrepancy is mainly due to 'no shows,' which can be linked to different factors such as negative weather conditions, travel constraints or the personal decisions of fans.\"With tickets available from nine euros for some matches, has the cost of not attending matches been made inconsequential? Poor promotion of the game in Paris has also been criticized, with advertising of the French Open -- which was being held in the city up until June 9 -- more prominent than a tournament being billed as a game-changer for women's sport.      Record TV audiences If ticket sales have not been an outright success, at least the group stages have enjoyed blockbuster global television figures. \n\n\n\n\nFrench free-to-air broadcaster TF1 has said a peak audience of more than 10 million watched France's opening match against South Korea, the most ever for a women's match in the country. At last year's World Cup in Russia, 12.6 million tuned in to watch France take on Australia in the opening game. England versus Scotland attracted a peak audience of 6.1 million on the free-to-air broadcaster the BBC, making it the most watched women's soccer game of all time in the UK. Fox Sports has experienced a 11% rise in viewership compared to the 2015 tournament, this despite the unfavorable time zone. In Brazil, this is the first Women's World Cup to be broadcast on the country's main TV channel, Globol, and Brazil's opening match against Jamaica averaged 19.7 million viewers. Millions have also tuned in in Italy, the Netherlands, Argentina and Germany, while in China, an average of 12 million reportedly watched the country's opening match live on CCTV. FIFA hopes a billion tune in to watch on television but, then again, it did hope that 1.3 million tickets would be sold.",

In their most difficult test thus far, the defending champions came through unscathed, securing a comfortable 2-0 victory against Sweden to make it three wins from three in France with no goals conceded. Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor athleticism, for speed, for attacking prowess the US is without equal at this Women's World Cup. Indeed, no team has ever scored more in the group stages than the 18 goals netted by Jill Ellis' side. \n\n\n\n\nSterner tests will come, but probably not until the quarterfinals when France, if the last-16 ties go as predicted, will likely be the opponent for what would be a mouthwatering contest in Paris. From the moment Lindsey Horan struck in the third minute in Le Havre for the quickest goal of the tournament the result was never really in doubt. That a Jonna Andersson own goal was the only addition to the scoreline will probably be an irritation to a team from which much is expected. Read MoreThe US wasn't without weakness, there were occasions when the defense erred -- Kosovare Asllani glided through on goal far too easily in the first half -- but it concludes the group stages atop Group F and as justified favorite for a fourth title. Ellis' biggest worry is likely to be Alex Morgan's half-time departure after a heavy challenge in the first half. The coach later said that substituting her star striker was a matter of being \"smart about things.\"READ: The Brazil great who defied a dictatorship to play footballHoran (C) scores the opening goal against Sweden.Three years ago, Sweden knocked out the US at the quarterfinal stage of the Rio Olympics, inflicting on the US its worst showing in a major tournament. Ellis denied that the loss in Rio had played on her mind in the build up to this match. \"I don't have a rear-view mirror,\" she told reporters after the match. \"It's all about what's in front of me. I didn't give that game a second thought.\"Since that defeat in 2016 Ellis has tinkered with rather than overhauled the team's style of play and so far in France her side has impressed, advancing into the last 16 with a 100% record and a goal difference of +18. Germany is the only other country to progress to the knockout stages with a blemish-free defensive record. Speaking after her ninth win as US coach in 10 World Cup matches, Ellis added: \"We wanted to talk about continuing to build momentum, but we've got some things to work on to make sure we're better and sharper for the next game.\"When you come out of the group stages a lot of what you talk about is mentality and being healthy and I think they're in a really good place.\"To have the players in a good place with self belief makes my job easier because they're certainly highly motivated and hungry.\"READ: Abuse and sexism in women's footballHeath celebrates with Kelley O'Hara after the US' second goal. Ellis opted for mostly the same personnel which started the record 13-0 opening victory over Thailand. Midfielder Julie Ertz -- a player who kept a photo of the Sweden defeat as a screensaver on her phone as a way of using failure to fuel the fire -- was the only absentee through injury. With progress also assured Sweden made seven changes to the team which beat Thailand in its last outing. Four players were given their World Cup debuts for a formidable baptism on the big stage.Coach Peter Gerhardsson said he made the selection with an eye on the knockout stages. \"We know we have a knockout match on Monday and that's the most important game,\" he told reporters. \"We talked more than ever about the starting XI both with the medical team, coaches, players etc. When we looked at the game plan, we didn't think in advance that it was important to end up first or second.\"READ: 1999 and the match that changed football     With Sweden not at its strongest, it was a straightforward night for the three-time champions. The US had 18 attempts on goal, though only four of which were on target, and enjoyed 58% of the possession. Indeed, Ellis' side completed more than double the amount of passes than its opponent.But Ellis denied that the Swedes had made it easy. \"You're not giving enough credit to the opponent we played,\" she said. Sweden is a good opponent to play in a group stage game, as it has been in tournaments past.\"The US and Sweden are familiar foes. No other teams have played each other on more occasions at Women's World Cups so Sweden should have been alert to the danger the defending champions pose at set pieces. But when Megan Rapinoe swung in a low corner, Sweden's defenders allowed the ball to fall into the path of Horan, leaving the impressive midfielder with a simple strike a few yards from goal. Even Thailand had held firm for longer. Despite the US' monopoly of possession and territory, it wasn't until the 50th minute that the second breakthrough came. Rapinoe was again the creator, finding the effervescent Heath who aimed at goal from an acute angle, forcing Andersson to direct the ball into her own net. Should the goal have been disallowed? Substitute Carli Lloyd appeared offside in the build up, but VAR deemed that the striker was not interfering with play. Lloyd should have scored a third in the dying minutes, but the striker drew a fine save from Hedvig Lindahl. Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosSweden will play Canada next on Monday, while the US will now turn its attention to a last-16 match against Spain, a team which is competing in the knockout stages for the first time and one which the defending champions defeated 1-0 in a friendly in January. \"Spain's a great side,\" said Ellis \"It was really purposeful why we wanted to play them earlier in the year. It was great to get them on the schedule and experience that in their home country. \"Any team that gets out of the group and is in this position you 100% respect and obviously we need to have very good preparation and performance to do very well against them.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The president of Georgia has accused Russia of meddling in its internal affairs and stirring anger that led to protesters attempting to storm the Georgian parliament on Thursday.Thousands of people tried to storm the parliament in the capital, Tbilisi, Thursday evening, protesting a visit from Sergey Gavrilov, a member of the Russian Communist Party.  Following the chaotic demonstrations, President Salome Zourabichvili wrote on Facebook late Thursday: \"Russia is our enemy and occupier. Today, the Fifth Column orchestrated by Russia might become more dangerous than open aggression.\"ICC opens investigation into Georgia-Russia warZourabichvili described the events in parliament as \"humiliating the country and insulting its dignity,\" but added that \"in no case does this justify the artificially stirred wave of anti-state actions aimed at storming the parliament and overthrowing the authorities.\" On Friday, Moscow expressed its \"extreme disapproval\" over the protests, which it labeled a \"Russophobic provocation.\" Read More\"One certainly can't help being extremely concerned over the fact that there were aggressive outpourings directed at Russian citizens,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call. Controversial visitAccording to Russian state news agency TASS, Gavrilov opened a session of the assembly at the Georgian parliament building and infuriated Georgian opposition deputies by sitting in the speaker's chair. Reuters reported that the lawmaker also addressed delegates in Russian, rather than the local language.The Kremlin described the protests as a 'Russophobic provocation.'Members of the opposition rushed the podium in protest. Gavrilov told Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that he was doused with water by protesting Georgian deputies.\"They broke into the hall, seized the rostrum and my seat,\" he said. \"We had a break, they started looking for me, tearing up documents, pouring water on me ... showing portraits of Putin.\"As protesters outside tried to enter the parliament, police used tear gas to disperse them, CNN witnessed. Some protesters appeared bloodied from skirmishes with law enforcement, while others had taken official shields and riot gear from the police.Georgia was part of the Soviet Union until 1991, and in recent years has struggled with tensions with Russia over Moscow's support for its breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Gavrilov told RIA-Novosti that he believed Georgian protesters demanded his removal because of his alleged participation in the separatist conflict in Abkhazia in the early 1990s. A member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Gavrilov has said he never participated in any armed conflicts.Georgian police used tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters attempting to storm the country's parliament.Tensions flared between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 over a Russian-backed separatist movement in the province of South Ossetia, when then-Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops to regain control over the self-proclaimed autonomous region. Russia responded by moving tanks and soldiers through South Ossetia and advancing farther into Georgian territory.When the fighting ended, Russia's military pulled back only as far as South Ossetia, which it sees as an independent state.CNN's Olga Pavlova and Warda Al-Jawahiry contributed to this report.",

Allowing the goalkeeper to have only one foot touching the goalline (or, if jumping, in line with the goal line) when the penalty kick is taken is a more practical approach as it is easier to identify if both feet are not on the line.\"As the kicker can 'stutter' in the run, it is reasonable that the goalkeeper can take one step in anticipation of the kick.\"JUST WATCHEDVAR -- what's the deal?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVAR -- what's the deal? 01:36READ: Hope Solo pulling no punches as TV punditNot only are the rules clear, players and coaches have had them explained to them and were made fully aware of them going into the tournament.Solo, who won 202 caps for the US, says she always felt that stepping off the line was a \"hindrance more than an advantage\" when facing a penalty.\"A GK inching off their line before the kick doesn't help, and it hurts the spirit of the game when VAR calls back penalties and keepers get cards in these scenarios.

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK's future now rests in the hands of 0.2% of its population. The final two candidates hoping to replace Theresa May as prime minister will spend the next month trying to win over 160,000 grassroots members of the governing Conservative party. The winner will immediately take over the party and, all being well, form their own government for a nation of 66 million citizens.The last two men standing are the favorite, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, who took Johnson's job as foreign secretary after he resigned in protest at May's Brexit plan.Johnson, the nailed-on favorite, has tried to pitch himself as both the only man that can take the UK out of the European Union on October 31 -- whether the UK has a deal with Brussels or not -- and the sole candidate with enough charisma to unite the bitterly divided Conservative party.Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson leaves his home on Thursday.His rival, Hunt, has a slightly softer pitch but has still said that he would support a no-deal exit rather than no Brexit at all.Read MoreFor whoever wins, it is fated to be the bitterest of bittersweet victories. Ever since the EU granted an extension to the Brexit deadline back in April, nothing of substance has changed and the UK remains stuck in agonizing political gridlock.Both wannabe PMs might claim they have a plan to secure a different deal with the EU. But neither has any evidence for this, other than a belief that their energy and optimism will be enough to convince the other 27 EU member states to reconsider an international treaty that took the best part of two years to negotiate.Boris Johnson might be exactly the Brexit prime minister Brussels needsEurope says that the Withdrawal Agreement -- the terms by which the UK immediately leaves the EU before moving to negotiating a further relationship, often referred to as May's Brexit deal -- is still the only deal on the table. Not only are European leaders unwilling to reopen talks on the Withdrawal Agreement, they are increasingly preparing for a reality in which it may never pass and a no-deal Brexit would become inevitable.The new prime minister will not only have to deal with this, but also the fact that they won't command a majority in British parliament. Therefore, any Brexit deal realistically requires compromise with members of other political parties. After seeing her deal fail, May tried to work with the opposition Labour Party to agree a softer Brexit position, but those talks collapsed before getting off the ground.Both Johnson and Hunt think that there is only one direction in which they can compromise: to reach an agreement with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, who, in theory, prop up the minority Conservative government.But, only in theory. The DUP has voted down May's deal three times, as it believes the deal dangers the sanctity of the United Kingdom and paves the way for a united Ireland -- their worst fear.Boris Johnson, sitting next to UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, checks his watch during the Conservative Leadership debate on June 18.May's deal contains a controversial clause called the Irish Border Backstop, which essentially keeps the UK in a Customs Union with the EU in order to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland, which remains a part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member.The DUP won't sign off on a deal that could ultimately see Northern Ireland move closer to unification with the south, so without a reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement and a change or removal of the backstop, they will never back this deal. And both Conservative MPs and grassroot members are happily using the DUP's obstinance as a reason not to back May's deal. No DUP, no Conservative consensus, no deal.On the Irish side of the argument, the history of violence on the island of Ireland is the primary reason for avoiding any kind of customs border. It is an absolute red line for Ireland, and therefore a red line for the EU.Brexit chaos could push the UK economy into reverse this quarterYou've probably spotted the problem: The EU won't move on an issue that is fundamental for the DUP to approve a Brexit deal. So, Johnson and Hunt's claim that they can get the extra assurances are optimistic at best and dreaming of unicorns at worst.This is the reality that the new PM will have to deal with from day one: A minority government bitterly divided on Brexit in its own right, the DUP digging its heels in, a membership looking for any reason to dismiss May's deal and a parliament that cannot agree on anything.Throw into the mix the fact that the opposition Labour party is edging closer by the day to becoming a party that paves the way to scrapping Brexit altogether -- in a nation that only voted to leave the EU by a margin of 4% -- and the potential for political chaos becomes even clearer.While the 160,000 Conservative members select the next prime minister for the rest of the country, they should think carefully about the landscape the anointed leader will suddenly be catapulted into.If the next UK leader cannot get changes from the EU, they will either have to dress up May's deal with some extra concessions and try to charm parliament into backing it, or agitate for a no-deal Brexit. At which point, the mother of all parliaments might decide to flex its muscles, bring down the government and force a general election.It's really that serious.Brexit hasn't gone away and the structural problems it has caused have not been addressed. When EU Council President Donald Tusk said that the UK must not waste its time after granting the most recent extension, a leadership psychodrama was probably not what he had in mind.",

Since 2009, there have been 27 international players drafted in the top 10, including 17 in the top five.Canada has the chance to surpass France, which had five selections in 2016, for the record for most draftees from a non-US country in one draft. Leading the Canadian group is Barrett, whose godfather is former NBA star and fellow Canadian Steve Nash. Before Williamson's stock took off, Barrett was seen as the potential top pick. Also notable, Rui Hachimura is poised to be the first Japanese player to be drafted in the first round.The Toronto Raptors -- the first NBA champion outside of the US -- featured five international players from five countries on their roster, and team president Masai Ujiri is Nigerian.",

To avoid parental disapproval, some women have to sneak out of their homes just to play. Players are trolled for their gender, and let's not even mention the gender pay gap.Thousands of miles away from that grassroots reality, there are three African countries at the Women's World Cup in France -- Nigeria, South Africa, and Cameroon. And as former Nigerian national team player, Ayisat Yusuf-Aromire watches the current Super Falcons team take center stage at the tournament, she is painfully aware of how women's football has often been relegated to the back seat with bonuses and allowances unpaid.Now a coach at FC Pohu club in Finland, Yusuf-Aromire says even though some progress has been made, the Nigerian men's team still enjoys far better privileges than the women's.\"Men get better treatment for everything -- camping allowances, salaries, wages, and welfare packages,\" she told CNN.Read MoreThe African teams represented at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France. The ex-footballer, who played defense for Nigeria's national team, still has unhappy memories of the 2004 African Women's Championship (now the Africa Women Cup of Nations), organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF).Yusuf-Aromire, 34, remembers staging a sit-in protest with her teammates in South Africa after winning the championship. \"We defeated Cameroon 5-0 in the finals, winning the title. But Nigeria's Football Federation refused to pay us our bonuses and pending allowances, claiming they did not have any money,\" she told CNN.\"We did not trust them to pay us in Nigeria, so we refused to leave our hotel in South Africa till they paid us,\" she added.The Super Falcons eventually got their bills settled after pressure from players and the media.In 2016, the Super Falcons staged a similar protest over unpaid bonuses outside Nigeria's parliament after winning the Africa Women Cup of Nations in Cameroon. CNN contacted the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) for comment but has not yet received a response.  Unequal payLate payments for footballers of both sexes are a chronic problem on the continent, but pay disparities between male and female players are even more prevalent. South Africa's Times Live reported earlier this year that the national women's team -- Banyana Banyana -- were paid 10 times less than the men's side, Bafana Bafana.JUST WATCHEDTanzania soccer freestyle queen ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTanzania soccer freestyle queen  00:42Banyana players received R5,000 (about $338) in a competitive match for a win, while Bafana players received as much as R60,0000 (about $4,000) when they won a game, according to a report in South Africa's Times Live. However, in May, South Africa's Football Association took steps to redress the balance by increasing Banyana Banyana's pay, making it equivalent to their male counterparts for the first time, according to a report in Times Live newspaper.The IFP Women's Brigade welcomes the news of equal pay for Banyana-Banyana which has been long due. For the longest time, women's football has been treated with disdain in this country. We believe they actually deserve more.

The NFF told CNN it conducted a pay review in 2017 resulting in basic match bonuses for the Super Falcons being raised to $3,000 per player, while the basic bonus for the men's team was reduced from $10,000 to $5,000 per player. It's noteworthy that none of the highest paid female footballers in the world are African players.Norwegian footballer, Ada Hegerberg tops the list of well-paid women with an annual income of \u20ac400,000 (about $451,660), but it is still about 282 times less than Lionel Messi, who is the highest paid male footballer earning $127 million. Poor publicityThe enormous pay gap in the African game can partly be attributed to poor handling of female football teams by their sports associations, says Samuel Ahmadu, a member of the women's committee for the NFF (Nigeria Football Federation).\"Marketing and promotion have not been enough for these women and their teams. If there is no consistency in promoting them, then there will be little attention for their tournaments and games,\" he told CNN.Football tournament sponsors typically pay attention to teams that enjoy large viewership. Women's teams in Africa struggle to attract sponsors for their games due to poor publicity, says Ahmadu. Women's World Cup: 'Football is life' -- Nigeria's plan to become a force in women's footballThe 2017 Africa Cup of Nations organized by CAF and sponsored by companies like oil and gas company Total offered, a $4 million prize to the winners of the competition. The following year, AWCON, the women's version of the tournament, offered just $80,000 to the winners. Twenty-five countries in Africa including Ghana, Cameroon, and South Africa have professional women's leagues at home, but minimal sponsorship opportunities and prizes mean that most players have to balance the game with other work commitments, says Ahmadu.Abuse, sexism, and harassmentBesides the divides in pay, sponsorship, and marketing, Africa's female players have to contend with discrimination on and off the pitch.Lolade Adewuyi, a chief strategist for the Nigerian sports communications company CampsBay Media, says there are sexist cultural beliefs that encourage prejudice against women in sports on the continent.\"There are obvious cultural barriers for women getting into sports. While the boys are allowed to go play out in the neighborhood, girls have to help in the house,\" he said.JUST WATCHEDFIFA Women's World Cup: Bigger, better, bolderReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFIFA Women's World Cup: Bigger, better, bolder 02:01\"Boys are conditioned from an early age to see sports as a way of proving their masculinity while many girls are conditioned differently,\" Adewuyi added.Yusuf-Aromire also admits fighting patriarchy at many levels to get to where she is today. \"To play football, I had to sneak out of the house. I used to get punished for just playing. At a point I had to stand up for myself because I didn't have the support of my family,\" she said.Women football players also face abuse and derogatory remarks while on the pitch.South African defender, Nothando Vilakazi was trolled about her gender during the 2016 Rio Olympics after a picture showing her hands over her groin area during a match surfaced online.In the same year, a senior official with the Nigerian Football Federation blamed the country's failure to qualify for the Rio Olympics on 'lesbian players.'

There are also plans to launch an African Women's Champions League, according to Yasmine Arkoub, co-founder of sports consulting firm, Melting Sports, who says she is encouraged by the interest level from CAF in improving participation in women's football. Ex-Super Falcons player Yusuf-Aromire has also launched the SheFootball Initiative to encourage young Nigerian girls to get on the pitch.\"I created the campaign because I thought about my upbringing. I never had parental support to play, and I want it to be different for other girls out there,\" she told CNN.Yusuf-Aromire offers training for girls and provides football kits for those who can't afford them.  \"There are a million girls out there who want to play football but are not being encouraged. They just need the support and access to opportunities,\" she said.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was a mystery for nearly 30 years.A hunter turned over a whale skull that appeared to share the characteristics of both a beluga whale and a narwhal. Scientists were stumped. But, years after revisiting the anomaly, a group of Danish researchers decided it was a hybrid whale all along.The unique skull, they say, was the result of a forbidden romance between a narwhal mother and a beluga father.Read MoreIt's the only known evidence of a hybrid between the two Arctic whales, they wrote, in a study was published Thursday in the journal Science Reports.Researchers recovered the skull in 1990 from a hunter who caught the whale in West Greenland's Disko Bay. He described the whale as gray in color with the short, round pectoral flippers of a beluga whale and the streamlined fluke, or tail, of a narwhal. The skull was larger than those of its presumed parents, and its teeth, positioned horizontally, didn't belong to either species. The hunter also captured two other similar-looking whales, though no samples remained of them. The skull sat unidentified at the National Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen for years, until researchers took it up again. The skull contained DNA from a female narwhal, an elusive species known for the long tooth that protrudes from male narwhal's lips and earned them the nickname \"unicorn of the sea.\"  To settle the whale's parentage once and for all, researchers analyzed the skull's DNA sequences against those of eight belugas and eight narwhals and the tooth and bone samples from both. The skull, they decided, belonged to a male hybrid -- a first-generation hybrid based on the 50-50 split of his DNA. His teeth helped scientists ID the whale, too: Male narwhals only have one tooth, which takes the form of its famous tusk, protruding through its lip and out up to 8 feet. Male belugas, meanwhile, can fit up to 40 teeth.While the Arctic's only two-toothed whale species share the same migratory patterns, opting to partner up in the spring after the sea ice breaks up and traveling to their summering grounds, not much else is known about their secretive breeding processes. But in Disko Bay, both species congregate in large numbers during mating season and individuals in both species have been spotted traveling with the pods of the other. Cross-species mating, while never before recorded, may be a rare occurrence. It's already earned the nickname \"narluga.\" And of course it happened in Disko Bay.",

Many have been trapped on the islands for six years.\"The situation of their indefinite and prolonged confinement, exacerbated by the lack of appropriate medical care amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment according to international standards,\" the UN rights experts said in the statement.  Read MoreEven if found to be refugees, the asylum seekers are not permitted to settle in Australia and must either go home, hope for relocation to a third country, or remain in Papua New Guinea or the remote island of Nauru. Some are also sent to the United States.Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told the ABC on Sunday that 531 had been settled in the US under the deal struck with former US President Barack Obama, while another 295 applications were being processed. However, he said it was unlikely that all 1,250 places agreed under the deal would be filled.

The situation is out of control & needs to be stopped,\" he tweeted Wednesday.Joyce Chia, director of policy with the non-profit Refugee Council of Australia said every day the group was receiving calls from advocates troubled that men who had shown resilience for years in a difficult situation were starting to crumble. \"We wake up every day hoping that somebody hasn't taken their own life,\" Chia said. \"We are in an incredibly critical situation... seasoned professionals have never seen anything like this.\"Since the election there have been over 90 suicide attempts & incidents of self harm by more THAN 62 highly depressed men on #Manus It is getting worse, the men have lost hope and are falling one by one.

The only thing that helps refugees in Manus and Nauru is freedom. Only freedom helps people and the only solution is freedom,\" he said via WhatsApp.The United Nations has repeatedly called Australia out on its immigration policy, most recently in a letter delivered in April where the government was asked to explain how its policy of indefinite detention is compatible with international human rights law. In its written response, provided by the UN, Australia said the health of refugees was of \"paramount importance\" to the governments of Australia, PNG and Nauru. The response, dated June 3, added that Australia \"does not accept the allegations that asylum seekers and refugees lack access to appropriate healthcare in Nauru and PNG.\"Dutton told the ABC that he was looking for ways to remove refugees from the islands.\"I want people off Manus and Nauru overnight, but I want to do it in a way that doesn't restart boats, and kids drowning again at sea,\" he said. Australia's Home Affairs department told CNN Wednesday that the government provides \"significant support\" to PNG and Nauru to provide \"comprehensive health services\" to refugees.But Chia said those health services are not enough to help refugees who had lost all hope.\"The situation is created by a loss of hope... what we need is a circuit breaker, so people can see a way out,\" Chia said.",

Citing experts, TASS said there are 22,000 to 31,000 polar bears in the world. In the north of Krasnoyarsk, a vast administrative region in Siberia, the bears inhabit the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean, the agency added.In April, a starving polar bear was spotted in the village of Tilichiki in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, also hundreds of miles from its usual habitat.

        "content": "(CNN)Australia's highest court ruled unanimously Wednesday that a sperm donor who had been actively involved in his daughter's life should be granted rights as a legal parent of the 11-year-old girl.According to the High Court decision, the judge accepted that the 49-year-old Australian man had donated sperm to the girl's biological mother in 2006 with the intention of raising the child together.A lower court's decision had previously ruled that the man was a \"sperm donor\" and denied of his status as a parent.An Australian legal expert said that while the ruling shouldn't be reason to \"panic\" for future parents considering using a sperm or egg donor, it highlighted the need to be cautious.\"We need to be careful when making these long-term life decisions. In the long term, the court won't consider what we thought at the time, or what we planned, but what is in the child's best interests,\" said Cassandra Seery, an associate lecturer in Law at Deakin University.Read MoreThe court documents used the pseudonyms Robert Masson for the donor and Susan Parsons for the girl's biological mother.\"He believed that he was fathering the child and would thus support and care for her. His name was entered on the child's birth certificate as her father,'' the judgment summary said.JUST WATCHEDDid sperm donor lie about criminal and health history?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDid sperm donor lie about criminal and health history? 02:09However, after the child's conception, the biological parents had a disagreement, and the girl lived apart from Masson, with Parsons and her partner.Yet the man continued to be heavily involved in the girl's life, playing an \"ongoing role in the child's financial support, health, education and general welfare,\" according to court documents.In 2015, Parsons and her partner announced that they planned to move to New Zealand with the girl. Masson initiated court proceedings, launching his lengthy legal battle for recognition as a parent, blocking the child and her family from moving overseas.According to court documents, the Family Court of Australia ruled against Masson who then appealed to the High Court in the capital of Canberra.Eventually, the judge deemed Masson's relationship with the child as an \"extremely close and secure\" attachment, and believed that his role in the girl's life surpassed that of a sperm donor. Masson's lawyer, Tahlia Bleier, said that the term \"sperm donor\" implies that the man \"does no more than provide his semen.\"She argued that her client didn't suit this label, saying his \"the established intention to co-parent and his enduring relationship and involvement\" with the girl demonstrated his desire to be a father to his daughter.Two dads, an egg donor and a surrogate: How a freezer failure changed everything\"Potentially we'll see an increase of cases in family court of donors seeking involvement in a child's life. Time will tell,\" Bleier said.The High Court didn't immediately respond to a request to be put in touch with the lawyers for Parsons and her partner.Legal expert Seery said that while the ruling could appear to have far-reaching consequences for parents with children by anonymous sperm donors, the High Court decision was in many ways a special case.\"The sperm donor in this case clearly had a long-term ongoing connection with the child in question, they had a relationship that went beyond just visitations,\" she said, saying it would likely have been a different situation if the donor had been anonymous.But Seery added that it wasn't just LGBTQ couples or single parents who were vulnerable to these kinds of disputes. \"These kind of parental conflicts can and do arise and it's just about everyone taking care when they're thinking about a child,\" she said.",

But their time together was cut short for what the church considered a disruption and Rimmer considered \"rejection.\"The family was to attend Sunday's Evensong, a mostly sung-through evening service, at King's College Chapel in Cambridge, England. The event was particularly thrilling for Rimmer's 9-year-old son, Tristan, who loves the 16th-century church's ceilings and famed Latin chorales. And because he has autism and is nonverbal, he expresses his excitement primarily through laughter and calls, his dad explained.But before the end of the service, an usher asked Tristan and his family to leave on the grounds that he was disrupting fellow parishioners, Rimmer said.In a biting letter addressed to the college's dean, the Rev. Dr. Stephen Cherry, Rimmer frames his grievances as a faux-apology for \"lessening the satisfaction\" of tourists who visit the chapel and who found his son's form of worship offensive. Read MoreOn Monday, he published the letter on Facebook, where it's been shared nearly 6,000 times. \"My son might not be able to talk, but he knows perfectly well what is going on around him,\" he wrote. \"He isn't even ten years old and he knows that he is unwelcome.\" Rimmer, who teaches astrophysics at the University of Cambridge, said the incident wasn't the first time his family had been asked to leave a church but marked the only occasion a member of the clergy asked for their removal. \"Might I suggest that you place a sign at the front of the chapel, clearly identifying which categories of people are welcome and which are not?\" he wrote. Cherry issued an apology on his blog the same day Rimmer shared the letter. The chapel dean said he \"failed [Rimmer] and Tristan\" at the service but denied that he personally called for the family's removal. \"Nonetheless as Dean I do take responsibility for the whole life of the Chapel and in that regard I express my unreserved apology and intention that we will do better in the future.\" Paul Rimmer said his son, who has autism, was asked to leave King's College Chapel in Cambridge during a Father's Day service. In an update, Rimmer said he was \"touched\" by the several dozen churches that invited his son to attend and worship the way he wanted as well as the countless parents of children with autism who offered their support. The dean met with Rimmer, who said they had a positive conversation about how to make the chapel accessible to all its parishioners. Public and private institutions like churches and schools aren't always sensory friendly for children and adults with autism. A 2018 study found that children with autism were nearly twice as likely to never attend religious services compared to children without the diagnosis, largely because they or their families felt unwelcome in places of worship. The diocese of Ely that includes King's College Chapel hasn't shared efforts its made in making its churches autism-friendly, but the Church of England allows the deaf and people with disabilities to serve as ministers. Rimmer and Cherry didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "(CNN)Talking to the BBC at half-time with his side 1-0 up, England coach Phil Neville said that his team was facing the best goalkeeper at the Women's World Cup. The evidence over 90 minutes to back up the Englishman's claim was compelling. Japan may have ultimately fallen to a 2-0 defeat to England in its final group game, but goalkeeper Ayaka Yamashita certainly stood out, as has many a goalkeeper in this tournament. Were it not for the goalkeeper's acrobatics in Nice the defeat to an England team which has now won eight matches in a row at major tournaments -- and qualified from the group stages of a World Cup with a 100% record for the first time in its history -- would certainly have been heavier. In the first half the 23-year-old made a reflex save to prevent Rachel Daly from doubling England's advantage, while after the break she was at full stretch to push away Tony Duggan's half volley. \n\n\n\n\nArguably Yamashita came off her line a touch too quickly to make Ellen White's first of two goals a far simpler chance than it otherwise would have been -- but that was the only blot on an impressive display. Read MoreStanding at 5 feet, 5 inches, the Nippon TV Beleza player is certainly not a towering presence, but she has added her name to the list of fine goalkeeping performances witnessed in France.  Indeed, both goalkeepers shone in the south of France. In the eighth minute, England's Karen Bardsley, criticized for costly errors in the past, produced a stunning save to keep out Kumi Yokoyama's free kick. READ: Marta makes World Cup historyYamashita produced a string of fine saves against England. The debate to make goals smallerFemale goalkeepers have long been the subject of mockery by those who wish to pour scorn on the women's game. It is the stick which is often used to beat the women's game. Is this the tournament which has put the goalkeeping debate to bed? Not quite, perhaps. In a column in the English newspaper, The Times, Emma Hayes, manager of English side Chelsea Women, remarked that \"no one ever thought to question whether it makes sense\" for goal sizes to be the same in both the men's and women's game. \"It's not sexist to call for smaller pitches and goals for women,\" rang the headline on the opinion piece. In the article published on June 13, Hayes argued that the size of goals should be smaller, pointing out that the height of hurdles in track and field differ for the sexes. The average height for women in England at least, Hayes argued, was 5 feet, 5 inches, while on average English males were 5 feet, 9 inches. US defender Crystal Dunn has disagreed with Hayes' comments this week, saying that Christine Endler's goal-stopping display against the US was \"testament\" that the goals are \"exactly the size they need to be.\" READ: Christiane Endler -- the goalkeeper opening doors for other womenEndler is the first player to captain Chile at a Women's World Cup. Were it not for the Chilean, her country could have suffered a thrashing against the US. Instead, the World Cup debutants fell to a 3-0 loss, a respectable score against the defending champions considering the 13-0 scoreline Thailand suffered in the US' first game. Player-of-the-match performances from Argentina's Vanina Correa and Endler in the group stages suggest goal sizes are fine as they are. Yamashita's display supported that, too. \"Not enough respect goes to the coaches and the goalkeepers that are performing fantastically,\" said England boss Neville after Correa's eye-catching performance against his team. In her column with the Guardian, former US goalkeeper Hope Solo explained that the position was one of the last aspects of the women's game to develop because of a lack of resources. \"Goalkeeper coaches are often the last hired on many professional teams,\" the American wrote. Endler, said Solo, was a \"one in a million\" goalkeeper. The Chilean emerges from this tournament with her reputation enhanced, but so too do many others in her position. Correa of Argentina saves a  penalty from England's Nikita Parris.In 18-year-old Chiamaka Nnadozie -- who became the youngest goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet at a World Cup in Nigeria's victory over South Korea -- the Super Falcons had a player who had stood up to whatever came her way against France, until the teenager suffered a harsh lesson on the biggest stage of all when she was penalized for stepping off her line before Wendi Renard hit her penalty. The same happened in Scotland's equally dramatic match against Argentina on Wednesday.Lee Alexander stepped off her line to save an injury-time penalty, a transgression which gave Florencia Bonsegundo the chance to retake the spot kick, which secured a 3-3 draw for an Argentina team which was 3-0 down until the final 15 minutes. It was the first time in history a team had dragged itself back from 3-0 down at a Women's World Cup. Victory for Scotland would have put the country through to the last 16. Instead, all World Cup debutants have now failed to progress to the knockout stages.A technical error from Alexander proved costly, yes, but the new penalty rule introduced at the beginning of this month which deems that a goalkeeper must have \"at least part of one foot on/in line with the goal line when the kick is taken\" will catch out many a goalkeeper over the coming months, male or female. For all the record scores, for all the hat-tricks, goalkeepers at this World Cup have stood up to the task, whatever size the goal in front of them.",

The White Sox told CNN the fan was conscious and coherent when transported from the ballpark to a hospital, where she was later released.Currently, the netting at Guaranteed Rate Field is installed from the backstop to the outfield end of both dugouts, which extends across the photo pits and exit stairs into the tunnel.Read MoreLast year, Major League Baseball announced that all 30 ballparks were extending protective netting to at least the far ends of both dugouts -- that is, the ends farthest from home plate -- intending to enhance fans' safety.The move came after high-profile incidents in which batted balls struck fans -- including the girl struck at Yankee Stadium in September 2017 and a man who was blinded in one eye by a foul ball during a game at the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field a month earlier.The clubs' moves last year to extend nets to the dugouts' far ends went beyond what MLB recommended in December 2015. Then, the commissioner's office encouraged teams to shield field-level seats up to the dugout ends closest to home plate.The incident at the Cubs-Astros game a couple of weeks ago has renewed calls for increased safety measures at ballparks across the country.CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London  (CNN)A far-right teenager who reportedly branded Prince Harry a \"race traitor\" and suggested he should be shot after his marriage to Meghan Markle has been jailed in Britain for four years and three months. Michal Szewczuk, 19, posted extremist material including an image of the prince with a gun to his head on a blood-spattered background, the UK Press Association (PA) news agency reported. Published months after Harry's wedding to Meghan, whose mother is African-American, the image also featured a swastika and the phrase: \"See Ya Later Race Traitor.\" Szewczuk was sentenced at the Old Bailey in London Tuesday, after pleading guilty to two counts of encouraging terrorism and five accounts of possessing terrorist material, the UK's Counter Terrorism Policing (CTP) unit confirmed in a statement. Among the materials in Szewczuk's possession was the White Resistance Manual -- a white supremacist handbook -- and the al Qaeda Training Manual, PA said.Read MoreMichael Szewczuk reportedly branded Prince Harry a \"race traitor\" in online posts. Szewczuk, who is of Polish descent but lives in Leeds, northern England, also wrote an \"extremely violent and aggressively misogynistic\" blog which attempted to justify the rape of women and children in the pursuit of an Aryan race, the court heard.The 19-year-old is to be detained in a young offenders institution, PA reported. He was sentenced alongside Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, 18, from West London, who received an 18-month detention and training order after admitting to two counts of encouraging terrorism, CTP confirmed. Dunn-Koczorowski's posts included support for Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist who killed 77 people in 2011, and material threatening the ethnic cleansing of Albanians. Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, who is head of CTP North East, said that Szewczuk and Dunn-Koczorowski \"see themselves as superior to the majority of society\" and \"feel their duty is to express their beliefs, in turn teaching others.\" Britain sees surge in far-right activity flagged to its anti-terrorism program\"The considerable amount of material they have posted on social media channels not only reflects their extremist beliefs but was intended to encourage others to carry out despicable acts,\" he said in a statement seen by CNN. \"Both men have developed and evolved their interest in the extreme right-wing ideology over time through research and connecting with like-minded individuals.\"Judge Rebecca Poulet, who presided over the case, described Szewczuk's images as \"abhorrent as well as criminal by reason of their intention to encourage terrorist acts.\"\"Individuals were urged to go out and commit appalling acts of violence on others for no reason that can ever be understood by any right-thinking individuals,\" she told Szewczuk in court, according to PA. A pro-migrant German politician was shot dead. Officials now suspect a far-right motiveWhen handing down the sentence to Dunn-Koczorowski, Poulet noted that he still held \"deeply entrenched views in support of this extreme right-wing ideology.\" This was echoed by his lawyer, David Kitson, who pointed to a medical report which stated that the teenager had a \"lack of remorse.\" Naomi Parsons, the prosecutor in the case, said that the pair's posts \"convey a message of the threat of and/or use of serious violence against others, in order to advance a political, ideological and racial cause and in this way encourage terrorism.\" She added that the targets of their posts included non-white people, the Jewish population and anyone \"perceived to be complicit in the perpetuation of multi-culturalism.\" The defendants, who had only met each other online, were arrested last December as part of a pre-planned police operation, the CTP said. Szewczuk, who was studying computer science at Portsmouth University, was arrested at his halls of residence, while Dunn-Koczorowski was detained at his home in London.

Three Russians, Igor Girkin, Sergey Dubinskiy and Oleg Pulatov, were named, along with Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko.The flight was on its way from Amsterdam to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur in July 2014, when it was shot out of the sky over territory held by pro-Russian separatists.According to investigators, Girkin is a former colonel of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), Dubinskiy was employed by Russia's military intelligence agency GRU and Pulatov was a former soldier of the Russian special forces, Spetsnaz-GRU.Ukraine's Kharchenko had no military background, but is believed to have led a combat unit in Donetwsk in July 2014.Read MoreDebris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 sits in a field at the plane crash site in Hrabove, Ukraine.While the suspects are not accused of firing the missile at MH17, they are \"just as punishable as the person who committed the crime,\" Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said.All four are charged with \"causing the crash of MH17, leading to the death of all the people on board ... and murdering 298 passengers of flight MH17,\" Westerbeke said.He added that they are suspected of obtaining the Buk missile \"with the goal to shoot a plane.\"The trial of the four men will take place on March 9, 2020 at the Schiphol Judicial Complex in Badhoevedorp, investigators said, adding that the accused will be tried in absentia if necessary.Investigators said they would not ask for the suspects to be extradited because the Russian and Ukrainian constitutions prohibit extraditing nationals. However added that they would ask Russia to cooperate with the investigation, and both countries to question the suspects about the charges.Flowers, soft toys along with pictures are left among the wreckage at the site of the crash of a Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 298 people from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, welcomed the charges from the international investigators and said he hopes all guilty parties face justice.\"Ukraine welcomes the conclusions of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) regarding MH17,\" said a tweet posted Wednesday on the account of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine.\"The President of Ukraine hopes that not only those the Security Service of Ukraine has announced suspicions about today, but also those who are guilty of the deliberate murder of innocent children, women and men, will be put in the dock,\" the tweet continued.During a Q&A following the briefing on Wednesday, Ukraine said it would try to arrest Kharchenko.Later on Wednesday Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the findings were \"absolutely unfounded accusations,\" and that the JIT press conference was aimed at \"discrediting\" Russia. \"No concrete evidence this time was shown to back up such unlawful statements,\" the MFA said in a statement posted online. It also disputed that Russia has refused to fully cooperate with the investigation.\"We strongly reject such accusations,\" the statement read. \"From the first day of the tragedy, the Russian Federation was highly interested in establishing the truth and is ready to provide all-round assistance to the investigation.\"Missile that downed MH17 'owned by Russian brigade'Meanwhile Girkin -- one of the suspects who acted as defense minister for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic -- said separatists in eastern Ukraine were not responsible for downing the Boeing aircraft, adding that investigators had not contacted him about the case.\"The (separatist) rebels did not down the Boeing, and I cannot comment further or clarify,\" he told Russia's Business FM radio.Asked if the JIT had contacted him -- which is made up of five countries: Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine -- Girkin said, \"No, they have not contacted me.\"Investigators announced in 2018 that the flight had been brought down by a missile fired from a launcher belonging to Russia's 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade.

The 28-year-old from Ontario, Canada, has finished on the podium in each of the last three years at the CrossFit Games, finishing second in 2018.Splitting his timeRead MoreRemarkably, while his contemporaries trained full-time, Vellner was still in school studying to become a chiropractor, though the former gymnast doesn't feel this academic commitment weighs against him.\"It's like an escapist kind of mentality, that I can escape from my schoolwork by going to the gym and I can escape from the gym by going into my schoolwork and that's what I do,\" he told CNN Sport. \"And it keeps me sane.\"Vellner crosses the finish line.At the 2018 CrossFit Games, Vellner suffered a myriad of misfortunes, enough to derail the toughest of competitors.In the opening event, a cycling criterium, or \"crit,\" Vellner crashed, resulting in him having to race part of the course carrying his bike until a replacement could be found. READ: How CrossFit's power couple met as teenagersThen during the \"Battleground\" obstacle course, Vellner's leg got caught in a rope ladder, causing him to fall 15 feet to the ground, landing on his shoulder. He even had to deal with a piece of rogue weightlifting equipment somehow rolling away mid-event, forcing him to chase after it across the competition floor, costing him vital seconds. Bouncing backVellner dusted himself off, carried on and still managed to finish second. It's this workmanlike attitude, partnered with the fact that he's not a full-time athlete that has contributed to Vellner becoming a fan favorite among the CrossFit faithful, regularly receiving rapturous applause above and beyond any of his rivals.Vellner will continue to work as a chiropractor and balance his CrossFit career as well.\"I noticed it last year.\" Vellner said. \"And that's cool. It's something that I'm proud of. But I think that to a certain degree it's a result of how I've managed to get to where I've been. \"I've had a lot of little injuries. Last year was a comical year with the amount of mistakes I made and little things that happened. But you know, like I said, I just dust myself off and I keep chugging forward.

I don't make it look easy. But I get it done.\"Toppling the kingIn August, the CrossFit Games will once again be held in Madison, Wisconsin, where Vellner will join the field competing for the title \"The Fittest Man on Earth.\" The one man standing in his way will once again be Fraser, the three-time defending champion, whose dominance in the sport has made it seem like everyone else is competing for second. Vellner celebrates with his medal.But Vellner believes Fraser is beatable, and that he could well be the one to do it. \"Is it going to be easy? Absolutely not,\" Vellner acknowledges. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"If I think that he's going to roll over, he's not going to. He doesn't make it easy for anybody and I wouldn't want him to, frankly. \"So it's going to be a good test. It's going to take most of what I have in me, but I'm willing to give it a shot. So we'll see.\"",

It was a record-breaking evening in both Group C matches as Havana Solaunn scored Jamaica's first Women's World Cup goal, but it was not enough to prevent the Reggae Girlz from falling to defeat as four goals from Sam Kerr -- the first Australian player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup -- sealed a comfortable 4-1 win for the Matildas. Tuesday's results mean Italy, Brazil and Australia qualify for the knockout stages while Jamaica, the first Caribbean country to play in the Women's World Cup, fail to progress after three defeats in three matches. READ: Sam Kerr -- Australia's million dollar playerRead MoreMarta celebrates with teammates after her record-breaking goal.Marta, a six-time FIFA Player of the Year and widely regarded as the greatest woman to ever play the game, celebrated her feat by kissing her boot. Arriving in France nursing a muscle strain, the 33-year-old has featured in just two of Brazil's three group games -- being on the pitch for a total of just 129 minutes -- but she has made an impact on both occasions, scoring on Tuesday to break Klose's record and finding the net against Australia last week to become the first player to score in five Women's World Cups. \n\n\n\n\nWith 17 goals in 19 matches, Marta now has two more World Cup goals than her compatriot Ronaldo and five more than Brazilian icon Pele, a three-time World Cup winner.For all her individual accolades, however, the Brazil captain has never won the World Cup, her best finish a runner-up medal in 2007. But if Marta is to become a World Cup winner this year, Brazil will need to improve. The former finalists have been far from convincing even as Marta's strike from the spot, after a harshly awarded penalty in the 74th minute when Italy defender Elena Linari barged into Debinha inside the box, made sure of progress to the last 16. Their opponent will be either France or two-time champion Germany.\"We were obviously targeting the first place in the group, but this is a World Cup after all,\" Marta told reporters. \"Now it doesn't matter who will cross our path. We can't choose it. We have cleared a goal of ours: qualifying. Now it's a matter to get ready and to try to go further.\"Marta celebrates with Brazil's midfielder Thaisa after scoring against Italy. Despite the loss, Italy -- which had qualified for the knockout stages for the first time since 1991 with a game to spare -- topped Group C on goal difference.READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in JamaicaKerr makes history tooKerr has now scored five goals for Australia in France. In Grenoble, Australia captain Kerr was in a ruthless mood. Her four goals against Jamaica made her joint top scorer of the tournament alongside American Alex Morgan. No Australian has scored more in a single Women's World Cup.  In theory, Jamaica could have qualified for the knockout stages but the minimum requirement was to beat Australia, an unlikely outcome after Kerr's two first half headers. Shortly after the break, substitute Solaun halved the deficit by collecting Khadija Shaw's through ball and finding the bottom right corner of the net. But that was as good as it got for the Reggae Girlz. Kerr pounced again in the 69th and 83rd minutes to seal a victory which put the Matildas, second in Group C on goal difference, on course for a last-16 tie against Norway in Nice on June 22. \"She's an inspirational leader,\" said Australian coach Ante Milic of Kerr. \"We should be thankful we're witnessing one of the best players in the world live. She got her rewards and fully deserved it. She's a special one. I'm delighted for her. It's history. All of the accolades must go to her but also the service she got from the rest of the team.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Just approaching Royal Ascot, there's something special in the air. Maybe it's the sound of bellowing laughs and brass bands that ring out from the parade ring, or perhaps it's the high fashion and lavish hats adorning the throngs of racegoers filing into the historic Berkshire venue. More pertinent, though, and what really sets this event out from the rest, is the royal seal of approval. Royal Ascot: Tracking Britain's most famous family at the racesBritain's Queen Elizabeth II has attended every day of every meeting for the last 64 years and her arrival at the head of the royal procession traditionally heralds the start of racing. This year was no different, and racegoers rushed to the track side to see the monarch and her royal entourage making their way in horse-drawn carriages up the Straight Mile in front of the packed grandstands. Read MoreThe 93-year-old Queen, in a cornflower blue coat and hat, was joined in the leading carriage by her middle son, the Duke of York. They were accompanied by the King and Queen of the Netherlands, while the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge occupied the second of four royal carriages.But royal fans hoping for a glimpse of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, were to be disappointed. It's just over six weeks after the birth of their first child Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.READ: Royal Ascot: A quintessentially British iconVisit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosJUST WATCHEDRoyal Ascot's glamour and appealReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoyal Ascot's glamour and appeal 01:35Best of BritishAs the procession made its way towards the Royal Enclosure, the British national anthem rang out as flags waved and cameras clicked furiously. With all the trials and tribulations facing Britain and its politics in recent years, many spectators see the Queen's presence as a chance to celebrate all that's good about the country. After all, it's easy to see where you are -- the grandstand is covered in gigantic British flags and bunting drapes almost every surface imaginable. Royal Ascot: How dress codes and fashion evolved from the 1700s to now\"It's lovely, we get up and sing the national anthem with a bit of passion. You have to be proud,\" one spectator told CNN Sport. \"This is a day you can forget about all of the issues, we just didn't want to miss it.\"As the pomp and ceremony died down, the racing began, and the atmosphere shifted to one of excitement and suspense. Spectators, many of whom have never even been racing before, scanned their race cards and become engulfed in the thrill of the sport of kings. \"To me its the best event of the year. I don't gamble all year but I just love Royal Ascot,\" said eager racegoer Ray, who stayed in a hotel overnight to get to the racetrack early with his wife.The first Group 1 race certainly didn't disappoint either. Lord Glitters, ridden by Daniel Tudhope, left it late to snatch the Queen Anne Stakes by a neck and three-quarters -- winning his connections north of $750,000 (\u00a3600,000) in the process.  READ: Meet the trainer to royals, rulers and billionairesPrince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are undeterred by the rain at Royal Ascot.Brimming with traditionIt's not just the horse racing that attracts flocks of spectators to this part of Berkshire, west of London, every year though. The event is also a celebration of high culture and drips with as much glamor as it does tradition. Top hats and outrageous headpieces bobbed their way around its walkways, their owners stopping for photos or to enjoy the champagne which flows from the numerous drinks stands around the course. Racing at the venue dates back to 1711, and the infamous dress code is perhaps the most obvious tradition on display.  Both men and women must adhere to strict policies depending on which area of the venue they have tickets for. Standards are policed by a specialized team, who swoop in should an item of clothing be deemed irregular.The enjoyment that comes with dressing up is the reason many people have battled the crowds to get here. \"It makes the day, watching everyone walk around,\" said one racegoer, who bought tickets as a special surprise for her husband. \"People look great, it's really nice to see.\"Racegoers are encouraged to express themselves, with the confines of the dress code.Within the guidelines, there is room for women to be ambitious with their choice of hat and some of the outfits on display are simply spectacular. \"I love everything that's British about the dress code,\" said Victoria Burgess, who was celebrating her birthday.\"I feel it's a proud representation of our country. This is us at our best.\"Royal Ascot is certainly a place to be seen. Photographers jostle for position at the entry gates, trying to snap a picture of the prestigious guests that flow into the Royal Enclosure.Those deemed important enough are also given name tags, a mark of prestige at one of the most celebrated social events on the calendar.  It's not just spectators who are expected to dress up though -- many of the staff enjoy honoring years of tradition too. Some experienced track stewards have earned the right to wear classic black bowler or \"coke\" hats, a tradition dating back to 1849.

We have the Kentucky Derby and this is the same sort of thing,\" said one family, who came all the way from Texas, USA.\"It's so beautiful here, we feel so under dressed!

        "content": "(CNN)It took a remarkable six-minute period in the second half for what had been a largely uneventful Women's World Cup match to come to life in Rennes as France beat Nigeria 1-0 in dramatic fashion. The task facing Nigeria's Super Falcons before a partisan 28,267 crowd at Roazhon Park had always been deemed a formidable one.  France had won 15 of its last 16 games coming into its final group match -- conceding only six times in the process -- but the Super Falcons seemed up to the task until the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) came into play in the 73rd minute and created a period of theater. \n\n\n\n\nNigeria defender Ngozi Ebere had brought Viviane Asseyi down inside the box, leaving the referee with little option but to award the spot kick once Melissa Borjas had opted for a VAR check. Ebere was subsequently shown a red card for a second bookable offense, while France defender Wendi Renard went on to hit the post from the spot -- only for VAR to give France a lifeline by penalizing Nigeria goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie for stepping away from her line before the ball was hit. Read MoreRenard retook the penalty and this time dispatched her effort with aplomb to give the hosts what proved to be the match-winning goal. In 18-year-old Nnadozie -- who became the youngest goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet at a World Cup in Nigeria's victory over South Korea -- Nigeria had a player who had stood up to whatever came her way, until the teenager suffered a harsh lesson on the biggest stage of all. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosReferee Melissa Borjas shows Ebere a red card.\"If I give you my honest feelings, they'll probably send me home so it's better I don't say anything,\" Nigeria coach Thomas Dennerby told reporters after the match.\"My players are heroes. Of course I'm disappointed by the result, France is a really good team and don't need support from anybody to win games. The girls were fighting so well, they followed the match plan and it's getting destroyed by people that we're not so happy with.\"Nigeria, which did not muster a shot on target against France, must now wait to learn if it has done enough to reach the last 16, while France -- winning all three group matches for the first time in its history -- will play its last-16 match in Le Havre after topping Group A. READ: 'Football is life' -- How Nigeria plans on becoming a world forceNnadozie reacts after learning that France will re-take its penalty.Renard celebrates scoring the winning goal. Germany maintains 100% record In Marseille, Germany had already qualified for the knockout rounds, but that didn't stop the high-flying side from dismantling South Africa in its final group stage match. In truth, the 4-0 scoreline could have been much worse for South Africa, which leaves its first ever World Cup with three defeats from three matches. German attacks came thick and fast in Marseille, and victory would have been by a greater margin had Martina Voss-Tecklenburg's team not squandered several chances in front of goal.  The emphatic result, however, extends Germany's remarkable record in the World Cup group stages to 19 games without a defeat -- the last coming to Sweden in 1995. Melanie Leupolz (center) celebrates her goal in MarseilleMelanie Leupolz, Sara Daebritz, Alexandra Popp and Lina Magull all got on the scoresheet with two goals gifted to the two-champion through sloppy South African defending. \"I'm extremely happy that we've reached the round of 16,\" said midfielder Daebritz, who scored her side's second goal. \"We got nine points from three games. We've worked hard, had a lot of willpower, and today we delivered a great performance.\"We can enter the round of 16 with a lot of confidence. We're very happy about it.\"READ: The Women's World Cup in numbersREAD: US dominates Chile to coast to last 16Leupolz opened the scoring after 14 minutes when she took advantage of poor marking from a corner to head past Andile Dlamini -- her first goal since the 2016 Olympic Games.The goalkeeper was then at fault for Germany's second, parrying an unthreatening cross into the path of Daebritz who coolly netted her second goal of the tournament and 12th in international colors. Popp towered above Lebohang Ramalepe to head home her side's third goal at the end of the first half, and Magull tapped in midway through the second period after Dlamini pushed a Marina Hegering header onto the inside of her post. Daebritz scores a goal her second goal of the tournament against South Africa.Both sides had chances in the closing stages with Germany having two goals ruled out for offside. South Africa, meanwhile, searched for just its second goal of the campaign but couldn't convert.The result means Germany -- as has become customary -- marches into the knockout stages with a 100% record, while South Africa becomes the first team to be eliminated from the tournament.In the other game in Group B, Spain and China played out a 0-0 draw in Le Havre which saw both teams progress to the last 16. Spain, which finished second in Group B on goal difference, has reached the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time in its history and is likely to face defending champion the US in the next round. Former finalist China, which has never failed to progress beyond the group stages, is guaranteed to finish as a best third-placed side and could face England. READ: Dutch striker breaks scoring recordREAD: Italy ends near 30-year drought at World CupNorway safely throughTwo penalties at the start of each half against South Korea ensured that Norway reached the World Cup knockout stages for the seventh time in Reims. It took just four minutes for Norway to take the lead after Cho Sohyun was pinged for holding Maria Thorisdottir in the box. From the resulting penalty, Caroline Graham Hansen scored what was not only the earliest goal of the tournament so far, but also the fastest penalty ever scored at a Women's World Cup.Caroline Graham Hansen scored a penalty inside the first five minutesSouth Korea then started to build momentum, enjoying plenty of possession and 14 first-half shots. It was Norway, though, which seized the advantage when Kang Chaerim brought down Graham Hansen in the box. With the No.10 hurt in the challenge, Isabell Herlovsen stepped up and powered the spot kick through the hands of Kim Minjung.South Korea's World Cup was now all but over, yet it continued to press forward with energy. Eventually, the reward came after a deft back heel from Lee Geummin put Yeo Minji through on goal, who finished past Ingrid Hjelmseth. More chances came, but it wasn't to be. The game ended 2-1, sending Norway -- which is without star player Ada Hegerberg this year -- through to the round of 16.",

        "content": "(CNN)The British research submarine Boaty McBoatface has made an impressive debut in the scientific arena, discovering a significant link between Antarctic winds and rising sea temperatures on its maiden outing.The unmanned submarine, whose moniker won a landslide victory in a public poll to name a $300 million British polar research ship, undertook its inaugural mission in April 2017.The unmanned submarine undertook its first mission in April 2017.The task saw McBoatface travel 180 kilometers (112 miles) through mountainous underwater valleys in Antarctica, measuring the temperature, saltiness and turbulence in the depths of the Southern Ocean.Its findings, published in the journal PNAS on Monday, revealed how increasingly strong winds in the region are causing turbulence deep within the sea, and as a result mixing warm water from middle levels with colder water in the abyss.Boaty McBoatface returns from its first voyage with 'unprecedented' dataThat process is causing the sea temperature to rise, which in turn is a significant contributor to rising sea levels, scientists behind the project said. Read MoreAntarctic winds are growing in strength due to the thinning of the ozone layer and the build-up of greenhouse gases, but their impact on the ocean has never been factored in to climate models. The British public voted in droves in 2016 to name the country's state-of-the-art new ship \"RRS Boaty McBoatface,\" with the user-suggested name gathering 124,109 votes.But despite the poll doing the impossible and uniting the country's electorate, the Natural Environment Research Council rejected the result and dubbed the ship RRS Sir David Attenborough after the renowned TV naturalist, in an effort to spare its blushes. The Boaty McBoatface name was instead given to a yellow submarine aboard the ship.McBoatface's success on its first mission has helped shed light on a key process occurring in Antarctica for the first time, according to National Oceanography Centre.\"The data from Boaty McBoatface gave us a completely new way of looking at the deep ocean -- the path taken by Boaty created a spatial view of the turbulence near the seafloor,\" Eleanor Frajka-Williams of the center said in a statement.\"This study is a great example of how exciting new technology such as the unmanned submarine 'Boaty McBoatface' can be used along with ship-based measurements and cutting-edge ocean models to discover and explain previously unknown processes affecting heat transport within the ocean,\" added Povl Abrahamsen of the British Antarctic Survey.",

        "content": "(CNN)Dog owners have long been aware of the phenomenon of puppy dog eyes -- just a simple glance from a canine companion can soften even the hardest of human hearts.Researchers think there is a reason for this -- with dogs evolving new muscles around the eyes to help bond with their two-legged friends. Experts in the UK and USA who studied the anatomy and behavior of dogs and wolves found that the muscular composition of canine faces has changed, allowing them to \"better communicate with humans.\"Researchers dissected dog and wolf heads and found that the facial muscle anatomy of both animals was almost identical -- except for an eyebrow muscle, found only in dogs, that allows them to \"intensely\" raise their eyebrows.The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) journal, found that the inner eyebrow raising movement makes the dogs' eyes \"appear larger, more infant like and also resembles a movement humans produce when they are sad.\"Read MoreThis prompts a \"nurturing\" response in humans, Juliane Kaminski, a comparative psychologist at the University of Portsmouth in the UK and the study's first author, told CNN.Most rabies infections in the United States come from bats, CDC says\"The findings suggest that expressive eyebrows in dogs may be a result of humans' unconscious preferences that influenced selection during domestication. When dogs make the movement, it seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them,\" she said in a statement.This would give the dogs that moved their eyebrows more a \"selection advantage\" over others, reinforcing the trait in subsequent generations.The researchers also studied the behavior of dogs and wolves and found that when exposed to a person for intervals of two minutes, dogs raised their inner eyebrows more and at higher intensities than wolves. \"Our findings show how important faces can be in capturing our attention, and how powerful facial expression can be in social interaction,\" the study's co-author, evolutionary psychologist Bridget Waller, said in a statement. Your Facebook profile can indicate if you have a medical condition, a study findsExperts believe the research indicates that the facial change has occurred over thousands of years of domestication. Lead anatomist Anne Burrows of Duquesne University in the US city of Pittsburgh, another of the paper's co-authors, said: \"To determine whether this eyebrow movement is a result of evolution, we compared the facial anatomy and behavior of these two species and found the muscle that allows for the eyebrow raise in dogs was, in wolves, a scant, irregular cluster of fibers.\"\"The raised inner eyebrow movement in dogs is driven by a muscle which doesn't consistently exist in their closest living relative, the wolf. This is a striking difference for species separated only 33,000 years ago and we think that the remarkably fast facial muscular changes can be directly linked to dogs' enhanced social interaction with humans.\"Previous studies have found that dogs can discriminate between positive and negative human emotions.",

The Los Angeles Times also reported on the trade.Per ESPN, the Lakers sent Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and three first-round draft picks -- including the No. 4 overall selection in Thursday's NBA draft -- to New Orleans. It's expected the deal will be completed July 6, according to ESPN, as that is the end of the free-agent moratorium.The Pelicans also have the No. 1 overall pick in this week's draft, and they're expected to take Zion Williamson.But right now, the focus is on Los Angeles. The trade instantly takes the Lakers from laughing stock to a potential title contender next season.Read More\"AD on da way!!\" James wrote on Instagram. He later added in the post, \"Let's get it bro! Just the beginning.\"Davis, James share the same agentDavis and James share the same agent in Rich Paul. In January, Davis informed the Pelicans that he would not sign a contact extension with the team and wanted to be traded, Paul told Wojnarowski at the time. He can become a free agent in the summer of 2020, and Davis plans to sign a new deal with the Lakers then, according to ESPN.New Orleans Pelicans win the NBA draft lottery -- and likely the Zion Williamson sweepstakesIn an interview with Sports Illustrated, before the trade was made, Paul, a close friend of James, discussed the optics about the perceived conflict of interest with reporter S.L. Price.\"My thing is: Take LeBron off the Lakers,\" Paul said to SI in the June 17 issue. \"Are the Lakers not a great destination for an arguably top-two player that went to Kentucky and won a national championship, signed with Nike? For a team that's had centers from George Mikan to Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Shaq?\"So now, when you add LeBron, that's what? The cherry on top. LeBron's 34 years old. Anthony Davis is 26. So when LeBron's done playing, the Anthony Davis trade is still rolling. What better place to do it than L.A.? If it was L.A. -- I never said 'L.A.' But there's no negative to that. Who gives a s--- what you're talking about, about me trying to help LeBron out? No, I'm not. I'm trying to help Anthony Davis. Now, if helping Anthony Davis helps LeBron in the long run? So be it. But my goal is Anthony Davis.\"Magic Jonson praises the moveMagic Johnson, a Lakers legend who recently quit his job as the team's president of basketball operations, praised the move in a series of tweets, giving kudos to notably owner Jeanie Buss and -- somewhat surprisingly -- general manager Rob Pelinka. Pelinka, Johnson said last month to ESPN, is why he stepped down as Lakers president, saying the Lakers GM talked behind his back.\"Laker Nation, the Lakers are back in a championship hunt!\" Johnson said in a tweet. \"Congratulations to the entire organization. I know LeBron James has a big smile on his face. I'm loving this!!\"",

        "content": "Berlin, Germany (CNN)A man arrested over the killing of a senior German politician earlier this month is believed to have links to the far right, prosecutors said Monday. Walter L\u00fcbcke, who was president of the Kassel regional council in central Germany, was shot in the head at close range on the terrace of his home in the small village of Istha, in the early hours of June 2.Sixty-five-year-old L\u00fcbcke was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling Christian Democrats and an outspoken supporter of the government's pro-migrant policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. The 45-year-old suspect was arrested on Saturday in Kassel based on traces of DNA evidence from the crime scene, according to the Hesse state office of criminal investigation and Kassel's public prosecutor.  The suspect has a long criminal record, police said.The past life and the \"openly expressed opinions and public views\" of the suspect linked him with the far right, Michael Schmidt, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office, told a news conference Monday. Read More\"Based on the current state of investigations, we assume that there is a right-wing extremist background to this act,\" Schmidt said, before adding there was no evidence that the suspect was involved in a right-wing terrorist group. Investigations are ongoing and officials confiscated computer equipment from the suspect, said Schmidt. Pro-migrant policies attract death threats and attacksAccording to police, L\u00fcbcke previously received death threats after a YouTube video emerged of him defending the country's immigration policies at a public meeting in Kassel in October 2015. The meeting was also attended by members of Pegida, a far-right anti-Islam movement.In the video, L\u00fcbcke says: ''You have to stand up for your values. If you don't share those values, then anyone is free to leave this country if they don't agree.\" Some members of the crowd could be heard shouting \"get out, get out\" in response. German nurse who killed at least 85 patients jailed for lifeGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier condemned hate posts toward the pro-migrant politician. ''The way some individuals on social media are attacking his death, taking satisfaction from it and applauding it is cynical, tasteless, revolting and offensive in every way,\" he said in comments at a German town association event. Interior minister Horst Seehofer also told the daily newspaper Tagesspiegel that \"if someone is so hated, just because he had liberal views, that is the decline of human morality.\"The killing of L\u00fcbcke is not the first attack on a pro-migrant German politician in recent years. In 2016 a man -- referred to as Frank S. -- who also reportedly opposed Germany's open-door refugee policies was sentenced to 14 years in prison for stabbing Cologne mayoral candidate Henriette Reker, according to the New York Times.Another German politician well-known for his pro-refugee policies, Altena town mayor Andreas Hollstein, was stabbed in the neck at a kebab shop in 2017 by an assailant who reportedly said: \"You are leaving me die of thirst while you bring 200 refugees to Altena.\" Angela Merkel's best laid plans are falling apart in Germany Merkel opened Germany's doors to more than a million migrants in 2015. But her policy, hailed by humanitarians, also attracted fierce criticism from the right, particularly following a number of terrorist attacks across the country in summer 2016.Riding the wave of public discontent was the anti-immigration, anti-Islam AfD. In the 2017 federal election, it became the third largest party in the Bundestag and the first far-right party to enter the country's parliament in almost 60 years.Now, the tide appears to be shifting again, with the environmentally focused and left-wing Greens surging to second place in May's European parliamentary elections, pushing the AfD into fourth.CNN's Nadine Schmidt reported from Berlin, Sheena McKenzie wrote from London.",

Five more riders came and went, but no one came close to the two Belgians until 2018 Valkenswaard winner Frank Schuttert. As the eighth rider in the jump-off, the young Dutchman and Lyonel D looked like they were on the way to another shock victory as they charged to the last fence, only to finish just behind Verlooy, at 0.08 seconds back. Could the last two remaining riders, Baryard-Johnsson and Fredricson, bring home the trophy for the first time?  The crowd erupted as Baryard-Johnsson and H&M Indiana set off at a fast pace, taking the lead in a time of 35.36 seconds, 1.46 seconds ahead of Verlooy, who looked crestfallen in the warmup area.\"It took a long time to beat me,\" said Verlooy. \"I'm very happy, I don't think it's a shame to behind these two,\" added the Belgian, who would finish in third place.Peder Fredricson clinched the first ever Longines Global Champions Tour  (LGCT) on home soil.\"Jos had a perfect jump-off,\" said Baryard-Johnsson. \"Unfortunately, perfect doesn't always win, because you have to be a little bit crazy and do something really, really risky.\"Fredricson wasn't sure if he was going to be able to beat his fellow Swede.\"She was really fast,\" Fredricson said about Baryard-Johnsson. \"I saw her just before I went in, and I thought 'it's going to be really difficult to beat.'\"The final rider to go, Fredricson and H&M All In, were 0.65 seconds ahead of Baryard-Johnsson at the halfway point and they extended their lead to 1.41 seconds as they finished in a winning time of 33.95 seconds. Head-to-head pictures later showed Fredricson took one less stride in the combination.\"Today was just my day,\" said Fredricson, the reigning European Champion, who has now qualified for the season-ending GC Prague Playoffs November 21-24, which will see all individual LGCT winners compete against each other in the season finale.

        "content": "London (CNN)Prince Harry has urged governments around the world to finally clear Angola of landmines, continuing the work of his mother, Princess Diana, who famously walked through minefields in the war-torn country months before her death.Diana made landmine removal a focal point of her humanitarian work, and drew international attention to the issue when she visited the Angolan province of Cuando Cubango in January 1997 with the Halo Trust charity.Images of her wearing protective gear as she witnessed mine-clearing efforts prompted worldwide efforts to restrict the use of mines in war. In a speech on Monday, Harry referenced that famous walk and urged that demining efforts remain on the international agenda.\"I was told just the other day of the positive transformation in Huambo since my mother walked that minefield all those years ago,\" he said during a speech at think tank Chatham House in London. \"What is less well-known is the impact landmines can have on conservation and wildlife, and therefore the economy.\"\"Angola is an important example of a country leading the way in clearing the remnants of war,\" he added.Read MorePrince Harry visits Angola to see mine clearance effortsHarry previously visited Angola in 2013, following in his mother's footsteps to see the after-effects of the nation's decades-long civil war, which officially ended in 2002.\"I saw a struggling community in a deserted landscape, unable to make use of the land,\" he said during his speech Monday. \"Let's not forget landmines are a humanitarian issue and not a political one.\"But Harry said that there is \"still a huge amount to do,\" adding that reductions in funding for demining efforts in the region were \"pretty shocking.\" Chatham House estimates that funding for the work has slumped by 90% over the past decade.He encouraged countries not to \"leave a job half-done,\" adding: \"There is an end in sight.\"Angola's protracted conflict, which broke out after it gained independence from Portugal in 1975, was in its last throes when Diana visited. The war killed up to 1.5 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 4 million people were internally displaced, more than half of them children, the United Nations said.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Marin Cilic describes himself as a \"thinker.\" Deeply reflective, the Croatian is one of only three players outside the Big Four to win a grand slam in the last decade and he's very conscious of not wanting to stop at one.  Don't be surprised, either, if the ongoing grass-court swing is where Cilic turns his season around after a right-knee injury heavily contributed to his ranking slipping to a five-year low. \"I understand that this year hasn't been a great one for me,\" Cilic told CNN Sport. \"It's a challenging season but I'm still very positive in terms of my game. I feel my game is there and I just have to unlock it in a couple of good events. \"I'm feeling that the second part of the season could be a really good one. Fingers crossed.\" READ: Nadal wins 12th French OpenRead MoreREAD: Disgruntled Djokovic exits French OpenAnd in an attempt to return to his grand slam winning form or even reach \"another level,\" the 15th-ranked Cilic -- but outside the top 50 in the calendar-year standings -- added former world No. 6 Wayne Ferreira to his entourage Sunday for his two grass events to work alongside current coach Ivan Cinkus. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosPresumably the collaboration will be extended if Cilic enjoys success over the coming weeks and the South African meshes with the 30-year-old's chilled, polite demeanor -- traits that belie a massive power game aided by a 6-foot-6 frame. Marin Cilic celebrates after winning the US Open in 2014. Cilic has previously been guided by flamboyant compatriot and 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, the vastly experienced Bob Brett and former singles and doubles standout Jonas Bjorkman. \"I'm at the stage of my career where I had some great coaches and I learned a lot,\" said Cilic, speaking before he unveiled Ferreira. He sought someone who could \"help me to get those few extra percents or has a different point of view, just looking at the game in a way where they can clearly see my game and see which areas I can develop.\"Asked if he can land more majors, Cilic replied: \"Yeah. I'm feeling that I'm still improving and definitely looking at my last few years, 2016, 2017 and 2018, I think I improved quite a lot.\"But Cilic didn't need to be told that last year, despite finishing in the top 10 for the fourth time in the past five seasons, he lost about a dozen encounters when in winnable positions. Big serve When Cilic bagged the US Open in 2014 with Ivanisevic alongside, he slammed a combined 50 aces in nine sets against grand slam winners or finalists Tomas Berdych, Roger Federer and Kei Nishikori to close the event. A knockout punch. JUST WATCHEDIvanisevic: Wimbledon's luckiest wildcard?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIvanisevic: Wimbledon's luckiest wildcard? 04:08He also seemingly struck the right balance between thinking and not overthinking on court. Cilic disagreed with the notion he needs to play more instinctively. \"I feel I'm a thinker,\" he said. \"I'm a person that thinks and I cannot stop thinking. But I'm also aware when I'm playing aggressive tennis, when I'm playing tennis that I don't need to think, then I'm playing also great. \"I believe though that in order for me to get to the top and play the best guys and to challenge them I also need to be able to think because if you play them without a game plan, then you don't have much of a chance.\"For the most part, Cilic has struck the right balance on grass. Indeed among active players, only that quartet of Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have a better winning percentage -- with a minimum 50 victories on the surface -- so no one will be discounting him from becoming just the second player in the last 13 years to retain the Queens title in London this week. He begins his title defense Monday against one of 2019's breakthrough performers, Chile's Cristian Garin. JUST WATCHEDWill Nadal pass Federer for grand slam wins?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWill Nadal pass Federer for grand slam wins? 03:52With virtually no grass courts back home, Cilic vividly recalls his first experience on the surface as a junior at Roehampton near Wimbledon in 2005. His earlier junior days were spent almost exclusively on clay.  \"It was funny because all the juniors when they came, including me, but maybe a little less me, were feeling comfortable on the baseline, most of them were playing for the first time on grass and they were starting to serve and volley and chip and charge,\" he said.\"It was funny to see how we as kids were seeing tennis on grass. But as soon as I stepped on grass, I felt extremely comfortable.\"Success, disappointment on grassCilic won the tournament in both singles and doubles and a dozen years later -- with serving and volleying a rarity for players -- landed a date with the king of SW19, Federer, in the final. What was meant to be a joyous occasion turned into a nightmare, however, when a blister on his left foot left him distraught and quashed hopes of adding to his grand slam haul. Marin Cilic made the Wimbledon final in 2017 but was hampered by a left foot blister. Cilic was a serious threat, too, especially since the year earlier at Wimbledon he led Federer by two sets and even held three match points prior to the Swiss rallying.  There were further bittersweet emotions for Cilic last year. After saving a match point at Queens to upend Djokovic in the final, he surrendered another two-set lead at Wimbledon, to grass-court novice Guido Pella, in the second round. \"Well, I actually have great great memories of the last two seasons,\" said Cilic. \"Going out of Wimbledon last year early was definitely disappointing and just after that, it took me a couple of weeks to get back on track and in training mode. It was extremely disappointing because I felt I was in incredible form and maybe played the tennis of my life. \"But definitely I'm positive in terms of looking ahead. I'm coming back to the grass court season knowing I played so well in these last two years.\"It was shortly after Wimbledon where plans were hatched by Cilic to organize a fundraiser through his charity foundation. A year after making the Wimbledon final, Marin Cilic lost in the second round at SW19 after having a two-set lead against Guido Pella. \"Game, Set, Croatia\" was held in Zagreb last week, raising money to build sports facilities for children. A packed house of 2,000 fans looked on as Cilic and about 30 of Croatia's top athletes -- including several members of the country's side that reached the football World Cup final last year in Russia -- contested a doubles exhibition. Charity dayCilic partnered Real Madrid superstar Luka Modric but as it turned out, they were outdone by Juventus' Mario Mandzukic.   \"Luka is really, really good,\" said Cilic, recipient of the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award three years ago. \"He's got great anticipation and great feeling. He had incredible shots. But I have to also mention Mandzukic, who won the tournament with a junior from Croatia. How about a \ud83d\udc4f for the @cilicmarin Foundation's successful 'Game, Set, Croatia' event, as Cilic was joined by @lukamodric10 and many \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf7 stars to raise funds in order to build a sports playground for elementary school children.\u2014 ATP Tour (@ATPTour) June 15, 2019\n\n\"We lost in the final to them but I have to say that we are better and were supposed to win, but anyway we will take the trophy next year,\" Cilic added with a laugh.

The couple also posted a photo in May in honor of Mother's Day in the many countries across the globe that celebrate it, including Meghan's native America. \"Paying tribute to all mothers today -- past, present, mothers-to-be, and those lost but forever remembered,\" the post stated, \"We honor and celebrate each and every one of you.\"The new image of Archie Harrison was released on the official Instagram account of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on Sunday. Read MoreThe photos are the only times that Archie has been seen since he was presented to the world in St. George's Hall in Windsor Castle only days after his birth on May 6. New details have just emerged about Archie's christening, which is set to take place at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in July, according to The Sunday Times. Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal expert, told CNN that the christening will almost certainly take place at the chapel as it is where Harry was christened in 1984, and where he and Meghan tied the knot in May 2018. More recently, the chapel has played host to the weddings of Prince Andrew's daughter Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018, and Lady Gabriella Windsor to financier Thomas Kingston in May 2019. Fitzwilliams noted that the christening will be a \"highly significant\" event, as Archie is the first royal baby born to parents of different ethnicities. He noted that the christening will highlight a \"changing royal family which reflects society as a whole in modern Britain as in the Commonwealth more closely.\" Meghan and Harry's newborn son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, is set to be baptized in Windsor Castle in July.Yet despite Meghan's push for modernity, which has included championing women's rights, the christening is expected to be a traditional affair, Fitzwilliams added.Archie will reportedly be baptized with water from the River Jordan, which holds particular significance for the Jewish and Christian faiths, as it is believed to be where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. The paper added that the royal baby will also be dressed in an exact replica of the historic royal christening gown, which was commissioned by Queen Victoria and first used in 1841 for the baptism of her eldest daughter, Princess Victoria. The original, which was made from Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace, was worn by 62 royal babies, including Queen Elizabeth at her christening in 1926, Prince Harry and Prince William. The christening is expected to take place in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan got married in May 2018.A replica of the gown was commissioned by the Queen in 2004, however, as the original was deemed too fragile for further use. The most recent royal babies to don the replica were Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. The christening will also feature the Lily Font, a silver-gilt receptacle which was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1840, the Sunday Times added. The font, which is stored at the Tower of London when not in use, has been used for the christenings of all of the Queen's children and grandchildren, excluding Princess Eugenie. Fitzwilliams noted that royal christenings are often small and private affairs, which are attended by \"senior royals, family, close friends and the godparents and their spouses.\" Meghan and Harry's newborn son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, is set to be baptized in Windsor Castle in July.The Queen is nevertheless expected to be absent at the celebrations due to prior engagements, according to the newspaper. While the monarch attended the christenings of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in recent years, she was noticeably absent from Prince Louis's baptism last year.The ceremony is expected to be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Right Reverend David Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is head of the Church of England. Conner has recently conducted the marriage ceremonies of Meghan and Harry, Princess Eugenie and Lady Gabriella Windsor.",

Francesco Galdelli, 58, and his wife Vanya Goffi, 45, who have been on the run for six years, were arrested Saturday in the Thai city of Pattaya in a joint operation by Royal Thai Police and Italian agents from Interpol, Italian police said in a statement. In 2010, Clooney took the witness stand in Italy and accused the couple of fraudulently using his name and forged signatures to create a bogus fashion line. Galdelli and Goffi also orchestrated a series of scams and frauds including selling fake Rolex watches online and sending their victims packets of salt instead of watches, Italian police said. The pair were convicted and sentenced in 2014 -- Galdelli to 8 years and 4 months, Goffi to 6 years and 5 months -- by Italy's supreme court. But by then they had fled the country and were wanted on an Interpol red notice issued by Italy.Read More\"Until 2013, they would go back and forth to Thailand,\" Italian police's Andrea Vitalone told CNN. \"They were considered respectable citizens and even benefactors amid the Italian community in Thailand. Galdelli even made massive donations for a charity supporting disabled children and children with HIV. Then, they went on the run.\"They were finally caught on Saturday after police surrounded the luxury villa where they were holed up, police said. Galdelli subsequently confessed to impersonating George Clooney in order to scam people, a Thai police spokesman told CNN. He was arrested on charges of illegally entering and staying in Thailand since \"there was no legitimate migration record of his current entrance and stay,\" police said. Goffi, whose entry had been registered, was charged with overstaying in the country. Galdelli was previously arrested in 2014, at the Dusit Thani Hotel in the Thai resort city of Pattaya. But he managed to escape a day later, Italian police said. Local police found out he had bribed prison guards in charge of his transfer, paying them 20.000 Thai Baht (\u00a3500), who he personally withdrew from a cash machine while in custody, police said. The two Italians are being detained at the detention center of the Immigration Bureau in Pattaya, awaiting extradition proceedings.Italian police called the operation \"Italian Bonnie and Clyde\" after the American bank robbers of the Great Depression era.Jib Pirada contributed reporting.",

Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been detained for more than three years in Iran on spying charges.Ratcliffe also began his hunger strike Saturday and has pitched a tent outside the embassy to protest his wife's continued detention. \"Hunger strikes in prison can be ignored whereas on your doorstep is a different thing,\" he said. Nazanin took the decision to go on hunger strike after her daughter Gabriella turned five while she remains incarcerated in Iran.\"I've just spoken to her, she was saying she was feeling her body is beginning to slow down,\" Ratcliffe said. He explained he is also starting to feel the physical effects of no food but is drinking water and mint tea. Read MoreZaghari-Ratcliffe was allowed to see her daughter Sunday and told her about the hunger strike. \"She said, 'does that mean mummy and daddy are going to die?',\" Ratcliffe said, adding that his daughter is beginning to understand more about her mother's situation. He was hoping to speak to his daughter as the UK celebrates Father's Day on Sunday.Ratcliffe said his wife was visited by representatives of the Iranian Prosecutor's Office on Sunday and they warned her that going on a hunger strike would not be good for her case.  Asked how long she will strike for, Ratcliffe said he presumes more than six days, which is her longest hunger strike so far. \"We will take one day at a time,\" he said, confirming that he intends to strike for as long as she does. A vigil was held for Nazanin outside the Foreign Office in London in 2018.He decided to join his wife after she told him Saturday that she had submitted a letter to the Prosecutor's Office informing them of her hunger strike. \"She sounded calm but said she was feeling a bit nervous,\" he explained.\"It's a really simple way of giving a message and not much else seems to work,\" he added.Iran's ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, reacted to Richard Ratcliffe's protest Saturday, claiming in a tweet that demonstrators were blocking the entrance to the embassy. Ratcliffe refutes that they are blocking the entrance.Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said in a statement: \"This is a truly heartbreaking situation. Nazanin has already been through so much, while her tireless husband Richard has strained every sinew to get Nazanin out of jail and back to the UK where she belongs.Nazanin is currently serving a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of \"membership of an illegal group.\" \"Nazanin is a prisoner of conscience, unfairly jailed after a sham trial and subjected to all manner of torments -- including months in solitary conferment and endless game-playing over whether she would receive vital medical care,\" she added.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport on April 3, 2016, prior to boarding a plane back to the UK after a regular family visit to the country with her infant daughter.She was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of \"membership of an illegal group\" by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran. She is presently serving her jail sentence in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe suffers panic attacks in Iranian prisonAsked whether he is anxious about an upcoming change in leadership in the UK and Boris Johnson potentially becoming Prime Minister, Ratcliffe said: \"We never got to meet Theresa May as Prime Minister... so knowing Boris has its advantages.\"In his most serious misstep as foreign secretary, Johnson was forced to apologize in 2017 after his comments about Zaghari-Ratcliffe raised fears that her jail sentence could be prolonged.Johnson told a parliamentary committee that Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism during her visit to Iran, but he later clarified that she had been visiting relatives before she was detained.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Donald Trump has attacked London Mayor Sadiq Khan over a spate of violence in the British capital, branding the politician a \"disaster\" and \"national disgrace.\" The US President's remarks came in response to a series of attacks in London that left three people dead in the space of 24 hours. An 18-year-old male was stabbed to death in Wandsworth, south London, on Friday afternoon. This was followed by the death of a 19-year-old male, who was shot dead only minutes later in south-east London. A male in his 30s was also fatally stabbed in the borough of Tower Hamlets, east London, on Saturday afternoon. Donald Trump accused Sadiq Khan of \"destroying the City of London\" in response to a spate of fatal attacks in the British capital.Trump apportioned blame to Khan, a member of the opposition Labour Party, for the attacks, retweeting a post by the right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins. Hopkins said the attacks represented \"Khan's Londonistan,\" appearing to blame Muslims for the violence. Read More\"London needs a new mayor ASAP. Khan is a disaster -- will only get worse,\" the President wrote in one Tweet. \"He is a national disgrace who is destroying the City of London,\" he added in another. Contrary to Trump's tweet, Khan is the mayor for the whole metropolitan area of London, rather than the City of London, which is a local government district comprising the historic center and central business district of London. The spike in crime in many parts of the UK has also been blamed in part on successive cuts to police funding and officer numbers by the governing Conservative Party; a policy implemented when Theresa May was home secretary. Khan did not respond in person to Trump's criticism, but his spokesman said the mayor was \"focusing on supporting London's communities and over-stretched emergency services.\" LONDON needs a new mayor ASAP. Khan is a disaster - will only get worse! https://t.co/n7qKI3BbD2\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2019\n\n\"He has been in regular touch with senior Met police officers last night and throughout the day. His thoughts are with the victims' families. He is not going to waste his time responding to this sort of tweet.\" Trump's remarks were nevertheless attacked by the opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said it was \"absolutely awful\" to see that the US President had used the stabbings to attack Khan. \"Sadiq Khan is rightly supporting the police to do their job, while Katie Hopkins spreads hateful and divisive rhetoric,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"They seek to divide at a time we need to come together.\" Six people were arrested following the fatal stabbing in Wandsworth; two of which have been charged and four have been released under investigation, the Met Police said. A further three individuals were arrested on suspicion of murder following the shooting in south-east London, while no arrests have yet been made in connection with the Tower Hamlets stabbing.Scathing tweetsTrump's remarks are the latest in a series of jibes against the London mayor. Their relationship soured in the aftermath of the 2017 London Bridge terror attack, when Trump blasted Khan's response to the emergency. Absolutely awful to see @realDonaldTrump using the tragedy of people being murdered to attack the Mayor. @SadiqKhan is rightly supporting the police to do their job while Katie Hopkins spreads hateful and divisive rhetoric. They seek to divide at a time we need to come together. https://t.co/Se3fgWDXUZ\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) June 15, 2019\n\n\"At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed,'\" Trump wrote on Twitter at the time. A spokesman for Khan responded, stating that the mayor had \"more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet.\"Khan has since repeatedly called for Trump's official visits to the UK to be canceled, and London's City Hall issued permission for a giant inflatable effigy of Trump to be flown over Parliament Square during planned protests.Khan's office issued permission for a giant inflatable effigy of Trump to be flown over London during  protests against his 2018 visit.Trump renewed his attacks on Khan on the eve of his state visit to the UK in June, telling The Sun newspaper that the mayor had done a \"very bad job on terrorism.\"He also sent a scathing tweet minutes before he touched down in London, accusing Khan of having done a \"terrible job\" as mayor, and being \"foolishly nasty to the visiting President of the United States.\" \"He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me,\" he wrote. \"Khan reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job -- only half his height.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Three years ago Tyson Fury seemed like he had it all: He was the world heavyweight champion and had a loving wife and children. But inside he was battling his own demons of drugs, alcohol and depression and was ready to drive his convertible Ferrari off a bridge at top speed.But after forfeiting his treasured world titles in 2016 and receiving a backdated two-year ban from UK Anti-Doping, the boxer \u2014 known as the \"Gypsy King\" -- has staged a remarkable comeback from severe mental health issues. \"If I can come back from it then anybody else can. I'm no special person, just a human being made of blood and bone,\" said the British boxer ahead of his bout with Tom Schwarz in Las Vegas on Saturday. Fury won the fight with ease, stopping his opponent in the second round.Boxers Tyson Fury (left) and Tom Schwarz pose ahead of their heavyweight bout.The 30-year-old is now using his comeback to spread awareness of dealing with mental health problems and wants his journey to be an inspiration for others suffering in silence. Read More\"It's not what brings you to your knees, it's the character you show that makes you get back up again,\" he says.Mental health triggers for elite athletesDepression and suicidal thoughts are something that many elite athletes suffer, from former professional footballer Clarke Carlisle, who intentionally stepped out in front of a lorry in 2014, to former England Test batsman Robin Smith, who meticulously planned how he would kill himself following his retirement in 2003. World Mental Health Day: Ex-footballer pushes for a \"mental health revolution\" after multiple suicide attemptsFor over a decade, clinical sport psychologist Andrew Wolanin has researched the prevalence and contributing factors of depression in elite athletes. He's found that injuries and retirement are often cited as triggers when it comes to mental health issues.In the past, he says, there has been \"a lot of assumptions that athletes were perfectly healthy\" and didn't suffer from mental health issues, however in reality, athletes were far from immune -- with nearly a quarter of athletes suffering clinically significant depression. He argues that depression in athletes is significantly underreported because of the stigma attached to it. Many attempt to mask their symptoms so that they aren't prevented from competing.\"They're worried about the consequences of indicating that they are having some issue,\" Wolanin says, adding that it's something that sticks with athletes well into retirement because of concerns around showing \"any weaknesses or issues.\"JUST WATCHEDA footballer's struggles with depressionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA footballer's struggles with depression 03:37For Clarke, who played for clubs including Preston, Burnley and Watford in a career spanning 17 years, a bad knee injury was the trigger for his depression -- which was diagnosed years later. He told CNN Sport last year that when you're injured and can't play it creates \"a feeling of worthlessness.\"\"When you're not able to do something that you do over and over and you're good at doing it -- if you take that away from somebody -- that's a really quick way to get somebody depressed,\" Wolanin explains.The World Player's Union FIFPro reported the same thing, after a study in 2015 found a strong correlation between severe injuries and the mental health of professional footballers.According to the study, players who sustained three or more severe injuries during their career were almost four times more at risk of experiencing mental health problems as those who did not suffer from severe injuries. Clarke Carlisle while playing for Northampton Town in 2012.A 'fractured identity' following retirementFor other sports stars, transferring to another club or having to retire can be a trigger -- like it was for Smith, who earned the nicknamed the \"Judge\" during his cricketing career for his wavy, wig-like hair. \"I was in limbo between my cricket career and the rest of my life and my identity became fractured,\" he reflects in his new book, \"The Judge: More Than Just a Game.\" \"I had been one of the world's best players, but now I had no identity,\" he writes. \"For 25 years there had been no real difference between cricket and life. They were so intertwined that they depended on each other and became one. Cricket dictated when I got up, when I went to bed, who I slept with, what I ate and where I went.\"He says that during his career he had suppressed his identity as \"Robin Arnold Smith\" to become the \"fearless\" Judge who appeared before fast bowlers and that when his career was over at 40 years old, he had no idea who he was without it. \"Cricket was more than just a game, it was my life,\" he writes. \"And it was over.\"Cricketer Robin Smith batting for England during the 2nd one-day international against Australia in 1993.Wolanin says once elite athletes retire, some really struggle with the change that comes with it.\"They feel lost and feel like they don't know what to do with themselves or how to feel good about themselves,\" he says.Smith turned to heavy drinking and his relationship with his family broke down, which eventually led to him planning how to end his life, to the most minute of details.\"I thought about how I would end my life so often, multiple times every day. I realize now that I'd lost the ability to think rationally, but at the time it was crystal clear in my head,\" he recalls.Wolanin says more needs to be done to support athletes and make them feel comfortable about opening up. He says it's about normalizing the conversation and instead of screening an athlete once or twice a year, a more casual space should be set up where they train so that they can pop in briefly whenever they need to. \"It's about trying to show that they can perform better when they get help that they need, rather than trying to hold everything in,\" he says.'It never goes away'In Fury's case, it wasn't retirement or an injury that propelled him into a battle with depression. In fact, in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2016 he alluded that it was fame that was a contributing factor and the negative stereotyping that he received for his traveler heritage. \"I was a lot happier when I wasn't the world champion,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"It's been a witch hunt ever since I won that world title, because of my background, because of who I am and what I do.\"Tyson Fury punches Deontay Wilde in the seventh round fighting to a draw during the WBC Heavyweight Championship in December 2018.\"I used to love boxing when I was a kid. It was my life. All the way through it was my life. You finally get to where you need to be and it becomes a big mess. And that's it. I hate boxing now,\" he said. \"I wouldn't even go across the road to watch a world title fight.\"It was in that interview that he revealed he had been taking cocaine and drinking alcohol daily.Despite coming out on the other side, and staging what's been described as one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport, Fury admits he still struggles daily. \"I liken mental health to a famous song The Eagles wrote called 'Hotel California,'\" he told CNN Sport. \"There's a verse in that called 'you can check out anytime you want but you can never leave' -- and that's mental health. You can check out and get help any time you want. But if you don't maintain and manage your mental health problems then it'll never go away. It never does go away.\"Tyson Fury: Boxing champion vacates heavyweight beltsFor him, training and keeping fit is his medication. \"I thought it was the boxing that made me Tyson Fury but you know I've realized now it's the training that I need to continue to do throughout about my life, other than just boxing competitively.\"Just two years ago Fury complained that he hated boxing, nowadays it's a totally different story. For him, it's no longer about winning, but fighting, because it's what he loves to do.\"I've won everything there is to win in boxing. I've won many awards and many world titles,\" he says. \"Everyone there is to win, actually -- there's not much more I can achieve in boxing.\"He says he's not boxing for achievements, at least not anymore. \"I'm boxing because I love to do it.\"For Fury, all that matters to him nowadays is that he lives a \"happy and healthy, mentally well\" life. \"I don't think anyone can ask for much more than that.\"CNN's Don Riddell, Ben Church and Dominic Rech contributed reporting.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin has been in power for nearly two decades, but he still has the capacity to surprise: This week, he unexpectedly showed that the Kremlin -- on rare occasions -- has a reverse gear.To recap: On Tuesday, Russian authorities dropped a criminal case against a top investigative reporter known for exposing local corruption. The journalist, Ivan Golunov, had been arrested on an attempted drug-distribution charge that he and his colleagues insisted evidence had been planted by police. Russia lost the most lives during WW2. So why wasn't Putin invited to D-Day event?As it turns out, the charges indeed had been fabricated. The police officers who arrested Golunov were suspended from active duty, and on Thursday Putin sacked two top interior ministry officials -- the chief of internal affairs at the western district of Russia, Andrei Puchkov, and head of the Moscow directorate for drug control at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Yuri Devyatkin -- in connection with the case. It was an unexpected reversal after an outpouring of solidarity from Russian civil society. Journalists rallied to Golunov's side, staging rotating, one-person vigils outside of the main building of the Moscow branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs at 38 Petrovka Street. Three leading newspapers on Monday published identical front pages with the slogan, \"I/we are Ivan Golunov.\" And campaigners organized a march in his support on Wednesday.In this photo, Russia's three major newspapers use the same headline that reads: \"I/we are Ivan Golunov\"But Putin's grip on power was never seriously in peril. Read MoreFor starters, there was the response to Wednesday's march. Organizers had hoped to build on the momentum of previous days, as thousands expressed interest in turning out for the demonstration. But the unexpected decision to release Golunov from house arrest clearly diminished interest. Golunov himself did not take part, and discussion about whether to proceed with protests sparked internal squabbling among Russia's already fractured opposition.Putin and Xi show a unified front against Trump in St. PetersburgAnd the authorities moved quickly and forcefully to shut down the unsanctioned demonstration that went ahead on Wednesday. When marchers turned out at the Chistye Prudy metro station in downtown Moscow, they were ordered to disperse by police. As they moved in the direction of 38 Petrovka Street, they were met by a cordon of police who effectively dispersed the march, with small squads of riot police collaring individual demonstrators and locking them inside police buses.Demonstrators chanted, \"Shame! Shame!\" but it was all over within a few hours. But while the protest in Moscow was far, far smaller than the wave of demonstrations seen in Hong Kong, the events of the week were still an unusual display of discontent with Putin. And the official climbdown in the face of street demonstrations was the most stunning: Russian authorities, for instance, have continued to hold US investor Michael Calvey, despite both domestic lobbying and diplomatic pressure from the US. \"Vladimir Putin's grip on power was never seriously in peril.\"Voices from MoscowWhat appeared to have mobilized some to take part in the protests was not necessarily Putin Fatigue, but resentment of local police, whom Russians distrust for corruption and arbitrary arrests.\"What is happening in this country is totally wrong, when drugs are being planted on a person who does not use them,\" a young man from a city on the Volga River visiting Moscow told CNN. \"The cops usually act like that.\"But his criticism did not extend to Putin. \"As for Putin, I can't state that he is a bad 'ruler' or something like that. As far as we know, he is quite a good man. I think he should deal with this situation and find out why the law-enforcement bodies have got to the point of planting drugs on people who do not use them, while they fail to catch those who sell tons of them.\" Another woman, a Muscovite, said she didn't watch the march in support of Golunov. But when told of the circumstances of his case, she said, \"I stand for him.\" Asked if Putin's reputation had taken a hit over the whole affair, she said, \"I think yes, and we will do nothing about it.\"Such candor has its limits: Both individuals when approached by CNN asked that their names not be used. Still, many outspoken Russians have taken to social media to opine on the meaning of the week's events. And the Golunov case started a wider discussion about revising Article 228 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the portion of the criminal code that covers drug crimes. Writing on Twitter, Yevgeny Roizman, the opposition former mayor of the city of Yekaterinburg, took it further, saying \"the entire Criminal Code of the Russian Federation must be revised, since it is an instrument for political persecution.\"That's a larger discussion that the Kremlin, most likely, is not ready to entertain.CNN's Olga Pavlova in Moscow contributed to this report.",

They're going to be tennis players,\" he said, referring to daughters Venus and Serena.A 78-page blueprint was soon prepared, describing how Venus and Serena would reach the top. A key plank of the plan was that it would be enacted from one of America's roughest areas.Serena celebrates her Evert Cup final victory over Steffi Graf in 1999 with her sister Venus and her father Richard.The Williams family was not poor and could have afforded to live in more well-to-do areas. But it was decided that Compton was the best place for their early education.\"There was no place in the world that was rougher than Compton,\" Williams said. \"The ghetto will make you rough, it'll make you tough, it'll make you strong.\"And so that's why I went to Compton with them.\"The plan turned out quite well -- at the last time of counting Serena has 23 grand slam singles titles to her name while Venus has seven, despite suffering from illness and injuries in recent years.Mahut consoled on court by sonYou maybe already saw this.Tennis player Mahut losing at Roland Garros in front of his family, breaks down in tears.His kid runs on court to hug him.His opponent Mayer getting emotional.Father and son walk away hand in hand.Losing, winning, living.pic.twitter.com/YOE3ohKVGJ\u2014 Tancredi Palmeri (@tancredipalmeri) June 4, 2019\n\nIt was a fairytale run at the French Open this year for Nicolas Mahut.

A major tribute to dadKen Rose was the person who introduced English star Justin Rose to golf, and as his son progressed through the ranks, Rose Sr. continued to be his mentor. He was still coaching and advising Justin a month before he died of leukemia in 2002. Justin Rose looks to the heavens in tribute to his late father after winning the US Open.Eleven years later, Justin clinched his first major title in the 2013 US Open at Merion, Pennsylvania.When the winning putt dropped -- handing Phil Mickelson a record sixth runner-up spot -- Rose looked up and pointed to the sky in tribute to his dad. It was Father's Day, after all.  Derek Redmond gets helping hand from dadIn 1991, British sprinter Derek Redmond won a gold medal in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo. So, going into the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, hopes were high that he could emulate that success.However, after storming out of the blocks in his 400 meters semifinal, Redmond pulled up with a torn hamstring on the back straight. Derek Redmond is helped by his father at the Barcelona Olympics.Instead of receiving medical attention, Derek tried to finish the race by hobbling and hopping along the track. As he rounded the final bend, Derek's father Jim appeared from the stands, brushed off the stewards and helped his son across the line. This display of paternal love and perseverance has since been used in advertisements by Visa as an illustration of the Olympic spirit, and featured in Nike's \"Courage\" commercials in 2008.Michael Jordan wins 'Father's Day Title'Michael Jordan was the biggest deal in basketball and a three-time NBA champion with the Chicago Bulls between 1991-1993. However, in 1993 his father James was murdered on his way back from a funeral, causing Michael to announce his first retirement. He had a stint in baseball before returning to the NBA in 1995. Michael Jordan and Randy Brown hug during the closing seconds of Game 6 of the NBA Finals in 1996.In his first season back with the Bulls, Jordan led them to the NBA Finals, where they beat the Seattle SuperSonics 4-2. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThe sixth game of the series with the SuperSonics -- in which they wrapped up the title -- happened to fall on Father's Day, which was clearly an emotional occasion. Instead of celebrating with his team, Jordan sobbed uncontrollably on the floor. That 1996 championship is now referred to as the \"Father's Day Title\" in a fitting tribute to Jordan and his late father.",

Martin underwent several major procedures as well as therapy and documented her journey on YouTube. \"Pretty much every fiber of my body told me it was the thing I needed to do,\" Martin explains. \"But I always said to myself that I'd never have the courage to do it; I'm too scared of the consequences; I'm too scared of telling everyone in my life and how they might react and treat me.\"So to go into transition and not only do it but have it go incredibly well, to be so happy, finally, suddenly feels like you've taken the biggest risk in your life but you've also hit the jackpot.\"When she transitioned, however, Martin turned her back on racing because she thought she wouldn't be welcomed as a transgender driver.She had been competing in the UK in hill climb racing -- where drivers go against the clock on uphill courses -- fitting it in around her day job in the family engineering business. \"I walked away from motorsport,\" she explains. \"I just couldn't see how it would ever be accepted. \"When I was in the first year of transition in the UK, people were quite standoffish but I think that was because everybody knew me and ... hill climbing in the UK is a slightly older generation thing -- and so that felt quite, I don't know. Challenging is probably the best way to describe it.\"A decision to go to France and compete in a one-off round of the French Hill Climbing Championship in St-Goueno renewed Martin's passion and her hopes of becoming a professional racing driver. She had broken the class record and won the race by three seconds, a positively monumental margin by hill climb standards.\"People were a bit surprised that this English girl who no one had heard of had come over and blown everyone away,\" Martin recalls with a smile.Blink and you miss her: Martin's motorsport dreams were reignited driving a Westfield in France.'Whole new life'Having the courage to undergo transition -- and re-mortgaging her house to finance facial feminization surgery at the end of 2013 -- ultimately galvanized Martin's self-belief and, in turn, made her a better racer.\"It opened up a whole new life,\" Martin adds. \"It started this whole process of taking risks, giving things a go and not worrying about getting it wrong and that snowballed and brought me to this point now -- Le Mans, let's go for it!\"In 2019, after more concentrated spells in hill climbing in Europe and a single season circuit racing season back in the UK, Martin quit her job and announced a campaign with the Racing Experience team to take part in the Michelin Le Mans Cup, a series for prototype Le Mans cars that would take her to the famous La Sarthe course this June. But Martin's Le Mans date with destiny was suddenly snatched away when the funding she needed fell through just two weeks before this weekend's race.\"It's a real shame,\" says Martin, whose place in the team has been filled for the Le Mans weekend only. \"Unfortunately because of last-minute delays with sponsorship we couldn't continue.\"We tried everything we could, including a crowd-funding campaign, but we were let down too close to the race itself.\"Martin is resilient and positive. She has to believe that this is just a minor bump in her road to Le Mans.And she can take comfort in the fact that she has always been working towards a three-year plan with the ultimate aim to compete in the 24 Hour race in 2021 as its first transgender driver.Martin says the motorsport community has in general been \"incredibly supportive.\"\"My goal remains to compete in the main 24 Hours of Le Mans and I feel even more determined than ever to make it happen,\" she adds.\"There's never been a professional trans driver in motorsport, so it's an exciting position to be in. \"First and foremost I just want to do the race but there is a huge significance for me to do that as the person that I am today, to do Le Mans as a trans woman.\"There is so much negativity bandied around in the media that we need real positive stories from real trans people doing incredible things with their lives.\"'Toxic environment'This year the debate over transgender athletes competing in women's sport has hit the headlines. Tennis star Martina Navratilova apologized after accusing trans women of \"cheating\" while former international swimmer Sharron Davies also said trans athletes should not be allowed to compete in female competitions.As a high-profile transgender athlete, Martin was drawn into the debate, appearing on national television in the UK. \"When you have respected voices in sport like Sharon Davies and Martina Navratilova sounding off and shooting from the hip, when actually they're not familiar with the research, it's incredibly damaging,\" Martin says.\"It creates a very toxic environment for the trans community.\"Celebrating Transgender Day of Visibility 2019 \ud83d\ude0c\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 I hope that my visibility within my life & sport can inspire positive change in the world \ud83c\udf0d\u2728Being trans is just one aspect of my life & I'm proud to be who I am today more than ever \u270a\ud83c\udffc #TDOV #TDOV2019 pic.twitter.com/DBMHS6MGqx\u2014 Charlie Martin \ud83e\udd8b (@GoCharlieM) March 30, 2019  The International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines says trans women must show that their testosterone level has been below a certain level for at least 12 months before their first competition.Martin approves of the IOC ruling, least of all because it silences those that argue trans women competing in female competitions have an unfair advantage because of increased levels of the male hormone.\"Anyone who goes through a medical transition doesn't have testosterone in their body,\" Martin adds. \"For me as a trans woman the idea of having testosterone in their body ... I would freak out. So this is a massive fact that is not being reported.\"If you've had testosterone in your body your whole life and you take it away and replace it with oestrogen you lose physical strength, you lose muscle mass and you get weaker. I know I have.\"Martin acknowledges that being in motorsport -- where a machine provides the bulk of the muscle -- has protected her from some, but not all, of the negativity.Martin checks in with her Racing Experience teammate during the 2019 Michelin Le Mans Cup.\"It removes the possibility for somebody to argue against me and says 'oh well you're only doing so well because you're trans and you have a physical advantage'. So it simplifies things from my point of view but it can still be challenging,\" she says.\"It's an unfortunate part of being open about my life that I face a lot of transphobic abuse. There'll always be a lot of abuse online (but) I've learned to ignore it.\"The only underhand transphobia I experienced within the sport was a few years ago when I was left out of a national squad for a racing championship after my transition, despite having the most experience of all the potential candidates.\"In general, I've found that the motorsport community has been incredibly supportive of my decision to be my true self.\"Looking back on her journey, Martin realizes how far she has come from that first transformative weekend watching the 24 Heures in 2001.\"Even the idea of doing Le Mans full-stop back then seemed highly improbably but if you said transitioning and doing it as a trans woman, I'd have just laughed,\" she says with another big smile.\"So to be at a point where that feels not only possible but that it is going to happen -- it's just huge.\"Martin is perfectly qualified for Le Mans, after all it's about endurance and she has that in spades.",

Saudi authorities arrested Qureiris when he was 13, three years after he participated in a bike protest during the 2011 Arab Spring. He is now facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia after being held for almost four years in pre-trial detention, as detailed in an exclusive CNN report published last week. Austria's parliament passed a resolution Wednesday, which said it would \"use all political and diplomatic means available to prevent the execution\" of the teenager. The resolution also calls on the government to \"quit the treaty concerning the residency of the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue (KAICIID) [in Austria].\" Exclusive: Saudi Arabia said they confessed. But court filings show some executed men protested their innocenceThe resolution goes on to say that \"after the (Jamal) Khashoggi case the Saudi government has once again shown how it deals with its critics and that it doesn't even shy away from murdering children/teenagers.\"\"The regime in Riyadh only understands a clear and precise language: no dialogue without respect for life and human decency,\" it added. Saudi Arabia has denied that its leaders were involved in the death of Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who was killed in Istanbul in October.Read MoreAustria's Foreign Ministry told CNN that it is assessing \"the legally necessary steps and (preparing) the implementation process.\" CNN has contacted the Saudi government for comment. Riyadh has not responded to previous requests for comment about Qureiris.Center says it's an easy target KAICIID's website describes itself as an intergovernmental organization that aims to use dialogue to resolve conflict. Its founding members were Saudi Arabia, Austria and Spain. The Holy See is a founding observer.In a statement on its website, KAICIID said it was concerned by the recent move: \"KAICIID is not an embassy, or NGO, or in any way the policy arm of any state, including Saudi Arabia. It is not a sinister extension of any state's influence or strategies.\"\"As the Austrian political scene becomes more heated ahead of impending elections, KAICIID is all too easily inserted into political and social narratives that are completely divorced from its status and mission.\"In April, Saudi Arabia announced it had executed 37 men who, according to rights group Reprieve, were mostly from the kingdom's Shia minority. The country has one of the highest rates of execution in the world, and has frequently been criticized by rights groups for executing people who were minors at the time of the alleged crimes.Qureiris was 10 years old when he committed at least one of the acts alleged in his charge sheet, CNN has learned.He was charged with accompanying his activist brother, Ali Qureiris, on a motorcycle ride to a police station in the eastern Saudi city of Awamiya, where Ali allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at the facility.A UN Working Group believes that the minor had been tortured, his confessions \"extracted\" and that his arrest was arbitrary.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy failed to qualify for last year's Men's World Cup in Russia, a devastating blow to a nation that lives and breathes football. But the Italian women are doing brilliantly at this year's Women's World Cup in France, making history Friday by reaching the knockout phase for the first time since 1991 after Cristiana Girelli's hat-trick inspired a 5-0 victory against Jamaica. England also advanced, edging a determined Argentina 1-0 to move to a perfect six points. If picking up a win against one of the favorites, Australia, in its first World Cup game wasn't enough, Italy has already advanced from its Group C cohort, which also includes traditional powerhouse Brazil. \n\n\n\n\nIt follows a hugely successful qualifying campaign where, not surprisingly, the Italian defense was difficult to breach. Read More\"Emotions I'm feeling are of joy, sheer joy,\" Italy coach Milena Bertolini was quoted as saying by FIFA. \"We wanted to move on in the group phase and to do this after two matches is a great satisfaction for us. \"The girls were awesome, to stay with their feet well planted on the ground considering all of the attention and coverage we're getting back home.\"The win in Reims against the Reggae Girlz wasn't without controversy, however. The use of VAR, or a video assistant referee, continues to divide opinion but when it was utilized by referee Anna-Marie Keighley to check on a possible penalty, it appeared that the right outcome was reached. READ: Japan back on track after Scotland winKeighley initially didn't point to the spot when Allyson Swaby made contact with Barbara Bonansea but changed her mind. Cristiana Girelli scored a hat-trick in Italy's 5-0 win against Jamaica at the Women's World Cup. Sydney Schneider dived to her left to stop Girelli but the kick was ordered retaken after the goalkeeper was ruled to be off her line before it took place. Replays might have justified the decision but far worse breaches of the rule are rarely called. Second chanceGirelli took advantage of her second chance, this time going to the keeper's right in the 12th minute. If that was a bit of luck for Girelli, there was more to come. Girelli's second goal in the 25th minute deflected off her thigh from a corner and in the 46th minute Schneider missed her punch and the ball found its way into the net off Girelli's shoulder. All that was left realistically for 53rd-ranked Jamaica was to limit the damage -- and see if it could score a first-ever World Cup goal. Emphatic from Italy! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f#JAMITA | #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/ZNRTLyGore\u2014 FIFA Women's World Cup (@FIFAWWC) June 14, 2019\n\nIt almost happened in the 58th minute when Italy goalkeeper Laura Giuliani dithered with the ball at her feet. She was caught out by Jamaica's top offensive threat, Khadija Shaw, before Italy recovered. Seconds later, Shaw saw yellow when her right foot cruised into the mouth of Italian skipper Sara Gama on a scissor kick. JUST WATCHEDKhadija Shaw soaking up World Cup limelightReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKhadija Shaw soaking up World Cup limelight 03:53Giuliani made a fingertip save in the 68th minute. Substitute Aurora Galli then provided Italy's fourth goal, courtesy of a thunderous right-footed drive that Schneider got a hand to, and she completed the scoring in the 81st, sprinting to get in behind the Jamaica defense and slaloming past Schneider. England eventually finds way past CorreaIt took a while for third-ranked England to find a way past inspired goalkeeper Vanina Correa in Le Havre, which didn't necessarily surprise Lionesses boss Phil Neville. \"I stood in the warmup and watched their keeper,\" Neville said after the game. \"She was unbelievable in the warmup. Normally when you are like that before the game, you're not like that in the game. But she was incredible.\"Correa stuck out a left arm to deny Nikita Parris from the penalty spot and later in the first half used her left foot to frustrate Beth Mead. Vanina Correa (green) saved a penalty in Argentina's 1-0 loss to England at the World Cup. As it did against 2015 runner-up Japan in its first match -- when it collected a first ever World Cup point -- Argentina sat back and defended in numbers with Correa holding firm between the posts. And she continued to star early in the second half, keeping out Parris' fierce drive from close range.Her positioning was perfect to comfortably catch Jodie Taylor's header but Euro 2017's top scorer made England's long awaited breakthrough in the 62nd minute following a rare Argentina attack. England was thus able to counter and the speedy Mead engineered a perfect cross to Taylor, who tapped home. Correa this time had no chance. It was the lone goal, a credit to an Argentina side that several years ago didn't have a world ranking due to inactivity and was all but deserted by its national federation. Congrats, @Lionesses! \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7fSee you in the Round of 16! #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/CguvOxJkhj\u2014 FIFA Women's World Cup (@FIFAWWC) June 14, 2019\n\nNot happy with his team's second-half performance against Scotland last Sunday, Neville had no complaints Friday. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I actually thought we were outstanding,\" he said. \"I really enjoyed the game. I enjoyed our performance. I stood here four days ago and I was slightly critical of them and that's because of the standards we set but I'm proud of every single one of them tonight.\" England and Japan face off Wednesday to decide the Group D winner, while Argentina meets winless Scotland.",

More poignantly, the rapper and the Toronto Raptors most recognizable fan quickly summed up the depth of feeling in the Canadian city -- and Canada -- after the team secured its first NBA title after defeating the Golden State Warriors. \"We did this off of heart,\" said Drake. \"We did this off of love. We willed this into existence.\"The Canadian music star has been ever-present during the Raptors' run to the Finals, and his almost fanatical support has put noses out of joint across the league.

READ: The first NBA player of Indian descent, who made history in 16 secondsRead MoreLong haul\"We're going to make the NBA proud. We respect the trust that they've charged us with,\" said John Bitove Jr., president of the yet-to-be-named professional basketball franchise in Toronto back in 1993. Established on November 4, 1993 for a then-record expansion fee of $125 million, the Toronto Raptors were the 28th NBA franchise and the second Canadian franchise alongside the Vancouver Grizzlies. While the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, the Raptors remained in Toronto and for its fans, the team's 2019 success has been a long time coming. In the 24 seasons of their existence, the Raptors have made the playoffs 11 times -- a good percentage on face value -- but have only reached the NBA finals once (this season). Although they've qualified for the playoffs for the past six seasons, the Raptors have been plagued by LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, being knocked out three years in a row by King James. Following a 59-win season last season in which the Raptors reached the Eastern Conference finals, coach Dwane Casey -- appointed in 2011 -- was fired, days after being named NBA Coach of the Year. Scapegoat. Agree with Stephen A. on that one. Casey doesn't deserve it.\u2014 Patrick Patterson (@pdpatt) May 11, 2018\n\nDue to the improvement the Raptors made under Casey's stewardship -- they finished with a record of 23-43 in his first season and a record of 59-23 in his final season -- the decision to replace him with his assistant, Nick Nurse, didn't go down well with many.However, what General Manager Bobby Webster did in the summer went a long way to rebuilding bridges. READ: 'We all have Hoop Dreams'New beginningsDeMar DeRozan -- who blossomed into a perennial All-Star for the Raptors -- was traded in July 2018 to the San Antonio Spurs for 2014 Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard. As well as acquiring Danny Green from the Spurs and Marc Gasol from the Grizzlies, Nurse entered his first season at the helm with a seriously kitted out team. And they didn't disappoint. Leonard and fan-favourite Kyle Lowry were named as All-Stars, Green finished with the fifth highest 3-point percentage in the league and Pascal Siakam developed from an up-and-comer to a flat-out superstar. But it was during their playoff run that the Raptors, who receive a lot less media coverage compared to many of their American counterparts, really burst onto the scene. From Drake's almost comical reactions on the touchline and ability to get under the skin of MVP-hopeful Giannis Antetokounmpo to Leonard's now-iconic game and series winning shot against the Philadelphia 76ers, the stars seemed to align for the Raptors.Kawhi Leonard hits the game winning shot against the Philadelphia 76ers.Canada's teamThere have been clips of viewing parties for the Raptors games all across Canada, and for Tas Melas -- a fan of the Toronto NBA team and co-host of \"The Starters\" -- the outpouring of support for the Toronto-based team has made him even more proud of being Canadian. \"Even as somebody who supported team for a long time, I didn't know that this amount of support existed out there,\" Melas said. \"More people in Canada watched Game 5 of the NBA finals than every other program this year, including the Super Bowl. It's shocking really.\"Even though there's been Raptors fan bases online that are so adamant about the team, but for pop up parties to happen from the Prairie provinces to the Atlantic provinces, it's a head-scratcher. \"It's something which bonds all the cities just like in London, England. I'm sure there are cities in England that aren't really fans of London. And that's the same sort of scenario in Canada. Drake cheers on stage as Toronto Raptors beat the Golden State Warriors in Game Six of the NBA Finals, during a viewing party in Jurassic Park.Journalist Mike Bossetti -- who has covered the Raptors for past four seasons -- echoes Melas' incredulity that the Raptors are now so popular and says that the lack of any other Canadian NBA franchise helps people to unite behind one common goal. \"Every team in the NBA has a city they represent. The Raptors have a country,\" he said. \"It's truly been remarkable to see the entire nation of Canada rally behind just one team. Over 50% of Canada has tuned in to at least one portion of the NBA Finals. \"Go 15 minutes in America and you might find different fan bases colliding. Up in Canada, there's only one love.\"Starting something newThe Raptors opponents in the Finals -- the Warriors -- have been the team to beat over the past five seasons, winning the NBA title three times. Behind the brilliance of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, \"Dub-Nation\" have reached the Finals in each of the last five seasons. But for Jordan Hayles -- who's supported the Raptors since he was 11-years-old -- the wait for the Raptors victory has made it even sweeter.  \"For the city, it is probably one of the biggest moments to happen really since the Blue Jays won (in 1993),\" he said, referring to the MLB team.Toronto Raptors fans celebrate atop a bus after the team beat the Golden State Warriors.\"I think it's even more important because when you look at it from a generational standpoint, it's always been the Maple Leafs,\" added Hayles in reference to the Canadian ice hockey team.\"The Leafs are a 100-year-old team and they won all their titles before television. The Blue Jays won when TV was obviously prominent, but they won before the internet era. \"And when you have the technology age that we live in, at the end of this decade moving on into 2020s, then the Raptors are a millennial team. They have been around for 24 years. So, you have a lot of generations coming together and witnessing this.\" An attractive propositionWhen NBA players are deciding where they'll be playing next during free agency, the past success (or lack of) for the franchises trying to claim the signature of that player can be a key factor. The Warriors themselves were that team before they won their title in 2015, having only reached the playoffs eight times in the previous 37 seasons. Melas thinks that winning the title this season will make Toronto an attractive place to play for star talents. \"They are already an A-list organization that's been proven in the last few years, but this would absolutely cement them as an organization that's not going anywhere and that is a free agent destination. Kawhi Leonard celebrates his teams win over the Golden State Warriors in Game Six.\"And it also is going to increase the amount of kids and interest in basketball throughout the country as well. \"These parties that are happening, win or lose, I do think there's people watching the game that maybe have never watched a NBA game before or weren't all that interested.\"So I expect the gyms and the outdoor courts to be more and more packed as these next few years go on because of the Raptors and how appealing they are and how appealing winning is and how magnetic this team is. \"And again, people just love these dudes.\"'Waiting for this moment'Suna Bari -- a Raptors fan whose earliest memories include watching Damon Stoudamire -- believes this title will have a dramatic effect on the Raptors' status and also their fans.\"The Raptors have always been the team in the league having to prove themselves; the underdog; and I think bringing this title home is enough proof that we don't only belong in this league, but we're good enough to compete against some of the greatest players in the world AND win,\" she said. \"I've been waiting for this moment for over 20 years. These last few years have been a wave of emotions, watching the Raptors push through the playoffs and inch closer every year only to fall short of the finish line. \"To win this title is to fulfil a childhood dream. Seven-year-old me is sitting at the edge of her seat, dripped in Raptors gear and full of emotions.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Twelve years ago, Bobby Despotovski was coming to the end of his football career. With one eye on a future in coaching, the-then Perth Glory striker went to his club's training ground to watch the youth teams play.On one pitch the women's team was being put through its paces. His initial intent had not been to watch the girls play, but he was drawn in by a 13-year-old who could glide away in the smallest of spaces. She was quick, athletic and blessed with \"raw talent.\" She was, he says, exceptional. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I saw her running and playing, and I thought to myself that this girl has attributes to become one of the best footballers in the world,\" Despotovski, now head coach of Perth Glory Women, tells CNN Sport. Some players are so brilliantly irresistible in their youth that it is obvious a golden future awaits and so it was with Sam Kerr, the football prodigy who became a Ballon d'Or nominee, a global brand ambassador and Australia's captain in a Women's World Cup where the country is regarded as one of the strongest teams in the tournament despite a shock opening defeat to Italy. Though her rise to the higher echelons of women's football has come as no surprise to her coach Despotovski, Kerr once described herself as being \"total crap\" in her first season of playing the game. Read MoreREAD: Australia's thrilling comeback seals victory over BrazilREAD: From nude calendars to title contenders -- The Matildas' long road to successKerr scored the opening goal in Australia's 2-1 defeat by Italy. To understand Kerr's description of her younger self it is to delve a little deeper into how the finest player Australia has produced came to play the beautiful game. Born in Western Australia, the 25-year-old grew up in a family where Australian Football League (AFL), more commonly known as Aussie Rules, was ingrained. Her Indian-born father was a late convert to the game but excelled in the WAFL premiership, the top division, while her brother, Daniel, played for West Coast Eagles in the AFL. \n\n\n\n\nKerr too was also a talented AFL player. At home she would pluck imaginary balls out of the air and practice with her three brothers. She was the lone girl who would star in boys' teams until, aged 12, she reached the end of the road. The differences between the sexes had become too pronounced and so Kerr switched to football, a sport which was alien to the AFL community she had been brought up in. Had there been a pathway for girls in AFL, Kerr admitted her life would have taken a different turn. \"I would have missed out on all of this,\" she told reporters on the eve of the Women's World Cup. \"The rug was ripped out underneath me,\" is how she described being forced to stop playing the childhood sport in which she shone. READ: US defends itself after 13-0 rout of Thailand READ: Women's World Cup -- The crucial statsKerr's now familiar backflip celebration has endeared her to Austalia's football fans. For a sport she did not immediately fall in love with, Kerr's progress was startling. Aged 15 and 150 days, she made her international debut, having already become the youngest scorer in the W-League -- Australia's top division -- and voted players' player of the year. Though she has previously said her intention was to retire aged 21, Kerr is still playing and for that Australia is grateful. She splits her time between Australia and the US playing for the Chicago Red Stars in the American National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) and Perth Glory in the W-League and is the all-time leading scorer in both leagues. Feats achieved despite suffering three major injuries. In 2018, she was named Young Australian of the Year and came fifth in the inaugural women's Ballon d'Or award. Earlier this year it was announced the striker would be the face of Nike in Australia, fronting the company's billboard and TV campaigns in the country in a deal which reportedly makes Kerr -- who has signed a AUS $400,000 [$278,000] contract with Federation Football Australia (FFA) -- the first female Australian soccer player to earn more than AUS $1million a year [$690,000].READ: The footballers changing perceptions around the worldKerr is the all-time leading scorer in both the W-League and the NWSL. How did Kerr become so good so quickly after an inauspicious first season? Work ethic, says Despotovski, who described the 25-year-old as an easy player to coach because of the Australian's desire to \"improve all the time.\" But with national hero status comes responsibility, not that the easy-going Kerr, whom Despotovski confirms is a joker, is the sort to let the hopes of a nation weigh heavy on her shoulders. \"She's a very bubbly person, nothing bothers her,\" he said. \"She comes to a training session and takes the young girls that we have in the squad under her wing and tries to introduce the work ethic she has. \"Even at 25, she's very mature and trying to pass all of that to the younger generation.\"READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in Jamaica Kerr takes a selfie with a young fan  after the 2019 Cup of Nations match between Australia and South Korea in March.The Matildas are a youthful, talented and diverse side and among the most popular teams in the country. In 2017 a first victory over three-time world champions the US made the world sit up and take notice as the Matildas captured the Tournament of Nations. It has been a long road for women's football in Australia, from posing nude to raise funds to compete at the Sydney Olympics 20 years ago to sixth in the world and expected to progress to the latter stages in France. Defeat against Brazil on Thursday, however, and a much-fancied team could become surprise early casualties. A tumultuous start of the year, Despotovski believes, can partly explain for the opening defeat against Italy, a team making its first World Cup appearance in 20 years. In January Alen Stajcic, the coach which guided the Matildas to the quarterfinals of the 2015 World Cup and to a high of fourth in the world rankings, was surprisingly sacked and replaced by Ante Milicic. One of Milicic's first decisions as the Matildas' new boss was to make his star player the captain. It was an appointment Despotovski regarded as shrewd because it is not only speed and ruthlessness in front of goal which marks Kerr as a great but leadership too. \"She doesn't lead by words or anything like that, she leads by action on the field,\" said Despotovski of a player who scored in that opening game against Italy. \"The biggest change is the publicity around the team.\" Kerr tells CNN.Kerr has admitted that the team's form over the last two years has brought with it its own pressure, both negative and positive. With unprecedented success comes expectation.  \"The biggest change for myself and my team is the publicity around the team,\" Kerr, now in her 10th year as an international, told CNN Sport before the tournament. \"The interest in the team from the last World Cup to now is day and night. Obviously with the good comes the bad, but I think it's been mostly positive. \"Everyone's got behind us and loved the way we played but with that comes that pressure, the pressure to have to perform. The year everyone got behind us we had so many good results and that's what people expect of us. We like that, we like that we have high expectations, but it's new for everyone to have this type of pressure and to not disappoint people.\"Though Kerr's personality allows her to take most things in her stride, her maturity and experience has also helped her adapt to the mental pressures that come with being a professional sportswoman. She admitted she has changed the way she approaches a game. In her younger days she used to play a forthcoming game over and over in her head, but it was an approach which eventually played with her mind. These days she tries not to think too much. \"I like to keep it calm on game day. I'm pretty chilled so it's just finding the balance between being focused and also feeling relaxed before the game and supporting my teammates,\" she said.A nation awaits to see what their fearless million dollar player can do.",

        "content": "(CNN)A German court has ruled that the poultry industry practice of killing unwanted chicks is still lawful, until an alternative can be found.The ruling, made by Germany's Federal Administrative Court on Thursday, ordered that the slaughtering of male chicks should continue until methods are developed to determine the sex of an embryo in the egg.Male chicks are considered redundant by both egg and poultry producers -- the former only uses cockerels in breeding programs for insemination, while the latter prizes faster-growing hens for meat. As a result, they are routinely killed in vast numbers in industrial farming around the world.Among the opponents of the controversial practice is Germany's federal minister of food and agriculture Julia Kl\u00f6ckner, who said in a statement following the ruling: \"My position on chick deaths has long been clear: ethically it's not justifiable. The practice has to end as quickly as possible.\"  Canada passes 'Free Willy' bill banning whale and dolphin captivityA spokesperson for Germany's Federal Ministry and Food and Agriculture told CNN that the ministry has invested in 5 million euros ($5.6 million) in ovo sex determination technology -- also called \"Seleggt technology\" -- which will be at the disposal of German hatcheries next year. Read MoreAs soon as the technology is available nationwide, the Animal Welfare Act, which prohibits chick culling, will automatically apply, they added.There are several methods that allow hatcheries to identify the sex of an embryo in an egg, which would allow industries to destroy unwanted male eggs before hatching. However, Judge Renate Philipp said there were \"reasonable grounds\" for the current practice to continue \"until methods to determine sex in the egg\" were developed, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.Health effects of eggs: Where do we stand? AFP reported that the dispute began when the state of North Rhine-Westphalia outlawed the killing of male chicks under the Animal Protection Act in 2013. Two hatcheries challenged the ruling at district level, and the case was escalated to federal court. Several methods are used in the industry to kill the animals, including maceration -- where chicks are put through a high speed grinder -- and the use of inert gases such as argon or nitrogen. British animal rights organization The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has previously said that while the thought of maceration and killing of chicks by gas can be \"distressing,\" both methods \"can offer humane methods of euthanasia, as long as they are carried out correctly by trained, competent staff.\"",

Italy end 20-year wait with shock winHaving last appeared at a Women's World Cup 20 years ago, Italy made a memorable return as Juventus star Barbara Bonansea scored twice, including a dramatic stoppage time winner, to give the Azzurre a shock 2-1 win over much fancied Australia.  The striker popped up at the far post to head home the decisive goal in Valenciennes on Sunday to sink the Matildas, who had been pressing strongly for a winner of their own. It sparked scenes of wild celebration as the Italy bench emptied and Bonansea was hoisted high into the air by her jubilant teammates.Players of Italy throw Bonansea in the air.Ranked sixth in the world and with one of the world's best players in the team in captain Sam Kerr, Australia had gone into the match at the Stade du Hainaut full of confidence and it did not take long for Kerr to make an impression.She won a penalty after being pulled down by Italian counterpart Sara Gama and although her initial weak effort was saved by Laura Guiliana, Kerr scored on the rebound.She celebrated in the style of former Australian international Tim Cahill, punching the corner flag, much to his appreciation, which he shared on social media.

Or Woods the bit-part player with a penchant for Augusta?The 43-year-old told reporters at Pebble Beach Tuesday he was in \"rough shape\" ahead of last month's PGA without expanding on his ailments, but said he was \"trending in the right direction\" ahead of the US Open at a venue which holds fond memories.    Read More\"It's crazy. It's been 19 years.

The 29-year-old Floridian has won the last two US Opens and is bidding to become the first player since Scotland's Willie Anderson in 1905 to win the tournament three times in a row. Only one player has won the same major three times in a row since the Masters was introduced in 1934 --  Australian Peter Thomson won the Open from 1954-1956.  Koepka admits history is not on his side, but acknowledged victory at Pebble Beach would be a unique feat in its own right.\"You look at the guys that have won here at Pebble, all Hall of Famers, some of the greatest players that have ever played the game,\" he said. \"How can you not like the views?

Like, how do you forget that?\" he said.He recalled a tale ahead of last year's US Open at Shinnecock Hills when he was working out in a gym and all eyes were on his close friend Dustin Johnson, even though he was the defending champion. He said it happened again in Canada last week.\"I was working out next to some guy, and he was talking about how Dustin was just in there and how cool it was,\" said Koepka Tuesday.\"And I was with my trainer, Barrett, and we were just kind of laughing.\"The flip side is that Koepka still coming to terms with his growing fame.  \"I view myself completely differently than people view me,\" he said. \"I still think it's weird when I walk into a place and I can see eyes are on me just for dinner. And I'm like, 'What's everybody staring at?'\"I just view myself as a regular guy. I just happen to be really good at golf. I just want to be just like everybody else, just a normal person.\"Despite Koepka's deadpan demeanour on the golf course, his compatriot Jordan Spieth, who has known him since amateur golf days, says he is \"light and fun, and fun to be around.\"\"He's a guy's guy,\" added former world No.1 Spieth. \"He's a good hang always. And he may be stoic on the golf course. I think that's his level of confidence that he has and his level of focus that he's been on.\" Brooks Koepka talks to reporters ahead of the 2019 US Open. Never ending storiesAlongside Woods and Koepka, the narratives at Pebble Beach this week are as tangled as the kelp in Carmel Bay. Veteran Phil Mickelson just needs the US Open to complete the career grand slam of all four major titles, but has finished runner-up a record six times in the tournament. However, the 48-year-old left hander won at Pebble Beach earlier this season for his fifth victory over the celebrated California course.Finish this sentence.

Following two PGA Tour wins at Pebble Beach, he led by three going into the final round of the US Open in 2010,  but amassed a closing 82 to finish tied eighth behind Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell.  Johnson also three-putted from 12 feet on the final green to hand Jordan Spieth the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay. And after his sole major win at the 2016 US Open at Oakmont, he led by four at halfway 12 months ago at Shinnecock before ending two behind Koepka.At Bethpage last month, Johnson took the fight to long-time leader Koepka with a final-round charge before falling short at the end. \"It seems like he steps up and plays really well in big events. That's a sign of a really good player,\" said Johnson of his friend.Third-ranked Rory McIlroy, who won the US Open in 2011, clinched the last of his four majors in 2014 but has hit form at just the right time with a final-round 61 to win in Canada Sunday.  Then there's Spieth, who is only the second player alongside Nicklaus to have won three legs of the career grand slam before the age of 24.Spieth, however, has struggled since his 2017 Open Championship win but has shown glimpses of better days ahead with third at the US PGA and two other top 10s since. \"This one should provide a really cool challenge just given where it is in the setting and the history of this tournament here,\" he told reporters at Pebble Beach. \"We have four Super Bowls a year; this is one of them so it means a lot.\"",

I love these girls, they are something else.\"Read MoreAnte Milicic -- who became Australia's coach in January after Alen Stajcic's surprise sacking -- told reporters that the win was \"one of the finest Australian performances I've seen.\"The Matildas fought back against a side that had last lost a group stage match in 1995, ending a run of three consecutive defeats in the process. Indeed, only one other team -- Sweden in 1995 against Germany -- has come back from two goals down in the Women's World Cup.\"I'm really really proud for the girls because it hasn't been easy for them,\" added Milicic, taking charge of only his seventh game.\"They deserve all the rewards that they were given. The circumstances that we won the game and the three points will be a massive confidence booster for them so I'm really delighted for them. They never stopped believing, the coaching staff never stopped believing.\"READ: Sam Kerr -- The prodigy who became Australia's million dollar playerMarta scores from the penalty spot to make Women's World Cup history. Brazil went ahead through Marta, who scored her 16th World Cup goal and in the process became the first player to score in five editions of the tournament. It was Elise Kellond-Knight who held onto the falling Leticia Santos for too long inside the box to allow Marta -- who was substituted at the break -- to score from the penalty spot and add to her status as the most prolific goalscorer in Women's World Cup history. Cristiane -- who on Sunday became the oldest player to score a World Cup hat-trick in either the men's and women's version -- scored her fourth of the tournament with a delicate, but precise, header into the bottom-right corner. READ: From nude calendars to title contenders -- The Matildas' long road to successFoord's goal before half-time ensured Australia went into the break with hope. But before half-time Caitlin Foord gave the Matildas a lifeline by guiding Tameka Yallop's cross into the net, while a cross by Chloe Logarzo -- intended for captain Sam Kerr -- curled into the net to draw the Matildas level. Australia's third goal was only given after a lengthy VAR review. After Monica had headed the ball into her own net, the goal was initially disallowed as Kerr was deemed offside. But having reviewed the play, the referee awarded the goal, judging that Kerr -- running into the box and a few meters ahead of Monica -- was not interfering with play. The result means three teams in Group C are on three points, with Italy -- playing Jamaica on Friday -- having played one fewer games than Australia and Brazil.Germany qualifies after China win In the day's other match, China beat World Cup debutants South Africa 1-0 thanks to a Li Ying volley minutes before half-time. China's victory meant Germany -- which has won its opening two games -- qualifies for the last 16. China and Spain, level on three points, will play each other on Monday in a match which will decide second place. South Africa, playing in the Women's World Cup for the first time in its history, will need to achieve what would be a remarkable upset by beating Germany comfortably to hope to qualify for the knockout stages.",

Absolutely not.\"But Solo said the US could have toned it down a little. \"You do want the game to be celebrated and you do want to see players having fun but at the same time I thought some of the celebrations were a little overboard,\" Solo wrote. \"A few seemed planned out and I do know some players spend a lot of time thinking about celebrations for the fans.

I celebrate that they're here. For us, the players are excited and I said afterward when you go into a World Cup you can talk tactics, but it's about mentality, it is also about confidence, and so getting off on the right foot is important.\"Solo did give props to US goalie Carli Lloyd, who consoled Thailand's goalkeeper Sukanya Chor Charoenying after the lopsided match.

And they definitely wouldn't have bet that rookie goalie Jordan Binnington, who started the season in the minor leagues, would be the shining star of their championship game. And yet, here we are. Binnington was absolutely on fire Wednesday night. He saved 32 -- count 'em, 32 --  shots and only let one slide by late in the 3rd period when the whole thing was essentially wrapped up anyway. The Blues ended up winning 4-1 to clinch the title over the Boston Bruins. These weren't just garden variety saves, either. Binnington was all over the goal, stretching and snagging and reaching in ways most normal people could never dream of doing, let alone someone swaddled in approximately 586 pounds of padding. To review, the Blues did not start off the season well, at all. They were dead last in the entire league at the beginning of January. On January 7th, they called Binnington up from their AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage. He and the team slowly improved and, well, the rest is history. This is the Blues' first Stanley Cup win in 52 years of being a franchise, and, amazingly, it's the first Stanley Cup win for literally every player on the Blues roster. Binnington, at the tender age of 25, also joins a short but storied list of rookie goalies who helped take their teams all the way. Ken Dryden and Patrick Roy did it for the Montreal Canadiens in 1971 and 1986, respectively; and most recently, Matt Murray of the Pittsburgh Penguins capped his rookie season with a Cup in 2016. Read MoreThen again, maybe we should have seen this coming. Back in February, Binnington gifted Blues fans with a top-quality one-liner that would prove to be pretty prophetic. When asked whether close games make him nervous, Binnington replied, unblinking, \"Do I look nervous?\"Stone cold.",

The ball squirts away off a leading edge. Rayudu and Rohit Sharma -- standing in as captain for Virat Kohli -- cross for a single.But, as Rayudu trots through for a run, securing his side the win with 63 balls still remaining, this one means more. It always does when India and Pakistan take to the field.In the words of Steve Elworthy, the managing director of this summer's Cricket World Cup: \"It is probably one of the biggest games of sport in the world.\"There are very few others that will have the impact that this has in terms of the audience and viewership.\"There are few sporting contests that mean so much to so many.Read MoreRecent tensionIt is, in many senses, the rivalry to end sporting rivalries; if the Ashes -- England's historic contest with Australia -- is the zenith of cricketing traditionalism, then this is something else. Something bigger and something greater, founded on something other than simply runs and wickets -- a sporting feud based on the countries' wider relationship.In February, an increase in violence between the two nations led to fears around their flagship World Cup showdown at Old Trafford, Manchester, on Sunday June 16.At the time, the Board of Control For Cricket in India (BCCI), issued a statement in which it urged \"the cricketing community to sever ties with countries from which terrorism emanates.\"Following that statement, CNN had reached out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for comment but received no response.Much of the tension in recent times has been linked to the conflict in Kashmir. A largely mountainous region located between India and Pakistan, it has had a tumultuous history.The region has been bitterly contested by both India and Pakistan following the partition of the two countries in 1947, leading to three wars and numerous other skirmishes.And while cricket -- within a wider context -- might seem a comparatively trivial matter, it has become a unifying vehicle; a tangible context within which to play out a fierce tension.Rohit Sharma, who captained India in Virat Kohli's absence against Pakistan at the 2018 Asia Cup, leaves the field after masterminding his team's victory.Unprecedented demand\"The India-Pakistan relationship is so critical for cricket,\" says David Richardson, the outgoing chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC). \"It is one of the iconic clashes.\"However, the pair have not met in Test cricket since 2008. The BCCI has refused to take part., while there has been just one bilateral ODI series since then -- taking between December 2012 and January 2013.One of the quirks of international cricket is that series between two nations are -- in the main -- the responsibility of the two national boards, meaning that the ICC does not have the power to force countries to face each other outside of ICC-run competitions.Of course, in global tournaments such as this summer's World Cup, the ICC does hold such jurisdiction and, as a result, the encounter on June 16 has been anticipated like few others.India has won four of the sides' last five ODI meetings, though Pakistan emerged victorious last time the pair met in the UK -- a shock triumph in 2017's ICC Champions Trophy. Few believed a side then in disarray would get beyond the group stage. That, in a nutshell, is the unpredictability of Pakistani cricket.\"The fact that India and Pakistan can play each other in ICC events is a tremendous tool to make sure that things don't get out of hand and that relationships are kept on an even keel,\" Richardson stresses.\"When you see a match played as we will at Old Trafford, you see the fans sitting together -- touch wood -- without any friction and enjoying the game.\"Perhaps fittingly, both Richardson and Elworthy are talking at the launch of the World Cup's partnership with UNICEF, with the focus on bringing people -- children, chiefly -- together.And if Elworthy's claim that this clash is the biggest in world sport seems outlandish, then an unparalleled demand for tickets suggests otherwise. Old Trafford, which has a capacity of 26,000, has had over 400,000 applications from those desperate to witness this titanic clash.Cricket fans in Karachi come together in a local venue to watch the Asia Cup encounter with India.A massive opportunity -- not a daunting risk \"We could fill Wembley four times,\" he chuckles of England's 90,000-seater national football stadium. He is only semi-joking.\"The applications for tickets have come from all over the world,\" Richardson adds. \"New York, everywhere, to come to watch the India-Pakistan game.\"That is their first priority. Then, of course, they hope their team will make the final and they will buy tickets for the final. But this is a huge game.\"The magnitude of the occasion cannot be underplayed. Nor, however, can the scale of the opportunity that comes with it. At a time of societal division, sporting products are quick to highlight their capacity to unify communities.READ: 'I am somebody': How cricket is helping give street children a voiceREAD: Cash, Kings and Kohli: Shane Warne on the IPL's $2.5 billion juggernautREAD: Playboy cricketer to politician, Imran Khan says he's Pakistan's best hopeIn this World Cup though, there is more to these statements than public relations or bluster; the story of the Afghan team -- from refugee camps and Taliban insurgency to World Cup dark horses -- is testament to the sport's genuine power to bring about change.\"This match is a key moment in the tournament, but it is also a very key message in the tournament,\" Elworthy explains.It will be the culmination of an all-encompassing pre-match buildup; rather than looking at the event as a daunting moment, those in charge have taken an opposite view -- that it is an open goal to be leapt on and not to be shirked.For Cricket World Cup managing director Steve Elworthy, India's game against Pakistan does not represent a security risk, but rather the perfcect opportunity to show sport's capacity to bring unity.'A chance to send a powerful message'Manchester will be a festival of activations and fan-zones, activities and a carnival atmosphere. Security, he says, is fluid, but intelligence-led. Rather than an occasion to stage on the down low, it is one to be used to emphasize the potential of rival factions peacefully coexisting.\"If I have a look at everything outside of the cricket, if you look at the wrap-around of all the events and everything that it is happening in and around Manchester in the days before the game and on the day, it is just absolutely testament to how big this actual game is,\" he says.READ: Shane Warne 'expecting huge things' as Australian ball-tampering bans come to an endVisit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videos\"When you talk about the game itself, there are no issues in terms of the fans.

That is one of the most powerful things you can see from a sport: actually making a proper statement that this is about the sport and about setting our differences aside; that we come to a game, we enjoy it, we support our teams. That for me is the most powerful message this World Cup can send.\"",

        "content": "Cannes, France (CNN)An unacknowledged son, photo ops with the mafia and humongous cocaine binges: it's incredible that Diego Maradona found time to become the greatest footballer of his generation.And yet, during his seven years at Napoli, Maradona catapulted an unheralded team to become Italian league champions -- twice -- won the World Cup with Argentina and nearly came within a whisker of defending it.\"The Golden Boy\" collected golden boots like cereal box toys; scored arguably the sport's most famous and infamous goals in the same game. To many Neapolitans and Argentines he was god. But you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain. Such was the case as Maradona's personal life went on to eclipse his exploits on the pitch. Now, after decades keeping the world at arm's length, the Argentine has gone on the record to have his say on a narrative long-calcified in public memory.   Debuting at the Cannes Film Festival, British Oscar-winning documentarian Asif Kapadia has made a punchy -- and surprisingly tender -- portrait of the star rising and falling like a celestial yo-yo, tracking the Argentine's turbulent spell in Southern Italy.Read MoreConfessionalVisually, the film is composed entirely of archive footage, much of it culled from a 500-hour trove shot in the '80s for an unmade documentary commissioned by Maradona's one-time agent Jorge Cyterszpiler. However, it is Kapadia's extensive access to the footballer himself that provides its revelations. Maradona, famously capricious, unspools himself in voiceover recorded by Kapadia at his home. The picture painted is one of a man grasping for equanimity, still wrestling to find peace with a life lived recklessly and unapologetically.Argentinian journalist Daniel Arcucci, British director Asif Kapadia and Maradona's former fitness coach Fernando Signorini pose during a photocall for the film \"Diego Maradona\" at the 72nd edition of the Cannes Film Festival.READ: How Maradona redefined football in the space of five minutes\"(Kapadia) achieved confessions ... that I had never had after having followed him for 30 years as a journalist,\" Maradona's friend and biographer Daniel Arcucci told CNN Sport. And the footballer spilled all \"in such a crude way, that I never expected from him.\"Kapadia's interviews find the filmmaker in new territory: both his previous subjects, Ayrton Senna and Amy Winehouse, were dead before film production began. \"I was hoping to look back on his life a little bit and be able to present it to him while he's still around,\" the director said, \"for him to reassess certain choices that he made.\"Born 1960 in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, Maradona was a \"little black kid from the slum,\" in the words of his former fitness coach Fernando Signorini.Football, says Maradona, \"was my salvation,\" lifting him and his family out of poverty as he rose through the ranks of Argentinos Junior and Boca Juniors, before leaving for a world record transfer fee to Barcelona in 1982. After an injury and illness-beset two seasons \"there wasn't another team in the world that would buy me,\" Maradona says. Enter Napoli, the struggling relative in the Italian family. As one newsreader drolly puts it, \"the poorest city in Italy buys the most expensive player in the world.\"Maradona on the beach with his parents.The CamorraNaples and Maradona had a natural affinity; the \"Africans\" of Italy is how the player coarsely describes the Neapolitans. Both were scrappy and fueled by adversity, both were passionate -- perhaps too much so.\"I was no saint,\" Maradona says, reflecting on his infidelity. While his football dazzled at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, his mistress Cristiana Sinagra was back in Italy, heavily pregnant with Diego Armando Maradona Sinagra. (For years the footballer refused to acknowledge paternity and did not meet his son until 2003). The documentary also covers occasions Maradona came into contact with the Camorra -- the Neapolitan mafia -- with Kapadia flashing up photographs of the footballer smiling alongside members of the crime syndicate. Representative for Maradona Stefano Ceci told CNN Sport via email that he could \"categorically confirm that Mr. Diego Maradona has no involvement with the Neapolitan Camorra\" and that the ex-player \"has never been convicted by a court to support members of the Neapolitan Camorra (sic).\"The photographs, he explained, were taken at a time when \"Diego was the most unapproachable person in Naples\" and that, as Napoli fans, \"the most powerful Camorra family in Naples ... on several occasions looked for a photo shoot with Maradona inviting (him) to various birthday parties of their family.\"Maradon'a on-field genius would go on to be eclipsed by his exploits off it.Parallel to Maradona's on-field genius, alcohol and drugs flowed. \"One hit and I felt like Superman,\" Maradona recalls of his first experience with cocaine while at Barcelona.As a Napoli player at the height of his addiction he would party from Sunday to Wednesday, Maradona describing how he would return home and lock himself in the bathroom to hide from his infant daughters. 'Lucifer lives in Naples'But the crown slipped from the prince of Naples when he broke Italian hearts, scoring for Argentina in the semifinal penalty shootout that knocked the hosts of out the 1990 World Cup. One Italian publication ran a story claiming \"Lucifer lives in Naples.\" A member of the Napoli Utlras, meanwhile, confesses in the film: \"I am still upset with Diego.\"The downfall was swift; the player was left isolated as the press turned on Maradona's addiction woes.A 15-month football ban soon followed for a failed drugs test in 1991. His career wasn't over -- who can forget the midfielder's stunning strike against Greece at the 1994 World Cup before falling foul to another failed drugs test? -- but Maradona never recovered his form on the pitch.\"He was used in a way,\" Signorini told CNN, who makes a distinction between the mild-mannered \"Diego\" he knew and \"Maradona,\" a persona constructed as armor against a prying world.\"It's (like) you're opening up a path in the jungle: the first one is the one who will have to confront all the dangers, then for others the path is already open,\" he added. Subsequent footballers have learned from Maradona's cautionary tale, Signorini implied, but for the Argentine \"nobody could help him on this journey.\" The wistful tone of many of the interviewees suggests they wish they could have. Maradona during downtime listening to records at home.There's more sadness to Kapadia's film than anticipated, and Maradona is on hand to comment on what was going on behind his younger self's often doleful expression. \"By the end of (the interview sessions) I was asking quite tough questions,\" said Kapadia. \"He would try to divert and go off and give you something else entirely.\" Eventually a begrudging respect formed, he added, with Maradona telling the director \"'at least you've got the nerve to ask those questions to my face, not like most of those journalists who do it when I'm not looking.'\"  At the time of writing Maradona had not seen the documentary, said Kapadia. Hopes that he would attend the gala screening at Cannes were dashed by a shoulder injury that kept him in Mexico where he is managing second-tier Dorados de Sinaloa.JUST WATCHED'Goal of the Century': Maradona's 1986 magicReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Goal of the Century': Maradona's 1986 magic 04:33Shoulder injuries aside, Kapadia's film argues that at the age of 58, perhaps some of Maradona's internal wounds have begun to heal.

They found that the females who were denied their first choice adopted a more \"pessimistic\" outlook on life. The study, published Wednesday in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, found that females separated from a preferred partner showed a \"pessimistic bias\" -- in other words, a bleaker outlook on life -- when presented with a challenge. 40,000-year-old severed wolf's head discovered in Siberia In a series of tests, researchers trained the fish to recognize and open boxes, distinguishable by their color and position in the tank: a \"positive\" box filled with a reward of food and an empty \"negative\" box. Biologists then presented the fish with a third \"ambiguous\" box  and measured the reactions of the female fish before and after separation from their preferred partner. Read MoreScientists found that the females who were paired with their preferred partner were quicker to investigate the ambiguous box, but if a female had been separated from her preferred mate, it affected her responsiveness to the task. \"It is a measure of their emotional state, their optimism or pessimism,\" said Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Dechaume-Moncharmont, a behavioral ecologist who was one of the authors of the study.\"If you are in an optimistic mood, you will see the glass half-full.

The study, researchers believe, may help us to understand love and emotional attachment better.\"Many psychologists decided that only humans can feel some emotion to their partner, but with this study, we have shown that is not correct. This will question very deeply the adaptive value of such behavior,\" Dechaume-Moncharmont said. \"Many people consider love as a pollution to our decisions; when you are in love, you may behave a little strangely.

Under the decree -- promoted by populist Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Matteo Salvini -- the captain, owner and operator of vessels entering Italian waters without authorization will face fines of between \u20ac10,000 ($11,300) and \u20ac50,000 ($57,000), the politician told reporters after it was adopted on Tuesday.  Salvini, who swept into office on the back of his anti-migrant policies, did not mention migrant rescue ships specifically. But the decree is a clear attempt to deter such vessels -- which pluck thousands of migrants from the Mediterranean each year -- from docking in Italian ports.Matteo Salvini, Italy's Deputy Prime Minister and leader of right-wing League party.The decree added that vessels repeatedly entering Italian waters without authorization would be impounded.The decree will now go before Parliament for final signoff. But with Salvini's far-right League party and its coalition partner the Five Star Movement holding a majority, it is likely to pass easily.Read MoreDecree a threat to 'human rights'But UN investigators said the decree would \"seriously undermine the human rights of migrants.\"In a letter sent to the Italian government in May, a panel of human rights experts condemned the then-proposed decree, saying it \"represents yet another political attempt to criminalize humanitarian actors delivering life-saving services.\"Such decrees stigmatize migrants as \"possible terrorists, traffickers and smugglers,\" without providing evidence, the experts said. \"We are concerned that this type of rhetoric will further increase the climate of hatred and xenophobia\" in Italy.In response, the Italian government doubled down on its approach, telling the UN in a letter that the organization showed an \"astonishing mental narrowness,\" according to a report by state news agency ANSA. It added that the respect for human rights is a \"priority objective\" of the government.German captain awaiting trialThe decree comes after an online petition calling for the release of German migrant rescue ship captain Pia Klemp received more than 80,000 signatures.Klemp, who captained the ships Sea-Watch 3 and luventa, has been charged by the Italian government with assisting illegal immigration. She is now staying with friends in Germany and Brussels, she told Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung on Friday, and awaiting trial. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, she said.

In 2017, Klemp's ship, the Iuventa, was seized in the Italian port of Lampedusa and the captain and nine other crew members were put under investigation, she told the newspaper.Italy's standoff over migrant rescue ships reached a crisis point in summer last year when a number of vessels, some carrying hundreds of people, were stuck out at sea for days with nowhere to dock.Salvini is one of a number of nationalist politicians in Europe -- including Hungary's Viktor Orban and France's Marine Le Pen -- who have gained popularity in recent years through anti-migrant policies. Against this backdrop, the European Union has increasingly adopted a strategy of supporting the Libyan Coastguard to intercept migrants before they reach European shores.But international rights groups have warned of the dangers facing migrants who are returned to Libya, where they face extreme violence and abuse.

If there is a positive result, then it will require just a point from its final group match against South Africa In Montpellier on Monday.The result will be all the more galling for Spain given the number of chances it created before Daebritz slid home Germany's winning goal.Sara Daebritz of Germany scores her team's first goal against Spain.Nahikari Garcia missed a wonderful opportunity to open the scoring after bursting through the center of the German defense but failed to hit the target. Silvia Meseguer then went close with her effort fizzing inches wide as Spain piled on the pressure.In the end Spain was made to pay. Alexandra Popp's close-range header was only parried by goalkeeper Sandra Panos, allowing Daebritz to beat Marta Torrejon to the ball and poke home what proved to be the winning goal.\n\n\n\n\n\"We did not start well, we were nervous for some reason.

        "content": "Reims, France (CNN)Sport is more often than not a brutal place for the underdog. There should always be hope, of course, but it is usually the Goliaths who win. Just ask Thailand, whose players will be chasing red-shirted American behemoths in their nightmares for a number of nights to come.The 13-0 scoreline was a true reflection of the match. It was a thumping, and it was a night that records tumbled as Thailand suffered the heaviest defeat in World Cup history.As both teams walked out onto the field for their opening match of the Women's World Cup, the difference in the physical statures of the opposing players was startlingly apparent. Not long after the final notes of the national anthems had faded into the ether so the disparity in quality became obvious, too.Alex Morgan scored the opening goal as U.S. dominated Thailand.  READ: 'Every goal counts': USWNT defends itself after humiliating ThailandREAD: Sam Kerr: The prodigy who became Australia's million dollar playerRead MoreOminous warningIt took just 12 minutes for the defending champions to open the scoring, Alex Morgan heading home from four yards. That only Rose Lavelle, who would end the night with two goals, and Lindsey Horan had added to the scoreline by halftime was the real surprise.After the break, the goals quickly came -- four in the space of six minutes, raising the decibels inside Stade Auguste-Delaune, a stadium in France's champagne region which had become a pocket of America for the evening. \n\n\n\n\nAlex Morgan ended the evening with five -- Michelle Akers is the only other player to score as many in a World Cup match -- while Samantha Mewis scored a brace and captain Megan Rapinoe, Mallory Pugh and Carli Lloyd also contributed to the astonishing score.At the final whistle Thailand's players were in tears. Emotional, beaten, exhausted. The odds had always been against them. The bookies' thought so, the fans thought so and so did the experts.This was the world's most successful country in Women's World Cup history, winners of three previous editions of this tournament and favorites in France for a fourth, going up against a nation which was competing in just its second World Cup.It was No.1 in the world versus No. 34 and these sorts of contests usually end one way, though not quite so savagely. In truth, the gulf between the teams was bigger than the world ranking would suggest.READ: The match that changed women's footballREAD: The inspirational footballers helping to change perceptionsU.S. stormed to the biggest margin of victory in World Cup history.Troubled preparation It had not been a perfect build-up for the Americans. Three months before the start of the defense of its title, 28 members of the current squad filed a class-action lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation, alleging that the federation imposes gender discrimination by paying the women less than the members of the men's national team.Former goalkeeper Hope Solo has been vocal this week too, telling the BBC that coach Jill Ellis struggled under pressure in 2016, when the team lost to Sweden in the Olympic quarterfinals -- its earliest exit in a major competition. But the defending champions are eager to make up for the failure of 2016 and the performance in Reims sent out an ominous warning to the teams with hopes of taking the title.With the US 3-0 up by halftime, the match was effectively over before the second half had begun but Ellis proceeded to make attacking substitutions, bringing on forwards Pugh, Lloyd and Christen Press, decisions she defended after the match in the face of criticisms that the team was too ruthless, too eager to celebrate every goal. \"If this is 10-0 in a men's World Cup are we getting the same questions?\" she told reporters. \"A World Cup is about competing. It is about peaking. It is about priming your players ready for the next game.\"You can tell by my substitutions, you play players who can get hot. And if you can play as many hot as you possibly can, feeling good, feeling the back of the net, that's so important for a forward and for a midfielder.\"Those feelings are what can help you through the tournament. We have to come out and we have to play as hard as we possibly can in every game. This will be an incredibly hard World Cup. This is only game one.\"",

We've been pretty pent up, as well. We've had kind of a heavy lead-up, obviously everything off the field. ... So, if our crime is joy, then we'll take that.\"A wider conversation around equality and whether these accusations would've been leveled at a men's team celebrating wildly followed, which were quickly countered by many pointing to the 2014 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico where Cristiano Ronaldo's shirtless flexing at 4-1 was widely ridiculed.Cristiano Ronaldo was widely mocked for this celebration scoring Real Madrid's inconsequential fourth goal in the UEFA Champions League Final against Atletico (Photo by Lars Baron/Getty Images) But whatever side of the debate you land on, what's undoubted is the attention and -- most importantly \u2014 passion this has stirred up around the Women's World Cup.Yes, the coverage and focus has been markedly improved on previous years, but you can't force hype --- and that's exactly what this USWNT has generated.Whether it's cast as the swaggering all-stars crushing all in their path, or the crass American bullies, what's important is that they have now created a narrative which drives all top-level sport, and the heat surrounding the team can only serve to heighten interest in this competition.As England star Toni Duggan points out, a lack of real atmosphere around the women's game is one of the crucial hurdles it needs to overcome if it's going to complete at the same level as the men's.Barcelona FC's forward Toni Duggan (R) celebrates her goal against Atletico Madrid. Recalling her experience in Spain where her Barcelona side traveled to Atletico Madrid for a league fixture, she told The Guardian: \"There's a picture of me celebrating and behind me there's actually a man putting one finger up.\"I'm not promoting that or saying it's a good thing but it kind of showed what it meant. You could feel the passion in the stadium that day. It was a real atmosphere, it was a massive game and it was only a league game.\"In Spain there's a lot more publicity ... when we're successful we're front page of the newspaper -- every newspaper and the big ones, Marca and others -- but then also when we lose we're slated. That's the level the game is at. It's the same as the men's \u2014 that's how we're treated there.\"READ: The football prodigy who became Australia's million dollar playerREAD: The female footballers who fought for change in South AmericaThe USWNT have put themselves front and center of soccer panel shows, social media debate, and a simple Google search puts the match as the most written about fixture in the World Cup so far after just one day, surpassing England vs. Scotland. Team USA may have won themselves few fans with their antics on Tuesday, but what they did for the narrative of the tournament has proven to be the biggest PR generator the women's game could have hoped for.

ACC is an extremely rare form of cancer, of which there are about 1,200 new cases discovered in the US each year, according to oncologist Dr. Alan Ho of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.Grunewald crosses the finish line in the 1500m at the 2017 US championships.She was then diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2010 and underwent radioactive treatment.

After more surgery to remove a large tumor, follow-up scans revealed that a dozen smaller tumors had appeared in its place.She formed the Brave Like Gaby Foundation to support research and treatments for rare cancer patients.\"I think being an athlete and being a runner has definitely effected how I approached surviving cancer,\" Grunewald told CNN last year.\"It's a sense of, I grind through my training and my runs, and sometimes it's really hard. But there's always a light at the end of the tunnel, and sometimes it takes a while to get there.\"I take some of that attitude into surviving my cancer, and there are days that require so much endurance and patience and persistence that you have as a runner. \"There's some tough races that I've had to bounce back from, and tough workouts, and that's the same thing with my treatments ...

        "content": "(CNN)The Vatican has come under fire from LGBTQ groups after releasing a guide to sexuality for Catholic schools across the world that describes non-binary gender as \"fictitious.\"The church's education ministry on Monday released the 31-page document, called \"Male and Female He Created Them,\" for parents, students, school leaders and bishops. The paper said that we are now facing an \"educational crisis\" in the field of sexuality, adding that the \"process of identifying sexual identity\" was being made difficult by the \"fictitious (construct) known as 'gender neuter' or 'third gender.'\"It comes as many countries mark Pride Month, an annual celebration of the LGBTQ community, and LGBTQ Catholic campaign groups were quick to condemn the Vatican's guidebook.Pope likens abortion to 'hiring a hitman' at anti-abortion conferenceNew Ways Ministry, a US-based ministry which advocates for LGBTQ Catholics, slammed the document as a \"harmful tool that will be used to oppress and harm not only transgender people, but lesbian, gay, bisexual people, too.\"Read MoreFrancis DeBernardo, the ministry's executive director, said it would confuse those struggling with questions of gender identity and sexual orientation -- and could lead to self-harm, addiction and even suicide. Research has found LGBTQ teens have a much greater risk of suicide.\"The only truth that the document reveals is that the Vatican remains ill-equipped to discuss gender and sexuality in the modern world,\" DeBernardo said. \"The Vatican remains in the dark ages, promoting a false teaching that relies on myth, rumor, and falsehoods.\"Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of \"Building a Bridge,\" which looks at the Catholic Church's relationship with the LGBT community, said in a tweet that the Vatican paper \"rightly calls for 'dialogue' and 'listening,' but sets aside the real-life experiences of LGBT people.\"\"Sadly, it will be used as a cudgel against transgender people, and an excuse to argue that they shouldn't even exist,\" he added.Polish priest blames 'devil' as he's confronted by alleged victim whose life was ruinedThe Vatican paper adds that \"a person's sex is a structural determinant of male or female identity.\" And that when people tried to erase the differences between men and women, it \"undoubtedly helped to destabilize the family as an institution, bringing with it a tendency to cancel out the differences between men and women.\" The document is not signed by Pope Francis but does include quotes from the pontiff. The paper comes amid fresh scrutiny of the church's stance on LGBTQ issues. In recent years, a number of government institutions around the world have recognized non-binary gender identities. And while the Catholic Church has traditionally had conservative ideas on gender and sexuality, in 2016 Pope Francis said the church owed LGBT people an apology for historically condemning homosexuality. In recent years, the church has also come under intense scrutiny over its handling of sexual abuse cases and, in March, the Vatican issued tougher rules governing the sexual abuse of minors.Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)The UK government is facing a court challenge over its use of children as spies in criminal investigations, as lawyers for a children's charity accused it of causing minors \"severe physical and emotional harm.\"Just for Kids Law said the use of minors as \"covert human intelligence sources\" (CHIS) without adequate safeguards violates national and international human-rights laws, including the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. A hearing was held Tuesday in the charity's case against the Home Office.Caoilfhionn Gallagher, representing the charity, cited a case raised in the British Parliament in October in which police asked a 17-year-old girl to spy on a man, subjecting her to sexual exploitation. \"While deployed, she continued to be exploited by him and the papers suggest she was even coerced into being an accessory to murder,\" Gallagher said, according to the British Press Association (PA).UK legislation permits the use of children as spies by police and other authorities, but an assessment of the risks involved must be carried out. Authorities must determine that \"risks identified in it are justified\" and \"have been properly explained to and understood by the source.\" Read MoreGallagher fears children could be increasingly used as spies in what she described as \"the most grave and dangerous contexts,\" the PA reported. Children could be employed in investigations into terrorism, gang violence, child sexual exploitation and drug offenses, the lawyer said in a written submission.\"Given that young people are increasingly involved, both as perpetrators and victims, in serious crimes ... there is increasing scope for juvenile CHIS to assist in both preventing and prosecuting such offences,\" Ben Wallace, Minister of State for Security and Economic Crime, said in a letter last July to the House of Lords.MPs call for inquiry into UK Home Office treatment of foreign studentsIn a statement to CNN, Wallace said: \"Juvenile covert human intelligence sources are used very rarely and only ever when it is necessary and proportionate and when there is no other less intrusive way to get the information needed to convict criminals or terrorist suspects.\"\"Their use is governed by a strict legal framework and is overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Throughout any deployment and beyond, the welfare of the young person is the paramount consideration,\" he said.In response to a request from a member of Parliament, Adrian Fulford, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, confirmed in a March 2019 letter that 17 children had been authorized for use as spies since January 2015. One was 15, while the others were 16 or 17.  \"Overall, the low numbers show that this tactic is only utilised in extreme circumstances and when other potential sources of information have been exhausted,\" Fulford wrote.James Eadie, representing Home Secretary Sajid Javid, said at Tuesday's hearing that the use of minors as informants \"may be very important for reasons of national security, public safety, and the prevention of disorder and crime,\" according to PA.The aim of the CHIS program \"is to ensure that use is properly controlled and accompanied by appropriate decision making,\" Eadie said. \"To that end, the welfare of the child is placed at the forefront of decision making as to the deployment of CHIS and the scheme provides adequate and appropriate safeguards.\"Judge Michael Supperstone will rule on the legal challenge at a later date, PA reported.",

London (CNN)The race to become Britain's next Prime Minister has taken a turn for the surreal, as a popular TV presenter best known for interviewing minor celebrities and dispensing lifestyle advice became involved in a public spat with one of the candidates. Lorraine Kelly, a mainstay of British morning television who combines a sunny outlook with plain-speaking Scottish patter, delivered an unusually pointed series of barbs over two days, directed at one of the outsiders in the 10-strong field to succeed Theresa May as leader of the governing Conservative Party.File photo of presenter Lorraine Kelly (center) meeting Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during the royal couple's visit to ITV's This Morning show. The spectacle began on Monday when viewers of ITV's \"Good Morning Britain\" saw Kelly's decidedly lukewarm reaction to an interview with Esther McVey, a hard-Brexiteer who, before becoming a Member of Parliament, was an anchor on a previous incarnation of the same show. After a day of social media comment, \"Good Morning Britain\" host Piers Morgan brought it up on Tuesday, in a live tease for Kelly's subsequent show, the eponymous \"Lorraine.\"\"Yesterday, Piers, I'll be honest with you, I just got sick to the back teeth of the whole toxic political atmosphere,\" Kelly replied.Then Kelly took aim at McVey's poor voting record on equality issues. \"I strongly disagree with her on LGBT rights, I just thought, I've had enough of this, we've had two-and-a-half years of going round in circles and not sorting Brexit out, and now we've got a state in Britain where people are at each other's throats, and it's got to stop.\"Read MoreWhile no one would suggest that Kelly is the voice of the nation, it's a fair point. Brexit is at a standstill. The European Union is clear that the deal struck by May last year is the only one the UK will get, and that negotiations on how the UK leaves the EU will not be reopened.However, since May announced her decision to stand down as leader of the governing Conservative party and the nation, those jockeying to take her place seem to have conveniently forgotten this fact. They are instead promising tweaked Brexit deals -- alongside other wild and uncosted policies -- that appear to have little grounding in reality. JUST WATCHEDTrump: May's probably a better negotiator than meReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump: May's probably a better negotiator than me 00:56The Conservative party has for decades held its record of sensible economic management as its chief advantage over the main opposition Labour party. This should be especially true right now, as Labour -- once the party of centrist icon Tony Blair -- is currently led by the far-left Jeremy Corbyn.Instead, the Conservative party -- arguably the group of people most responsible for Britain's Brexit paralysis -- is effectively playing chicken with the nation's finances by creating an unprecedented level of uncertainty. It's all very strange. Conservative Party MP Esther McVey speaks at a political rally entitled Lets Go WTO hosted by pro-Brexit lobby group Leave Means Leave.Public polling is throwing up all sorts of weird results at the moment. At last month's EU elections, neither main political party finished in first or second place. Those spots were taken by the Brexit party, who support a clean break from the EU, and the Liberal Democrats, who want to stop the whole thing and stay in the EU. Brexit has created an odd atmosphere among a public that was in 2016 effectively split down the middle by a binary vote. This is what Kelly was talking about. Michael Gove, British PM hopeful: 'I deeply regret' taking cocaineHowever, it isn't the public that gets to select the next Prime Minister. That honor falls to the 160,000 Conservative party members -- roughly 0.25% of the country. So, the destiny of a country that is facing its largest political crisis since the end of the Second World War is in the hands of political activists from one political party.It's little wonder so many in the UK, like Lorraine Kelly, are sick of the whole thing.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)At first glance, the arrest of investigative journalist Ivan Golunov seemed to be the latest in a string of attacks on the free press in Russia. The reporter was brought up last week on what to many appeared to be a fabricated drugs charge.But the response to his detainment took the Kremlin -- and Russian society -- by surprise. For starters, Golunov's arrest prompted an outpouring of journalistic solidarity. Over the weekend, Russian reporters took turns staging solo protests, lining up to hold placards outside the Moscow branch of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Those single-person pickets -- which do not require a permit -- continued into Monday evening.Shift change of the one-person picket for #IvanGolunov pic.twitter.com/wdnzTa3c2g\u2014 Nathan Hodge (@nohodge) June 10, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, authorities reversed course and announced they had dropped the case against Golunov because a lack of evidence, Minister for Internal Affairs Vladimir Kolokoltsev said. But the outcry over his case represented a spontaneous burst of protest in a country where political speech is often tightly controlled. And Russian media organizations -- both independent and pro-Kremlin -- rallied to Golunov's cause.Read MoreOn Monday, three leading Russian business newspapers published identical front pages with the headline: \"I/We are Ivan Golunov.\" It was a phrase reminiscent of \"Je suis Charlie,\" the slogan that went viral after the 2015 mass shooting at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo.Three papers ran the same headline on Monday: \"I'm/we are Ivan Golunov.Colleagues and supporters of Golunov gather at a court building in Moscow on Saturday. Equally striking was support from Russia's celebrities, artists and performers. Many Russian celebrities posted videos calling for Golunov's release, calling his case an important test for the rule of law.\"It's crucial that Ivan Golunov walks free not only for himself and for his loved ones, friends or colleagues,\" said rapper Oxxxymiron (Miron Fedorov). \"It's crucial for the whole society and all of us. Because if bravery will continue to be punished and villainy will be praised, none of us have a future.\"Veteran rock musician Andrey Makarevich recorded a video statement in support of the journalist, saying \"We must do everything so this travesty ends.\" Makarevich's band, Mashina Vremeni (Time Machine), was scheduled to perform Wednesday in Moscow's Red Square to celebrate Russia's National Day, but the performance was canceled after \"a call,\" the musician said on Facebook. Chulpan Khamatova, the actress best known for her role in the 2003 film \"Good Bye Lenin!,\" said, \"I want to live in a country where there is no fear. I don't want to be afraid. Ivan Golunov must be free.\"Many others weighed in. But Fekla Tolstoy, a TV personality descended from author Leo Tolstoy, suggested why the case resonated with so many Russians.\"It's not just the latest attack on freedom of speech, it's a signal to all of us: Anyone one of us can be arrested,\" she said. \"And we can't put up with that.\"A protester in St. Petersburg holds up a poster calling for Golunov to be freed on Saturday.  A protest outside a government building in Moscow on Friday. Kremlin acknowledges conflicting informationGolunov is best known for his investigations into large-scale crime and corruption in Moscow. He investigated how family members of Moscow's deputy mayor purchased nine elite multi-million penthouses in just one day; a state communications regulator's use of artificial intelligence and hundreds of staffers to censor the Russian internet; and linked Moscow's funeral business to criminals and government circles.The last investigation Golunov published before his arrest was an expose on how Moscow loan sharks deceive debtors to seize their property, evicting over 500 residents in five years.Russia's police are widely criticized for corruption, and official handling of the case has only fueled suspicion that the case against Golunov has been fabricated.Golunov was arrested Thursday and subsequently charged with intention to sell drugs in large quantities. Police initially released images from his apartment that appeared to show a kind of drug laboratory, but subsequently backtracked, saying most of the images were not from Golunov's apartment.On Tuesday, police dropped the charges and freed Golunov from house arrest.   \"According to the results of biological, forensic and fingerprint examinations and DNA testing, a decision was made to terminate the criminal prosecution of citizen Ivan Golunov due to the lack of evidence of his participation in the crime. Today he will be released from house arrest, and the charges will be dropped,\" said Kolokoltsev, the interior minister.Kolokoltsev added that the police officers involved in detaining the journalist had been suspended and that he would request the dismissal of two senior interior ministry officials.Before Golunov's release, even the Kremlin acknowledged conflicting information in the case.Asked to comment on police statements over the weekend, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday: \"We have paid attention to the corrections that were later published, and we also proceed from the fact that there are several issues that are in need of a clarification.\"Peskov's comments were the closest the Kremlin has come to acknowledging the public outcry. Meanwhile, Meduza, Golunov's employer, and other media outlets have raised questions about his treatment in custody.Golunov breaks down during a hearing at a Moscow court on Saturday. The ambulance doctor who examined Golunov in police custody said the journalist had a concussion, bruising and possible broken ribs. Police subsequently allowed him to be examined, according to a statement from the Moscow branch of the interior ministry, and a prominent doctor said there was no need for him to be hospitalized -- although some questioned the doctor's political motives for saying so.Speaking in the courtroom on Saturday, an emotional Golunov clearly appeared to be under enormous stress.\"This is all very hard, it's like in a movie,\" he said, before breaking down and crying. \"I never thought that I'll be attending my own funeral.\"That spectacle, then, may also be what is driving public outrage.Film director Andrey Zvyagintsev spoke for many when he said the case had laid bare official corruption and hypocrisy.\"This is all fake, pretend and lies,\" he said. \"How long? How long will this dragon tribe drink our blood, when will they be sated? For how long can we observe this and be indifferent?\"",
