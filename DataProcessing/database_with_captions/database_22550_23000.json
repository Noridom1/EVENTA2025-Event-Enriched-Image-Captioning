        "content": "(CNN)Breath and breathing seem to have taken on added significance for the world as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic -- even more so if you're asthmatic.US sprinter Noah Lyles is an asthmatic. Though you'd never have guessed -- he secured his 200 meters world title with a run of 19.83 seconds, which if the average healthy adult's normal respiratory rate is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, would have taken the track star just a handful of breaths to complete his landmark run. \"Asthma definitely affects kind of everything I do in terms of health, physical fitness, sometimes even emotional because if you're emotionally fatigued, that can bring your immune system down,\" Lyles told CNN Sport. \"So it's kind of important that I keep high spirits in times like this, and it makes me a bigger risk factor. Having the asthma with the allergies, I've said that I used to get sick a lot of times during allergy season, so I'm doing everything I can to make sure that I keep them under control. \"I'm gonna continue to try to make sure that I'm healthy, washing my hands, taking vitamin C, doing a little bit of warm water with lemon. Doing these things are increasing my chances of not getting sick.\"Read MoreThis isn't the first time the 22-year-old American has dealt with a global epidemic. \"I actually did get the swine flu in 2009. It's something I overcame and knowing that I've done that it definitely gives me confidence knowing that I can keep fighting each time, even if I get it I know I'll be able to overcome it.\"Sprinter Noah Lyles has suffered with asthma since childhood.READ: Fixing 2021 sporting calendar will be like a 'huge jigsaw puzzle'Growing up with asthmaThe sprinter has suffered with the respiratory condition ever since he was a child and needed to be homeschooled during his early years. \"So about three to four, all the way to about seven years old, I was dealing with asthma and asthma attacks seriously, like in the hospital, maybe every third night; coughing fits, constantly sick because my immune system was weak.\"After a tonsillectomy, a change in diet and the support of his mom, Lyles was able to attend public school. There he had more challenges to overcome.\"Around second grade that's when I kind of got diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and dyslexia and it became a situation where I was kind of alienated from the rest of my friends. \"It was a lot harder to go through standardized testing and even simple things like spelling tests. I know a lot of people forget about those. But spelling tests were probably the worst days of my life.\"You know you can spell the word in your head, but as soon as you try to start writing it's like: 'that doesn't look right. But I don't remember exactly how it's supposed to look.' \"Those are pretty hard days and even all the way through high school it was very stressful because you have to put in 10 times more work just to reach the average level of what they want you to learn.\"School had always been a very hard point for me and sports was definitely my outlet of where I could go, where I felt I was great.\"Away from the track, Lyles is a passionate musician.\"I got into music probably about two years ago and I just started, I went from making kind of 'poem-ish things' and I was like, you know what I want to put music to them.\"To help promote last year's Diamond League meeting in Zurich Lyles and pole vaulter Sandi Morris collaborated with the Swiss pop group Baba Shrimp on the music video 'Souvenir.'Lyles says he uses his struggles growing up as inspiration for his music.\"I feel that a lot of kids through adolescence aren't heard. I'm kind of basically trying to tell the world what it's like during those time periods, and everybody's gone through it. But I feel that a lot of people forget.\"JUST WATCHEDAthletes at home during the coronavirus quarantineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAthletes at home during the coronavirus quarantine 02:17READ: The gaming event that raised $2.7M for coronavirus aidStaying connectedAs the world continues to adjust to staying at home to fight Covid-19, Lyles has had to modify his training regime.\"I'm now what I would call a park exerciser,\" Lyles, who is based in Florida, told CNN. \"We have been training in a park and we have been like split up majorly. So we actually have a decent sized group, we're about 24 people and we're kind of broken up into groups of six or less. And we come at different times and we aren't able to do nearly as much. I don't even remember what the track smells like. So it's different.\"If training has been different, his athletics career had already given him a good idea of dealing with self isolation.  \"Social distancing is kind of easy for us as athletes, because all we do is like practice, eat, recover, go to sleep. At least in the track world, we don't really get to go out.\"With athletics events around the world either postponed or canceled, the lack of traveling has given Lyles more free time. Along with his music, he has been producing art and playing card games. Leading sports psychiatrist Dr. Carla Edwards recently told CNN that \"human interaction was really, really important\" for athletes during this epidemic. Lyles is a keen gamer and has been playing video games such as Overwatch, Halo 5 and Dead by Daylight. He says it has helped him stay connected.\"When my generation plays video games we're not getting on to play alone. A lot of that is playing with others. So when I get on, I'm usually texting three or four of my friends: 'hey, I'm getting on. Get on with me so we can play.' \"I call my family almost every day. I called my sister up. I think I woke her up on accident this morning. But I literally called her because I was like, 'I wonder what my sister is doing right now?'

But this is only within the area of the fire outbreak.\"His measurements refer to the microsievert per hour (\u03bcSv/h) reading; the maximum allowable amount of natural background radiation is 0.5 \u03bcSv/h, the emergency services said, but Firsov's reported amount was nearly five times that.A total of 124 firefighters, two An-32P planes and an Mi-8 helicopter are battling the largest blazes, and have carried out 42 water drops on the area. Another 14 firefighters were battling a smaller blaze of around 12 acres, the emergency services said.Read MoreHowever, the spike in radiation levels does not appear to extend to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, or to the city of Chernobyl itself, where authorities say radiation levels remain normal.

I hope they will be voted in. Otherwise, large-scale fires will continue to occur every autumn and spring,\" he wrote. CNN's Mary Ilyushina contributed reporting.",

        "content": "London (CNN)England and Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker has apologized for reportedly hosting a party with two sex workers while urging fans to stay at home and respect the United Kingdom government's coronavirus lockdown.British tabloids, including The Sun, posted details over the weekend of a gathering Walker held at his home, which included two sex workers and a friend.The meeting breaks the UK's current lockdown laws, which ban gatherings of more than two people and states that Britons must not leave their homes apart from for essential reasons, and only with members of their own household.Last month Walker had urged supporters to follow those rules, writing on Twitter: \"On a serious note though, please everyone stay home, look after one another through this difficult time and check in on loved ones but don't visit them.\"In a statement sent to CNN by Walker's agency, the England full-back said: \"I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week which have resulted in a story today about my private life in a tabloid newspaper.Read More\"I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down,\" he added.\"There are heroes out there making a vital difference to society at the moment, and I have been keen to help support and highlight their amazing sacrifices and life-saving work over the past week.\"My actions in this matter are in direct contrast to what I should have been doing regarding the lockdown. And I want to re-iterate the message: Stay home, stay safe.\"Kyle Walker of Manchester City prepares to go in goal after Claudio Bravo of Manchester City received a red card during the UEFA Champions League group C match between Atalanta and Manchester City at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza on November 06, 2019 in Milan, Italy. Walker has 48 England caps and is a first-team member in both the national team and Manchester City's squads.Manchester City have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. In a statement sent to the BBC, the club said they are aware of the incident and would be conducting internal disciplinary procedures.\"Footballers are global role models, and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS and other key workers in fighting the effects of the Covid-19 coronavirus in any way we can. Kyle's actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts,\" the club said.'Deeply embarrassed' Jack Grealish apologizes for ignoring UK government lockdown adviceLast week, Premier League star Jack Grealish -- who plays for Aston Villa -- was also forced to apologize for breaking the country's lockdown rules.Grealish said he was \"deeply embarrassed\" after UK media reported that he was pictured at the scene of a road traffic accident, where two parked cars suffered minor damage. Villa has fined and disciplined Grealish. Like Walker, Grealish had also previously urged people to stay at home on social media. \"To help save lives, you must stay at home. Only leave your house to buy food, to buy medicine, or to exercise,\" Grealish said in a video posted to Twitter.The incidents come as Premier League footballers find themselves being urged by some -- including UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock -- to take pay cuts in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, which is leaving clubs large and small facing huge financial losses and resulting in some furloughing their non-playing staff.Ex-England star Wayne Rooney wrote in a column in The Times newspaper on Sunday that players are being treated as \"scapegoats\" over the issue, noting that not every player could survive a 30% drop in their income.",

        "content": "(CNN)It came from China, that's where this all began. It's the reason NBA games were canceled and why the brand value plunged. The source of so much angst for officials at the world's top basketball league.Chaos ensued in October, when the NBA found itself at odds with the Chinese government.Remember that? It was only six months ago, but already it seems like a trifling matter from a distant era.Between then and now, the 2019-20 season has been extraordinary for the NBA. A season birthed in controversy, lurching towards loss and unexpected tragedy, and now, like all other sports, dealing with the repercussions of a crippling global pandemic. The NBA could lose billions this season. Who will eat that loss? A season in which the notion of crisis has been redefined within just a matter of months.Read More\"I get chills just thinking about it,\" USA Today's Christine Brennan told CNN Sport. \"Basketball is a global game and a worldwide beacon and I'll bet that this season will be studied for years to come. It's a microcosm of everything in our sports, in our culture and in our history.\"First, on October 4, there was a tweet. Just a single image from the general manager of the Houston Rockets -- a slogan supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Overnight, it thrust the NBA's business relations with China, by far its biggest overseas market, into crisis. What should have been a quick pre-season victory lap in Asia, showcasing the best of the NBA's talent to a burgeoning new audience, descended into a series of abruptly canceled games and awkward press conferences. At stake, balancing the issue of free speech with the delicate sensitivities of a major business partner.The league's biggest star, LeBron James, along with anyone else trying to walk the tightrope between the two, found themselves in a no-win situation. As sponsorship evaporated along with valuable television exposure, the losses for the NBA were staggering -- estimated at up to $200 million in revenue. Barely five months later, the China fiasco was front-of-mind for some league officials who were now grappling with the cascade of worrying -- and likely even costlier -- news about the coronavirus pandemic. READ: Former NBA star Stephon Marbury to help bring masks to New YorkAnti-Chinese Communist Party activists protest outside Staples Center where free t-shirts were distributed supporting Hong Kong.A sad start to the yearBut we're getting ahead of ourselves.Just as the season had begun under a cloud, so too did the year. On January 1, the NBA's former commissioner David Stern died at the age of 77.For 30 years, he'd been at the helm of the league, overseeing its globalization. Having suffered a brain hemorrhage in December, his passing wasn't totally unexpected, but an influential figure had now left the stage. Barely three weeks later, the NBA was in mourning again and this time, it was truly stunned after the 41-year-old Kobe Bryant, one of the biggest names in basketball history, died in a helicopter crash alongside his daughter Gianna and seven others. Kobe Bryant headlines Hall of Fame classHis former team, the LA Lakers, were in so much pain that they couldn't play for a week. All of a sudden, the idea of sport seemed a little less important.Then again, if you'd told any of those Lakers stars on the last day of January that they'd only play another 17 games before the whole league would be shut down, they'd have looked at you sideways. This was the season that was supposed to have everything. The emergence of a new generation of stars like Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and Trae Young and continued excitement of the international narrative, thanks to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic. And maybe, with James and Anthony Davis now in the groove, the Lakers were going to rediscover past glories. READ: NBA returns in virtual form as Kevin Durant headlines video game tournamentGianna and her father, Kobe, attend the WNBA All-Star Game 2019.But for those who've been covering the game, the most pertinent action has been away from the court. Ernie Johnson has been hosting the popular 'Inside the NBA' show since 1990; he says he's never seen anything like it. Having navigated through the fiasco in China, the story quickly turned to one of sadness and despair. \"David Stern and Kobe Bryant died less than four weeks apart and suddenly, the whole tenor of the season had changed. It was hard to explain, but there was a pall over the league,\" Johnson told CNN Sport.Instead of covering a game in Los Angeles, Johnson broadcast a tribute show from the middle of the court at Staples Center.\"I've been doing this for thirty years, sitting in that chair hosting 'Inside the NBA,' I've never done a show like it.  It wasn't a basketball story; it was a story about shattered families. The emotion was so raw, I've never been a part of anything as powerful as that.\"All over the league, people were reeling.\"David Stern was the architect of modern NBA and sassy and vital and just an unbelievable visionary,\" Atlanta Hawks CEO Steve Koonin told CNN Sport. \"And to have both of those icons of our game pass away within a month of each other was something that made me very sad. It stunned me.\"Johnson is joined by Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley.That night in LA, Johnson was surrounded by some of his closest friends and colleagues, including NBA legends Shaquille O'Neal and Charles Barkley. Fast forward to March and Johnson was fronting another show that was equally unprecedented. \"After the All-Star game, we had this stretch until the playoffs and now this mysterious coronavirus is in the mix. We had this show on a Thursday night when there are no games to be played but we're still going to do a show. It's me, Shaq and Kenny Smith and Charles joins us on the phone. \"He (Charles) can't be there in person because he's just been tested for the virus. On so many fronts, this entire season has been a surreal experience. Normality is out the window. I just don't know where we go from here, I just don't know. \"That sentiment is echoed throughout the league. Koonin, who's been the Hawks' CEO since 2014, put it this way: \"It has been an extraordinarily unique year. I'm not sure that what we know as normal will ever exist again. We're calling it business as unusual.\" READ: A fierce critic of Turkey, Kanter has more than just losing the NBA season on his mindKobe's former teammate, Shaquille O'Neal, pays tribute to him following his death. On holdThe league has been suspended since March 11 and nobody seems to have much of an idea when play will start up again.Can anything be learned from the events of the 2019-20 season? Koonin says that behind the scenes, teams are actively working to \"provide a safe, structured environment where people can come and consume sports live in a safe environment.\" But, when it comes to planning for the impact of a season like this, he doesn't think there's much you can do. \"If we look at the milestone events that we have been talking about, none of them occurred on the court. So, from a basketball sense, nothing has really changed. \"In a business sense, you have to prepare for all potential outcomes, but 'bleep' is going to happen. And the one that you can't plan for is probably the one that's going to happen.\"So how will Johnson remember this season?Fans leave the building after the Sacramento King game against the New Orleans Pelicans was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.He takes a breath, trying to find the words. \"Your memories of a season will be somewhat based on how the season ended, as it always does. Like the shot by Kawhi Leonard that bounced on the rim three times before dropping to put the Raptors through to the eastern conference finals. You remember those moments.\"As it stands right now, the memory will be tragedy. The memory will be a hillside outside Los Angeles; it will be the death of David Stern. It will be players walking off the court and not returning. And even if they do somehow finish the season, the lingering thoughts will be of Kobe and those families, David Stern and this unseen and unnerving menace that we're all going to try and get a handle on.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThe beauty of sport, the reason that so many of us love it, is that it's unplanned and unscripted; we should expect the unexpected. That's certainly one way of looking at this remarkable NBA season, but there's not been much to love about it. Given everything that's happened so far, perhaps it's better left unfinished. As Johnson put it: \"I love basketball as much as the next guy. But if it comes down to: 'Sorry, we're not going to have a champion, we're going to do the right thing, we're going to do what then experts have told us and not play anymore' then I'd be good with that.\"",

Johnson, 55, was first admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were \"routine tests,\" saying on social media that he was in \"good spirits.\"But the apparent change in the leader's health has shocked the nation, with politicians from his party and the opposition voicing their support for the leader, as the country battles an outbreak that has killed more than 5,000 people.  How can Boris Johnson run the UK while suffering from coronavirus?\"Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,\" a Downing Street spokesperson said.According to Downing Street officials, Johnson remains conscious and has been moved to the intensive care unit as a precaution, in case he requires ventilation.Read MoreThe move strikes a sharp contrast to earlier reports on Johnson's condition: During his period of self-isolation, Downing Street had said that Johnson's symptoms were \"mild,\" and on Sunday said his hospitalization was just a \"precautionary step.\"The Prime Minister's spokesperson had said earlier on Monday that Johnson spent a \"comfortable\" night in hospital, but would not comment on reports Johnson was given oxygen. Officials are no longer describing his symptoms as mild.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State and the most senior Cabinet minister, said Johnson had asked him to deputize for the leader where necessary.Raab chaired Monday's regular morning coronavirus briefing and made a televised statement saying that the government will continue Johnson's direction in responding to the outbreak.It's not easy to get a coronavirus test in the UK, so Britons are turning to mail-order kits\"The government's business will continue and the Prime Minister is in safe hands with a brilliant team at St Thomas's hospital. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister's direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward,\" he said. He added there was an \"incredibly strong team spirit\" in government behind the Prime Minister. Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit at around 7 p.m., Downing Street said. The decision was made by the leader's medical team after his condition worsened over the afternoon on Monday. The United Kingdom's death toll of above 5,000 is one of the highest in the world. The government has been scrambling to implement widespread testing as evidence grows that asymptomatic people could carry and spread the virus.'Together we will beat this,' Johnson saidJohnson was hospitalized Sunday because he was still suffering coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus. The British leader announced on March 27 that he had been infected and was, at the time, suffering mild symptoms including a cough and fever.At the time, he vowed to continue leading the nation's response to the outbreak and hold meetings via video-conference, saying in a video: \"Together we will beat this.\" Related storiesUK records biggest one-day rise in deathsVirus strikes heart of UK government Track the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusBritish politicians from Johnson's ruling Conservative Party, as well as the main opposition Labour Party, have united in their wishes for the Prime Minister's recovery.

        "content": "(CNN)As other sports search for solutions on how to carry out events in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, UFC president Dana White believes he has come up with a creative resolution. The upcoming UFC 249 event on April 18 was originally scheduled to take place in New York City but was forced to move because of the spread of Covid-19 and bans on public gatherings.  After much speculation about whether the event will go ahead, White told TMZ Sports on Monday that he is a \"day or two away\" from securing a private island which will host the upcoming event, and subsequent fight nights. \"We're getting the infrastructure put in now so I'm going to start doing the international fights too,\" he said.\"I won't be able to get international fighters, all of them, into the US, so I have a private island. I'm going to start flying them all into the private island and doing international fights from there. So as of April 18, the UFC is back up and running.\"Read More\"We're going to get the fighters somewhere, and we're going to bring them to this location.

The island will be closed to fans -- with the event being streamed exclusively on ESPN -- and only a select few members of the media will be permitted. Fighters will congregate in one place before private planes fly them to the island. White said that even the fighters \"won't know where they're headed.\"\"We've been working on this since the world fell apart and every day, when we'd work on something, we'd wake up the next day and the world would change. This is definitely the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\"White's idea comes a few days after one of Australia's most popular professional sports, the National Rugby League (NRL), announced they were considering a proposal to house all players on a luxury island in an attempt to get live sport on TV as soon as possible.Codenamed Project Apollo, players from all 16 NRL teams would be quarantined at Tangalooma Island Resort on Moreton Island, off the coast of Queensland, to be ferried back and forth for games in empty stadiums to be broadcast worldwide.

And while Ferguson believes Nurmagomedov should have his title stripped for pulling out of the fight, White doesn't blame the Russian at all. \"It's not Khabib's fault, it's not anybody's fault,\" he told TMZ Sports. \"This is something you could never prepare for, plan for or even dream that any of this is possible.\"Nurmagomedov's absence left White searching for an opponent for Ferguson, and on Monday night, Justin Gaethje signed on to participate in the main event.

        "content": "(CNN)Australia's Great Barrier Reef has experienced its most widespread bleaching event on record, with the south of the reef bleaching extensively for the first time, a new survey has found. This marks the third mass bleaching event on the reef in just the last five years and scientists say that the rapid warming of the planet due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases are to blame.Aerial analysis conducted by Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, and others from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, found that coastal reefs along the entire length of the iconic reef -- a stretch of about 1,500 miles (2,300 kilometers) from the Torres Strait in the north, right down to the reef's southern boundary -- have been severely bleached. \"We are all in shock really at how quick this has happened,\" said Hughes. \"Three severe bleaching events in five years is not something we anticipated happening until the middle of the century.\"Climate change could kill all of Earth's coral reefs by 2100, scientists warnWarm ocean temperatures are the main driver of coral bleaching, which is when corals turn white as a stress response to water that is too warm. This happens because they are expelling the algae that grows inside them, which is their main energy source and gives them their color. Read MoreBleaching doesn't kill coral immediately. But if temperatures remain high, eventually the coral will die, destroying a natural habitat for many species of marine life.Hughes said he took about 11 flights over nine days in March criss-crossing the full length of the Great Barrier Reef, surveying 1,036 reefs from the air to measure the extent and severity of the coral bleaching.What he saw was unprecedented. \"For the first time, severe bleaching has struck all three regions of the Great Barrier Reef -- the northern, central and now large parts of the southern sectors,\" he said. Of the reefs surveyed this year about a quarter were severely affected, while a further 35% had modest levels of bleaching.The bleaching event this year is not only the largest, in terms of the area affected, but also second most severe on record, the scientists found, with the damage likely to be lasting and irreparable. In 2016, bleaching killed more than half of the shallow-water corals on the northern region of the Great Barrier Reef. A second mass bleaching in 2017 meant the coral could not recover. This year, the cumulative footprint of bleaching has expanded further south, affecting more fragile and heat-sensitive corals. Hughes said they won't know the full extend of the loss of corals until they go back to the same reefs conduct underwater surveys in October or November. Bleaching is when corals turn white as a stress response to warm water temperatures. Bleaching events getting more frequentCoral reefs are some of the most vibrant marine ecosystems on the planet -- between a quarter and one-third of all marine species rely on them at some point in their life cycle.And none is more vital than the Great Barrier Reef.Covering nearly 133,000 square miles, it is the world's largest coral reef and is home to more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 species of hard corals and dozens of other species.It's also a vital resource to Australia's economy, contributing more than $5.6 billion annually and supporting tens of thousands of jobs.As bleaching expands and becomes more frequent, corals are at greater risk of dying off -- and that will be devastating not only for the region's biodiversity, but for the thousands of people whose life and livelihood depend on the reefs.

(Credit: ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies)\nThe scientists' main concern this year is the southern region, which escaped the bleaching during 2016 and 2017 as water temperatures were close to normal, Hughes said. Because it has not been bleached before, this portion of the reef has more coral that is sensitive to the heat. Most susceptible to dying off are ecologically important species such as the staghorn, or branching, corals that are ideal habitats for an array of species of fish and other marine life. \"When we go back underwater in a few months time, we anticipate significant mortality or loss of those corals,\" Hughes said.He anticipates that as much as half of these \"red reefs\" that suffered the most severe bleaching this year to have died because that's what happened in the northern reefs in 2016.Another concern is the shrinking gap between one mass bleaching and the next. The first recorded bleaching event along the Great Barrier Reef occurred in 1998 -- then the hottest year on record. Four more severe bleaching events have occurred since, in 2002, 2016, 2017, and now in 2020. This year, February saw the highest monthly sea temperatures ever recorded on the reef since records from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology began in 1900. Many reefs experienced temperatures that were 3\u00b0C above the normal summer maximum.\"That's incredibly destructive. Those extreme temperatures can kill the coral very quickly,\" Hughes said. \"We really are on uncharted territory here in terms of rising temperatures.\"The bleaching event in 2020 was the most widespread on the Great Barrier Reef ever recorded. Fewer opportunities for recoveryPast bleaching events have typically occurred in years with a strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a climate phenomena that can increase the odds of a host of extreme weather events around the globe. But as summers get hotter year on year in Australia, scientists found that bleaching can occur even when El Nino is not active. That could have a huge impact on whether the reefs can recover. Hughes said it takes about a decade for the fastest growing corals to make a full recovery. As bleaching events become more frequent, there are fewer opportunities for the corals to rebound. \"Normal recovery rates for the reef are being impinged by the scale of the loss of the adult root stock -- that's the grown up corals that make the babies,\" Hughes said. Reefs are important because they protect shorelines and coastal regions from erosion and extreme weather events. They are also source of food security for millions of people around the world.According to a study by the United Nations on the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, coral reefs benefit about 850 million people worldwide, with at least 275 million depending directly on reefs for livelihoods and sustenance.Already in Australia, fish stocks on the Great Barrier Reef are declining because of loss of habitat, Hughes said. You take out the coral, the ecosystem collapses and marine life dies. This photo taken on March 2020 shows coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The mass bleaching conditions were also observed in late March by Coral Reef Watch, which uses remote sensing and modeling to predict and monitor for signs of bleaching.Dr. C. Mark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch, told CNN last month that because of the massive amounts of heat the world's oceans have already absorbed, the reef likely won't have the chance to recover before it bleaches again.\"If it takes decades for a reef to recover ... what chance do we have for reefs recovering when events are coming back this fast?\" he said.Though researchers around the world are exploring ways to revive reefs, Eakin says those efforts will not be enough if we don't address the root cause of their demise -- human-caused climate change.\"We have to address climate change if we want to have coral reefs in the future.\"CNN's Andrew Kann contributed to this report.",

He doesn't wear a mask or gloves. \"It might sound a bit strange, but in this historic moment, I consider this a privilege... my life is for the people -- to be with them in this crucial moment.\"A priest and relatives pray as a victim is buried at the cemetery on March 28.Spain has been hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic than almost any other country. Madrid is the epicenter of its outbreak, accounting for 40% of Spain's coronavirus deaths. With city morgues unable to handle the volume of bodies, two ice rinks are now being used as temporary morgues. Cemeteries say they're burying two or three times as many bodies as usual.Across the small parking lot, next to a shuttered flower-stand, F\u00e9lix Poveda paces back and forth in a smart black pea coat, dark tie and white surgical mask. He contracted the virus himself at a family lunch a few weeks ago. His brother and his mom got it, too \u2014 all three were eventually hospitalized. His 77-year-old mother died.The hilltop fortress town that cut itself off from the world -- and coronavirusLike so many others in Spain, Poveda had to say his goodbyes over the phone. He says his mother's doctor explained to him that she didn't qualify for a ventilator -- equipment that's been in desperately short supply in Madrid's overwhelmed hospitals.\"I don't know how to deal with this... I don't know how to feel,\" he told us. He understands the need for distance and brevity in burying the dead, but understanding doesn't make the reality any less harsh.\"I am alone here. My brother and sister they couldn't come. My wife is not coming. Grandsons and granddaughters are not coming. Just me. There's no way to think that the end... could be [like] this.\"Poveda plans to have a proper funeral for his mother when the crisis is over, he's just not sure when that will be.Cemeteries in Spain say they're burying two or three times as many people as usual.Moments later, a hearse pulls up to the crematorium. This one, he confirms, is carrying his mother's body. Like clockwork, Father Edduar emerges to lead the prayers. Poveda folds his hands and bows his head.A few minutes later, her casket is taken inside on a gurney. As he wanders back to his car, his pain and shock are all too clear. The tears rolling down his face are partly obscured by his mask. It's not the way he expected to say goodbye to his mother.",

        "content": "(CNN)As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across Europe and the United States, a global scramble for medical equipment such as respirator masks and gloves is underway. Several countries have accused the United States of trying to hijack their orders, but the details of who may have done what to whom are still murky.In France they are calling it the \"guerre des masques\" -- the war of the masks, and on Friday German officials also made allegations against the United States.  Andreas Geisel, a senior official in the state of Berlin, said that the US had committed an act of \"modern piracy,\" alleging that a consignment of 200,000 respirator masks destined for the Berlin police had been diverted to the US while in transit in Bangkok.Related storiesCan you use apps to track coronavirus?Asia may have been right about face masksHow the coronavirus could impact gender equalityUpdates: Coronavirus deaths top 60,000 globally \"This is not how you deal with transatlantic partners,\" Geisel said, adding that \"even in times of global crisis, no wild west methods should be used.\"Read MoreA German media report said the company involved in the Berlin order was US manufacturer 3M. But 3M told CNN Friday that the company \"has no evidence to suggest 3M products have been seized. 3M has no record of any order of respirators from China for the Berlin police.\"The Berlin police told CNN they could not confirm whether an order had been placed with 3M. CNN has reached out to the White House and US Department of Health and Human Services for comment.The US government's invocation of the Defense Production Act has made life difficult for some suppliers with foreign contracts. The 1950 law gives the government sweeping powers during emergencies to direct industrial production. President Donald Trump criticized 3M for seeking to export protective equipment, tweeting Thursday: \"We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. 'P Act' all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!\"Trump announces new face mask recommendations after heated internal debateOn Friday 3M responded: \"Ceasing all export of respirators produced in the United States would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same, as some have already done.\"A senior White House official denied the administration was blocking 3M from sending shipments of respirators to Latin America and Canada.As stockpiles dwindle and countries embark on what one French official called a \"global treasure hunt,\" governments are reluctant to allow protective and other equipment to leave their shores. Many governments say the prices being offered and demanded for personal protective equipment (PPE) are exorbitant.On Friday, Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya said an order for ventilators that had already been paid for had been impounded in Turkey.\"There is a shipment of ventilators that for now are not going to leave Turkey because the Turkish government understands that it is a priority for the treatment of its patients in Turkey,\" she said. \"[What] they do guarantee is that, within a reasonable period of time, within a few weeks, they will make that material available to Spain again,\" Gonz\u00e1lez Laya added. CNN has requested comment from the Turkish government.

        "content": "London (CNN)People in the UK are turning to mail-order coronavirus tests as the government scrambles to offer mass public testing and get a hold on the virus' spread across the country.  UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, recently returning to public life after testing positive for coronavirus, announced Thursday the UK would aim to test 100,000 Britons a day by the end of April. Critics of the government's stark U-turn on testing suggest it may have been spurred by about 8% of National Health Service (NHS) staff being off work because of Covid-19-related issues. Coronavirus sparks a 'war for masks' in desperate global scramble for protectionBut at the moment, these government-funded tests by hospitals are unavailable to most people and are still reserved for those with severe symptoms and some health care workers. In a tiny, airless office in Old Street in east London, the business Rightangled is offering a solution -- at a price. The DNA testing firm is here hurriedly repurposing its health testing kits to be mailed to customers for about \u00a3200 ($250) each. The coronavirus testing service sounds like a dream solution.The kits arrive in the mail, you follow the video to take a swab from your throat, and send the sample back in a biohazard bag. The results come back around three days later.Read MoreBut the price tag, unaffordable to many, is just one drawback.CEO Abdullah Sabyah said he had thousands of orders in just a week, and is offering half-price discounts for staff in the UK's free health care service, the NHS. But even at a reduced price of \u00a3100 ($122) the tests do not provide a broad solution to the UK's testing crisis. The UK's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had said in mid-March that public \"testing will be based on symptoms and severity\" as the broad spread of the disease meant \"it is no longer needed for us to identity every case.\" Yet Prime Minister Boris Johnson's insistence last week that testing is \"so, so important\" means the UK is racing to make testing as widespread as possible just at the time when it is expected to reach its peak of infections.

Starmer, 57 will replace Jeremy Corbyn, who announced he would step down after a bitter defeat at the last election that saw sweeping gains for the ruling Conservatives.Coronavirus means that no one's talking about Brexit any moreThe change in leadership comes as the country battles its own coronavirus crisis and amid calls to improve public services, such as the National Health Service currently under strain.Starmer is a former crown prosecutor who has promised to pursue policies aimed at improving social equality, including an increase to the top tax rate and a boost to social services, as well as take stronger action on climate change.In a video posted to his Twitter account, Starmer said he would work with the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to tackle the coronavirus crisis, while also pointing out \"mistakes or faltering government.\"Read More\"In times like this, we need good government. A government that saves lives and protects our country,\" he said.\"It's a huge responsibility. And whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right,\" he said.Starmer rose to prominence as a young activist lawyer before his career in politics. He more recently raised his public profile as Labour's shadow Brexit spokesperson. In the UK, the main opposition party has \"shadow\" ministers who hold political portfolios. UK vows to boost coronavirus testing after criticism, as officials release guidance on who to save firstStarmer won more than 56% of the party vote, beating fellow MPs Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey in one round. The new leader has pitched himself as a unity candidate amid continued divisions in the Labour Party. The Labour Party has been mired in criticism over anti-Semtic remarks by several MPs in the past. Corbyn was widely criticized for his lax response to the problem within the party.Starmer said in his video that the party needs to face up to the issue with honesty and apologized to Jewish communities.\"On behalf of the Labour Party, I am sorry.\"And I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us.\"",

But unlike Americans, Berry is weighing these options as an Olympic athlete. \"When people think of Olympians, they think of people who have a lot of money, like professional basketball players, or professional baseball players, and it's definitely not the case,\" Berry told CNN Sport.  \"The Olympics are considered amateur. We do not get paid for training or participating. The Olympic Games makes billions of dollars, and the athletes literally get paid nothing. I don't think a lot of people understand that, because they don't know Olympians. Read More\"They think we have this celebrity status but it's not true.

View this post on Instagram           Cheers to one of the happiest years of my life. This past year was the year of reconstruction and elevation; I was able to finally Be ME..... In regards to Track and Field: Season 2019 I gave myself two options: Either I was going to walk away from this sport forever or I was going to make a change (a decision in which I was extremely proud of).I fell back in love with my crazy event and I truly began to be a \" hammer thrower \".. I was able to learn an indescribable amount of skills ... I was able to learn from other perspectives.. able to hear amazing stories..and finally able to be FREE (in and out of the ring) I found my POWER and more importantly my PURPOSE ..2019 was about transitioning, understanding and actually moving forward. Recognizing the true reasons of my past failures and working to make them my biggest threats. No excuses In regards to life; I was able to take a stand. I STAND FOR Those who sometimes feel like they are lost, misunderstood, and unheard. Others, who are so emotionally withdrawn that they fail to even try. Poverty stricken neighborhoods..children with no education or guidance these are things I see nearly every day. Inequality..a word that can be clearly defined but easily ignored in the exact same instance. Gun violence, lack of equal opportunity and justice .. these are the issues I stand for. And I am happy I was able to voice that because it is a true issue. Finally: would like to thank my team (MR Matt and Mrs Gail; Youri, Heidi Johnson, Amber Campbell, ) for taking a risk on me and unselfishly uncoiling all of the emotional, physical , and mental damage I came with. They encouraged me,stuck by me, and didn't make it about ego. Instead they made everything about me. And they did it without needing any credit or recognition. Thank you to Coach Will and Coach Brek for being kind and helping me with my training. I am so happy they are in my corner. To my dearest friends, family, supporters, and current sponsors I appreciate and love you all. I AM STILL ELIGIBLE to compete in this years upcoming Olympic Games.. and I'm coming .. and I will continue to stand for what is right !!! #olympics Tokyo 2020 let's get it !!! A post shared by  Gwen Berry (@mzberrythrows_) on Jan 2, 2020 at 12:34pm PST A 2016 Olympian in hammer throw, Berry lost some of her sponsorships last year, after raising her fist in protest on the podium of the Pan American games.She received a 12-month probation from the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee for the act, which she says was meant to highlight social injustice in America. The IOC's decision to postpone the Olympics by a year, means the rest of her sponsorship dollars are now gone too. Unlike the global roster of Olympians who have had their Olympic sponsorships extended by companies like Visa, Berry is very much on her own. \"For me it was extremely devastating because they cut off all my revenue. Competing, going overseas, going to competitions, getting prize money, and then ultimately making the Olympic team help me, help my family, help my community,\" the 30-year-old explains.\"For a lot of Paralympians and Olympians, when you have this opportunity and it's taken from you -- everything gets cut.Mental health issues\"Most companies sponsor you or support you because of the Olympics. It's one of the biggest sporting events in the world. So I think for most people that's been the hardest thing is the financial support and the financial stability.\"It's just been really hard for people to get out there and train and even find the motivation to continue at this time.\"The financial burden is only one of the challenges facing hundreds of athletes who thrive in a meticulously disciplined lifestyle.\"The mental health situation for most athletes is really dire. For professional athletes, we're pretty intense,\" she outlines. \"We have a regimen and we want to stick to it. READ: The breast cancer survivor determined to make her fifth Olympic Games in 2021\"We focus on being excellent every single day, so when all of that stops it really feels like retirement -- like what do I do now? What do I do next\"If I can't practice on that or focus on this, what do I do? Our schedule is interrupted, our regimen is interrupted, our eating habits, our exercise habits, everything is terribly interrupted, so I feel like it can make a lot of people kind of go crazy and kind of feel just like 'What do I do?' \"I know that USA Track and Field has done a really good job emailing us and letting us know that if we do need mental help and we do need to call in, that we have that service provided to us.\"I don't want to say Olympians have it worse that everyone who is struggling, but emotionally, it could be worse, because we have sacrificed years.\"This has literally stopped everything for us. It stops everything relating to our goals, our dreams, our families, and we already get paid nothing anyway. So it's nothing on top of nothing on top of nothing, for this moment that we may not even get anymore.\"Berry competes at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.An uncertain futureBerry isn't sure yet whether this setback marks the end of her Olympic journey.  She has a 15-year-old son named Derrick, who lives with his father in her hometown of St. Louis. Since leaving for college in 2007, she has had to miss much of Derrick's life while chasing her Olympic dream. She is not sure she wants to miss any more of it.  \"My child plays a very big part in this. I have been away from him for a long time. I've always had to train outside of St. Louis and I only get to go home a few times a year to visit him. He is going to college soon, and I want to be a part of that. More a part of it than I am now,\" Berry said.\"I think the decision for 2021 will come down to my family. Before I moved out here to Texas to train two years ago, I went home to St. Louis and I consulted with my family, so hopefully I will get to go home pretty soon, I don't know the travel restrictions from Texas to Missouri, and I'll talk to my family again and see how they feel about everything and see how they feel about me being away and then I'll go from there.\" Berry of the United States competes in the Women's Hammer Throw final day two of 17th IAAF World Athletics Championships.There is also the race against the clock. The daily strain track and field athletes put on their bodies is immense.\"I feel like even though I do love the sport, I am getting older. My body changes everyday. Every practice, something else hurts.\"At this time I feel like it's just up in the air. I'll let my body decide what I should do, my family, and I'll keep trying my best to train and do what I can right now. It will come down to my body and the way it responds to training, and the time being away from my family. \"It as while working her way towards the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, that Berry got a job for year at Dick's Sporting Goods to ease financial strain. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosShe is considering doing the same thing now, but tells CNN that a lot of those places aren't hiring in Houston, where she has lived and trained the last two years.\"I really want to file for unemployment, because honestly this is affecting my income. Luckily, I do have some savings, I do have enough to help me and my family from afar, but honestly I was thinking about filing for unemployment because essentially I am unemployed.\"That's a reality facing thousands across the US.",

        "content": "We are publishing personal essays from CNN's global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Valentina Di Donato is a producer for CNN in Italy, living in Rome for more than six years.Rome (CNN)Rome has given me so much. I came here for a two-year stay from Montclair, New Jersey, for a master's degree. That was nearly seven years ago. I was bewitched by the Eternal City, and most of all by the man who is now my fianc\u00e9, Fabio.Rome is the backdrop to our story -- where we met and fell in love -- so naturally, our wedding had to take place here. Our reception was to be at the 17th century Villa Aurelia, a few minutes south of the Vatican and across the Tiber River from the Colosseum. It's a beautiful estate that even hosted Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, at a wedding for one of her friends last year.Valentina Di Donato met her fiance in Rome. Cocktail hour was to be in the lemon garden, with prosecco and Bellinis passed out to guests as they arrived through the wisteria-covered entrance. We had our menus created with all seasonal items for the month of May. Planning an intercontinental wedding has been the most exciting part of my life, not only for me but also for my future mother-in-law and my own mother, who met my father in Rome in the 1980s.

But on March 10, as I analyzed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's ordering of the lockdown to report on, two things struck me. As a journalist, I had spoken to enough medical experts to understand that the stringent policies would be the best way to contain the virus that has hit Italy so hard.Read MoreBut as a bride-to-be, I realized that I wouldn't have my wedding dress fitting that Friday -- the day when we had planned to finally choose the lace. I texted my dressmaker Cinzia Ferri to say I wouldn't see her and her Maltese dog, Emma, that week. And I began to fear that the wedding itself -- just two months away -- would have to be postponed.Cinzia Ferri fits Valentina Di Donato for her wedding dress.Italy has been the country hardest hit in Europe so far by the coronavirus. When it began to rip through the north and I was called to cover the news, Fabio and I were having a weekend in Florence. Since then, I've reported on the deadly pandemic daily from Venice to Florence to Rome, speaking to doctors on the front line, the virologists and the epidemiologists to get their take on new infections, when the curve would flatten, and who was most at risk.I know the facts. I know that Italy having the second oldest population in the world makes it vulnerable. I also know that having an autoimmune disease myself, type 1 diabetes, makes me more at risk. This is the most personal of all stories to cover.Valentina Di Donato wears a mask while on assignment to cover the outbreak of coronavirus in Venice. My fianc\u00e9 and I waited as long as we could to make a final decision about our wedding date, hoping things would get better, hoping that the numbers would change. But every day, as I followed the Civil Protection press conference at 6 p.m., we heard the numbers were increasing, the death toll rising.Now we are facing what love in the time of coronavirus means for us.Our family and friends around the world had booked and bought flights and hotel rooms months in advance. Now I was getting messages from New York City, from California, the UK and Brazil that followed the same script: How are you? And then, more anxiously, how are the wedding plans?One of my bridesmaids works in a hospital and was told she would not be paid for her time off if she traveled to Italy during the lockdown and that she would have to be quarantined for 14 days upon her return.Ferri crafted a mask from lace and backing for Di Donato to match her wedding dress.The logistics of getting 150 guests from multiple countries to the same place on the same day is a challenge in the best of times. To scrap those plans and do it all a second time is a bride's nightmare.But every day at 6, as I'm watching that news conference updating the tragedies, Rome gives me something beautiful to restore me as Italians go out to their terraces to sing. Everyone sings something different, but it's a moment of solidarity, it's a moment to remember the resilience of the human spirit, and the howls of my beloved Italians make me feel like we can get through this.Fabio and I made the decision to postpone our wedding to October. It's the time of year we both moved to Rome from our home towns before we even knew one another existed. October -- the month in which our lives separately began as adults. October -- the month in which we will come together as a married couple.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Edinburgh native James Morton was 24 years old when his employers realized he was trans after he applied for a pension scheme requiring him to provide a birth certificate. He told CNN that a data protection error outed him to colleagues, who began asking Morton about his private parts and \"made offensive jokes at my expense,\" he said.The traumatic time \"very much made me think that I do not want this document (his birth certificate) undermining my privacy,\" Morton said of his decision to change his gender marker in the eyes of British law.To do so, Morton applied to a tribunal, which issues a gender recognition certificate (GRC) that would in turn allow him to change his birth certificate. To be successful, an applicant needs to provide the panel proof of living in the \"acquired gender\" for at least two years and a detailed medical and psychiatric report, outlining a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and any relevant treatment or surgery. There is no requirement to undergo sex reassignment surgery to receive the GRC.  A man beat a transgender woman for using the correct bathroom -- the women's. Now he's guilty of a hate crimeHis petition was ultimately approved, but only after what he describes as a pedantic, burdensome process.In a bid to be in step with some European countries, Scotland's government wants to ease the current pathway, criticized as too expensive and intrusive. The simplified self-declaratory system would shed away the panel and the medical reports. And where it has been a requirement for applicants to prove having lived in accordance with one's gender identity for 24 months, the new system would require just three months. It  would also reduce the minimum age of recognition to 16, from 18.  Read MoreThe move has reinvigorated the quest for more rights for the structurally disenfranchised community, blighted by high rates of discrimination, harassment, suicide, and who report facing difficulty obtaining gender-affirming healthcare in the UK. A consultation began on a new draft law in December, which has the backing of the country's biggest women's groups and major players in the ruling Scottish National Party (SNP), including Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. \u200bBut that law, along with other legislation, has now been placed on hold while officials work to contain the coronavirus pandemic. In an April 1 letter to activists with the Scottish Trans Alliance, the Scottish government expressed its \"strong commitment to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and improve the current process for trans people.\"James Morton (far right), the manager of the Scottish Trans Alliance, says reform will create a more equitable society. Yet campaigners who spoke to CNN are wracked with apprehension after a UK-wide attempt at canvassing public opinion in 2018 manifested a toxic culture war. They say reform will create a more humane and equitable society, whereas critics have pitted one of the world's most maligned minorities against a historically oppressed group: trans women against cis-gender women -- that is, women whose gender identity aligns with the sex assigned to them at birth.Some opponents of the new draft law, who say that trans women are not women, believe trans women pose a threat in spaces that are for women. \"The Scottish government is creating a loophole for predators and pretenders to exploit,\" Fair Play for Women, a campaign group that opposes the inclusion of trans women in women's sports, wrote about Scotland's draft bill on its website in March. Bill banning gender reassignment treatments for transgender youth fails in South DakotaIt warned male prisoners in Scotland could change their gender marker by obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) and access women's prisons in England and Wales, adding that \"your son or daughter could apply for a GRC\" in their first week of university in Scotland and \"have a new birth certificate by the time they start the next semester in the new year.\"While the biggest opposition to transgender rights in the US is associated with the Christian right, a number of high profile journalists, radical feminists and academics are among the loudest dissenters to reform in Britain. And like the American legislators who debated so-called \"bathroom bills\" that restricted access to public accommodations for transgender people, British opponents argue that any new trans rights, such as the act's amendment, undermine existing protections for cisgender women and girls.Trans rights activists say these are alarmist and transphobic narratives that scuppered reform in Westminster, and they have arrived in Holyrood. Reform in Scotland \"now looks more uncertain,\" Morton said, adding that \"the really ferocious anti-trans stuff in England\" is having \"dangerous impacts\" on surrounding countries.The other culture war This was the last thing the government of former Prime Minister Theresa May expected to happen when it proposed in 2017 \"to streamline and de-medicalize\" the process of obtaining a GRC, helping those who wanted to change the gender markers on their birth certificates. By the time consultations began in 2018, prominent columnists were arguing the de-medicalization of the law could lead to \"male-bodied people\" changing their gender only to enter spaces for women, like prisons, bathrooms and refuges -- citing the case of Karen White, a transgender woman who committed assaults on fellow inmates after being transferred to a women's prison.Anti-trans pressure groups such as Transgender Trend branded the reforms a threat to girls, saying it was a \"safety issue\" and worried about the \"implications for parents, schools and professionals in its acceptance of the diagnosis of 'transgender children' as fact.\"The government of former Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to streamline the process of changing their gender marker.Mainstream news outlets published articles that echoed those fears. One journalist for The Times wrote that reforming the law would \"destroy women's competitions, allowing former-men with greater musculature and testosterone to dominate.\" The argument exposed splits among feminists, political parties, academics, and some in the LGBTQ community. Twitter turned into a battlefield. A small group of protesters blocked the start of London Pride in 2018, holding signs that read \"transgenderism erases lesbianism.\" The action, said Pride organizers, showed \"unacceptable\" levels of \"bigotry, ignorance and hate.\" The trans community felt the sting of Britain's broadsheets, which toted stories warning of the \"Trans ideologists,\" reminiscent of homophobic language used in the 80s. \"UK newspapers who had barely published anything about trans folk in a decade suddenly exploded into life,\" Christine Burns, a trans campaigner and author of \"Trans Britain: Our Journey from the Shadows,\" told CNN.Burns said outlets like the Times and the Sunday Times went from publishing \"six trans related pieces in 2016 to over 150 in 2017 and similarly each year since,\" adding that the copy \"barely gave any space to the voice of trans people, who were suddenly portrayed as dangerous, censorious, (and) anti-free speech.\"J.K. Rowling's 'transphobia' tweet row spotlights a fight between equality campaigners and radical feministsSplits emerged in the country's leading left-of-center newspaper, the Guardian, when it published an editorial saying trans rights were colliding with women's rights. Guardian US journalists wrote an angry rebuttal: \"The idea that all trans women should be denied civil rights because a trans woman might someday commit a crime is the essence of bigotry and goes against feminist values.\"Speakers who advocated against trans-inclusive legislation were disinvited to events, which British columnists branded a freedom of speech issue. \"People who claimed to be 'silenced' by a 'powerful trans lobby' were allowed free reign to spout their lies on the platforms given to them virtually across the board by the UK press,\" Burns said.  By the time Boris Johnson entered Downing Street in 2019, the reforms had been kicked into the long grass. \"All this pain had been created by announcing these policies that the government had no intention of following through,\" Burns said. Critics not appeasedFurther north, Scotland's government launched its own consultation on the issue in 2017. Compared to Westminster, there was less misunderstanding in Holyrood due to the closer collaboration of transgender activists, politicians and feminists, Morton said.A coalition of Scottish women's organizations -- including Engender, Scottish Women's Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland -- welcomed the law's reform saying that they \"do not regard trans equality and women's equality to be in competition or contradiction with each other.\"  They added that refuges had already been providing \"trans-inclusive services\" for the past six years, which \"has not given rise to any concerns or challenges.Campaigners like Morton say the Scottish media has been less divisive. \"The Times for example has a Scottish version, there is a large overlap with most of the stories but they tweak it for Scotland so some of the anti-trans stories would run in the English edition and not run in both,\" he observed. The Scottish government unveiled the new draft law last year after nearly three-quarters of respondents to the 2017 survey backed a new self-declaratory system. The proposed legislation retains safeguards like a statutory declaration in front of a judge  and \"criminal proceedings for lying or making false applications,\" Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Scottish cabinet secretary for social security and older people, writes in the consultation paper -- which ended on March 17.The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust runs the UK's only NHS Gender Identity Development Service.Yet critics are not appeased. LGB Alliance, a group formed in 2019 to oppose changes to the GRA and stop trans-inclusive teaching in schools,  says they have been buying full-page advertisements warning against reforms in Scottish dailies. Their latest, published in the Scotsman, claimed \"self-ID gives predators the green light.\"  In a public letter last year, more than a dozen Scottish National Party (SNP) politicians called on the government to not rush into reforms. \"Changing the definition of male and female is a matter of profound significance. It is not something we should rush,\" they wrote.Kate Harris, co-founder of the LGB Alliance, told CNN that the crux of her resistance is the distinction between sex and gender. Sex is a classification based on bodily characteristics, internal and external. Gender is the socially constructed roles and behaviors typically ascribed to men and women.One common shorthand for understanding what it means to be trans is that one's gender identity does not match the sex one was assigned at birth. But that is an anathema for people like Harris.\"There is no evidence in the world that gender identity exists,\" Harris told CNN. \"What has happened is a kind of global tsunami of this peculiar transgender ideology. The facts are very clear, men cannot become women by wishing it so,\" she said. She says the proposed law's minimum age of 16 years old is too young, speculating that teenaged lesbians who may be confused about their sexuality are being referred to GIDS, the specialised gender identity clinic for young people, and encouraged to transition. A transgender woman's brutal murder has shocked Puerto Rico and renewed a conversation about transphobiaAccording to the latest data available, GIDS did see a year-on-year increase in children of almost every age referred to its clinic from 2016 to 2017. Trans rights proponents say this is because awareness of the service is increasing, and stigma against using it is decreasing. GIDS did not respond to multiple CNN requests for comment.Jane Fae, a trans journalist who works with British charity Trans Media Watch, told CNN that the rise in referrals to GIDS corresponds  with an equal increase in the number of people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans during a time of more visibility and acceptance for the gay community. \"A useful thing I like to keep in mind when people say there's a huge social contagion driving kids towards medical transition is that 300 people under the age of 18 are newly prescribed puberty blockers each year in the UK and the UK population aged under 18 is 15 million,\" wrote trans campaigner Shon Faye on Twitter, citing data obtained by the BBC. Campaigners say access to pubertal suppression can be a matter of life and death for transgender teens. A study, published this year in the medical journal Pediatrics, found that the chances of suicide and mental health problems declined significantly for transgender youth who have access to puberty blockers.Scotland's government launched its own consultation on the issue in 2017.The issue is part of an upcoming High Court judicial review of Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which runs GIDS. The claimants are challenging the legality of giving puberty blockers and sex hormones to anyone under 18 years old experiencing  gender dysphoria.Nor is there quantitative data, say campaigners, on the speculated surge of predatory men in women's refuges  especially in countries that already have progressive self-declaratory systems, like Norway, Denmark, Malta, Colombia, Argentina and Ireland. And while \"it makes sense to have debates on issues related\" to trans people, like prison environments, the atmosphere is so toxic and transphobic that \"no trans person dares start that debate because we just know it will be taken down as evidence and used against [us],\" Fae said. The case of White, who assaulted female inmates, has been repeatedly deployed to stoke fear, when the issue there was \"the English prison system failed to follow their own policy to do the proper risk assessment they were meant to do,\" Morton added. There are more LGBTQ characters on television than ever beforeIn the a statement to CNN, the Ministry of Justice said that \"following the Karen White case, all prison governors were reminded in writing of the careful safeguards that are in place to protect all prisoners from the challenges posed by some transgender prisoners, including consideration of risks relating to anatomy or previous offending history, and any risks to vulnerable women.\" \"Violence against women and sexual offending is scary and real,\" Morton said, \"so it can feel overwhelming and frustrating trying to change the way men behave towards women and I think there is an element of 'how can we control trans people' because that seems more controllable.\" The inflamed rhetoric is doing little to focus public discourse on what activists say are the real issues -- like more resourcing for refuge services, a spike in rates of women being killed by a former partner, soaring number of transgender hate crimes recorded by the police, and the discrimination of women and trans people by cisgender men, say campaigners.\"Marginalized groups and trans folk need to work together -- fighting among ourselves only lets the real abusers off the hook,\" said Morton.",

Yes, they get paid a lot of money, but I'm sure they want to help. \"They're consistently very good in the communities and I'm sure over the coming days that footballers will stand up and be counted, either taking pay cuts or making donations to charities or staff workers that are non-playing. \"So, I'm confident that will happen, but it takes time and everyone here is jumping on the bandwagon. Politicians do tend to do that occasionally, especially at football's expense -- so, if I'm wrong, then I'll be as critical as everybody else.\"In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said it planned to start a consultation exercise with top-flight players.\"In the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019/20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.\"The League will be in regular contact with the PFA, and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow [April 4] between the League, players and club representatives.\"Cristiano Ronaldo of Juventus reacts during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg match between Olympique Lyon and Juventus at Parc Olympique on February 26, 2020 in Lyon, France.READ: Footballers working from homeThis week, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players took a 70% wage cut to ensure that all non-playing members of staff continue to get paid a full salary during the pandemic, while Juventus' first-team squad has given up 100% of its wages for four months to save the club $100 million.\"I think one or two of our clubs have kind of thrown their players under a PR bus in many ways by announcing that they're cutting staff salaries and putting them on furlough, but not affecting the players' wages,\" said Lineker.\"That was not announced by the players, but it was announced by the clubs, so let's wait and see. Let's be a little bit patient here. Let's not all jump on the judgment high horse and just wait and see how it pans out over the next week or so. \"I'm confident and I would be very disappointed if the players don't do the right thing, but I'm sure they will.\"Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona looks on during the Liga match between FC Barcelona and Real Sociedad at Camp Nou on March 07, 2020 in Barcelona, Spain.READ: 'Inconceivable' for Premier League to return anytime soon, says Gary Neville'Detrimental to wider society'The PFA called an urgent meeting on March 27 with the Premier League and the EFL to ensure the salaries of footballers in the third and fourth tiers -- whose wages, it says, are \"closer to the national average\" -- were protected for April.\"Many of these players will have contracts ending in June,\" the PFA said in a statement on Thursday. \"These are often people with young families, for whom their immediate financial position is uncertain.\"Gary Lineker poses for a picture with the Premier League Trophy prior to the pre-season friendly between Oxford City and Leicester City at Kassam Stadium on July 19, 2016 in Oxford, England.While TV money has funded handsome salaries for many players, it's arguably also benefited the super-rich owners of the 20 Premier League clubs, whose combined wealth totals close to $85 billion, according to Forbes.Which is why the the PFA says that while it is aware of the public's belief that players should give up their salaries to pay the wages of non-playing members of staff, it reiterated its stance that if clubs can afford to pay both, then they should continue to do so.\"The players we have spoken to recognize that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly,\" it said. \"Any use of the government's support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. \"In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club's shareholders.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)A man who worked for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for 20 years was \"neglected\" after he contracted Covid-19 and died, alleges his daughter Tamira Harvey.Although Thomas Harvey never got a test for Covid-19 before he died, an NHS Trust confirmed to CNN that he had picked up the virus. According to his daughter, the 57-year-old health care assistant was let down by both the hospital where he helped care for recovering stroke patients, and by emergency responders.Tamira alleges that London's Goodmayes Hospital failed to provide necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) to her father. And just a few days before Harvey's death, emergency services \"refused\" to come to take him to hospital, Tamira says, despite family concerns that he wasn't \"breathing properly.\"Related Stories UK vows to boost coronavirus testing after criticismA healthy 39-year-old DJ died of coronavirusAn ER doctor dies in his husband's armsOpinion: Covid-19 may inspire a new generation of doctorsThe NHS trust responsible for the hospital where Thomas worked told CNN on Wednesday that there were no symptomatic patients when Thomas Harvey went off work sick, and that it has been following national PPE guidance. CNN reached out to NHS England, which leads the public health service in England and oversees emergency services, via phone and email and has yet to receive a response.  The London Ambulance Service (LAS) did not respond directly to Tamira's claims that they \"refused\" to take Thomas Harvey to the hospital. They did however, confirm that they were \"seeing unprecedented demand\" for both their 999 and 111 services at this time, with more than 8,000 calls coming into their 999 control rooms each day. Additionally, when they were called on the day of Harvey's death, medics arrived in \"six minutes,\" the LAS said.Read MoreBut Tamira remains adamant that the blame for her father's death should ultimately lie in the hands of the UK government. She believes that Harvey picked up the virus at work due to a lack of PPE. Before he died, he told Tamira that the protective equipment supplied wasn't substantial. \"He told me on the ward they only had flimsy aprons and gloves,\" she said. She says she is now concerned for the welfare of other medical professionals and patients at the Hospital. The novel coronavirus pandemic is now hitting the UK hard, with more than 34,000 recorded cases and the country's death toll rising to more than 2,900, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.The UK government is also under growing pressure after it admitted on Wednesday that fewer than 3,000 frontline health care workers, out of around 500,000, had been tested. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government planned to \"massively\" increase testing to try and solve the \"coronavirus puzzle\" on Wednesday night.'He always wanted to put others before himself'When Harvey collapsed in the bathroom at this home in Hackney, London on March 29, family members had to use an ax to break down the door to reach him. Police and paramedics soon arrived to assist but the 57-year-old went into cardiac arrest and died in his living room.  Tamira described the whole experience as \"devastating\" but she does not fault the effort of the police and the paramedics in their attempts to save her father's life on March 29. She is, however, critical of the fact that he wasn't tested for the virus, and angry that more was not done to prevent his death.\"I think he was neglected from the start. It's just a tragedy... It's a mixture of emotions. Loads of questions of why and how this happened. The fact he wasn't tested, none of us were tested. My mother is overwhelmed as they have been together for so long and she has lost her best friend,\" she told CNN.Thomas Harvey is pictured with his son Thomas Jr. and his wife, Marcia.Harvey initially thought he had the flu. Then, in mid-March, his condition rapidly deteriorated, said Tamira. His breathing was heavy, he lost his appetite and gradually he resorted to hand actions to tell his family to stay clear -- because he was finding it so difficult to speak.\"His breathing woke me up from my sleep because it was really loud... He was breathing like a car that was on its last legs,\" she said.A few days before his death, the father-of-seven confined himself to the living room and isolated himself away from his family -- in an effort to stop them catching the virus. \"He always wanted to look after people. He always wanted to put others before himself,\" Tamira said in an emotional interview. In the early hours of March 29, Tamira's brother heard Harvey leave the living room and move towards the toilet. When his wife went to check in on him, he had collapsed. The way Harvey had fallen had blocked the door and meant the family couldn't immediately reach him to help, Tamira said.\"I told my mum to get an ax we had for like chopping meat and she chopped down the door. We were taking off the top half of it. We made a little hole and my brother just started punching the door and breaking the door with his bare hands,\" she said.\"The police arrived and took down the rest of the door. My brother and police moved him into the living room. Then he went into cardiac arrest. They tried to resuscitate him a few times. They tried really hard ... they did their best. They were there for a good hour trying to bring him back.\"On Sunday I lost my dad to COVID- 19, he was an amazing husband, father, grandfather, brother & friend. As a family we want to share our story so other NHS staff & the public understand the severity of the disease & how he was neglected as dedicated NHS staff member of 20 years. pic.twitter.com/OtewnZziAj\u2014 #JusticeforThomas (@tamiraharvey) March 31, 2020\n\nTamira criticized what she described as emergency responders' failure to do more to help her father earlier. In total, she says the family called 999 on three occasions. On March 22, paramedics did make the trip to come and treat Harvey.A few days before his death, on March 26, the family called for a second time to try and get Harvey into a hospital to access more specialized care, but were instead directed online. \"He was neglected on the second account we called paramedics -- they told us to go online. How is that going to help someone who is not breathing?\" said Tamira.The third was the day of his death. \"Sadly, despite the best efforts of our staff, the patient died at the scene. We would like to express our sympathy to the family at this very difficult time,\" a spokesperson for the London Ambulance Service (LAS) said.

        "content": "(CNN)A new video game tournament is offering NBA stars a chance for a competitive outlet, as players who would normally be preparing for the postseason are instead practicing social distancing. The players-only video game tournament starts Friday and will be aired on ESPN as hoop stars face off against each other in the popular basketball franchise NBA 2K. It's a much needed distraction for players, who have found themselves with time on their hands since the NBA suspended games March 11 because of COVID-19.The tournament is also intended to help people through the crisis: both with its entertainment value and the $100,000 the winner gets to donate to a charity connected to coronavirus relief efforts. Kevin Durant #7 of the Brooklyn Nets looks on against the Milwaukee Bucks during their game at Barclays Center on January 18, 2020 in New York City. READ: Enes Kanter has more than just losing the NBA season on his mindRead MoreFormer MVP Kevin Durant is the top overall seed, and his Twitter feed is littered with 2K-related thoughts.The two-time NBA champ, often remembered for a trophy acceptance speech in which he called his mother the real MVP,  had this to say in 2014 : \"Thank you God for my wonderful ma and 2k.\"However, Durant might need to brush up on his skills prior to the tournament. Just last month, the Brookly Nets superstar tweeted: \"The transition defense on 2k is the most frustrating thing in my life at this moment.\" Spencer Dinwiddie #8 of of the Brooklyn Nets in action against Rajon Rondo #9 of the Los Angeles Lakers during a preseason game as part of 2019 NBA Global Games China at Mercedes-Benz Arena on October 10, 2019 in Shanghai, China. READ: Leading NBA players say they've tested positive for coronavirusWith play suspended, hoopers have been taken away from their job and one of their favorite pastimes. The respite has caused a longing for the game, which manifests itself in many different ways.For the Nets' Spencer Dinwiddie, it meant watching old highlights of his best games. On Twitter, he asked his co-workers: \"Any NBA players going to YouTube to watch their own highlights due to withdrawals?\"Donovan Mitchell, another tournament partcipant and one of the first players diagnosed with coronavirus, replied to the tweet, saying he had started with his rookie year highlights and worked his way to this season.Donovan Mitchell #45 of the Utah Jazz.READ: NBA star Gobert faces backlashBut now, Mitchell and other 15 players have another outlet, video games, for the basketball-sized hole in their lives.Mitchell, for one, has been practicing. Earlier in the week, he scored a virtual victory against Ronnie Singh, aka Ronnie 2K, the marketing director and public face of the franchise. With NBA teams closing their practice facilities in order to stop the spread of the virus, 2K is the closest thing to the NBA the players are going to get.Miami Heat forward Hassan Whiteside is certainly looking for some tougher competition, as he's spent his quarantine blocking his young son from scoring on a mini-hoop. With the tournament looming, he'll have a chance to pick on someone his own size -- albeit on the virtual hardwood. For many, the experience of playing a video game with your likeness in it is a strange feature.Former Slam Dunk contest champion Zach LaVine, the 7th seed in the upcoming tournament, had this realization during his rookie year, tweeting: \"Bout to play 2k15. Crazy to really think I'm in it.\" Now, until play resumes, NBA players will be forced to live out their stardom not on the court, but in the realm of the video game.",

        "content": "Cordoba, Spain (CNN)The fortress town of Zahara de la Sierra in southern Spain is used to fending off enemies. The Moors and Christians fought over it in medieval times, and it was sacked by the French in 1812. Now its formidable position high above the Andalusian countryside has suddenly become an invaluable asset once more. On March 14, Zahara cut itself off from the outside world as a dangerous coronavirus spread its tentacles across Spain. The mayor, 40-year-old Santiago Galv\u00e1n, decided to block all but one of the town's five entrances. Galv\u00e1n acted the day that Spain's \"state of alarm\" came into force.Since then, the country has recorded more than 100,000 cases and 10,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. On March 14, Zahara de la Sierra cut itself off from the world as the coronavirus spread through Spain.In Zahara, however, there has not been a single recorded case of Covid-19 among its 1,400 inhabitants. \"It has been more than two weeks, and I think that's a good sign,\" Galv\u00e1n told CNN.The mayor's drastic steps have the full support of the townspeople, and especially the elderly. Nearly a quarter of Zahara's inhabitants are older than 65; there are more than 30 residents in an old people's home. Towns and villages nearby have seen infections and several coronavirus fatalities. Read MoreZahara's white houses and narrow streets cling to the steep hillside, looking up at medieval fortifications and down towards a reservoir and rolling olive groves. An hour from Seville by car, it's a popular destination for visitors from around the world. Galv\u00e1n says that in the first few days, they had to turn away French and German tourists who were unaware of the local government's measures.Four of the town's entrances were blocked, leaving just one, which has a manned checkpoint where vehicles are sprayed with a mix of bleach and water.The checkpoint on the one access road is run by a single police officer. Two men dressed in the protective clothing normally used for spraying the olive groves wash vehicles that come through with a mix of bleach and water. The vehicles even have to pass through a sort of sheep-dip to ensure their tires are disinfected.\"There is no car that comes through the checkpoint that's not disinfected,\" says Galv\u00e1n.The mayor admits that such measures could be anywhere from 20% to 80% effective, but says it's all about reassurance. \"We have managed to give tranquility to our neighbors,\" he says. \"They know no one 'unknown' can come in.\"Related storiesSpain passes 10,000 deathsWhy many people aren't social distancingTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the coronavirusSimilar sanitation precautions have been introduced inside Zahara. \"Every Monday and Thursday at 5:30 p.m. a group of around 10 people are out in the streets to disinfect the town, all the streets, plazas and outside homes,\" Galv\u00e1n says.One of them is local farmer Antonio Atienza, whose tractor trundles through the town spraying the streets.A local business is paying two women to make grocery and medical deliveries to reduce the number of people out on the streets, especially those most vulnerable to contracting the virus. They work about 11 hours a day and their order book is growing.One of them, 48-year-old Auxi Rascon, says the response from other citizens has been wonderful.A group of volunteers and town workers clean and disinfect the streets.\"They are very happy, because they don't need to go out, they feel protected and feel confident,\" she says. Rascon is also proud of the town's swift response. \"They took the right measures at the right moment, and now we are seeing the results,\" she told CNN by phone.Besides organizing the delivery service, the Zaharilla women's association looks after the elderly who can't cook for themselves (by leaving food at their front doors) and arranges basic repairs for them. A Facebook page created for older residents has started a drive to get their old photographs published online. Luisa Ruiz Luna, who started the initiative, says it's taken off, and is \"a nice way for Zaharenos who live abroad to interact with us, apart from exercising the memory.\" The town has also outfitted two cars with music and lights, \"so kids can come to their balconies and enjoy them,\" Galv\u00e1n says.Zahara de la Sierra's Mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n acted on the same day that Spain's \"state of alarm\" came into force.The economic lifeblood of hundreds of small Spanish towns like Zahara is provided by family-run businesses and \"autonomos\" -- the self-employed. So the town council has dipped into its contingency fund to cover the costs of electricity, water and taxes for local businesses during the national state of emergency. Bars and restaurants reliant on tourism -- there are 19 such establishments in Zahara -- would otherwise go to the wall. For Galv\u00e1n, it's more than financial aid. It's about preserving Zahara as a community. His father was born in the town. But the mayor knows that in the end, Zahara will need help from Madrid or the regional government if the national confinement continues.\"We will need a sort of financial lung if this goes on,\" Galv\u00e1n told CNN.Like millions of Spaniards, he scrutinizes the Ministry of Health's daily Covid-19 bulletins, hoping that like the sieges of Zahara in centuries past, this too shall pass.",

        "content": "(CNN)As the coronavirus pandemic spreads across Europe and the United States, a global scramble for protective equipment such as masks and gloves is underway. In France they are calling it the \"guerre des masques\" -- the war of the masks.Some French officials have even alleged that their consignments from China have been hijacked by Americans.The presidents of two regions in France have claimed that American customers -- without specifying who -- have tried to pay Chinese suppliers three or four times the agreed price to get critical supplies diverted.Related storiesWhy humans are terrible at being apartUS lab faces coronavirus testing backlogWomen use code words to escape domestic abuseLive updates: Cases approach 1 million globallyRenaud Muselier, president of the Sud region, alleged in several interviews that an order from one French region had been bought by the Americans for cash -- and the plane that was due to fly to France had instead gone to the US.Muselier was asked by CNN affiliate BFM-TV whether masks had been taken by Americans at Chinese airports. He replied: \"Exactly,\" before adding, \"There is a foreign country that paid three times the price of the cargo on the tarmac. So the masks are gone and the region that ordered them has been destitute.\"Read MoreMuselier later tweeted that masks for his own region were on their way and had \"not been bought by a foreign power.\" Contacted by CNN, Muselier referred further questions to the French Foreign Ministry, which said Thursday it was looking into the reports.Jean Rottner, the president of another French region -- Grand Est -- echoed Muselier's remarks, telling French radio network RTL that it was a daily battle to secure orders. \"It's true,\" he claimed, \"that on the tarmac the Americans arrive, take out cash and pay three or four times more for the orders we have made, so it's necessary to fight.\"Here's what health experts say about face masksRottner tweeted that 2 million masks had arrived on April 1 from Shanghai, posting video of the cargo being shipped on his Twitter account. Two more shipments are due to arrive at the weekend, he said.  Contacted by CNN, Rottner's office would not elaborate on his claims, but a third regional president, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse of \u00cele-de-France, said the quest for masks was a global treasure hunt. \"We had made an order but were unable to complete it because others were ready to pay three times the market price,\" Pecresse told radio network Franceinfo. She did not identify the \"others.\"It's unclear which US entity -- federal, state or commercial -- might have tried to secure orders destined for France. CNN reached out to the US Department of Health and Social Services Thursday but has not heard back. The US Embassy in France, which only speaks for the federal government, said the US \"has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France.\"In an interview with French television Thursday, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said securing deliveries was \"not always easy.\" The problem, he said, was \"not logistical difficulties related to missing aircraft but difficulties sometimes in accessing the products from orders that are not always delivered. This is for a variety of reasons, including the huge demand that comes to China from the United States, from Europe, and indeed from the whole world.\"Workers pack newly produced masks at a plant in Beijing, China last month.CNN has submitted several questions to the Prime Minister's office about problems with deliveries.On Friday, the German Health Minister Jens Spahn responded to media reports that a PPE consignment bought by the state of Berlin had been diverted to meet an American order. \"Reports of this kind -- I don't know if it is true in this specific case -- but it is not the only report of this kind,\" Spahn said. \"This is not a good development in general, but at the same time it is due to a very strong demand that is there.''Spanish and French officials say that logistical bottlenecks in China have compounded the problem of shipping personal protective equipment (PPE.) Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa told a parliamentary committee in Madrid last week that everyone was trying to buy from China -- but could not confirm when Spanish orders would be met \"because the market is crazy and the logistics are hard.\"One French region, Centre Val de Loire, told CNN its order had been diverted to Zhengzhou airport due to congestion at Shanghai airport.

        "content": "(CNN)Jose Mourinho is pedaling on an exercise bike to the familiar beat of \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" The Tottenham manager, far from engrossed in the workout, nonchalantly taps each thigh with the palm of his hands as his legs move up and down like a sewing machine needle. It is an unusual technique. But these are unusual times. At this time of year Mourinho would usually be plotting how to defeat an opponent or, depending on your point of view, figuring out where to park the bus. (His team was supposed to playing Sheffield United in the English Premier League on April 4.) But with most of the world in lockdown, there are no tactics to determine, no battles to prepare for. Fortunately, for fans of the London club at least, Mourinho's players appeared to be breaking sweat during Tottenham's midweek videolink training session; split screens showed them running on the spot at their homes while a trainer barked from miles away. The future is now. \ud83c\udfe1 The virtual training sessions continue \ud83d\udcaa#SpursAtHome \u26aa\ufe0f #COYS pic.twitter.com/ppU3jkyf7w\u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (at \ud83c\udfe1) (@SpursOfficial) April 1, 2020\n\nAs a pandemic has swept around the world, video clips of famous footballers training at home have become widespread on social media. The lives of those often regarded as superhuman have also been brought to a standstill by a virus that does not discriminate. Like the rest of us, their futures too are uncertain.No one can say with certainty when normality will return. No one knows when thousands will again gather in stadiums and joyously cheer a goal, a kick or spectacular save. In the meantime, players must stay at home and work from home.Read MoreBut the backyard is no substitute for the intoxicating hit to the senses that comes with entertaining thousands, so how will footballers manage to keep in shape, both mentally and physically? After all, they are the people who never seem to be alone; training with teammates, performing magical feats around the world, their almost every move analyzed and recorded. Brighton manager Graham Potter has admitted this week \"one or two\" of his players were not sleeping well as they worry about unprecedented events.Dr. Craig Duncan, a human performance strategist currently supporting the Professional Footballers of Australia (PFA), tells CNN Sport:  \"The postponement of competitions, the cancellation of training and, in many instances, the isolation of players, this could come at a psychological cost.\"Football players have a strict daily, weekly and season routine.  What time to sleep, eat and train is all determined by this schedule so at this stage there are obvious changes. The daily connection in a team environment is also vital, as in any workplace.\"New England Patriots fly 1.2 million protective masks from China after 'challenging' operationMajor League Soccer's suspension has been extended to May, the start of the National Women's Soccer League has been delayed, leagues in South America have been halted, while the majority of football in Europe has been put on hold as governments attempt to curtail the spreading virus. The postponement of Euro 2020, Europe's quadrennial championship, until next year has opened up the summer months to complete the leagues in Europe should they run beyond their scheduled end dates, which seems increasingly likely. But a number of questions remain unanswered. Will seasons restart in April, May, June or July? What if the leagues can't be resumed? What will be the financial implications? And, should the season bleed into the summer months, what will happen to players whose contracts were set to end in June? Dr. Duncan has written training programs for players in complete lockdown and is monitoring them through an app which, he says, helps identify if there are any \"significant physiological or psychological issues.\" \"This is a very difficult situation,\" he adds. \"The only thing we can do is focus on what we can control and everything else will play out in some shape or form that at present is unknown.\"Liverpool needed three more wins to win the English Premier League before English football was suspended. Focusing on returning to the pitch is not how best to deal with a crisis which has no end in sight. It will only add to any anxiety, Dr. Peter Olusoga, senior lecturer in psychology at Sheffield Hallam University, tells CNN Sport. \"There's a natural tendency to focus on the future, on what's coming up, and when something this unprecedented happens that just ramps up even more,\" he says. \"There will be a lot of thoughts about it not being what they're used to. Am I going to be able to train as well? Am I going to be able to stay sharp and motivated? They're all legitimate concerns, but again it's thinking about the future instead of what's happening.\"In sport you have to have goals, things that you want to achieve, but really what you want to do is stay focused on the present moment. If you focus too much on the outcomes you're not attending what's important right now -- the training session that you're doing, the small things you can do to make improvements.\"Shifting the mindset, treating the current situation as another challenge to overcome rather than a disaster is important, says Dr. Olusoga. Seeing this crisis as an opportunity to strengthen weaknesses will also help.  \"They've already got those skills. It's almost like getting injured. It's a case of using some of those strengths and skills in a different way,\" he says.Before the novel coronavirus brought society to a stop, some players were on the verge of winning championships, some were hoping to earn new contracts, some were in a relegation dogfight. Some of these footballers are multimillionaires of world renown; others live modestly and aspire to greatness. Not everyone is the same.

A post shared by  Mohamed Salah (@mosalah) on Mar 26, 2020 at 4:51am PDT\nThis week a video of some Watford players remotely participating in a 30-minute spin class conducted by goalkeeper Ben Foster was shared on social media. These highly paid English Premier League players appeared to be training in well-equipped gyms in their palatial homes. \"The higher level you play the more resources you have,\" says Dr. Duncan. \"However, this process can be managed on any budget and often players in lower divisions have built up strong resilience and are used to managing with less support.\"Replicating the intensity of a match or a training ground session will be difficult, no matter what the resources on offer. But training at home is not pointless. \"I have managed numerous players during isolation and it is possible to keep a sound fitness level. Of course, it is better to be in a team situation but this present challenge can be won,\" adds Dr. Duncan. William Rose is a fitness coach at AFC Wimbledon, a London-based club in the third tier of the English football league.Before the United Kingdom was put into lockdown, he posted on Twitter a home fitness program which he had devised for the 122 players in the club's academy and, to his surprise, his tweet was shared around the world, an indication perhaps that at the moment there are plenty of athletes, be they amateur or professionals, in need of guidance. After today's news, Lockdown is pretty much inevitable, and most probably, round the corner.I've devised a home program for the squads in wake of the upcoming gym closures.Feel free to use any drills or exercises, and share them around if it helps.Enjoy \ud83d\ude0a pic.twitter.com/vtRhDQcKni\u2014 William Rose (@WilliamNRose) March 16, 2020\n\nRose is attempting to make sure young players remain mentally and physically fit but, he admits, there are difficulties. While some players live in leafy Wimbledon, others are in central London apartment blocks. Space is an issue for young players trying to not only develop physically but technically too. \"To be told you have to stay in for 14 days when you're an athlete who is running 30 kilometers a week, it's suddenly all quite daunting,\" Rose tells CNN Sport. \"It's managing them from a physical point of view to get ready to play again but also keep them mentally stimulated to make sure they're not going stir crazy.\"We can't expect them all to have a 50x50-yard garden. It has got to be specific to them so we have to mix up the drills and make sure each session is capable of adaptation. Italian soccer team delivers care packages to its elderly fans during coronavirus lockdown\"They're used to doing hard, varied sessions, short and sharp, plus more extended runs, and you can't do that in the space they'll be working in so it's getting them to replicate aspects of what they do on a pitch but on runs down the park. But you can never truly replicate that so you can never truly replicate match fitness.\"You look at the top tier teams, they will have players who have gyms in their house or a vast garden space where they can do the technical and physical programs. \"A lot of the bigger clubs have the facilities to lend the equipment to players during this time off but lower down the leagues you don't get those resources so you can't just dish out a program that may not be attainable for them.\" Twice a week Rose and his team will be holding interactive workshops. The first class focused on nutrition, the next psychology.Footballers are accustomed to being provided for. Academy players at AFC Wimbledon will typically eat breakfast and lunch at the training ground, says Rose.Not only are players having to learn to train by themselves, but they are having to think about nutrition and, in some cases, learn to cook. For players from poorer backgrounds or children of key workers, it is another obstacle to overcome during an already testing period. \"We're making sure everyone's checking in,\" says Rose. \"No one has ever been so grateful for technology. We just can't live in this time without it.\"Like everyone else, footballers are learning to adapt to a new way of living.  But with the numbers of deaths rising around the world, there must also be perspective. As Rose says: \"People love football and it means a lot to people but, at the same time, there are a lot of things that are more important in these times.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Spain passed another grim milestone as it grappled to contain its coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, reporting that more than 10,000 have now died in the country as a result of the virus.The Health Ministry said it recorded 950 new deaths in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day increase the country has seen so far. Its total death tally is now 10,003, meaning it joins Italy as the only countries to report a five-figure death toll.But there was cause for muted optimism in the country, whose devastating outbreak is slowing. As death figures rise, the rate of new infections in Spain has fallen to its lowest rate since the start of the crisis. An increase of 3,056 cases was reported in the past day, just a 4.3% jump and a notable improvement on the dire situation in the country during mid-March.Officials said the data shows that Spain's curve of cases is coming under control, and that the drastic emergency measures put in place to lock down the country are working. Read MoreCoronavirus live updates: Cases top 941,000 globally\"The data shows us that the curve has stabilized,\" Health Minister Salvador Illa said in the government's Thursday press conference. \"That we have achieved the primary objective of reaching the peak of the curve and that now we are starting the phase of deceleration.\"Deaths lag behind new infections as a measure of the speed of a country's outbreak. And even the stark 10.5% rise in fatalities Spain reported Thursday is similar to Wednesday's increase, and smaller in percentage terms than any recorded in the past two weeks. There was also a smaller increase in new patients admitted into intensive care units, with 220 admissions in the past day.  Spain's government has come under criticism from opposition parties, some health workers and unions for reported shortages of ICU facilities, lack of sufficient personal protective gear and overstretched health workers.A second makeshift morgue opened earlier this week in the capital Madrid, which has already converted a conference center into an emergency hospital and an ice rink into another morgue.And Illa warned that the country's health service remains under strain, saying: \"Even observing a decrease in the number of admissions, the long stays in these units produce an effect of accumulation of patients because of which there still remains difficult weeks for our health system.\"But officials have indicated that Spain's harsh lockdown measures are having the desired effect.Funeral cars and vans wait outside an ice rink, temporarily converted into a morgue to house hundreds of bodies, in Madrid.Health official Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra said on Wednesday that the lower case numbers help \"evaluate the measures we've been taking very positively,\" and that in many communities around the country the government has seen pressure on intensive care units ease.The total number of current or active cases in Spain stood at 73,492 on Thursday, the government said. In total, it has an accumulated number of 110,238 recorded cases since the start of the epidemic.Related coverageWomen using code words to escape domestic violence during lockdownOutrage in Japan as PM offers cloth masks but refuses to declare emergencyHumans are terrible at being apart.

Its streets have laid empty for weeks as residents have been told to stay home.Meanwhile, Spaniards continue to adjust to the devastating economic impact of the pandemic.The nation registered an increase in unemployment of 302,265 people in March compared to the previous month, according to Spanish Labor Ministry data released Thursday.This increase represents the largest monthly rise since records began, Labor Minister Yolanda Diaz said at a press conference in Madrid on Thursday. She called the increase in unemployment \"absolutely exceptional\" and \"historic.\"The worst-affected sector was services and tourism, with over 200,000 jobless claims, Diaz noted at the press conference. Spain's total unemployment is now 3,548,312 following a 9.3% increase in March.CNN's Max Ramsay, Ingrid Formanek, Tim Lister and Al Goodman contributed reporting",

Throughout this season, the Boston Celtics backup center has played with an infectious smile that belied the intense pressures of his personal life.Follow @cnnsport\n\nOne of the NBA's most popular players has been facing a range of tumultuous challenges off the court, including death threats and the criminal trial of his father back home in Turkey.\"Basketball is my escape,\" Kanter recently told CNN in the Celtics' locker room after an overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers. \"As soon as I'm on the court, it's my escape. I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to focus on my teammates, basketball and winning. \"But as soon as I step off the court, the same conversation starts: How can I help those people out there?\" he added, referring to thousands of Turks who have been held accountable by their government for alleged crimes against the state.

In a recent statement sent to CNN  the Turkish Embassy in London said that his \"judicial process is ongoing\" and that he \"needs to return to Turkey and face justice.\"Kanter has denied all allegations of wrongdoing and has said he fears backlash to public criticisms he has made of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The 27-year-old has called the Turkish leader \"the Hitler of our century,\" among other critiques.  Turkey also reportedly requested the extradition of Kanter last year. A Turkish state media report on the request said Kanter was accused of being part of a terror organization -- an accusation he responded to with humor. \"The only thing I terrorize is the rim,\" he tweeted, adding that he never even had a parking ticket in the US.\"Nobody should be surprised if Turkey calls you a terrorist because you don't agree with them,\" Kanter says. \"We got used to it already.\"In the wake of Turkey's accusations, the 6-foot 10-inch former prodigy of Turkish club Fenerbah\u00e7e says he has endured death threats over social media and was harassed by people he said were Erdogan supporters as he was leaving a Boston mosque with teammate Tacko Fall in October.Kanter says he has not been in contact with his family in Turkey for more than five years.READ: Leading NBA players say they've tested positive for coronavirusHis father, Mehmet Kanter, is facing trial in Turkey on suspicion of membership in a \"terrorist organization,\" according to the Turkish embassy in London.The embassy said the accusations against both Enes Kanter and his father stem from their support for US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, naming the NBA star as \"one of the most visible faces\" and \"prominent financers\" of the Gulen movement. Mehmet Kanter reportedly denied any association with the Gulen movement to a Turkish Court in June, according to Turkish news site T24. CNN has not been able to reach Mehmet Kanter for comment.Gulen has been accused by Erdogan of orchestrating the 2016 failed coup -- a charge he has repeatedly denied.  Mehmet Kanter was due to appear in court on March 19, according to Enes Kanter, though it is unclear whether the trial was delayed again. Out of safety concerns, Kanter says he has not spoken to his parents in five years, but is updated by his brother Kerem who plays basketball in Spain.\"If they don't delay this time, he's going to be in jail for about five and a half years,\" Enes Kanter said one month before the anticipated trial date. \"Just because they are accusing him of being my dad.\" Kanter takes the court with the word \"freedom\" written on his shoes during the Boston Celtics away game against the Los Angeles Lakers on February 23.READ: NBA star Gobert faces backlashSince his battle with the Turkish government went public, Kanter has shaped himself into one of the NBA's foremost political activists -- no small feat in a league awash with social consciousness.He has received the backing of both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in his calls for legislation, including an act that passed the House in October intending to sanction Turkish officials and limit US arms sales to Turkey. Kanter also spoke in Congress, appealing for US visas for Syrian Kurds displaced by Turkey's ground campaign against ISIS, according to the Washington Post.

Kanter says \"thugs\" and \"goons\" sent by the Turkish Consulate were to blame; the Turkish consul general Alper Akta\u015f denied the allegation.Then came the incident outside the mosque in October, when Kanter and 7-foot 5-inch Fall, who is from Senegal, were verbally confronted by two Turkish-speaking men who repeatedly called Kanter a \"traitor\" and levied other accusations as they waited for a cab Kanter filmed and shared a video of the alleged incident, which he described as \"crazy and scary\" to the press the following day.

They're suffering, they get tortured in jail, they're getting kidnapped.

By April of 2018, more than 100,000 people had faced criminal investigations in Turkey and at least 50,000 people had been imprisoned pending trial, according to Amnesty International. In addition more than 107,000 public sector employees had been fired. Turkey has also been at the top of the list of countries imprisoning journalists. \"Right now there is no freedom (in Turkey),\" says Kanter, who is eligible for US citizenship next year and has said he would like to run for office. \"Certainly no freedom of speech, no freedom of religion or freedom of expression.\"JUST WATCHED'The first reality show': 'Hoop Dreams' at 25ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'The first reality show': 'Hoop Dreams' at 25 02:21The Kaepernick effectLast summer, Kanter sat down with another pro athlete who has been the face of a political movement, Colin Kaepernick.  \"He's a super smart, intelligent guy, and obviously he was going through some problems too,\" Kanter says of the NFL quarterback who has not played since kneeling during the national anthem as a form of social protest in 2016.Though Kaepernick's NFL career hasn't recovered, he sparked a movement in sports and brought an awareness to the killing of unarmed black men at the hands of police. Kanter says he picked Kaepernick's brain on how to use his status as an NBA player to broaden his own platform.\"He was giving me some ideas,\" Kanter says. \"People know my story because I play in the NBA, right? But there are tons of stories out there that are way worse than mine. I was like, 'How can we use my story to tell their stories?'\"But unlike Kaepernick, who has been celebrated in media campaigns and is reportedly receiving millions from Nike, Kanter is one of the few players on his team without a shoe deal. He has said that talks with Nike stalled after they raised concerns that stores would be shut down in Turkey, a country of more than 80 million people.\"Because I talk about these issues, I don't get any endorsement deals,\" he says. \"Nike is so scared to give me a contract because they don't want their business to be affected in Turkey.\"Nike did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on a shoe deal for Kanter. Endorsements, however, are not what drive him. \"You know what?

For all of Kanter's support in Washington, it is unclear whether he is as popular in Turkey, where his games have been banned from broadcast and his and his Twitter feed has been blocked.That is in part due to his closeness to Gulen, the 78-year-old cleric who, along with his followers, is held with suspicion among many ordinary Turks.Supporters point to Gulen's ethos of interfaith dialogue and access to free education. His movement has opened schools and universities in more than 100 countries, including the largest charter school network in Texas, Harmony Public Schools.But even those outside of government in Turkey feel that Gulenists operate an influential shadowy network, according to Esra \u00d6zy\u00fcrek, chair in contemporary Turkish studies at the London School of Economics.\"They are seen as (being) behind the 2016 coup attempt, and responsible for corrupting the legal system and the university and state service entry systems,\" she says.  \"This is popularly believed.\"         View this post on Instagram           to raise awareness for Turkey's dismal human rights record.

According to the online CrossFit magazine Morning Chalk Up, upwards of 70% of CrossFit affiliated gyms across the globe have already closed their doors, with the number expected to rise.

        "content": "(CNN)Shin-Soo Choo, an outfielder and designated hitter for the Texas Rangers, is giving every player in the Rangers' minor league system $1,000 to help alleviate the financial hit they may take amid the coronavirus pandemic.That's 191 players, meaning the 37-year-old from South Korea is pledging $191,000.\"I can help other people,\" Choo, who is heading into his final year of a $130 million, seven-year contract, said Wednesday in a conference call. \"That's a good thing.\"\"Twenty years ago ... coming from Korea, I (had) nothing,\" he said. \"Baseball gives me a lot of things. I want to pay back to other people...It's a hard situation in the world, but still I can help other people.\"Choo spent seven years in the minor leagues. He remembers how little money he had in those days, and said at times he would skip dinner to keep his $20 meal money. Read MoreWhen he and his wife Won Mi Ha had their first child, Alan, in 2005, Choo said he had trouble having enough money to buy diapers. He estimated during that time he was earning about $350 a week.\"I don't want these guys' baseball careers affected by money,\" Choo said, adding that he hopes his donation can keep players in a position to focus on training at home, and perhaps one day reach the majors. \"Probably a lot of guys maybe (are) looking for another job right now,\" he said. \"I don't want to lose any players over money.\"Choo's major league career started in 2005 with the Seattle Mariners. He also played for the Cleveland Indians and briefly with the Cincinnati Reds. He joined the Rangers in 2014.On Tuesday, MLB announced it would extend its initiative to provide financial support to minor league players through the end of May or the beginning of the minor league season, whichever comes first, according to a statement from the league.A source with knowledge of the initiative told CNN that the plan will provide more than 7,000 minor league ballplayers with $400 a week during this time period.The affected players and their families also will continue to receive medical benefits during this time period.CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

The undefeated lightweight champion had been scheduled to fight Tony Ferguson at UFC 249 on April 18, but like many other sporting events, the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc with a fight that had been originally scheduled to take place at the Barclay Center in Brooklyn, New York later this month.After returning to his home in Dagestan, Russia from California, Nurmagomedov said he wouldn't be leaving even if UFC president Dana White comes us with a solution to stage the event.\"Staying home in quarantine and reading the reaction of people to the situation around my fight, it turns out that the whole world should be in quarantine,\" the 31-year-old said on Instagram. \"Governments of all countries, famous people around the world urge people to follow all safety requirements in order to limit the spread of the disease, to save people, and Khabib is the only one relieved of all obligations and must demonstrate free will and train flying around the world, for the sake of fight?\"Read MoreREAD: Why Enes Kanter has more than just losing the NBA season on his mindNurmagomedov and Ferguson face off during the UFC 249 press conference.While a host of major sporting events have been postponed or canceled, White has been insistent that UFC 249 will go ahead in some form or other. With New York in lockdown as the city attempts to limit COVID-19's effects, hosting UFC 249 in the United Arab Emirates had been mooted, though worldwide travel restrictions also make that idea look improbablyWhile he acknowledged his decision would not be to fans' liking, Nurmagomedov told the mixed martial arts world to \"take care of yourself and put yourself in my shoes.\"\"I understand everything, and I'm definitely upset more than you to cancel the fight, probably like all others, I had many plans after the fight, but I can't control it all,\" Nurmagomedov said.

        "content": "(CNN)Nightingales may be less likely to survive their annual migration because climate change is causing the songbirds to evolve shorter wings, new research has found.Scientists discovered that over the past two decades, the wingspan of nightingales from central Spain has decreased.They highlighted natural selection caused by rising average temperatures in the region as the likely cause of the trend.Nightingales flock to sub-Saharan Africa every year, but the researchers from the Complutense University of Madrid warned that the birds find it harder to return if their wingspans are stunted. Their study was published Wednesday in the journal The Auk: Ornithological Advances.\"There is much evidence that climate change is having an effect on migratory birds, changing their arrival and laying dates and their physical features over the last few decades,\" lead author Carolina Remacha said in a statement. Read MoreClimate change could be making birds shrink in size, study finds\"If we are to fully understand how bird populations adapt to new environments in order to help them tackle the challenges of a rapidly changing world, it is important to call attention to the potential problems of maladaptive change,\" she added.In Spain, the spring season has shifted later in the year and droughts over the summer have become longer and more intense, meaning nightingales have a shorter window in which they can raise their young, the team said.That timetable has led to the more successful birds having smaller clutches (or groups of eggs), which affects wingspan and potentially other important survivalist features because of the unique way the songbirds' genes interact.The \"migratory gene package\" theory dictates that a number of features which help nightingales survive their migration -- including wingspan, a high resting metabolic rate, shorter lifespans and larger clutches -- all interact with each other, so if one is negatively affected, all the other can be weakened too.That means having fewer offspring due to a warming climate is likely also responsible for the birds having shorter wingspans, the researchers said.The impact of climate change on numerous bird species has been well documented.Research by the National Audubon Society last year found that two-thirds of North American bird species \u2014 389 different species -- are at risk of extinction from climate change.Another independent study said that said nearly 3 billion birds have disappeared from the United States and Canada in the past half a century. And further research in 2019 stated that the sizes of birds in the US has changed over the past four decades, likely as a result of the changing climate -- although that study found that the birds' bodies were shrinking but their wingspans were getting wider.",

Komen breast cancer organization.Instead, Lowe underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy in 2019.         View this post on Instagram           I'm learning that sometimes battling cancer can make you feel like a science experiment. You're always getting poked, prodded, cut and evaluated. I have scars where all cancer and healthy tissue were removed. I have a port under my collarbone where I will be given the chemotherapy drugs and a scar under my arm where lymphnodes were removed and tested. (All lymphnode were negative for cancer which means it has not spread) praise God! While it doesn't feel good, I appreciate each invasion that is necessary to save my life. Today I visited my plastic surgeon who helps me feel better. His job is to pick up the pieces and help make beauty out of the mess. Never the less, I woke up from a nap today feeling exhausted, sore and tired, but when I looked out the front door to saw a care package from the most amazing friends letting me know that they are behind me all of the way! My heart felt so full. In one of my first moments of weakness their kindness brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my heart! If you know someone going through something similar please share compassion and empathy for them. It does more for them then you will ever know. A post shared by  Chaunte Lowe (@chauntelowe) on Jul 17, 2019 at 12:41pm PDT \"He was definitely an easy target,\" Lowe says of her first doctor. \"But, I will say that the only thing that I probably wish he would have done different is not said, 'definitively, there's nothing wrong.\"'She says her treatment has been successful though, and new doctors have found no further evidence of cancerous cells. However, her body is still recovering from chemotherapy, which has weakened her immune system.A second bar to jumpThe outbreak of coronavirus complicates matters for Lowe.Owing to her weakened immune system, she is now classed as a vulnerable person, something that Lowe indicates is uncomfortable but \"eye-opening.\"Despite serious health concerns, Lowe had been determined to compete at Tokyo 2020.\"I would have been scared,\" she says. \"And I would have had a lot of different worries going into it that maybe some of the other athletes didn't have.\"But with the Olympics now postponed to 2021, the high jumper is more determined than ever to make the squad.In 2008, Lowe finished sixth in the Olympic high jump competition but was later upgraded to bronze when three athletes above her tested positive for banned substances.Lowe wants to use the buildup and the event itself to raise awareness for breast cancer.More than 42,000 women are expected to die from breast cancer in the US this year, according to the American Cancer Society.In 2018,  there were more than two million new breast cancer cases worldwide, according to World Cancer Research Fund International.Researchers stress that early detection of breast cancer leads to the highest rates of survival. Lowe hopes that, by raising awareness, she can help others.         View this post on Instagram           #nofilter . Yes, I had to cut it all off!!!

While training for the Olympics, Lowe has also been raising three children.Now she's a breast cancer survivor too, determined to support others and spread awareness about the illness.And amid the impact of a global pandemic, she is also determined to look for positives. \"By us all being apart, it shows that we're all coming together,\" she says. \"Everybody cares about the well-being of our world and the health of our world.\"Everyone had to take part in this process of making sure that our world is healthy. \"And so I think that it [the Tokyo Olympics] will be a time of peace, a time of celebration, and hopefully, a time to remember where we all had to come together as one world to save the world.\"",

He returned to the city from 15 years away in 2017.London (CNN)It's only eight days later. Just over a week into the lockdown, and the toilet paper and pasta have magically returned. London was told it was ahead of the rest of the UK for coronavirus infections by about three weeks. The moment of surge, or peak, is now upon us, even if our best scientists simply can't be sure how deep is the horror it will bring.

Sirens rattle vacated roads. Red buses roam emptily, leaving you to wonder where the quarter of passengers reportedly still using them are. A passerby's cough can echo in the first light, even if the dawn chorus is louder than it's seemed before.The past weeks have conjured a capital from dystopian movie sets; a deserted moonscape suddenly lit up, as if someone turned the sunlight back on at 3 a.m. On the first morning of the partial lockdown, the lights were still on at the usually packed Piccadilly Circus junction, but only the pharmacist Boots' doors were open. Plainclothes police in an unmarked car stopped us. \"How long do you plan to be here?\" the officer asked our three-strong TV crew, seeming as confused at asking the question as we were at answering it.The statue of Eros, whose surrounding steps are normally packed with tourists, is deserted at Piccadilly Circus on the first day of lockdown.The inconveniences caused by Covid-19 are as many and widespread as its dangers, and there is a race between them to dominate our attention span. We are told it is going to get worse before it gets better. It is already quite bad.Read MoreThe convenience stores have food aplenty, mostly limiting people to maximum three of anything. Yes, there is a 75-minute queue for one higher-end supermarket in North London, and even four people outside another budget one amid measures put in place to keep people 2 meters (6 feet) apart. The difficulty of getting to the food -- not its scarcity -- makes you want to buy more than you need.Shoppers observe social distancing in a queue outside a supermarket in central London.But the numbers are beginning to make these irritants seem petty. The UK's daily death toll is now often counted in the hundreds, a terrifying escalation that seemed to casually happen overnight. A \"good\" final total would be under 20,000 dead, UK officials warn. The contrarian voices urging we all get back to work to save the economy, are presumably volunteering to be part of those 20,000.The UK isn't testing much, and the 134,946 tests as of Monday morning carried out -- in quite strict, specific circumstances often because of severe symptoms -- have revealed 22,141 positives. We can only hope that the 112,805 who met the criterion for a test and were cleared are medical staff being deservedly checked and cleared for work. But some of their unions complain tests are too rare. Outside of London, officials have surreally chosen the forecourt of a huge theme park -- Chessington World of Adventures, where once you enjoyed lions and rollercoasters in the same day -- to test National Health Service (NHS) workers.Drive-through testing tents have been set up in an empty parking lot at Chessington. The magical carrots of science are too small and fleeting to distract from the daily stick of lockdown. Most Brits can't get a test and may never know if they have had coronavirus or have it. Sharon Peacock, the director of the national infection service at Public Health England, wowed us Wednesday for three whole hours. She promised millions of home-testing kits, able to check if people had had the infection, and deliverable by Amazon, within days. That same afternoon, Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer and favorite realist, said the kits were still an unspecified while away. We know whatever is going to happen here, is going to happen with the lights off. Sitting comfortably at home, we can all snark at a government facing a challenge that would flatten most of us before our first coffee, and that's becoming as personal as it is monumental. Should we pay more or less attention to our chief informer and movement-restricter, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, since he tested positive for the virus?Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had only mild symptoms and continued to work and send messages to the country.Johnson had earlier said the UK could \"take it on the chin\", and even spoke of shaking hands until quite late on. But the tousled, lone figure holding up his own mobile phone -- transmitting from his apartment above Number 11 Downing Street like the final broadcast from Sigourney Weaver's stranded starship -- is in itself the direst warning any Briton can have. Britain, as a country, could not keep Boris safe. Nor his health secretary, or the chief medical officer -- all of whom have tested positive. It's not negligence, but the essential nature of their work that likely exposed them. And that causes a pause for thought: How essential is your work? Do you really need to go out?Support for National Health Service staff fighting the coronavirus outbreak has been displayed in signs and applause.The city's ability to be nice to itself keeps surging and ebbing. On Thursday, across the country, a nationwide round of applause in support for NHS workers brought us to windows and doorways. Some London neighbors saw the faces of the people who lived opposite for perhaps the first time. It was fleeting, but real.The idolized NHS free health care service has deftly handed Britain a huge symbol of reassurance, to inspire us to believe it might handle even this -- the NHS Nightingale Hospital with potentially 4,000 intensive-care beds on the side of the Thames. Inside, the mammoth, empty conference space of the ExCel Centre is being swiftly delineated into booths by half-finished walls, with soldiers and contractors in high-visibility vests working overtime. Anxious former hotel cleaners mill around the entrance hoping for shifts. Huge columns of heart monitors sat in one hall: an army massing for a battle ahead, whose size is unknowable for now.Members of the military arrive to turn the ExCel Centre in London into the NHS Nightingale Hospital. They call it a \"pop-up hospital\" and its scale comforts as it shows that London wants to be ready, but also disturbs because it speaks of a gargantuan challenge ahead. Perhaps fittingly it is named in honor of Florence Nightingale, who revolutionized nursing only after she had experienced the horrors of the Crimean War.Soldiers and contractors build booths for hospital beds. We are in this together, is one mantra, to which officials stick because there are few facts to cling to. We don't really know how far \"it\" has spread, how many of us have had it, or who has it now -- just that the peak is really here. In London, the only comfort as we enter the dark fortnight ahead, is that its close may bring the end into view.",

According to a statement from the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics on March 30, Italy's 7,000 care homes are \"neither equipped nor have trained personnel\" and they can become \"biological bombs of contagion.\" The society made the statement while announcing it had started a blood survey to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic criteria in nursing homes.Livia Borghese reported from Rome and Sharon Braithwaite from London.

        "content": "(CNN)A British pensioner has just been the crowned the world's oldest man after he celebrated his 112th birthday. Born on March 29, 1908, Robert Weighton has officially been confirmed as the new title holder by Guinness World Records (GWR), it was announced Tuesday. He scoops the title after Chitetsu Watanabe, from Japan, passed away on February 23. Born on March 5, 1907, he was 112 years and 355 days old.  It is usually customary for adjudicators to meet with record holders in person. However, due to global social distancing measures that have been applied because of the coronavirus pandemic, Weighton was awarded his certificate remotely, at the assisted living home where he lives.World's oldest living man has died at age 112 in JapanPlaying down the accolade, Weighton described himself as \"an ordinary bloke who just happened to live for a long time.\" Read MoreIn a video clip posted on the GWR site, he said: \"I have never been someone who said 'I want to climb Everest' or sail around the world... I just take life as it comes along.\"Born in Kingston-Upon-Hull in Yorkshire, he was one of seven children. After leaving school at 16, he undertook a marine engineering apprenticeship. He later moved to Taiwan where he spent two years learning Mandarin and taught at a missionary school. In 1937 he married his wife Agnes, who was also a teacher. Their first child was born in Taiwan, but two years later they left for the UK.Their timing clashed with the outbreak of World War II, and the family was diverted to Canada. During the war, the family moved from Canada to Connecticut in the US. While there, Weighton worked in a factory making planes to support Britain's war efforts.The couple had two more children during this time and remained in the US until 1945, when they then returned to the UK.World's oldest man dies in Japan at age 113Weighton later went on to teach at London's City University. His wife Agnes passed away in 1995.The grandfather of 10 and great-grandfather of 25 said: \"When you're young you don't think about being old. It's a new record for me. The only other record I remember ever having was jumping five feet two inches high in my school days in the final high jump on sports day.\"Weighton has more than four years to go until he beats the record of the longest ever living man. That accolade goes to Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who was born on April 19, 1897 and died aged 116 years and 54 days on June 12, 2013. Kane Tanaka, the world's oldest woman, lives in Japan. She celebrated her 117th birthday in January.",

        "content": "(CNN)Most people might look at a washing machine and think it's only got one use. For Fabio Wibmer though, once he's finished washing his clothes, white goods provide the perfect obstacle for his next trick. The Austrian cycling sensation, whose videos have garnered him a huge following on Instagram and YouTube, has been pedaling furiously during lockdown. Whereas he previously used railings and walls in cities across the world for his stunts, the 24-year-old is making the most of what he's got at home for his videos. His \"Home Office\" video, which was viewed over 1.6 million times in one day and now has over seven million views, involves Wibmer performing tricks all around his house using household appliances and sporting equipment as props. Read MoreWibmer describes riding his bike at home as a \"weird situation.\"For Wibmer and his housemates, the ability to focus on producing this video and \"thinking outside the box\" has helped him pass the time while he's been stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. \"I was walking through the house and through the garage. And then, for example, I saw my bike like standing. And then I thought this could be actually cool to jump on it,\" Wibmer told CNN Sport. \"We really, really enjoyed it because we had a rhythm, kind of like a mission to do something and we found our passion in that time.\"I think the whole team was super happy to be in such a situation where we can still do something at home rather than just sitting in the home and watching Netflix or whatever.\" READ: The extreme parkour team whose death-defying jumps caught the attention of HollywoodWibmer balances on the outside of a window of his house. Adapting to the surroundingsWibmer starting riding when he was six and has traveled all over the world to film stunts from the streets of Paris and Hamburg to Tenerife and Vancouver.Given that global lifestyle, being told he had to stay home in Austria was \"super crazy\" for Wibmer. \"I was there with my roommates and then we just thought, 'well, let's make the most out of it and just try to be creative and do something.' And so I had to bring my biking playground from the streets and from the mountains to my home.\" To Wibmer a bike isn't just for riding ...\"For a guy like me, I'm used to playing outside on my bike and riding my bike everywhere else, but not at home. I didn't really know what to do in the beginning because usually I don't ride at home.\" Even for someone as experienced as Wibmer, some of the stunts that feature in the video took numerous attempts to perfect. Wibmer says that he tried the basketball trick shot, where he uses his bike's back wheel to hit the ball into the hoop, around \"600 times.\"\"I think out of those 600 tries we had, maybe 10 tries kind of went into that direction, but they're definitely not in the basket. \"I mean we didn't really have any stress, so it was actually more chill. It took us around four or five weeks in total to get everything.\"READ: Oscar-winning director Jimmy Chin on fear, risk and finding the edgeWibmer jumps from the roof of his house onto a tree.'Inspire'Wibmer's stunts have helped him become one of the best-known riders on the biking scene, with his videos raking in over 700 million views.

        "content": "(CNN)The world's richest football league will return to our screens on June 17.Following weeks of negotiations with clubs, players and the UK government, the Premier League confirmed the resumption of the 2019/2020 season on Thursday.The decision was met with excitement by fans across the world, but for many there is a sense of trepidation.Earlier in the week, just hours after the Premier League announced that its clubs had unanimously agreed to resume contact training, the UK government issued figures showing a further 412 people had died of Covid-19.The total number of coronavirus deaths in the UK now stands at 37,919, but the true death toll is believed to be much higher. Read MoreJust before the Premier League season's resumption was confirmed, Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK government, said at the daily coronavirus briefing that the number of new cases is around 8,000 per day.\"That is not a low number,\" Vallance said.Several high-profile players, including Troy Deeney, Sergio Aguero and N'Golo Kante, have all expressed fears about returning to action when there is still so much uncertainty and so much about the virus that remains unknown.READ: 'I hope your son gets coronavirus': Troy Deeney reveals abuse he's sufferedREAD: Father of Aston Villa manager Dean Smith dies after contracting coronavirusJUST WATCHED'I hope your son gets coronavirus': Troy Deeney reveals abuse receivedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'I hope your son gets coronavirus': Troy Deeney reveals abuse received 04:47Dr. Ralph Rogers, who has worked in the Premier League, told CNN Sport that those players have cause for concern.\"I can imagine as a player, I would be very wary about coming back,\" says Dr. Rogers. \"Especially because there's so much about this coronavirus [we don't know] and people are dying. I completely understand that. \"What we know about this virus is that we should be doing social distancing. You can't even go into Waitrose [supermarket] without being six feet apart, so unless they're changing the rules of football it might be a little bit premature,\" added Dr. Rogers.\"The virus is indiscriminate, it will attack anybody.\"Despite the still rapidly rising death toll -- new data shows the UK has the second-highest death rate per million in the world -- the Premier League, given the green light under government guidelines, continues to press ahead with plans to provisionally restart the season next month.But the league's return is in line with a gradual re-opening for the rest of the UK economy; Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced earlier this week that all non-essential shops would be reopening from the middle of June.Dr. Rogers says it's a case of \"money vs. health\" --  and at the moment, it would appear money is winning.\"It's bigger than just football,\" says Dr. Rogers. \"We've got to follow the virus. That's what it's all about. The virus will dictate to us what we do in society and unless they change the rules in football, not tackling, not heading the ball together ... it's a contact sport and people get very close to each other.READ: Experts warn lockdown could come at 'psychological cost' to footballersREAD: Lionel Messi and La Liga stars get go ahead to resume play early next monthTroy Deeney has expressed concerns about returning to training.\"So there is a big chance, a big opportunity for this virus to spread through football and if it wasn't for the amount of money in football, I don't know that we would be having this conversation, which is, I think, really the underlying issue to this whole thing.\"We all want football because it's so interesting for society. It's nice, it's that little layer to how we live, it's entertainment. But at what cost?\"The Premier League was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.Just over a week ago, Deeney estimated that \"65% to 75%\" of players were concerned about contact training going ahead and that number was \"even higher\" for those who thought the season wouldn't resume.The Watford captain publicly opted against returning to phase one of training, a decision for which he received abuse -- \"I hope your son gets coronavirus,\" one person told him -- but he will go back for phase two.Deeney says improved communication with the Premier League has been a factor, but adds there's also an element of resignation that players could no longer prevent the league restarting.\"I genuinely think a lot of players have definitely come to the conclusion that it's happening,\" he told CNN. 'There's [a sense of]: 'We can't stop it.'\"Ultimately, everyone knows this is happening, the season is gonna finish and you control the controllables, is what we've had to do.\"Fears for BAME playersOfficial figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released at the start of May showed that black people in England and Wales are more than four times more likely to die from the coronavirus than white people.Even when removing socioeconomic factors, the statistics found they were still almost twice as likely to die from Covid-19. The reasons why remain unclear.When it was first announced that Premier League clubs would return to training, Deeney was one of a number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) players who expressed concerns about those statistics, leading the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to ask the Premier League to conduct more research into the figures.JUST WATCHEDEPL return will \"make so many people happy,\" says Phil NevilleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEPL return will \"make so many people happy,\" says Phil Neville 02:38\"It's a fair thing to acknowledge that there is an increased risk in BAME groups,\" Dr. Mark Gillett, the Premier League's Chief Medical Advisor, said at a recent briefing.\"In mitigation of that the risk in young fit athletes is still very, very small and I think that is an important factor. I come back again to the fact that we're trying to create the safest possible working environment we can for these people.\"I'm happy we've mitigated all the risks that we can understand at this point and then when more information becomes available obviously we will do everything we can to mitigate against that as well. We will certainly move with it in real time as more information becomes available.\"Deeney is also complimentary of how the Premier League has handled his concerns since he first spoke out.The Watford captain says he has now had \"four or five\" meetings with the league and has also been speaking to Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the UK government's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who has allayed some of his fears.Deeney says he is aware that as a professional footballer, even one from a BAME background, the risk of him suffering serious health problems due to Covid-19 is very low.However, it's the risk of passing it on to friends and family that worries him the most; Deeney has a five-month-old son who was born prematurely and has breathing difficulties.\"When I'm talking about black players, it's not necessarily me, it's if we go home to mums, dads,\" he says. \"We have a player at our team that lives with both of his parents and his grandparents live with him, and he's of [minority] ethnicity.JUST WATCHEDBehind the gradual return of global sportReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBehind the gradual return of global sport 03:19\"So not only is he at risk, but then going home he's putting the people that are definitely in the higher risk category [in danger].\"Having spoken at length to the Premier League and Van-Tam, Deeney says some of the increased health impacts of Covid-19 are due to cultural behavior towards illness.\"Black people don't go to the doctors as much,\" he explains. \"We'll wait until the last minute, we get symptoms but we don't necessarily go straight to the doctors, we'll try and wait it out a little bit.\"Economically as well, depending on where you're from and what areas you live in, that can all hit but, ultimately, they're gonna say for footballers we don't come under those categories.\"But it's also the bigger picture of our families and that's more important to me than a few pound notes in our back pocket.\"The cost of coronavirusThe pandemic could end up costing the UK as much as \u00a3298 billion [$368B] for the current financial year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.Despite its multi-million dollar salaries, transfer fees and billion dollar broadcasting deals, the football industry has also sharply felt the financial impact of the coronavirus.At a stakeholder meeting earlier this month, top-flight clubs across Europe estimated they could stand to lose up to \u00a36.2 billion [$7.7B] if the current season could not be completed.JUST WATCHEDGermany's Bundesliga is the first major football league to come back in the pandemicReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGermany's Bundesliga is the first major football league to come back in the pandemic 02:39Dr. Rogers says he has privately spoken to fellow medical professionals and most are in agreement as to the reason why football is desperately trying to get the current campaign restarted.\"Same things that I'm saying, it's all about money,\" he says. \"I don't want to put it so glibly like that, but people want this thing open, you know, it's a business. My colleagues, the guys that I know in the field of sports medicine are basically saying we have to look after the players' health.What I think is valuable are the nurses that have to deal with the coronavirus. They should pay the nurses more, they should pay the doctors more, they should pay the teachers more. And by the way, the guys who clean the hospitals, probably one of the most important people, they should pay them more.\"\"One of the jobs that I do is in urgent care and I can remember the first weeks going to work I was scared, I'm not afraid to say I was scared. I can't say I'm less scared but I try to put in the back of my mind now and just get on with my work but this is serious.\"This is a very serious virus and people who are not in the medical field are surely scared. This is football, it's a game. I realize it's a business but at the end of the day, it's a game and there are a lot more important things than football -- I hate to say it even though I'm a football fan, but people are dying out here.\"An independent study published last year by Ernst and Young revealed that the Premier League and its clubs contributed \u00a33.3 billion [$4B] in taxes and added \u00a37.6 [$9.3B] billion to the UK's gross domestic product just in the 2016/17 season.JUST WATCHEDFormer Real Madrid star uses AI company to fight Covid-19 in SpainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Real Madrid star uses AI company to fight Covid-19 in Spain 02:55Almost 100,000 UK jobs are supported by the league and almost all of them will have felt the economic impact of the pandemic, but it's not the highly-paid players or coaches who have been most affected.\"Think about the guys who clean the stands, think about the people sell hot dogs, there's just such a trickle down as to why football is so important in this economy, and you start to see how important it is,\" Rogers says.\"It's a business so they want to get it going again but, again, I do completely understand the concerns of players.

A role model to us all, he lived his life interested in and engaged with all kinds of people from across the world,\" the family said.Weighton, who was born in Yorkshire in the north of England on March 29, 1908, was officially named the world's oldest man after Chitetsu Watanabe, from Japan, died on February 23, aged 112 years and 355 days.World's oldest living man has died at age 112 in JapanPlaying down the accolade at the time, Weighton described himself as \"an ordinary bloke who just happened to live for a long time.\" Read MoreHe also declined the offer of a birthday card from Queen Elizabeth II this year, saying he did not want one at taxpayers' expense and had received at least 10 from her already, PA reported.Right up until his death, Weighton's family said, he had a wide range of interests, including politics, theology and ecology. He was also passionate about the environment and had a workshop inside his home filled with furniture, windmills and puzzles that he hand-made and sold for charity.\"We are so grateful that until the very end Bob remained our witty, kind, knowledgeable, conversationalist father, grandfather and great grandfather, and we will miss him greatly,\" the family added.Born in the northern English city of Hull, Weighton was one of seven children. After leaving school at 16, he undertook a marine engineering apprenticeship. He later moved to Taiwan, where he spent two years learning Mandarin and teaching in a missionary school.Humans have reached their lifespan limit, researchers sayIn 1937, he married a fellow teacher, Agnes, and two years later they left for the UK. However, their timing clashed with the outbreak of World War II, and the family was diverted to Canada and then moved to Connecticut in the US, where Weighton worked in a factory making planes to support Britain's war efforts.The couple remained in the US until 1945, when they returned to the UK.Weighton later went on to teach at London's City University. Agnes died in 1995. He is survived by his children David and Dorothy, 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.According to Guinness World Records, the world's oldest person is Kane Tanaka, who lives in Japan. She celebrated her 117th birthday in January.CNN's Lianne Kolirin contributed to this report.",

They were banned shortly after Adolf Hitler assumed power in 1933, as part of the Nazi's early efforts to remove Jews from the public life.Nazi regalia, firearm and illegal fireworks confiscated in German raidsThe German military has admitted recently it has a problem with extremism within its ranks. Last year, it set up a central coordinating office to combat the issue. Read MoreA report by the military released in March said 49 military personnel were dismissed in 2019 because of extremism and anti-constitutional beliefs. The report said 46 of the dismissals were due to right-wing extremism, two were classified as Islamism, and one soldier was identified as a left-wing extremist.According to the defense ministry, the role of the rabbis will mirror those of Catholic and Protestant chaplains. They will provide pastoral care to the soldiers and accompany them on foreign missions.The new military rabbis will work as temporary military contractors for six years, but their positions might become permanent in the future, the ministry said. A similar initiative to introduce military imams is being discussed.The law will also establish a special federal military rabbinate in Berlin, which will oversee branches in Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Leipzig. Up to 10 rabbis will initially report into the federal chief, the ministry said. Germany does not formally record the religious affiliation of its soldiers. According to official estimates based on voluntary disclosures, around 300 Jewish soldiers and 3,000 Muslims are currently serving in the German military. There are 53,000 Protestants and 41,000 Roman Catholics, who together account for roughly half of all service members.",

Aston Villa sits just four points above the Norfolk team while Bournemouth makes up the bottom three, although Watford and West Ham are sat on the same number of points.The provisional restart date for the competition will only go ahead \"provided that all safety requirements are in place,\" the Premier League said.

        "content": "London (CNN)Is the damage caused by the lockdown worse than the virus itself? That's a question raised by some world leaders and commentators who claim that economic and social hardship caused by strict coronavirus restrictions places a heavier burden on society than the death rate caused by the disease.These lockdown skeptics point to the tens of millions of US jobs lost in an economic downturn not seen since the Great Depression, the warning by the European Commission of a  recession of \"historic proportions\" and the Bank of England's fear that the British economy is facing its worst crash in three centuries. Covid-19 has taken a staggering toll on a whole generation in northern ItalyThe drumbeat of dissent had its moment on the popular British debate show, the BBC's Question Time, when Luke Johnson, a prominent UK businessman with a maverick streak, argued in the May 14 broadcast that the UK had over-reacted to Covid 19. \"Imagine the agony of two million more people,\" he said of the number who could lose their jobs amid a sustained UK lockdown. \"How many deaths might flow from that?\"US President Donald Trump made similar claims in late March, telling Fox News: \"You're going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.\" His Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro insists that economic stagnation will hurt Brazil more than the virus itself, and on Thursday called the decision made by governors and mayors to close some non-essential sectors of the economy \"a terrible disgrace.\"Read MoreThese arguments are unconvincing, say economists. To fix the global economy, fix the global pandemic, they add. Survey data shows the US economy was winding down even before US states were mandating stay-at-home policies. Fear of the virus mean people were shopping less, small businesses were closing and cutting employment. Fear of the virus mean people were shopping less, small businesses were closing and cutting employment. \"What I think they [the skeptics] are missing is this wasn't some left-wing conspiracy to stop the economy from working. This was middle-aged people, like me, who didn't want to see their parents die,\" Charlie Robertson, chief economist at investment bank Renaissance Capital, told CNN. Nor is there enough data to say lockdowns are more deadly than the disease -- which has infected over 5.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 350,000. \"None of us [economists] have enough information to know if lockdowns are worth it or not. We are not operating in the realm of perfect information or even much information,\" Thomas Hale, associate professor in public policy at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University, told CNN.The EU is still divided over coronavirus relief. That could tear it apartStudies of previous recessions have shown that all-cause mortality tends to fall during them, although suicides increase. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, it was found there were declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy, according to a research paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.  But there is no precedent to the scale of the lockdowns enacted around the world to combat the coronavirus. The best we can do, say economists, is to track the emerging evidence. \"We don't know much about the epidemiology of this disease; we don't know how long it will last, how the economy will react -- these are all big unknowns -- so the best we can do at this point is follow the evidence we do have, be completely committed to following the science and updating our strategies as we get new information,\" Hale added.The impact  There is no doubt that lockdowns have wrought economic chaos. Restrictions launched to counteract the disease have exacerbated existing inequalities in education and the workplace, and between genders, races, and socio-economic backgrounds. Academics warn of a new lost generation as more disadvantaged students face increased obstacles to achieving good grades under lockdown. Historically underpaid, women are the hardest hit by the economic slump in the US, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In Britain, men working in low-skilled jobs are dying from coronavirus at a higher rate than their white-collar peers. Migrant workers, treated as second-class citizens in the Gulf, Singapore, and India, have found themselves unable to afford their next meal or suffering the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak in those countries. Our economic recovery depends on policies that benefit womenYet there is widespread agreement among world-leading economists, such as the Chicago Booth School IGM Panel, that lifting severe lockdowns too soon could risk reigniting second waves of the virus that would inflict still more financial pain on societies. The point of shutting economies was to save lives. It also helped governments buy time to scale up their testing, tracing and isolating regimes, which have helped countries like Germany and South Korea isolate and tackle future clusters or outbreaks until a vaccine is developed.  But Hale says some countries, like the US, have squandered the time given to them. \"Other governments haven't used that time well, and I would say the United States is very much one that, at the federal level, has not had a coherent strategy.\" A failure to use the time wisely risks a spike in infections as lockdowns are lifted, and a subsequent nosedive in consumer confidence. People \"would freak out\" as they watch their peers get ill, leading them to \"question their livelihoods and lifestyle,\" Giancarlo Corsetti, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Cambridge, told CNN, Research conducted by Corsetti found there is no absolute trade-off between human health and the economy in developed countries, where the economic price of inaction in the pandemic could be twice as high as a lockdown.\"Now, would people carry on going to restaurants to bars, and then go visit their parents and kill them?\" Robertson asked. \"I would suspect that that you'd still have this combination of people altering their behavior and spending less and going out to restaurants less.\"Sweden is still nowhere near 'herd immunity,' even though it didn't go into lockdown Nor would there be much benefit for some economies to ease restrictions early while much of the rest of the world remained under lockdown, experts add. Robertson points to Sweden, which adopted a different strategy to other European nations during the pandemic -- keeping most schools, restaurants, salons and bars open. It did, however, ask people to refrain from making long journeys, placing an emphasis on personal responsibility.Despite its different path, Sweden's economy is in the doldrums along the rest of its European counterparts, and it has more deaths per capita, over a seven-day rolling average, than its Nordic neighbors, according to Our World in Data, an independent statistics website headquartered at Oxford University. But don't entirely dismiss lockdown skepticism, especially when nations have used the deep freeze as a guise to grab more power. \"I think the critique is very welcome because governments should be aware of the costs of these policies,\" Hale said, explaining that laws rushed out after the 9/11 terrorist attacks have outlived the crisis they were meant to address.Armed protesters demand the reopening of businesses April 30, 2020, outside Michigan State Capitol in Lansing.There is a better argument against the efficacy of lockdowns in low-income countries, where citizens cannot rely on generous welfare provisions to compensate for the loss of livelihoods. Not everywhere will benefit from a stimulus check from the Internal Revenue Service or the sort of job retention schemes seen throughout Europe.  Rich, developed nations may well be able to afford extended shutterings, says Robertson. But low-income countries in South Asia, as well as Africa, cannot afford to rack up high debt, lose tax revenues and investments to its economy, he added. The question, he said, is more pressing in countries where millions \"badly need to have an economy that is working and growing.\"",

They had been holding separate solo demonstrations in support of a jailed colleague, according to statements from their employers.The detentions sparked outrage among local journalists and activists who argue that solo demonstrations are not forbidden by law and accuse local authorities for using the coronavirus lockdown as a suppression tool.At least eight people were detained then later released on Thursday, including Sergey Smirnov, chief editor of MediaZona, an online outlet that covers criminal justice and police activity in Russia, and journalists Tatyana Felgenhauer and Alexander Plushev of the Ekho Moskvy radio station.All detainees have been charged with violating laws on protesting and six have also been charged with breaking the self-isolation restrictions, which could result in fines or jail time. The court hearings are expected within the next two weeksAlexander Plushhev was holding a one-person protest, according to a statement from his employer.The journalists had been protesting the arrest of Ilya Azar, a prominent journalist and activist in Russia. Read MoreAzar was jailed for 15 days on Wednesday following his own solo demonstration in support of Vladimir Vorontsov, a former police officer who runs an outlet dedicated to exposing abuses within law enforcement. Police said at the time that Azar was being detained for violating a ban on mass gatherings during Moscow's lockdown, meant to slow the spread of coronavirus. He was subsequently charged with \"repeated violation of laws on protesting.\"Sergey Smirnov, the chief editor of MediaZona, an online outlet that covers criminal justice and police activity in Russia, was also detained.\"Obviously you can't hold mass demos amid the pandemic in order to prevent further spread but a one-man protest is not a mass demo, either in its form or idea,\" Azar wrote on Facebook before his court hearing on Wednesday.\"To sum it up, using the pandemic and the general fear and apathy as cover, the people in power multiply their illegal acts,\" Azar added.  \"They are seriously discussing holding the military parade in June but I will be punished for a one-person demo.\"The Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.On Friday morning, Moscow police issued a warning saying anyone who participates in protests will be fined or put under administrative arrest, citing Mayor Sergey Sobyanin's order on \"increased alert\" in the city, which bans public events.But the solo protests continued, spilling over to other Russian cities. On Friday, at least eight people were detained outside the Interior Ministry headquarters in Moscow, and several journalists in the Siberian cities of Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk came out in support of detained colleagues. Journalists Felgenhauer and Plushev were detained again while covering the protests, according to a tweet Plushev sent from a police bus.While some countries clap for doctors, health workers in Russia face open hostilityThe head of the Russian branch of Amnesty International, Natalya Zvyagina, called the arrests \"a cowardly\" move against civil rights activists.\"The authorities hypocritically limit public events under the pretext of the pandemic by arresting solo demonstrators who do not pose a threat to anyone but the authorities as their abuses are being uncovered,\" Zvyagina said in a statement Thursday. \"The demonstrators are being thrown into overcrowded cells where they are risking getting infected with Covid-19.\"The discontent regarding the criminal proceedings against Vorontsov has been brewing for several weeks.Vorontsov's apartment has been raided at least three times since he retired from service in 2017, with police confiscating his computers and phones, according to state media.He was detained on May 7, when a special task force stormed his apartment descending on ropes from the roof of his residential building, according to his wife's account of the raid.He was then jailed for two months and is currently awaiting a verdict on two separate charges involving extortion and illegal distribution of pornography, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported at the time, citing his lawyers.Vorontsov denies these charges, saying the case is politically motivated and linked to his activism.His platform, called \"Police Ombudsman,\" has amassed about 500,000 followers on social media. Vorontsov has been hailed as an unofficial union leader for law enforcement officers as the project reported on a suicide wave among police, caused in part by what it called a \"race for crime solving rate,\" and published other stories about a hostile work environment and overwork among officers.",

        "content": "(CNN)The sporting world has come together to pay their respects to George Floyd after his death in Minnesota, US, on Monday. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died unarmed after pleading for help as a white police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes while pinning him to the ground.Floyd was declared dead at a nearby hospital soon after, according to authorities.Protests against police brutality have since spread across the US with crowds, numbering in the thousands, calling for justice. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a leading figure in the \u200bmovement against systemic racial injustice, threw his support behind the demonstrations which began in Minneapolis \u200bthis week, and have spread to Louisville, Kentucky, Memphis, Tennessee, and elsewhere around the country.Read More\"When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction,\" he wrote on Instagram.\"The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears because your violence has brought this resistance.  \"We have the right to fight back!

NBA's LeBron James shared a picture on Instagram of the police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck next to a picture of Kaepernick taking a knee with the caption \"Do you understand NOW!!??!!?? Or is it still blurred to you??\".   These were thoughts echoed by Stephen Jackson, a former NBA player and friend of Floyd.Jackson, who called Floyd \"twin\", said he will head to Minnesota in order to give his friend a voice.  \"This is not the way he was supposed to go,\" he told CNN's Newsroom. \"He didn't deserve that, but the way that people are supporting him, standing up for him -- the way I'm going to stand up and support him -- his death will not be in vain. \"What is justice? I can't even answer that question. I've seen so many black men get killed, officers get laid off jobs with pay, no jail time.\"Four Minneapolis police officers involved in Floyd's death have been fired -- but his family says they want murder charges against them.Protests have spread around the US.In a tweet posted on Thursday, local NBA team Minnesota Timberwolves paid tribute to Floyd.\"We will work tirelessly to use our voices to influence change, encourage healing, and promote thoughtful action as we move forward,\" it wrote. NFL's Minnesota Vikings also said it was saddened by the tragedy which occurred close to its stadium.  \"Everyone in our community deserves the right to feel protected and safe,\" a statement posted on Twitter read.\"Our thoughts are with the George Floyd family and all individuals who have been affected by this tragedy.\"Homero De La Fuente contributed to this report.",

I want that again, very soon,\" Ricciardo told CNN World Sport's Amanda Davies.He might occasionally feel a bit lonely, but if the Renault driver's Instagram account -- he's got 3.1 million followers -- is anything to go by he's also been having a lot of fun in the outback. The Australian has been posting content of himself riding a motorbike into the house, running around doing his own version of parkour and driving his off-road buggy.\"There have been discussions already from a few years back.

So that's certainly something I truly believe has helped.\"The family farm includes sheep, cows and alpacas and the F1 driver has posted images of himself getting close to the animals -- though not too close. \"I had every intention one morning to shear, shear sheep,\" reveals Ricciardo. \"So I saw our caretaker do it, and I wasn't filled with a whole lot of confidence in myself.\"So I pulled a pin in that one and haven't returned since. I'm taking photos that's all. I love them but I just don't show the love too much because I don't really get close enough to them.\"It's not just in Australia that Ricciardo has shown a love of farming ... In October 2016 he worked as a ranch hand for a day during previews ahead of the United States Formula One Grand Prix at Circuit of The Americas in Austin. While his work on the farm has been limited -- \"I'm not gonna claim that I'm very good at operating the machines but I do kind of get out there and dig holes and stuff\" -- Ricciardo's workouts have been extensive.The Australian has got creative with his surroundings to stay in shape while the F1 season is on hiatus. He's embraced waving battle ropes, flipping tyres and even lifting mechanical equipment such as gearboxes.\"If you're kind of in a gym all the time and running on a treadmill, no one enjoys that after a while,\" says the Australian. \"It becomes monotonous. Even just being creative with the workouts has made them much more tolerable.\"Ricciardo's family farm includes sheep, cows and alpacas.

Throughout his career the 30-year-old Australian has continually been linked with a move to the Italian team.\"There have been discussions already from a few years back. And that continued all the way through to now,\" said Ricciardo. \"So yeah, I won't deny that. But obviously it's never really come to fruition.\"Both of Ricciardo's parents are of Italian descent. His father was born in Italy and his Australian mother was born to Italian parents. But he's not sure why he has never joined the Maranello-based team. \"I don't know actually and I've never really chose to dive too deep into it. Everyone says it would be a good fit, obviously, with my name and all the background stuff, but yeah, I try not to get emotionally caught up in any kind of situation.\"I see how Carlos is a fit for the team.

And I can't actually give you a black and white answer. There wasn't any moment, which was like a light bulb and said, 'Yes, that's what I need to do.' Equally, there wasn't something I saw in McLaren, which created that or there wasn't something in Renault, which created the moment of 'I have to move on.'\"The discussions with McLaren go back to even before, I guess, 2018, and I guess continued over time.\"Obviously it's not an overnight decision.

We're obviously all experienced and professional.

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK government is mulling giving greater visiting rights to certain Hong Kong residents, unless the Chinese government suspends a controversial proposed national security law. Such a move could make it easier for those residents to one day apply for UK citizenship.The offer would apply only to Hong Kongers who possess a document known as the British National Overseas (BNO) passport, which was granted to residents who registered for it prior to Britain handing Hong Kong back to China in 1997. More than 314,000 BNO holders reside in the semi-autonomous territory, according to the Home Office. Their status currently entitles them to seek consular assistance from the UK, but is not equivalent to British citizenship.On Thursday, Britain's Home Office Secretary, Priti Patel, said she and the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab were exploring ways to provide more rights for BNO passport holders, including extending a \"path to citizenship.\" China approves controversial national security law for Hong Kong\"Deeply concerned at China's proposals for legislation related to national security in Hong Kong,\" Patel wrote on Twitter. \"If imposed, @DominicRaab & I will explore options for a path to citizenship for BNO passport holders. UK will continue to defend the rights & freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.\"Read MoreIt followed an announcement by Raab earlier on Thursday in which he told the British press that greater visa rights were in the cards for BNO passport holders. \"In relation to BNO passport holders, as you know, currently they only have the right to come to the UK for six months. If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will change that status,\" he said. \"We will remove that six-month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship,\" he added.The offer has been welcomed by a broad range of Conservative lawmakers and the opposition Labour Party. Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, called it \"an important first step in fulfilling our longstanding obligation to the people of Hong Kong,\" in a statement. She added that it reflected \"the seriousness of the threat posed by China's approval of new national security legislation earlier today.\"It is an unexpected move from the British government, which has been vowing to end the free movement of European citizens and introduce a new points-based immigration system.Widespread condemnationChina's proposed national security law has been met with protests in Hong Kong and criticism internationally. Observers warn that it could curtail many of the fundamental civil liberties guaranteed in the transition from British to Chinese rule. The sweeping proposed legislation, which was approved by China's legislature on Thursday, bans secession, subversion of state power, terrorism, foreign intervention and allows mainland China's state security agencies to operate in Hong Kong. US warship again challenges China's South China Sea claimsOnce the law has been drafted, it will implemented upon promulgation by the Hong Kong government, bypassing the city's legislature via a rarely-enacted constitutional backdoor.In a video shared on Twitter, UK's Foreign Secretary Raab urged China to \"step back from the brink and to live up to its international obligations.\"China's move to assert greater control in Hong Kong has also mounted tensions between Beijing and Washington. Following protests in the city Wednesday in which around 300 people were arrested, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the law as a \"disastrous decision\" and \"the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms.\"He added that the country would no longer consider the global financial hub as autonomous from China for trade and economic purposes.CNN's Nectar Gan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Watford captain Troy Deeney says he has been abused both in public and online for expressing concerns about the Premier League's attempts to restart the season amid the coronavirus pandemic.Deeney told CNN Sport that people online have been wishing ill on his five-month-old baby, who was born prematurely and has breathing difficulties, while people on the street have told him to go \"back to work.\"\"I saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: 'I hope your son gets corona[virus],'\" Deeney told CNN Sport. \"That's the hard part for me. If you respond to that, people then go: 'Ah, we've got him' and they keep doing it.\"Clubs voted unanimously on Wednesday to resume contact training, stage two of the league's 'Return to Training protocol,' though the Premier League later announced that four players and staff from three clubs tested positive for Covid-19. Deeney has been one of several high-profile players to publicly question a possible resumption and says he has privately received support for his views. However, he believes the backlash he and other outspoken players have received means other footballers maybe fearful of talking about their concerns.Read More\"In a time where it's all about mental health and everyone says: 'Speak up, speak out, please speak,' Danny Rose spoke out ... and I spoke out and we just get absolutely hammered and battered for it,\" adds Deeney, referring to the England defender's comments on 'Project Restart.'\"So people see that and go: 'Woah' and it's not just us that gets it, the missus gets direct messages and you'll be walking down the street and people will be like: 'Oh, I'm at work, you go back to work.'\"READ: Here's where sports league stand on reopeningREAD: La Liga stars get go ahead to resume play early next monthJUST WATCHEDBehind the gradual return of global sportReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBehind the gradual return of global sport 03:19Messages of supportWith Watford siting precariously near the bottom of the Premier League, Deeney says much of the criticism he received was accusations of wanting the season to be canceled so his club could avoid relegation.However, once players from teams at the top of the league -- including Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero and Chelsea's N'Golo Kante -- began voicing their concerns, Deeney felt public opinion began to change.\"Personally, I just think this is showing me that the players have so much power if they actually all came together,\" he says. \"That's what this is showing me. I've had a lot of messages of support from people that I wouldn't normally -- well, that I didn't even know had my number for a start. \"But certainly from players from bigger clubs and that shows me that I must be doing something right because I'm just a little old Troy from Watford and everyone seems to listen to what I say.\"Since he first spoke out, much of the narrative has been framed as 'Deeney vs. the Premier League' but the striker speaks highly of how the organization has tried to allay his fears.Deeney says he has now had \"four or five\" meetings with the Premier League -- some productive, others \"heated.\"\"I just think my concerns were purely for family reasons,\" explains Deeney, referring to his young son. \"I needed more questions answered with a bit more authority and, at the start, they couldn't really do that, but not for any reason or want [of trying], it was just because they didn't have the information.Deeney says players are worried about going public due a potential backlash.\"I think everyone can appreciate everything that the Premier League is trying to do as well. I don't think it's a pure neglect of: 'We're going back to work and get on board or [else],' it's nothing like that. They have very good lines of communication.\"These meetings don't stay too safe -- there's some frustrating conversations. When somebody said I'm at the same risk of getting coronavirus by playing football or going to the supermarket, I said: 'I've never had to jump for a header while picking up a cucumber.'\"But then there's also been some really good ones as well.\"Deeney says he has also been speaking to Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the UK government's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, who has been providing more information on the statistics which show people from minority backgrounds are disproportionately affected by Covid-19.\"He's been doing very, very good research and there is a lot of good will on his part to tell me, ultimately, that I'm going to be looked after as best as they can and, ultimately, there is going to be some form of risk for all of us going back to work,\" Deeney says. \"Lockdown [ending] and the social distancing measures coming down mean people will still always have risk.\" Premier League integrity 'already gone'Deeney's Watford is the only team to have beaten Liverpool in the Premier League this season, winning 3-0 at the end of February to end what many thought would be just the second undefeated season after Arsenal's 'Invincibles.'Before the coronavirus pandemic brought the season to a halt, Liverpool boasted an insurmountable 25-lead at the top of the table and was just two wins away from securing a first top-flight title for 30 years.Watford stunned Liverpool to inflict the Reds' first defeat of the Premier League season.Regardless of what happens to the remainder of this campaign, Deeney believes Jurgen Klopp's side should be crowned champion but also sympathizes with how the circumstances of any potential title win are likely to be remembered.\"I believe that when it comes to the integrity of this season anyway, it's already gone,\" Deeney says. \"I feel sorry for Liverpool because no matter how it plays out, they deserve to win the league. They deserve to get the trophy. \"But no matter how it plays out, even if we play all the games, it's still going to be the year spoiled by the pandemic. It's not going to be that year that Liverpool won the league being the best team and, you know, it's 30 years they haven't won for. \"So I do feel sorry for Liverpool and their players and Jordan [Henderson], but in terms of integrity, there's no way you could say that this is a viable competition,\" added Deeney, referring to the Liverpool captain.\"It's like running a marathon, 20 odd miles, stopping for two months and then sprinting the last bit and going: 'Ah, that was a good time that.'\"JUST WATCHEDEdwin van der Sar: 'Extremely harsh' if Liverpool don't win Premier LeagueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEdwin van der Sar: 'Extremely harsh' if Liverpool don't win Premier League 04:04'Thrown under the bus'At the start of April, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock gave an answer during the daily coronavirus briefing in which he specifically called on Premier League players to do more during the crisis.\"I think everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers too,\" said Hancock.\"Given the sacrifices people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS, who have made the ultimate sacrifice and gone into work and caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution; take a pay cut and play their part.\"Hancock's comments played a part in Premier League players becoming a lightning rod for criticism from both the public and politicians amid the early stages of the pandemic.This was exacerbated when a number of Premier League clubs opted to use the UK government's job scheme -- intended to aid those employers most severely affected by the Covid-19 shutdown -- to help pay the wages of non-playing members of staff placed on temporary leave.\"If you remember, we got thrown under the bus by the politician here in the UK that was saying that football players need to do more to give to the NHS,\" says Deeney.

So it's the NHS, it could be anything. The politician that said that we should be doing more was posed with the question: 'Could he give up some of his money?' And he said he's gonna work harder. So that was nice to hear.\"CNN has reached out to the Department of Health and Social Care for comment but is yet to receive a response.\"At that time, it was very early into the pandemic, we were all watching the news, trying to learn about what's going on today really,\" Deeney added. \"Most of us [players] are watching it and then you see that and you're like: 'Where did that come from?'\"Less than a week after Hancock's comments, Premier League footballers announced a collective initiative called 'PlayersTogether' which would donate funds to NHS charities during the pandemic.\"And for players, even if we came out and said: 'We've all donated X amount of money,' it still wouldn't be enough,\" said Deeney.",

        "content": "Moscow  (CNN)Frontline medical workers in the US, the UK and elsewhere may face major risks in their efforts to battle the coronavirus pandemic, but they've also seen an outpouring of public appreciation. In Russia, health workers say they face fear, mistrust -- and even open hostility.Tatyana Revva, an intensive care specialist in the central district hospital of the city of Kalach-on-Don in southern Russia, shared a video in late March about equipment shortages with the Doctors Alliance, an advocacy group aligned with Russia's political opposition. After the video went viral, she said, she was summoned by local police about it.\"I was called to the police and gave a statement with a lawyer, but another statement against me was sent to the prosecutor's office,\" Revva told CNN via Skype after finishing a night shift.\n\n\n\n\nRevva said law-enforcement investigators subsequently checked the availability of PPE and ventilators at her hospital.\"But the check was carried out a month after I flagged the problems,\" she said. \"You can imagine how much had been purchased in a month after the buzz the video made.\" Read MoreRevva says she has not been fined by the police but now fears professional retaliation. Police have not responded to CNN's request for comment. The hospital administration could not immediately be reached for comment, but the hospital's chief doctor, Oleg Kumeiko, said in a March 29 statement on YouTube that the information posted online about PPE shortages was \"absolutely untrue.\"  Rumors and conspiracy theories abound in Russia about Covid-19: that the virus was invented by doctors to control society; that medical workers are hiding the true extent of the casualties from the public; or that medical personnel are falsely attributing deaths to Covid-19 to receive more money from the government.

Rabbit!' to celebrate son Archie's first birthday\"Certain days, especially certain speeches as well, when I was growing up, you definitely get a bit of anxiety about it,\" William explained, adding that he felt a need to \"get it right\" and that he was aware of certain people watching him speak. \"Weirdly the sort of thing that helped me which I didn't actually realize at the time, was... my eyesight started to sort of tail off a little bit when I got older and I didn't used to wear contacts when I was working.

View this post on Instagram           The Duke of Cambridge has met players, fans and managers from grassroots to the elite as part of #HeadsUp, a campaign to kick off the biggest ever conversation on mental health, through football. The documentary 'Football, Prince William And Our Mental Health' will be broadcast on Thursday 28 May at 20:05 BST on BBC One. In this preview of the documentary The Duke and former footballer Marvin Sordell discuss how feelings from a traumatic event can resurface when becoming a parent. #FootballPrinceWilliamAndOurMentalHealth @Heads_Together A post shared by  Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@kensingtonroyal) on May 26, 2020 at 1:44am PDT\nThe documentary, which will air Thursday evening in the UK, follows William's campaign to engage British men in the issue of mental health, using football as a way of getting them talking and breaking taboo. In the same documentary, William spoke to soccer player Marvin Sordell about the death of his mother, Diana, as part of a discussion about how becoming a parent can lead to the resurfacing of feelings from a traumatic event.Last year, the Duke of Cambridge opened up in a BBC documentary about the loss of his mother, Princess Diana, saying he felt \"pain like no other\" after her death in a car crash in 1997 when he was 15 years old. He also said British people -- particularly men -- should feel comfortable talking about mental health issues.CNN's John Sinnott contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson's embattled chief aide Dominic Cummings may indeed have broken the UK's coronavirus rules by driving to a castle town during lockdown, British police have concluded, heaping further pressure on the Prime Minister to change his position and sack his adviser. Durham Police have found following an investigation that Cummings' 26-mile drive to Barnard Castle \"might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention.\"No further police action will be taken against Cummings, and police said they did not deem him to have committed an offense by driving some 260 miles from London to Durham to relocate his family while they were self-isolating.But the announcement from police Thursday has delivered another twist in a scandal which has threatened to derail Johnson's response to the pandemic.Both Cummings and the Prime Minister had repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong by driving from London to Durham in late March, nor by visiting Barnard Castle in mid-April on their way back to London.Read MoreBoris Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings says he 'doesn't regret' 260-mile lockdown tripCummings claimed on Monday that he drove for half an hour to the town only to test his eyesight and check whether he could indeed drive safely -- a claim that was met with skepticism by critics and some lawmakers.  At the time, Johnson was urging Britons to \"stay at home,\" and government guidance allowed people to leave the house once a day for exercise but not to drive to other locations to do so.Johnson's reaction to the police announcement suggests he will not back down in his support of Cummings. \"The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr. Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations,\" a Downing Street spokesman said Thursday.\"The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr. Cummings behaved reasonably and legally, given all the circumstances, and he regards this issue as closed.\"But a growing group of lawmakers have called on Cummings -- seen by many as the architect of many of the government's policies -- to resign, and accused Johnson of undermining his own public health messaging in the middle of a pandemic. \"Boris Johnson's unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the government looking untrustworthy and unprincipled,\" Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Thursday. \"Worst of all, he's undermined the public health advice that keeps us all safe, just to keep one aide in his job. Our nation's health must come first.\"On Wednesday, Johnson said he understood the \"indignation\" the public may feel over Cummings' actions, adding: \"But I think what they want now is for us to focus on them and their needs rather than on a political ding dong about one adviser may or may not have done.\"UK suffers 'worst death rate' of any countryThe controversy has piled further scrutiny on Johnson's management of the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe.Earlier on Thursday, an analysis of excess mortality figures by the Financial Times concluded that the UK likely has the highest actual coronavirus death rate compared to countries such as Italy, Spain and the United States.The figures, which use historical data to compare total deaths beginning from mid-March, provide an estimate of actual deaths related to the coronavirus, beyond the official numbers of confirmed virus-related deaths. The estimates are considered helpful because many people who died were not tested, and not officially recorded as victims of Covid-19. The Financial Times did not disclose the specific range of dates the analysis covers.The UK has suffered more coronavirus deaths than any other country in Europe, according to official statistics.The newspaper examined mortality data available from 19 countries' national statistical agencies and found the UK emerged worst when comparing excess death data per million people.A CNN analysis of death statistics from Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland shows there has been just over 59,000 deaths in excess of the long-term average from mid-March until mid-May, which are the most recent statistics available.In response to the Financial Times analysis, a spokesperson for the UK's Department of Health and Social Care told CNN: \"Our absolute priority as we tackle this outbreak is to save lives. Although it is important to look to evidence from other countries, comparing figures directly can be misleading as different countries compile their figures in different ways with different categories of patient included.\"The numbers deliver a cold judgment on the way Johnson's government has responded to the pandemic, and come as some raise concerns about a second wave of cases as society reopens in June.Experts say it's not safe to reopen schoolsMeanwhile, on Thursday morning a leading group of experts said it would be unsafe for the government to reopen schools in England next week as planned.Johnson later confirmed at a news conference that he is pushing ahead with his plan to welcome selected year groups back to the classroom starting June 1, as part of a wider relaxation of the country's lockdown. Teachers' unions, local authorities and headteachers have raised concerns about the plan to reopen schools on Monday. The experts said schools could only safely reopen when local infection rates were low and when a \"well-functioning, coordinated, local test, track and isolate strategy\" was in place.\"We have seen no compelling evidence that these conditions have so far been met across the country. Until they are, it is not safe to open schools everywhere on June 1,\" said the report from the Independent SAGE group of scientists. The group was established by former UK chief scientific adviser David King and includes several leading scientists concerned about the advice being given to ministers.Schools will need to make these changes to protect students from coronavirus, expert saysThe report suggested that the plan to reopen schools on June 1 had not been properly vetted by the experts in the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the official body of scientists who advise the government. SAGE is not connected to the Independent SAGE group.\"The school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by SAGE, making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,\" King's group said.It also warned that the step should not be taken until more complete testing and tracing programs are up and running. \"Robust testing systems are not in place everywhere,\" the report said. \"Public adherence to social distancing is influenced by trust in the government and its messaging. This trust is increasingly strained,\" the report added.Downing Street did not respond to CNN's request for comment.Unlike England, the UK's devolved nations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will not be sending children back to school next week.CNN's Simon Cullen, Sarah Dean, Samantha Tapfumaneyi and Luke McGee contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Greatness cannot be achieved without sacrifice. While it is the fire that burns inside that fuels the brilliance, the pursuit for perfection can also torment, turning relationships to ashes and niggling at the soul. The gifted can be loved and disliked. They can achieve immortality but still be flawed. They are, after all, human. But, ultimately, their extraordinary talent overshadows everything. As Michael Jordan says in 'The Last Dance,' the wildly popular 10-part docuseries covering the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls season: \"Winning has a price and leadership has a price.\" Magnus Carlsen had just been introduced to chess by his father, Henrik, when Jordan was securing his first hat trick of NBA championships with the Bulls in the early 1990s. Still progressing through elementary school, and some years away from being described as the \"Mozart of Chess\" by the Washington Post, the young Carlsen never watched Jordan's games but, nevertheless, collected NBA cards. \"Everybody knew who Jordan was,\" Carlsen tells CNN Sport. Magnus Carlsen's next move is to launch $1 million online chess tourLike millions around the world, Carlsen has been captivated by 'The Last Dance,' which gives a courtside seat into what it took for Jordan to become the ultimate champion. Winner of six NBA championships and five MVPs, the American superstar who became a cultural icon had time for one thing: winning. In the retelling of Jordan's tumultuous final season with the Bulls and the dynasty he helped build, the audience is saddled with conflicting emotions. While his talent is awe-inspiring, his force of personality enthralling, some of the methods used to achieve excellence on the hardwood -- berating teammates, even punching one in the face -- can rankle, raising an internal monologue of questions during what is a sensationally good sports film. Read MoreBut few watching what is reportedly the most in-demand documentary in the world can relate to Jordan, except for perhaps Carlsen, himself a master of his chosen craft, a once-in-a-generation talent who is relentlessly great at his sport. \"There have been people saying in Norway 'you don't have to be an a*hole to win;' whenever they say that from now on I'll say 'go and watch Jordan' and I'm going to use it as an excuse for any questionable behavior,\" Carlsen says, a wry smile engulfing his face as he speaks from his Oslo home. \"I'm certainly somebody who is very much in that school. There are no excuses. You always have to be the best, nothing else is acceptable.\"One of basketballs all time greats and @SteveKerr\ud83d\udc9b #TheLastDance pic.twitter.com/Zi4TeDUs33\u2014 Magnus Carlsen (@MagnusCarlsen) May 18, 2020\n\nCarlsen has been the world chess champion since 2013. Aged two he was solving 50-piece jigsaw puzzles. By five he was building magnificent creations from Lego. At 13, he beat former world champion Anatoli Karpov, drew with Russian great Garry Kasparov and became a chess grandmaster.Six years later, he was the youngest chess player in history to top the world rankings. His rise was dazzling and, over the last decade, the prodigy has become one of the best there has ever been: four world titles and the highest-rated player in history. Carlsen participating in the Dubai Open chess tournament in 2004, aged 13.So, is ruthlessness, that need to win come what may, an essential trait in an all-time great? \"I think you need it,\" Carlsen answers, after a moment's reflection. Much like Jordan, it is a loathing for losing that powers Carlsen's merciless drive. The infrequency of the defeats does not soften the blow. In last month's Magnus Carlsen Invitational, an online tournament with a record total prize fund of $250,000, he lost to 16-year-old rising star Alireza Firouzja. \"It pied me off a lot,\" admits Carlsen.And on his way to beating Ding Liren, he turned the air blue as his frustrations boiled over. He is, he says, \"more human than most.\"\"When I blundered in one game there'd be a bunch of expletives coming from my mouth; I think that's a good thing,\" Carlsen says, believing that a player's freedom to be expressive makes rapidplay online chess, games which are normally completed in under an hour, more appealing to the many than the classical format. \"It's real. People have these instant reactions, which you cannot actually have when you're at the board,\" he says. \"There must be room to be yourself and I'm a super competitive person, and when I mess up in a way I shouldn't, that bites at me and there's really nothing wrong with expressing that. It's just part of who I am. \"You can like it, or you don't like it. It's authentic and that's the most important thing.\"People have been saying that's a good and bad thing about me. My emotions are usually outside my body. That's not what you usually connect to a chess player in general, but that's the way that I am.\"Firouzja (L) against Carlsen during the ninth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands.In 2010, Kasparov -- the world chess champion from 1985 to 2000 who was once Carlsen's coach -- told Time magazine: \"Before he is done, Carlsen will have changed our ancient game considerably.\"Still in his 20s, Carlsen's impact on the game has been sizable, leading to modeling assignments with G-star, a deal with Porsche and his own app. All have contributed to his multi-million-dollar fortune.For half his life, the Norwegian has been accustomed to traveling the world for around 200 days a year, so these last few months in Oslo are the longest he has spent at home since childhood.And while Carlsen's daily life during the global pandemic has not changed significantly -- \"I play chess for a living,\" he says all furrow-browed -- it has given him the opportunity to pause, and the consequence of that may indeed lead to a shake up of the ancient game. The pandemic has provided Carlsen with the opportunity to put into practice his vision of making chess more interesting to the masses, in a time when sport has stalled and most of the world is dealing with devastation and unpredictability. Magnus Carlsen beats Fabiano Caruana to win World Chess ChampionshipEarlier this month, he launched The Carlsen Tour, a $1 million series of online tournaments in which he will compete, providing hours of entertainment for chess fans until August. The first event was the Carlsen Invitational, a final reportedly watched by an online audience calculated at over 115,000, and the second the Lindores Abbey Challenge, which is happening now.His aim, Carlsen says, is to \"ensure chess players can have a livelihood,\" while also giving chess fans \"something to look forward to.\" He would be surprised, he says, were he to play over-the-board chess this year. \"I suspect next year there will be some sort of return to normality, but who knows, I'm not banking on it,\" says Carlsen. Perhaps it will come as no surprise to hear him call his eponymous 16-day online tournament, which involved eight top-ranked players, as an \"instant hit,\" but he has not been the only one to praise the format. Earlier this month UK newspaper, The Guardian, wrote that the tournament \"proved a revelation,\" magnifying mistakes and intensifying the pressure. It is also significant that the Norwegian describes his win over Hikaru Nakamara, the world's top-rated blitz player, in the final as his most satisfying victory for a while. Carlsen holds his trophy up after beating Fabiano Caruana to regain his World Chess Championship title on November 28, 2018 in London.\"It was really hard,\" he explains. \"The final two matches were both really close and I felt I was challenged in a way I haven't been too often in rapid and blitz chess. \"We can take from [the Invitational] two things, both that fast time control and the match format, that it's this one-on-one combat, [and] both of them worked pretty well.\"The first couple of days took some getting used to but after that I was fully focused and there were no worries and, also, for most of the time I had the thumbnail video of my opponent in the corner of the screen so I could see my opponent and see their facial expressions, so that made it more real.\"You can actually see some of what they're thinking and that's also something that people appreciate while watching.\"Ending two days before the start of the Online Nations Cup, a competition run by governing body FIDE which Carlsen did not participate in, the timing of the Invitational raised some eyebrows. In interviews last month, Carlsen said there were no issues between himself and FIDE. Carlsen describes himself as a \"sports nut\" and says he has missed not being able to watch live football these last few months. Following his 2018 world title win over Fabiano Caruana, Carlsen told the assembled media in London that had he lost he would probably never play a world championship match again. Had he bowed out, the impact on the world of chess would have been akin to Jordan abruptly retiring from basketball while in his prime nearly three decades ago. But now there is no talk from Carlsen of prematurely quitting any format of the sport. For as long as his computerized brain allows him to flatten opponents, he will continue to set the standard. Fabiano Caruana -- the American helping make chess cool \"I just enjoy the game so much,\" he says. \"[I] enjoy winning every time, hate losing every time that happens. I'm eager to keep going.\"There are moments when I'm thinking, 'I've done this before, why am I doing it again' but they are few and far between and that doesn't happen much at all. \"I feel like my top level is still the very best in the world. The fact that I'm vulnerable on my bad days speaks to how good the others have become. \"I'm just motivated and love to play the game. As long as I feel like I'm still top of my game and I continue to win, I don't see one reason to quit.\"",

It makes no difference to the relentless way Bayern collect Bundesliga titles and the Baverian club is on the verge of yet another after a 1-0 victory over rivals Borussia Dortmund.The result leaves Bayern Munich with a seven-point lead at the top of the table and within sight of being crowned German champions for an eighth successive season. It would need to drop points in at least three of their remaining six matches and that would require a vulnerability that Bayern almost never show.READ: Footballers emerge from lockdown with some unexpected new looksRead MoreJoshua Kimmich (center) celebrates scoring against Borussia Dortmund with his teammates.Joshua Kimmich scored the crucial goal, shortly before half-time, with his deft chip from outside the Dortmund penalty area beating keeper Roman B\u00fcrki. It was a sublime touch for a defensive midfielder and one that we instead might have expected to see from one of the two star strikers who started the game.This had been billed as a showdown between Bayern's Robert Lewandowski and Dortmund's Erling Braut Haaland. Lewandowski, the experienced and prolific former Dortmund forward, is the Bundesliga's leading scorer. Haaland, the teenage phenomenon, is coveted by some of the biggest clubs on the planet for his pace, strength and goal scoring prowess.Yet neither found the back of the net in this game -- although Lewandowski did see a deflected shot hit the post in the second half -- and Haaland's match ended early when he limped off twenty minutes from the end.Borussia Dortmund versus Bayern Munich was, unquestionably, the most significant event since some top level sport has resumed after the coronavirus disruption. Germany's two leading football teams in a match that could all but decide the fate of this season's Bundesliga title.Players observe a minute of silence for the victims of the coronavirus before the German first division Bundesliga soccer match Borussia Dortmund and FC Bayern Munich.The viewing figures could be interesting in light of the historic numbers recorded by \"The Match II\" last weekend. If what was, effectively, a charity golf contest could attract the sport's largest cable TV audience ever, then how many more would tune into German football's biggest rivalry at a crucial stage of the championship race? Here in the UK, we already know that UK broadcaster BT Sport recorded a fivefold increase on their previous best performing Bundesliga match for Dortmund's match last weekend.Late season encounters between Bayern and Dortmund have been one-way traffic in recent seasons. The Munich team winning the last three such games by an aggregate of 15 goals to one.Yet, this game looked like it might be different as Dortmund began brightly -- even getting the ball in the net in the 10th minute, although the goal was disallowed for offside. Manuel Neuer in action during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich.As the match wore on, Bayern's dominance increased and, after Kimmich's goal, it was hard to see any other winner. Maybe even Dortmund believed it because there was no protest in the second half when TV replays showed a shot from Haaland had struck the arm of Bayern defender Jerome Boateng. The VAR officials were silent, like the rest of the Signal Iduna Park, and there was no penalty.Dortmund's cause wasn't helped by its unusually quiet stadium. Their cavernous stadium echoing only to the sound of the players' shouts and the ball pinging from boot to boot, instead of the usual wall of noise created by 80,000 fans. Spectators are still banned to eliminate the health risk that would be posed by a combination of Covid-19 and large crowds.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosFor the neutral fan and sports followers across the globe, so starved of top flight action right now, Bayern's victory could be viewed as a disappointment. For some, it could make the rest of the Bundesliga season just that little bit less enticing.",

        "content": "(CNN)For some footballers, how they look on the pitch is almost as important as how they play. Many players have their own celebrity hairdressers, while others even fly their favorite barbers to team camps during international competitions.So, with hairdressers across the world having been closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic, how have players been coping without a regular professional trim?After returning to training at their clubs in recent weeks, certain footballers have shown their barbers are worth their weight in gold.

        "content": "(CNN)It was a mouth-watering prospect for sports-starved fans everywhere. Four of the greatest athletes the world has ever known, on the golf course at the same time, offering us a glimpse of who they are when they aren't winning Major Championships and Super Bowl trophies. On Sunday at Medalist Golf Club in Florida, Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning faced off against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady in \"The Match: Champions for Charity.\" The goal was to raise more than $10 million for Covid-19-related causes which provide relief for frontline workers, small businesses, and those in desperate need of food as a result of the pandemic.Mother Nature didn't play by the rules early on. Torrential rain at the start of the event dampened the excitement and limited the trash talk but, to the players' credit, the weather didn't deter them from the job at hand. Proof that the greatest don't become great without learning how to navigate adversity. Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning win 'Champions for Charity' golf matchWithin the first 30 minutes of the broadcast, more than $1.5 million in additional charitable donations had been raised. Millions tuned in hoping to get inside the minds of the illustrious foursome. Woods and Mickelson are familiar foes, with Woods besting his compatriot over the majority of their respective careers. Manning went 6-11 against Brady during his time in the NFL. Read MoreThe quarterbacks were nervous to start and found it difficult on one of the toughest courses in the country. Woods debuted his signature Sunday red at his home golf course. He came into 'The Match' with hundreds of rounds at the private club under his belt, and his experience showed. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosWoods and Manning read a putt on the sixth green during The Match: Champions For Charity at Medalist Golf Club.Woods' ease was delightfully juxtaposed by the play of the greatest quarterback in the history of American football, Tom Brady, who quickly became the focal point through the first nine holes. The ultra-exclusive, and incredibly challenging, Medalist made the otherworldly quarterback look refreshingly human, as he struggled to find the fairway. Brady was the butt of the joke (quite literally when his pants split down the back) until the six-time Super Bowl winner holed-out from the fairway on the Par-5 7th hole in the greatest moment of the event. Eli Manning joined Twitter, and was immediately made fun of by Tom BradyTo be fair, Brady has had less time to practice his swing than Manning, who is good friends with Woods and has played multiple rounds at the venue in the past. Known for his maniacal preparation, Woods joked earlier in the week that Manning approached the contest like he was playing Brady and the rest of the New England Patriots, relentlessly sending Woods different videos of his game, asking for things to work on, and requesting drills from golf's greatest player to make sure he was ready to go. The homework seemed to pay off, as Manning was masterful on the par 3's with his irons and stayed consistent for the majority of the day. For golf enthusiasts craving quality insights, Mickelson committed to narrating the day in detail. He used the cameras mounted to the players personalized golf carts to his advantage -- providing constant feedback and urging much needed dialogue between the competitors.Later, Mickelson also proved to be a valuable coach to his teammate, walking him through each putt and trying to keep his confidence up while the NFL star struggled. As expected, Charles Barkley was an asset to the broadcast, most notably in prompting trash talk between the foursome. His natural curiosity and affable personality brought the best out of the high-profile athletes. Mickelson and Brady on the 13th green.\"I've learned something through this pandemic, we need sports, man,\" Barkley told CNN last week. \"Are they the most important thing in the world? Not even close. But the one thing they do, they take your mind off of all the other stuff going on in the world.\" The back-nine featured an alternate-shot format and, after a beautiful drive off the tee on the par 4 11th from Mickelson, Brady finished the hole with an eagle putt to get the duo back in the game. The pair punctuated their celebration with an \"air high-five,\" a brief but stark reminder of why they were there in the first place -- to help those affected most by the coronavirus.\"There are so many people struggling all over the world. I was born in South Africa and I'm always paying attention to the events that are happening around the world, particularly in South Africa where I'm from,\" said 2008 Masters Champion Trevor Immelman, who was Barkley's co-analyst.President Trump praises live golf event and says sport returning is good for country's 'psyche'\"This pandemic has been so brutal for so many people globally. I've always been struck by how Americans are willing to jump behind a charity. They are willing to jump in and raise funds for people that are struggling. It never ceases to amaze me how great Americans are at doing that. At the end of the day, you've got $10 million-plus dollars being raised in a single afternoon.\"As millions of dollars continued to pour in from celebrity donations and corporate contributions, the rain came again midway through the back nine. In an engaging twist, it seemed to add to the drama, with the competitive fire between the four superstars burning brightest in the final few holes.  The intensity picked up on the par-3 16th, with a big putt from Mickelson cutting Woods and Peyton's lead to one. In the end, the event ended as many thought it might -- with the putter in Woods' hand on 18 to seal the win for him and Manning. Despite less than ideal playing conditions, the broadcast found a way to showcase some great trash talk, highlight a strong competitive undertone, and raise a total of $20 million for charity. All things considered, the event was a rain-soaked success. \"Knowing that $20 million was raised is amazing,\" Manning told TNT after the event. \"It was an honor to be invited to this, and it's something I will always remember and cherish.\"",

Werner -- reportedly a transfer target of Premier League leader Liverpool -- netted three goals when Leipzig hammered Mainz 8-0 in November and got three more in Sunday's 5-0 away victory that kept his side's slim title hopes alive. Leipzig moved to within seven points of table-topping Bayern Munich -- which downed Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 on Saturday -- after dropping two points against Freiburg last weekend. It is the second weekend of action in the Bundesliga, which was the first major sporting league to resume amid the global coronavirus pandemic. Werner ended a spell of four games without scoring and increased his league tally to 24 goals, second only to Bayern Munich talisman Robert Lewandowski's 27. Timo Werner (middle) scored three goals for Leipzig Sunday against Mainz. Read MoreIn truth it could have been worse for relegation threatened Mainz. Yussuf Poulsen missed a sitter after Werner's pass in the first half and Christopher Nkunku dragged his shot wide when in alone on keeper Florian Muller, also in the first half.Poulsen, though, did score earlier. It was hardly an upset given their respective places in the standings, but since the German top division returned last week following a two-month stoppage, home teams overall have found it difficult playing with no fans.They have won three of 18 matches, losing 10 times. Earlier Sunday, eighth-place Schalke fell 3-0 at home to Augsburg, which had been in the bottom five, and in the late kickoff Koln needed goals in the 88st and 91st minutes to salvage a draw at home against third-last Dusseldorf.

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson has refused to sack Dominic Cummings, standing by his embattled chief aide despite a growing scandal in the UK over his reported decision to break lockdown restrictions multiple times.The Prime Minister said that Cummings had \"no alternative\" but to drive 260 miles across England to stay with his parents while his wife was sick with Covid-19 symptoms, insisting he acted \"responsibly, legally and with integrity.\"\"I think he followed the instincts of every father and every parent, and I do not mark him down for that,\" Johnson added at the government's daily coronavirus briefing on Sunday.Cummings' movements during lockdown have sparked a scandal in Britain, quickly becoming a defining moment in the country's much-scrutinized response to the coronavirus pandemic and threatening to undermine the restrictions Johnson has spent eight weeks pleading with Britons to follow.But Johnson resisted growing political pressure to sack Cummings, batting back accusations from across the political spectrum that he has allowed his aides to disobey the rules.Read MoreHe sidestepped reports that Cummings subsequently returned to the north of England on multiple other occasions, saying only that he has \"looked at them carefully\" and was \"content that (Cummings) behaved responsibly\" and with the intention of stopping the spread of the virus.Johnson left many questions unanswered -- including whether Cummings visited a town 30 miles away from his parents' home, as witnesses have said he did, and whether he knew that Cummings was leaving London.Ministers have spent much of the weekend loyally defending Cummings, the enigmatic aide often portrayed as the mastermind behind Johnson's premiership, after reports of the first journey emerged.But Cummings' position became more perilous still on Sunday, after fresh claims emerged that he had in fact broken the UK's coronavirus lockdown on multiple occasions throughout April. Johnson's refusal to let Cummings go ensures the controversy will continue to overshadow the country's coronavirus response in the coming days.'Enough is enough'Johnson's response will do little to appease critics, who have been asking why Cummings needed to drive across England to find childcare despite being healthy and free of Covid-19 symptoms. \"Boris Johnson just insulted every person in this country who has made sacrifices to follow the rules he implemented to save lives in this pandemic,\" the Labour Party's shadow justice minister David Lammy said during Johnson's briefing.The Prime Minister said he has had \"extensive\" conversations with Cummings on Sunday, insisting that \"Mr Cummings did isolate for 14 days or more,\" even if it was not at his London home.The uproar over Cummings' behavior began on Friday evening when two newspapers, The Guardian and the Daily Mirror, revealed he had traveled from London to Durham to stay at his parents' property at the end of March while his wife had coronavirus symptoms. The journey appeared a clear breach of the UK's lockdown, with Cummings' boss Johnson repeatedly urging the public to \"stay at home\" and \"save lives,\" and has dominated front pages in the country throughout the weekend.Cummings (left) has been considered the controversial figure behind Johnson's premiership.But ministers have stood by the aide, insisting he needed his parents to care for his child in case Cummings also became sick with symptoms, which he later did. \"Caring for your wife and child is not a crime,\" minister Michael Gove tweeted, one of a number of leading government figures to claim the lockdown allowed for such trips.It marked a notable shift from previous episodes regarding the lockdown. When leading epidemiologist Neil Ferguson was forced to resign from the scientific body advising the government for breaching lockdown, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was left speechless by the \"extraordinary\" breach. On Saturday, Hancock said Cummings' trip was \"entirely right.\"That defense was bruised on Sunday, after the same papers dropped new details alleging Cummings had been seen in the Durham area on multiple occasions after his initial trip. Downing Street has rebutted the subsequent claims, saying in a statement that they \"will not waste our time answering a stream of false allegations about Mr. Cummings from campaigning newspapers.\"Related coverageSunday's live coronavirus updatesThe lockdown is disastrous for womenThe pandemic could reshape the world orderBritain braces for a recessionCummings' influence over ministers is well documented in the British political press, but Downing Street's approach is no longer being followed by several of Johnson's own backbenchers, who one by one began to call on Cummings to go on Sunday.\"Enough is enough,\" Conservative lawmaker Steve Baker wrote in an opinion piece for The Critic website. \"Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the Government, the Prime Minister, our institutions or the Conservative Party.\"And concerns have been raised that the government's defense of Cummings' behavior has given implicit permission to the public to interpret the lockdown rules however they see fit.\"There cannot be one rule for Dominic Cummings and another for the British people,\" the opposition Labour Party said in a statement. A scandal at the end of a torrid weekThe timing of the controversy is particularly unfortunate for the Prime Minister, who has overseen the deadliest Covid-19 outbreak in Europe and who was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on a controversial fee for immigrant health care workers just days earlier.On Thursday the Prime Minister was forced into his first major policy U-turn since winning a sizable majority in December's general election, agreeing to scrap a heavily criticized fee that overseas NHS and health care workers were forced to pay while simultaneously working on the front lines of the country's coronavirus battle.\"We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next,\" said Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is proving a formidable opponent to Johnson as he settles into the position he took over in April. Starmer was referring to the weekly round of applause for health workers that Britons have been taking part in.Remember Brexit? Why Britain could really struggle to dig itself out of recessionJohnson had defended the surcharge as late as Wednesday, telling MPs \"we must look at the realities\" and insisting the fee was \"the right way forward\" to provide the NHS with funding.But by Thursday the policy was gone, amid growing discontent among Tory backbenchers. The change in tone added to the criticism Johnson has faced over the NHS, with opponents pointing to a lack in personal protective equipment (PPE) and a slow rate of testing.Throughout the controversies, Britain's death toll has continued to climb. Though it is well past its peak of cases and deaths, the country has seen more fatalities from Covid-19 than any other country in Europe, with more than 36,000 in total.The country is entering its final week under the current phase of lockdown. From June 1, the government will look to lift certain restrictions as it paves a way back towards normality. CNN's Simon Cullen and Sarah Dean contributed reporting.",

Golf titans Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson are set to partner up with NFL superstars Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in a charity golf match which will raise money for the fight against coronavirus.Dubbed 'The Match: Champions for Charity', Sunday's clash will be a rematch of Woods' televised clash with Mickelson in 2018, but this time with the added interest of two of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game. WarnerMedia (the parent company of CNN) has joined forces with the players to donate $10 million to local and national causes with more fundraising challenges expected throughout the day.\"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unimaginable tragedy and heartbreak,\" said Jeff Zucker, Chairman of WarnerMedia News and Sports.  Read More\"We're hopeful this event and platform will help raise meaningful funding for Covid-19 relief, while also providing a source of brief distraction and entertainment for all sports fans.\"The US currently has 1,577,758 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 94,729 deaths, according to the latest data.      READ: Tiger Woods says his kids don't talk about his Masters winBehind closed doorsThe showcase match will take place at the Medalist Golf Club in Florida, US, but will be played behind closed doors amid the pandemic. The prestigious venue is all too familiar for Woods, who regularly practices at the course, giving the American a potential advantage ahead of the weekend. He will partner with Manning to take on Mickelson and Brady over 18-holes -- the front nine in a four-ball format and the back nine in a modified alternate shot format.Players will not be allowed their usual caddies but will be able to ride in their own carts.The four athletes boast an impressive 20 golf majors and eight Super Bowls between them and have enjoyed healthy rivalries with one another. Woods and Mickelson have been two of the biggest names in men's golf over the past two decades and were known to have a frosty relationship earlier in their competitive heyday, but that has turned into a much friendlier rivalry over time.Woods, 44, has won a staggering 15 majors throughout his roller coaster career and is tied for the most PGA Tour events (82). Meanwhile, 49-year-old Mickelson has won 44 tour events, including five major championships.      READ: Tiger Woods' son is good at golf, but video poses wider questionsTrash talkThe elder of the two may not have won as much in his career, but he does hold the bragging rights from their last $9 million match and has been quick to bring it to his rival's attention. \"This is the trophy for 'The Match' I don't know Tiger if you know what this looks like, you might have caught a glimpse, but that's actually what the trophy looks like had you have won,\" laughed Mickelson, pointing toward his trophy during a video call between all four men on Bleacher Report.Not to be outdone, Woods hit back by donning the famous green jacket that he won at last year's Masters. Similarly, Brady and Manning were pitted against each other throughout their respective playing careers and the two amateur golfers have shared fighting talk in the buildup.\"I will be ready partner! I sensed fear in their eyes yesterday!!\" Brady wrote on Twitter, responding to a tweet from Mickelson. Whilst Manning retired in 2016, Brady recently joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after spending 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, winning six of the nine Super Bowls he reached.During illustrious spells at the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos, Manning won two Super Bowls and retired as the NFL's all-time leader in passing touchdowns and yards. Both NFL legends are avid golfers and are relishing the chance to play with their heroes.\"I think that the ability to do good and help others is at the core of what this was all about,\" said Brady.\"The fact that I get an opportunity to go play golf with three of the guys that I've always looked up to in sports is something that I certainly couldn't turn down.\"The trash-talking has already begun ahead of Sunday's clash. 'We need sports'NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley will be one of the guest commentators on the day and is looking forward to seeing sport return to the screen. Professional golf has been put on hold throughout the pandemic but the PGA Tour is expected to resume behind closed doors on June 11.\"Without sports all we have to do is talk about reality. Obviously right now reality isn't great for everybody,\" Barkley told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"It's going to be awesome. You have four of the greatest athletes in the history of sports.\" \"We need sports. Are they the most important things in the world? Not even close. But the one thing they do is they take your mind off all the other [things] that are going on in the world.

They say there are no prizes for second place; that's not entirely true, but a silver medal isn't much of a consolation. The losers would often prefer to be forgotten. But if there is to be a fate worse than finishing as the runner-up, it's being remembered only because you blew it, choked, snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. The history books of sport are littered with many such examples. Golf can be particularly cruel; just think of Greg Norman's epic collapse in the 1996 Masters or the hapless Jean van de Velde at the 1999 Open Championship, where he threw away a three-shot lead on the very last hole. Such calamities can define a career or even shape the identity of a city.

Seven of Milan's starting 11 had won the Champions League just two years previously.Brazilians Cafu, Dida and Kaka were all World Cup winners, while the following summer, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Alessandro Nesta would be world champions with Italy.Ukrainian striker Andriy Schevchenko was the 2004 Ballon d'Or winner, arguably the greatest individual recognition in the game and an honor that Kaka would later claim in 2007. Captain Paolo Maldini was a Milan and Italy legend, regarded as one of the best defenders in the history of the game and a player who'd won four of his five European Cups by the time of this game. \"The team was spectacular,\" lifelong Milan Paolo Agostinelli, who had tickets to the game in Istanbul, but had to cancel his trip at short notice, told CNN Sport. Nonetheless, as he tuned in to watch the game on television, he expected only one result, \"I was positive that we would have won that match, I was confident. I was very confident.\" Paolo Agostinelli, right, is pictured with his father and son.READ: From footballer to Netflix superstar: How Jesus Mosquera became one of Spain's top actorsThe reason for such heady optimism wasn't just Milan's galaxy of stars; it was the perceived weakness of the opposition. Though Liverpool had once dominated the English league and European competitions, such success was -- by that time -- a rather distant memory.In 2005, Liverpool's domestic performance in the Premier League was so poor that they hadn't even qualified for the next Champions League season. They'd finished fifth. Milan's starting 11 was a who's who of international football; Liverpool's team was more of a 'who are you?' In the 20 years since Liverpool had even played in the European Cup final, AC Milan had won it four times. Granted, Liverpool's ambitions were hampered by UEFA's five-year ban for all English teams after the Heysel Stadium disaster, but regardless -- they'd been absent from the top table for a long time. On the eve of the game, the teams made their case to the international media. Maldini was compelling; \"History counts and in recent years, Milan has always been at this level.\" Liverpool's first-year manager Rafael Benitez told the assembled press that he was hoping for an early goal, but Maldini volleying the ball into the back of the net after just 50 seconds was not quite the early strike that he had in mind. As Paolo Agostinelli remembers it, \"We were playing fabulous football, the team was confident and everything was fine and then Maldini scored. That was a sign of destiny. Maldini never scores.\" Milan were purring; their Brazilian goalkeeper Dida chuckled when CNN asked him recently if he had much to do in the first half: \"Honestly not much,\" he admitted. \"The concentration and focus of the team were extremely high.\" By halftime, a couple of goals from Hernan Crespo had given the Italians a 3-0 lead. It was a lead that seemed insurmountable.

Founder of the Gallipoli supporters club in 1984, he's a lifelong Milan supporter, estimating that he's been to some 400 games. He's watched them lift the European cup in Madrid, Barcelona, Vienna, twice in Athens and also Manchester.\"It was a great first half; the supporters asked me to unveil our celebratory banners.\" But then, in the second half, \"something unreal happened.\" AC Milan fan Antonio Greco.What happened next has become the stuff of legend in Liverpool. As the teams left the field for the fifteen-minute interval, it was hard to tell which team was losing. The supporters at the Liverpool end of the Atat\u00fcrk Stadium defiantly held their scarves aloft, serenading their heroes with hymns of praise and the spine-tingling 'You'll Never Walk Alone.' The Liverpool players could hear it from their dressing room, and defender Sami Hyypia told CNN\" \"Maybe that gave us a little bit of strength. Rafa Benitez just said, 'Look boys, it can't continue like this. We have to give the fans something to cheer about in the second half.' He was quite calm.\" Across the hall, the Milan team was also calm, or tranquillo, as Dida put it: \"Our trainer Carlo Ancelotti was tranquil; he didn't say much to us, but he said that we still had to put in all our efforts because there were still 45 minutes left. Therefore, we knew that we still had to make an effort.\" Football is a sport littered with clich\u00e9s, but rarely has there ever been such a 'game of two halves.'

Milan were rattled, and so were their fans. Back home in Italy, Agostinelli said that he'd stopped paying attention during halftime. His friend -- a Juventus supporter -- asked if they even really needed to watch the second half. But when Liverpool began scoring, the television had his attention again. \"I was petrified. I had a feeling of something sinister going up and down my back.\" Within just 15 minutes of the restart and only six minutes after Liverpool's first goal, the game, incredibly, was tied at 3-3. Dida saved a penalty from Xabi Alonso, but the Spaniard followed up on the rebound to score the equalizer. Watching in disbelief from Milan, Agostinelli said, \"When I saw that Dida had made the save, but it still wasn't enough, in that very moment, I knew this was lost.\" Inside the stadium, Milan's supporters were witnessing an epic collapse and an extreme shift of emotions. Greco was trying to process what he'd just witnessed, he told telling CNN, \"I was shocked, literally. I couldn't stand anymore and my first thought was to get to the airport and go back home as soon as possible.\" When you ask players from both sides what happened, none are really able to explain it.Dida described the anxiety creeping in, but felt they still had \"the ability to do more in the game; we had the strikers, we had the strength in our legs. Even though it was 3-3, we still thought we could win the match.\" Istanbul, Turkey:  Liverpool's captain Steven Gerrard kisses the throphy surrounded by teammates at the end of the UEFA Champions league football final AC Milan vs Liverpool, 25 May 2005 at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul. 'A terrible evening'Level after 90 minutes, the game went to an extra period of half an hour; but with the drama of a penalty shootout looming, Milan still had one last chance.It fell to their exceptional striker Schevchenko, but he was twice brilliantly denied by Liverpool's Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. For Greco, that was definitive: \"At that moment I really understood that AC Milan would lose the cup -- a terrible evening.\" In the subsequent shootout, Milan missed their first penalty, Dudek saved two more, and Liverpool completed their most extraordinary comeback to win their fifth -- and most improbable -- European Cup. It was 'The Miracle of Istanbul', but for Milan it was 'The Nightmare,' 'The Tragedy,' 'The Curse of Istanbul;' their fans used all three words to describe it. Their exultant high had been cruelly dashed in a crazy period of just six minutes. Greco says that he was still in shock when he got home and didn't want to get off the plane. \"The flight attendant had to come and convince me,\" he said.\"Sometimes when we watch the match today, we still can't believe it,\" laments Dida. \"We still think about it. We got so close; how could it be?\" Often in sport, when a team has capitulated so spectacularly, the fans can't help but turn on them. But Agostinelli, who'd attended two previous European Cup victories, says that didn't happen here. \"They had won the final in 2003; there were a lot of players that we loved. There was no tension between the fans and the team. The coach was a Milanista and we all loved him. There was no resentment. It was like we were fighting against an obscure, invincible force. It was supernatural.  \"This was something so extraordinary, so impossible that only something equally impossible could fix it. And kind of the impossible happened two years later.\"Carlo Ancelotti walks by the throphy at the end of the Champions League final between AC Milan and Liverpool in Istanbul.Chance for revengeIn 2007, this time in Athens, Liverpool and Milan met again in the final of the Champions League. The chances of a rematch occurring so soon would have been incredibly slim: same clubs, same managers and many of the same players. Liverpool had enjoyed their miracle, but this was Milan's chance for revenge, and it was on hallowed ground because since Milan had also won the Champions League at the Olympic Stadium in 1994. The game was tense, combative and although Liverpool created more chances, it was Milan that held their nerve. They had learned their lesson from 2005. Dida is much happier recalling the game in Athens: \"The true difference between the two matches was our concentration,\" he remembered.\"It was much, much stronger than before; every aspect was under control.\" Late goals in each half from Filippo Inzaghi -- who had been injured for the game in Istanbul -- gave Milan a 2-0 lead, and Liverpool's 90th-minute strike from Dirk Kuyt proved to be merely a consolation. The curse had swiftly been broken. \"We hugged and saluted each other, and then our fathers, sons were all there; it was a truly wonderful sensation,\" said Dida. \"It was proof that we could have also done the same thing two years before, but we must try to forget the game that we lost and focus on what we have won.\" Milan were back on top of Europe, re-establishing themselves as one of the powerhouses of the continental game. After the match, Milan's defender Gennaro Gattuso told the media: \"The defeat two years ago will stay with me for a lifetime, but this is a different story. It's our turn to celebrate now.\" At the final whistle, up in the stands, Greco had some unfinished business. \"It was unbelievable, the emotion and joy that I felt was enormous. We finally unrolled the banner that had been left rolled-up since Istanbul 2005, with tears in our eyes.\" Rarely has such a heartbreaking defeat been transformed into such satisfying revenge, but Athens will always be tinged with regret. Milan may have choked in 2005 and the scars from that evening will never completely heal, but in 2007 they did everything possible to put it behind them. Expecting everyone else to forget it, though? Well -- that would take another miracle.",

Another body was to be buried that afternoon. A simple, white plastic cross marks each grave. Taped to each cross is a piece of paper bearing a surname, sometimes with an initial, sometimes with a first name. No date of birth. No date of death.

Many, he added, had no families. In a few cases, the families of the dead have been unable to claim the bodies because of the lockdown.With morgues filled to capacity, and more dying each day at the peak of the outbreak, authorities in Italy's coronavirus hotspots had little choice but to bury the unclaimed dead like this. If their families come forward to claim the bodies once the epidemic is over, the remains will be exhumed and reburied.Read MoreThose laid to rest here died alone. Then again, with coronavirus, almost everyone dies alone.Police investigation into Italian care homes finds coronavirus violationsCarla Porfirio wanted desperately to be with her mother in her final moments.Before the coronavirus outbreak, she visited her 85-year-old mother Michela, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, every day in Milan's sprawling Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute nursing home.When the nursing home abruptly stopped relatives from visiting their loved ones as the virus spread, Porfirio said she called every day to ask about her mother. Every day the staff reassured her Michela was fine.Porfirio is concerned that she wasn't told when her mother first became unwell. When she called the home on Sunday April 5, she was informed that Michela had been put on oxygen and given morphine. She died the next day.Carla Porfirio's 85-year-old mother died in a nursing home in Italy. \"What's so tragic for those of us who lost their loved ones,\" Porfirio told CNN, her voice breaking with emotion, is that \"we couldn't be close to them in their last days as they suffered. They needed the hand of their loved ones.\"At the height of the pandemic's rampage through northern Italy, the regional government of Lombardy asked nursing homes to make room for non-critical Covid-19 patients, to lighten the massive burden on hospitals. Porfirio said the Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi nursing home put one of those patients in the same room as her mother and two other older women.When Porfirio protested, she says a staff member told her the home had no choice; it had run out of space.The Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute told CNN in a statement that \"starting from the detection of the first case ... at the Palazzolo Institute, the Don Gnocchi Foundation started the isolation, mapping and swab testing procedures on contacts exposed to the risk of contagion ... All Covid-19 positive cases were handled according to the protocols provided by the authorities, and in coordination with the authorities themselves.\"The institute did not respond to Carla Porfirio's claims regarding the care of her mother.Italian authorities are investigating a string of health violations at elderly care homes across the country during the Covid-19 crisis. The Palazzolo-Don Gnocchi Institute believes the investigation will show their work was proper.\"We are confident that the brief presented by the Foundation's lawyers at the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office and documents subsequently acquired by the judiciary will confirm the correctness of the Foundation's work in the context of this health emergency,\" it said.The two countries that show life beyond lockdown isn't what people think it will beThe Lombardy regional government told CNN it is not giving interviews on \"the nursing home issue,\" due to the ongoing investigation.At least 15 facilities have been closed and their patients relocated after inspections by the Italian Police health force -- Nuclei Antisofisticazione e Sanita (NAS) -- found that many failed to follow coronavirus protocols, including providing enough protective equipment for staff and dedicated quarantine areas for suspected coronavirus patients.Sixty-one people have been referred to judicial authorities. Another 157 people have been fined a total of more than $78,500 (72,000 euros).Like many who lost loved ones in nursing homes to coronavirus, Carla Porfirio is indignant.\"It's uncivilized,\" she says. \"We're in 2020 and this still happens? The images are like the Spanish flu epidemic 100 years ago. And we're in the same condition?\" she asks.Calls for answersNot long ago, Alessandro Azzoni says his 75-year-old mother Marisa was physically strong and responsive, despite suffering from Alzheimer's. He regularly took her for walks, for an ice cream, to dance in the park.Now Marisa is in a critical condition, on life support, in a Milan hospital after being transferred from the city's Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home.The Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home also admitted Covid-19 patients, and the virus spread.Azzoni presented a diagram on his phone of his mother's nursing home, based on information from doctors and nurses he said worked at the home. Much of the map is colored red, showing wards which now house Covid-19 patients.The home is being investigated over multiple manslaughter complaints filed by staff and relatives of patients who say it failed to protect residents and medical workers against infection.  Fresh out of medical school, young Italian doctors are being fast-tracked to the coronavirus frontlineMilan's Public Prosecutor Mauro Clerici said last month he was looking into \"more than 100 deaths,\" at the home during the Covid-19 epidemic.Clerici said the inquiry would center on \"what crimes may have been committed in accordance with existing legislation as applied to a pandemic.\"No arrests have been made and no one has been charged in the case.A spokesperson for the Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home refused to comment out of respect for the investigators, saying they needed \"to work freely and without pressures of any sort.\"Last month, a spokeswoman for the home told CNN that \"the rules regarding masks were followed,\" adding that the number of deaths in the first quarter of 2020 were in line with those in the same period last year.Azzoni, who founded a group demanding a criminal investigation into what happened at Pio Albergo Trivulzio, describes it as a \"massacre.\"With an investigation, he says \"we have the opportunity to completely change things, to put humans back at the center.\"The region of Lombardy accounts for about half of Italy's 32,169 dead from the virus.  Nembro's main nursing home, where in the space of just a few weeks many of its residents succumbed to the virus. One of the hardest-hit communities in Lombardy is the town of Nembro, in the foothills of the Alps.Of the 87 residents in Nembro's main nursing home, the Nembro Nursing Home Foundation, 34 died from the virus.While law enforcement authorities won't comment on whether the home is under investigation, its director, Barbara Codalli, told CNN there are no allegations of wrongdoing against the home which, she says, never took in any Covid patients. As soon as staff realized that the virus had spread to the home, Codalli said: \"We decided to shut down the structure to families and to close the day care, even if we didn't know at the time what was actually happening, but with the feeling that something out of the ordinary was happening.\" \"We started using PPE, masks, not easily because finding them was hard, we found them at absurd prices,\" she adds.As northern Italy is ravaged by coronavirus, there's trouble brewing down south But still, the home was overwhelmed by the virus, which Codalli said badly hit its staff, killing its president and one of its doctors.She blames the provincial health authorities for being late in testing the nursing home's residents.The Lombardy regional government, which oversees the health authorities, would not comment citing the ongoing investigation.Barbara Codalli notes that when the first cases became evident in the third week of February it took weeks for swabs to be carried out.\"The very first swabs were done the 10th of April,\" she says, \"regardless of what some were claiming on television.\"Nembro's mayor, Claudio Cancelli, confirmed to CNN that the first swabs, from the home's most severely ill patients, were taken beginning on April 10; he says that testing of all staff and the remaining patients only began on April 23. Fresh tombs in Nembro's cemetery. This town suffered one of Italy's highest per capita death tolls as a result of coronavirus. Its undertakers and cemetery workers have been busy.In Nembro, we searched for death notices -- but found only two recent ones. We called a funeral home to ask where we might find more. The undertaker explained the Nembro municipality had removed all but the latest ones, to avoid damaging morale in the town.Mayor Cancelli confirmed that the death notices were removed, but denied that there was an official order to do so in order to boost citizens' spirits. He insisted the decision had been based on common sense, adding that if doing so had improved morale, he was satisfied with that.A set of notices from early March were found next to Nembro's cemetery which showed that in the space of just three days -- March 7 to 9 -- five elderly men and women had passed away.Funerals are finally being held again in Nembro as the lockdown in Italy eases.'A tsunami overwhelmed us'Giacomo Boffelli, 84, died on March 11. Friends and family were finally able say their farewells two months later, at a simple ceremony near the entrance to the town's cemetery.His daughter, Nicoletta, read a statement. \"We never abandoned you. We never would, because you will always be in our hearts.\"'The sea is stormy and the captain is dancing on the deck.' One view of the US from Italy in the time of coronavirusGiacomo's widow, Margherita, sat and listened, the mask covering her nose and mouth moist from her tears.After the ceremony, as Giacomo's ashes were placed in the family tomb, Nicoletta told me: \"The woman who works here at the cemetery says that all of this part was empty before, and now it's filling up.\"Indeed fresh pictures mark the tombs of the recently deceased. Undertakers and grave diggers are the busiest people in Nembro now.\"It was as if a tsunami overwhelmed us, especially the oldest people,\" says Nicoletta.Spring has arrived in Lombardy. In the region's towns and cities, people are venturing out to enjoy the weather and their first hints of freedom, as the lockdown eases.Yet unlike other parts of Italy where coronavirus' toll was lighter, in Lombardy a hint of sorrow hangs in the air.Beppe Severgnini, a columnist for the daily Corriere della Sera, who lives in the hard-hit town of Crema explained: \"It's so sad. Every time I open the obituary pages of the local newspaper, I find so many people that I know have died. A whole generation is being wiped out.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Esteban Granero has often been able to see things differently to other players on the pitch.Praised for his vision and spatial awareness in midfield, the former Real Madrid star is deploying all the skills he learnt as a footballer to run Olocip, an artificial intelligence company he founded five years ago.While Olocip normally provides predictive analysis in sport, it has recently been proving key to Spain's attempts to minimize the impact of the coronavirus.If Granero's analytical mind has made him a joy to watch throughout his career as a metronomic midfielder, it's something the Spaniard believes has helped his unlikely transition from player to AI entrepreneur.\"The key point is anticipation,\" he says. \"This is something that happens on the pitch for a midfielder, to try to anticipate what's happening in the next play is so important.Read More\"They're the best at anticipating, they rule the game and artificial intelligence as we know it is about anticipation, trying to make predictions in order to see the future in a very realistic way before it happens, so you can make decisions in a scenario with less uncertainty. \"So anticipation is key for decision-making in clubs in the industry, but also in health problems like this pandemic -- and, of course, inside the pitch when you are a football player.\"Esteban Granero celebrates after winning the Copa del Rey against Barcelona in 2011.The 32-year-old, who currently plays for third division side Marbella, has dedicated almost every second of his free time over the last five years to developing his company.Granero founded Olocip while playing for Real Sociedad to fill what he saw as a void of predictive data analysis in football; data that helps clubs, for example, to more accurately assess how a new signing will perform in the future.However, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has shifted all of its resources from focusing on football to helping fight the rapidly spreading outbreak.So highly regarded is the work that Olocip does -- thanks largely to the work of Concha Bielza and Pedro Larranaga, who Granero describes as \"two of the best artificial intelligence scientists in Europe\" -- that the Spanish government, as well as local government in each of Spain's autonomous regions, have come to them for guidance.Dr. Antonio Salmeron, a fellow data scientist and the Head of Mathematics at the University of Almeria, says Olocip's models are valuable as they are not only built using data, but also incorporate knowledge from human experts.\"Remarkably, Olocip emphasizes prescriptive models, that is, they are not only capable of detecting potential problems, but also give indications for their treatment,\" he told CNN. \"Which is especially interesting in aspects of sports medicine.READ: Germany's Bundesliga marks elite football's return, with changes, during coronavirus pandemicREAD: Premier League clubs vote in favor of returning to training as 'Project Restart' edges closerGranero has spent much of the last five years developing Olocip.\"I have been following the progress made by Olocip since the beginning of the [coronavirus] crisis and they have adapted their models to predict the evolution of the disease, with good results -- it has an excellent reputation in Spain, having first-rate scientists and data analysts.\"Olocip's analysis has helped predict how the virus will spread across the country and which areas will be hit hardest, allowing decisions to be made on where to move resources \"before the system collapses,\" when to lift lockdown restrictions as well as being better prepared for future pandemics.\"I think our models are the best we can find about the pandemic,\" Granero tells CNN from lockdown at his home in Marbella. \"It's already been used by institutions and we have been asked in different countries, not only in Spain, so we are happy to help. \"When a problem is so huge, a global problem, and it's affecting old people and people with vulnerabilities, it's your responsibility to do your best in the way you can to try to help, this is nothing heroic. \"I think the heroes are in the hospitals treating patients and risking their lives and we are just doing the best we can in order to make this prediction, that is our speciality.\"Light at the end of the tunnelAfter being contacted by a friend who founded the 'Stop Corona' platform, Granero began focusing on the pandemic when Spain declared a state of emergency on March 13. Though Spain has already passed the peak of its pandemic -- Granero's model says this was on April 4 -- it has been one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak.Concha and Pedro lead our artificial intelligence team ... their role is very important for me. I cannot think about my company without these two people and I'm so proud that we can work together.\"Spain has recorded more than 232,000 confirmed cases, the fourth highest in the world, and 27,888 deaths. However, there is now light at the end of what has been a devastating tunnel.After seven weeks of the strictest lockdown in Europe, restrictions were eased slightly at the start of the month as Spaniards were finally allowed outside for limited exercise.Throughout this unprecedented, ever-evolving scenario, Olocip has provided all of its data analysis for free.\"It's not always about profit,\" Granero says. \"We haven't raised a penny with [helping] this problem, but we are very proud to have us helped in this way. Our models are available for anybody that needs them or thinks that this can help with the health of people.\"Spain was the second country in Europe, after Italy, to be severely impacted by the coronavirus, which Granero says made it more difficult to anticipate solutions.While the UK and the the US have been among the countries worst affected by the pandemic, Germany and Canada are widely considered to be among those that have handled it best.Real Madrid celebrate winning La Liga in 2012.\"Germany did a good job because they are very realistic with data,\" Granero says. \"And so they they took the best decisions.\"Canada had this artificial intelligence system in order to predict how big this virus was going to be, so they locked down before the rest and had fewer problems. \"I don't think we [Spain] have done very badly. We could have done better, yes, but it was very difficult. So the most important thing is try to do the right things from now, and the best way is trying to hear the specialists and, of course, use technology in the best way.\"'Complex problem'Granero, who won La Liga and the Copa del Rey during his time at Real Madrid, recently joined Marbella after leaving top-flight side Espanyol, lured by the southern club's ambitious project and the opportunity to lead the club into the first division.Before the coronavirus brought football to a halt in Spain, Marbella was in second place and looking assured of a playoff spot as it went in search of promotion.Granero believes finishing this season must take priority over starting the next, not due to personal interests with Marbella but to maintain the integrity of the competitions.Granero joined Marbella this year and is hoping to secure promotion.La Liga boss Javier Tebas has outlined protocols for elite football in Spain to return behind closed doors in June, though plans were dented recently when five players across Spain's top two divisions tested positive for Covid-19.\"The first first thing we need to have in mind is the health of people, health of spectators, players and referees,\" Granero says. \"The solution is not easy, but the competitions are better if they are finished.\"They need to find a way to finish the competitions because once something has started, it needs to be finished. So they need to find a way. The other [solutions] are unfair by nature.\"Of course, it's a very complex problem and they need to wait until health is assured but they need to finish the competition -- behind closed doors is probably the only solution and this is probably something we will see.\"Isolation certainly isn't the way Granero would have envisaged his start to life Marbella, but it has at least provided him with more time to focus on his growing company -- which is now perhaps more important than he could have ever imagined it would be.Lionel Messi tries to tackle Granero during Barcelona's La Liga clash against Espanyol in 2018.Ever the analyst, Granero is already thinking about how this enforced break can be used to his side's advantage.\"When we start again with training and with games, we will be living a situation nobody has lived,\" he ponders. \"That is four months without playing games and then starting again. So we are trying to see this as an opportunity to make the difference between us and the rest of the teams.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)If any footballers are looking for inventive goal celebrations, their children might just be the best source of inspiration if the example set by Mohamed Salah is anything to go by. It is almost a year to the day since he was opening the scoring for Liverpool in its Champions League final victory over Tottenham Hotspur. On June 1, 2019, the Egypt international scored for the Merseyside club from the penalty spot in the second minute, with Divock Origi doubling the lead late on to wrap up the club's sixth European Cup success with a 2-0 win. After being mobbed by the rest of his teammates in celebration, Salah looked down the barrel of one of the many cameras in the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium for his own, special celebration. Salah celebrates after scoring the opening goal during the UEFA Champions League final in 2019.He twisted his fingers in front of his face before placing one on each side of his nose while sticking his tongue out.Read MoreAnd with the one-year anniversary of that special night in Madrid approaching, Salah sat alongside his eldest daughter, Makka, for an online interview with a group of children and revealed the unique celebration was her idea.  When asked by one of the girls what his favorite celebration is, Salah turned to Makka and asked her, \"Do you know how we celebrated in the final? When I scored the goal?\" In response, the five-year-old reproduced Salah's celebration perfectly. \"You'll find this in the final of the Champions League where Makka told me before the match to make this move/sign if I scored, so that's why I did it,\" the 27-year-old said.READ: No surprise if Africans choose MLS over Europe because of 'awful' racism, says Uganda's Micheal AziraSalah celebrates with his daughter Makka after his side won during the UEFA Champions League Final.'I'm happy the girls in Egypt started to take their right to play football'Salah says his daughter \"loves to play football.\"He added that Makka \"hasn't been to any clubs\" yet, but as a long-term advocate for women's rights in the Middle East, it's something he would embrace.In 2019, speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson, Salah said: \"The woman has to get her right in the Middle East.\"First of all, we have to accept that there is a problem. I know it's very difficult to accept that. But 100% the problem is running deep and deep and deep.\"And the second thing, my opinion is the woman has a right to talk about anything she doesn't like. I'm talking about myself; I want when my daughter has a problem, she has to feel like support from me to come to talk to me about the problem. The most important thing is the fear.\"The woman, the wife, fear from her husband, from her father, which that's the main point, I think. The fear is not healthy for anyone ... We have to fix that.\"Salah raises the Champions League trophy. Stay confidentAnd after being asked by a girl in the online interview for his tips to becoming a good player, the Liverpool forward offered encouragement to girls everywhere. \"There isn't anything specific I would be able to tell you that will make you a good player, but if you have a dream that you want to make true, just stay confident that you're going to make it true -- that's the thing that will push you forward. \"So if you want to grow up and become a football player, it's going to be hard and in some communities it might be a little complicated for people to accept a girl to play football, but as long as you have a dream you want to make true, just hold on to it and work on it and I'm sure you're going to make it.

Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the University has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year,\" a University of Cambridge spokesperson said in a statement.Some colleges and universities plan to have limited in-person classes and cancel fall break to combat coronavirus\"Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements,\" the university's statement added. The decision will be reviewed if guidelines around social distancing change.Read MoreCambridge and Oxford, the UK's two leading universities, rely  far more on smaller group teaching than large lectures -- so the move will probably not be as disruptive as it would be at most institutions.But it demonstrates the dilemma facing universities around the world, many of which have been forced to shut their campuses and move classes online in recent months.That situation has created uncertainty for people preparing to start their studies. In the UK, university semesters begin in September. The traditional \"freshers' week\" period at the start of the year sees students mixing in accommodation halls, bars and clubs, but it is seems likely that such activities will be discouraged this year.On Monday, the University of South Carolina in the United States made changes to its fall semester in preparation for the likelihood that Covid-19 cases surge during cold and flu season this fall and winter.",

        "content": "(CNN)Among Michael Jordan's seemingly infinite list of great moments, \"The Flu Game\" in the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz is close to the top. Despite suffering apparent flu-like symptoms the night before and during the game, Jordan -- through sheer strength of will and determination -- scored 38 points to help his Chicago Bulls win 90-88 in Game 5. And while \"The Flu Game\" had been written into basketball lore, Jordan and people close to him told a different story during Episode 9 of \"The Last Dance\" documentary which aired on Sunday. In the documentary, Jordan -- along with personal trainer Tim Grover and best friend George Koehler -- recall ordering a pizza to their hotel room in Salt Lake City, Utah, the night before the game. According to Grover, they became suspicious when, as they remember it, five people arrived at the door to deliver the one pizza. Read MoreDespite the alleged misgivings, Jordan ate the entire pizza by himself, and later that night, Grover said he received a phone call that the five-time NBA MVP was \"literally curled up in the fetal position\" on his hotel room floor, complaining of food poison-like symptoms. \"I ate the pizza,\" Jordan said in the documentary. \"All by myself. Nobody else ate the pizza. I wake up about 2:30am throwing up left and right ... It really wasn't the flu game. It was food poisoning.\"READ: Jordan's children reveal extent of their dad's competitive streakJordan walks on the court during game five of the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz.However, the man who claims to have made and delivered the infamous pizza has called the version of the incident told in the documentary \"a bunch of crap.\"Craig Fite, who was a Bulls fan living in Salt Lake City, was a newly-appointed assistant manager at Pizza Hut in 1997. After his store received the order for Jordan's pizza, Fite personally took charge of the cooking and delivering of the pizza, even though those weren't his normal job responsibilities. \"I remember saying this: 'I will make the pizza, because I don't want any of you doing anything to it,'\" he told \"The Big Show\" on 1280 The Zone in Salt Lake City. \"And then I told the driver, 'You're going to take me there. And it'll be my first delivery.'\"Such was his love for the Bulls -- he admits that he named his son after Jordan -- Fite personally made sure the pizza was cooked perfectly. \"I followed all the rules,\" Fite said. \"At the time I was trying to impress the store manager there.\"Upon arriving at the hotel, Fite remembers feeling like he had been \"punched in the face with cigar smoke\" upon stepping onto Jordan's floor at the hotel, before catching a glimpse of the six-time NBA champion in his hotel room while he handed over the pizza. Jordan plays for the Bulls.Discussing the incident that took place 23 years ago, Fite disputes the claim there were five people delivering one \"large, thin and crispy, extra peperoni pizza.\" \"That's a bunch of crap,\" Fite said. \"Sorry, we were five creepy looking guys that the guy felt threatened? I guess you have to sell your book but it really wasn't that exciting.\"There were two of us. I didn't even have that many people working [at the Pizza Hut].\"And according to Fite, the accusation that the pizza gave Jordan food poisoning is wide of the mark too. \"Did you get it diagnosed? Did you go to the doctor? All this is innuendo on their part,\" Fite said. \"One thing I remind everybody is, he was smoking so many cigars. They had windows open. He didn't have a shirt on or he was in a tank top. At around 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon in Park City, the sun is gone behind that mountain so it gets colder up there.\"READ: Michael Jordan declined $100 million to appear at an event for two hours, agent says     Upsetting teammatesFite is not the only one that took issue with some stories from \"The Last Dance\" documentary.

But that was kind of edited out of the documentary, if you want to call it a documentary.\"Grant, who spent seven years with the Bulls, is accused by Jordan of leaking stories for \"The Jordan Rules,\" a book that sometimes painted the Hall of Famer in an unflattering light, in the documentary, something Grant vehemently denies.",

But after taking up cycling and embarking on what had previously seemed an unlikely professional career, Southerland discovered a reliable means of controlling his diabetes.\"When I was on the bike, I didn't have to check blood sugar, I didn't have to get insulin,\" he says. Read More\"All I had to do was eat so I didn't bonk and that was what every other cyclist was doing. So I was absolutely normal and that felt really, really cool.\"Phil Southerland competes for Team Type 1 in California in 2009.Type 1 diabetes is a disease which causes the body's immune system to destroy cells required to make insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. Type 1 diabetics inject themselves with insulin so cells can take glucose from the blood for energy.

Southerland says cycling made him \"obsessed about glucose control.\" He launched Team Type 1 alongside a friend in 2006, which eventually became Team Novo Nordisk in 2013 -- an all-diabetic professional cycling team of 16 riders competing on the UCI World Tour.READ: Diabetic Olympic hopeful Mandy Marquardt adapts to training in quarantine\"I started thinking -- sport is such a powerful platform. I thought the bike could be a way to promote our story and inspire people to take control of their diabetes and go and pursue their dreams,\" says Southerland, who today serves as CEO of Team Novo Nordisk. \"We took what 10 years ago would have been perceived as our greatest weakness and turned diabetes into our greatest strength, which is the unity it brings our team, the family bond it gives to all of our athletes.\"Diabetes is not an excuse for our athletes. We own the control. We have challenging days on the diabetes front, but these guys work really hard to be the best they can at their diabetes management.\"Spanish rider David Lozano prepares for the third stage of the Tour Colombia in February this year.Having lost key riders, Southerland admits there have been \"plateaus\" in the team's progress since climbing to 83rd in the world rankings in 2015.Team Novo Nordisk had previously set a goal of competing at the Tour de France -- the holy grail of road cycling -- by 2021, which also marks 100 years since the discovery of insulin. But the timeline on that goal has been adjusted.\"For me, the Tour de France is still very much the dream,\" says Southerland.\"I'm not putting a hard timeline on when we have to get there. It's more the journey and the process for us to do it. One day, we will be there.

For me, I always say this and some people just laugh, but it's the best thing that ever happened to me. \"It's given me a mission; it's given me a route in life to take for the better.

The team often finds new riders through social media who then feed into a talent pipeline. While many cycling teams have the luxury of cherry-picking riders, Team Novo Nordisk has to develop its own. \"The challenging part for us is the recruitment process,\" says General Manager Vassili Davidenko. Charles Planet (left) rides during Team Novo Nordisk's training camp in Spain last December.\"Where I used to manage before, you have to have good budgets; once you have a budget, you start shopping around ... In our case, it's different. There are not many riders who have diabetes.\"Eight years ago, the team started talent ID camps where young cyclists are invited to a summer training camp in Atlanta. Some progress to the junior team, which in turn feeds into the development team and the professional team. \"If you have something that you can do in your life, something very special, you have to take it.\" @Teamnovonordisk's Vassili Davidenko explains why he took up the \"challenge\" of managing a team of riders with type 1 diabetes. https://t.co/t1XYEmqtH4 pic.twitter.com/sGwKlLGvkO\u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) May 19, 2020 \"We do have this great pipeline but it's a long way before you bring a rider from point one to point two -- point two being a professional cycling team,\" says Davidenko.\"We need to find riders, we need to create them, and we need to guide them to the top level,\" he went on.\"I knew [when I joined] I was going into something very, very challenging but my personality is that I like challenges ... I knew there would be challenges to win races in the beginning. I knew we were going to miss this feeling of winning races.\"But most important to me was that it was something that was very good outside of the sport that [could] help people affected by diabetes to understand that right management can achieve goals.\"Dedicated supportWhile finding riders has been testing at times, finding fans has been rather more straightforward for Team Novo Nordisk.\"We are very popular on social media, we do have fans around the bus (at races) pretty much all the time,\" says Davidenko.\"In Poland, this girl took a day off and traveled like 300 kilometers just to meet us at the start and to say, 'I have type 1 diabetes, because of you guys I took control of my management.

As well as staying sharp on the bike, the riders are encouraged to take up other pursuits, including cooking and yoga.\"When you cycle a lot, you don't have the mental energy to learn and to improve your knowledge, because you are just very tired -- you eat, you go to sleep, you rest,\" says Federico Fontana, head of performance at Team Novo Nordisk. \"Your brain is kind of lazy, but now (during lockdown) your brain is very active and it's drooling to do something.

Players are set return to training in small groups after the sport was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, some players have expressed concerns about exiting lockdown to join up with the team, with wicketkeeper Jos Buttler saying he had \"some anxieties\" about leaving quarantine. James Anderson, England's leading wicket-taker in Test cricket and One-Day Internationals, told CNN that while he is \"desperate to get out there and play,\" he thinks it's only natural for players to have worries. \"It's just a human reaction to be nervous about this situation. We've got players in our team who have pregnant wives and the worry there is if they bring something back,\" Anderson told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies via Instagram Live.

How cycling's Team Novo Nordisk turned type 1 diabetes into its 'greatest strength'Anderson takes a catch to dismiss Rassie van der Dussen of South Africa.Adapting to new conditionsLike all other sport, cricket will have to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic. One of Anderson's key skills, making the ball swing (moving it through the air from side to side), is partly dependent on how much he and his fellow players can shine the ball using their sweat or saliva. But to avoid the spread of Covid-19 between players, the International Cricket Council has put forward the idea of banning players from using saliva to shine the ball.And Anderson is \"99% convinced\" players won't be able to use saliva to shine the ball when they return to training, something the 37-year-old and his fellow bowlers will have to adjust to.Anderson bowls during a Test Match against South Africa.\"It's a massive thing for me because to get the ball to swing, you need to be able to polish the ball and repair it when it gets scuffs on it,\" said Anderson, who also said he doesn't know if he's \"going to make it to the next Ashes series\" in 2021. Sports that are returning now, like the German Bundesliga soccer, is doing so without fans. And with fans unlikely to be able to attend cricket matches this summer, Anderson believes he and his teammates will need to \"lean on each other\" to motivate themselves for games. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"We're lucky (in England) that most Test matches are sold out, certainly the first few days, we get big crowds so motivating yourself isn't an issue,\" he said. \"You just get out there in front of a packed house and it's quite easy to get up for a game. I think we might have to lean on each other as players if there's no crowd there, no atmosphere, we hear the sound of leather on willow echoing around the ground rather than the applause.\"",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russia's southern republic of Dagestan provided President Vladimir Putin with his first real test as a national leader in 1999, when militants in Chechnya crossed the border and launched a war that forged his image as a man of action.More than two decades later, the remote mountainous region presents the Russian President with a new challenge, as its Covid-19 outbreak raises fresh questions about how Russia counts coronavirus infections and deaths.As of Tuesday, Dagestan has 3,553 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 32 deaths, ranking it fifth out of 85 regions in official Russian federal statistics. But in an Instagram Live interview Sunday with a local journalist, the head of the republic's ministry of health gave figures far higher than Moscow's, saying the total number of people infected with coronavirus and community-acquired pneumonia in Dagestan exceeded 13,000, with 657 dead.Asked by journalist Ruslan Kurbanov to explain why Covid-19 and pneumonia cases were being counted separately, the health official, Dzhamaludin Gadzhiibragimov, responded that pneumonia patients are treated as if they have the virus, but not all cases are ascribed to coronavirus due to a lack of testing.\"Basically, the same [treatment] methodology is used for both,\" he said. \"But because we do not have lab test confirmation, the statistics are being compiled in that way.\"Vladimir Putin's spokesman has been hospitalized with coronavirusRead MoreAs in other countries, frontline health workers in the region have been the most vulnerable to the deadly outbreak. Between 40 to 50 health workers have died in Dagestan since the beginning of the pandemic, according to estimates from Gadzhiibragimov and the region's chief mufti. Dagestan has a population of about 3 million people. According to Russia's health ministry, the region has 635 ICU beds and ventilators.Doctors in the region have complained in the past weeks on social media about the lack of protective equipment, and some hospitals have not had space to treat their staff. A video of nurses hooked up to intravenous drips in a storage room in the city of Derbent went viral in early May.Civil rights activist Ziyautdin Uvaisov, who is head of Patient Monitor, a non-profit organization that raised money to buy protective equipment for Dagestan's doctors, told CNN that the healthcare system in the region is in a really bad state. \"We have been talking about it since 2017 but unfortunately there is a habit to sweep everything under the rug,\" Uvaisov said.He added that most of the doctors his organization interacts with say about a half of their colleagues are sick with no one to replace them as hospital wards overflow. Dagestan's dire situation has put the republic into the spotlight of Russia's top-level officials. On Monday, Putin took the unusual step of chairing a special government session with Dagestani leaders.\"The situation in Dagestan is difficult and demands urgent measures,\" Putin said in a video conference, ordering the military to build a 200-bed hospital to help relieve overcrowded emergency rooms.Much of the Russian government response to the pandemic has been hindered by bureaucracy and mismanagement of regional funds. In poorer regions like Dagestan, where the average monthly wage is two times lower than nationwide, according to Russia's state statistics agency, such foot-dragging became one of the key reasons behind severe outbreaks.Additional payments promised by Putin to compensate for the hardships of frontline work became another grievance for health professionals. \"We've been at work since the very beginning of the pandemic and we've faithfully performed our duties -- now a lot of our colleagues are [confined] inside medical institutions, fighting for their lives,\" one paramedic from the city of Buinaksk in Dagestan said in a video posted by a local outlet. \"There are very few of us left at the frontlines. We have 151 employees, but only 41 received payments. Others got nothing.\"Similar videos and open letters have surfaced in at least 20 out of 85 Russian regions in the past week, according to a CNN tally. In a public outcry, health workers complain they either did not receive any extra pay at all or got a fraction of it, calculated based on hours and even minutes spent working directly with Covid-19 patients. \"If the government decree initially stated clear, understandable, transparent and easily to control principles and ways to bring these presidential payments [to health workers] for working in special conditions, then there would be fewer questions for the head doctors who work from morning till night anyway, and to the governors too,\" Putin said TuesdayThe federal government amended the relevant decree, removing a bureaucratic loophole that resulted in some doctors receiving less than 50 cents of extra pay, and vowed to facilitate all due payments.Putin's coronavirus crisis deepens with fatal hospital fire and spokesman's diagnosisIn the special meeting convened by Putin on Monday, officials acknowledged the situation in Dagestan is more serious than what's reflected in the official statistics. Russia's Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said that 7,000 people have been hospitalized. In Monday's video conference, the republic's Chief Mufti Ahmad Abdulaev told Putin many Covid-19 deaths are not recorded as people die in their homes without ever making it to a hospital and get buried according to local traditions -- and without an autopsy that could confirm cause of death. Vladimir Vasilyev, the head of the republic, attributed the infection rates in part to Dagestan's traditions, which involve mass gatherings to mark milestone events such as weddings and funerals as well as a certain reluctance to suspend Friday prayers at the early stages of the outbreak. He also addressed the discrepancies in numbers between pneumonia and coronavirus. \"We are not hiding anything,\" Vasilyev said, citing the high number of respiratory-related deaths in 2018 and 2019, before coronavirus. \"But here it [is] not so easy to distinguish between the two.\"In mid-April, the streets of the regional capital Makhachkala were still busy with people. Independent outlet Meduza described in a report last week how a 500-person wedding in one of Dagestan's small towns became one of the first coronavirus hotspots in late March. Still, some Dagestanis dispute speculation that their traditions are one of the causes of rising infections; Uvaisov, the local activist, cited distrust toward local authorities and the healthcare system for prompting some to disregard warnings. The Kremlin has promised to help Dagestan with additional resources to help it fight the pandemic, including more test kits as the republic is still testing at a daily rate two times lower than recommended, according to federal healthcare and well-being agency Rospotrebnadzor. The agency's head, Anna Popova, told Putin that Dagestan is maintaining \"a very fragile balance,\" as authorities worry that the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr and mass celebrations could prompt a new outbreak. Russia's overall coronavirus death toll remains low with 2,837 fatalities reported as of Tuesday and its mortality rate is 7.4 lower than the global average, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova. The country's counting method has been scrutinized by observers who point out that deaths are often ascribed to other causes. Russian demographers and epidemiologists hope that nationwide statistics for April's all-cause mortality, expected to be released by the authorities late May, will help to get a clearer picture of the pandemic's toll on Russia -- both for coronavirus fatalities that might have been missed and for people who couldn't get medical help for other conditions due to overwhelmed hospitals.",

        "content": "(CNN)Hungary has banned people from legally changing gender, in a move rights groups said could lead to further intolerance and discrimination against the LGBTQ community in the country. The parliament voted Tuesday to stop transgender and intersex people from changing their gender on identity documents.Lawmakers voted -- with 134 votes in favor, 56 votes against and four abstentions -- to define gender on the basis of \"sex at birth,\" as registered on a birth certificate.Amnesty International researcher Krisztina Tam\u00e1s-S\u00e1r\u00f3y said in a statement published online: \"This decision pushes Hungary back towards the dark ages and tramples the rights of transgender and intersex people. It will not only expose them to further discrimination but will also deepen an already intolerant and hostile environment faced by the LGBTI community.\"Hungarian rights group Hatter Society said the law violated a constitutional fundamental right and had been opposed by the European Parliament and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. It said LGBTI organizations were now requesting the law be sent for review to the Constitutional Court.Read MoreThe Constitutional Court is the principal organ protecting the democratic state through the rule of law, and decides on the constitutionality of acts of parliament and other cases.While Hungary is a member of the European Union, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been forging his own path in recent years, passing a rash of laws that EU leaders have warned will undermine the country's democracy. However, the government defended the law, telling CNN in an emailed statement that the law \"does not affect men's and women's right to freely experience and exercise their identities as they wish.\"In no way does the relevant section of the bill that some people criticize prevent any person from exercising their fundamental rights arising from their human dignity or from living according their identity, just as the state cannot normatively instruct anybody what to think.\"Two men have been charged in the shooting deaths of two transgender women in Puerto RicoEarlier this month, Hungary dropped points in a ranking of European countries for LGBTI rights by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) because of \"policies targeting LGBTI communities.\"Darienne Flemington, co-chair of the ILGA-Europe executive board, said the then proposed ban on legal gender recognition was among \"alarming signals of how governments with strong authoritarian tendencies are emboldened by the crisis to further limit the rights of vulnerable groups and minorities.\"Hungary currently recognizes legal unions for same-sex couples, but the ruling Fidesz party and its leader, Orban, oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage.  Coca-Cola faced a backlash from politicians and conservative activists in Hungary last August after running ads that included images of same-sex couples kissing and holding bottles of Coke.At least one leading politician from the Fidesz party and conservative media outlets called for boycotting Coke products or banning the ad campaign.In 2018, the Hungarian State Opera canceled a third of its performances of the stage musical \"Billy Elliot\" for this month and July amid criticism by a pro-government media outlet.But a 2017 poll by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association found that more than 60% of the country's residents believe equal rights should be afforded to everyone, regardless of sexual orientation.",

        "content": "(CNN)For millions around the world, Michael Jordan was a sporting and cultural icon the likes of which very few of us had ever seen. But for those of us who lived in Chicago as he was winning six NBA titles in 14 years with the Bulls, Michael was simply -- ours. The so-called Second City was second to none in the Jordan era beginning in 1984 and ending in 1998. Bulls fans were treated to such an incredible ride that a 10-hour documentary was created about it. \"The Last Dance,\" which aired its final episode on ESPN Sunday evening in the US and is now streaming internationally on Netflix, featured extraordinary access to the sixth championship run in 1997-98 and candid interviews with Jordan and other key member of those title teams. Read MoreThe world saw the ups and downs and the behind-the-scenes drama play out, and many of us who were fans of the team remember where we were and how we felt when these moments happened. That's why my CNN producing partner Sam Krumov and I (John Lynch) wanted to recap the documentary by taking you on our journey through the Jordan years as long-time Bulls fans.      READ: Michael Jordan declined $100 million to appear at an event for two hours, agent saysThe early years (John Lynch) Even though I was born and raised in the far northern suburbs of Chicago, I confess I really didn't know anything about the Bulls until Michael Jordan was drafted in June of 1984. I had just turned 9 years old that month, and, frankly, the entire 28-year history of the franchise had been forgettable. The team was drawing less fans at the Chicago Stadium than the city's indoor soccer team, the Sting. Even as Jordan's star was rising his first year and a half in the league, he and his Bulls teammates rarely graced the front pages of the sports section. They were dominated by two of the most iconic teams in the city's sporting history -- the 1984 Cubs, who came within a game of reaching Major League Baseball's World Series, and the 1985 Bears, whose Super Bowl win capped one of the great seasons in NFL history. It wasn't until Jordan's record-breaking 63-point performance in the 1986 playoffs that I and other Chicagoans sat up and took notice. We rarely sat down for the next 12 years. By the late 1980s, kids in my class all wanted to be like Mike, and I did too. Jordan jerseys, t-shirts and even shoes (if you could afford them) were all over the playgrounds. We'd imitate his moves below the playground hoop (those we thought we could do anyway) and couldn't wait to watch him play on TV. My dad, my brother and I were lucky enough to get tickets to see him play twice in the 1989 season, the only times we saw Jordan play live before tickets were too hard to get. The first was sometime during the regular season, and all I remember was walking into the biggest building I'd ever seen in my life and watching the best player I'd ever seen. Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls (L) eyes the basket as he is guarded by Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers.READ: Jordan's children reveal extent of their dad's competitive streakI didn't think it could get better than that until a day before Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Someone my dad knew from his work offered him tickets! OMG! This is WAY better than a regular season game! This is playoffs! The Bulls were coming off the euphoria of Jordan's iconic buzzer-beating shot that eliminated the Cleveland Cavaliers and were in the conference finals for the first time in 14 years. They faced the Detroit Pistons, who had beaten us in the playoffs the year before. The Bulls led two games to one heading into that May 29 game. I walked into the Stadium thinking \"This is it! We're going to beat the Pistons today and then win one more and we're off to the NBA Finals!\"I left bitterly disappointed. Detroit won 86-80. Jordan was held to 23 points (which seems like a lot but wasn't really for him) and I felt like even though the best-of-seven series was tied at two, it was already over. I was right. Detroit won in six. They beat us again in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals, this time in seven games. CNN producer John Lynch.I was tired of losing to them. They'd physically roughed us up every chance they got. They were the so-called 'Bad Boys' of the league (and bullies to us) and they knew it. The teams met up again in 1991, but this time the Bulls weren't going to get pushed around. They stood their ground and won! It was a four-game sweep that seemed remarkably easy but at the same time as satisfying a triumph as any I had witnessed as a fan of any team.The team we disliked the most was finally in our rear-view mirror (though I'm still as mad as Jordan that Detroit's big stars didn't bother to shake our hands as they left the floor). I thought now the Finals would be a breeze, and for the most part I was right. They dispatched Magic Johnson and his LA Lakers in five games. I remember crying in my living room along with Michael when he finally hugged that championship trophy in the locker room. He'd hug a few more in the years to come. \"The Last Dance\" has brought Michael Jordan's exploits in the NBA to a new auidence.READ: 'Pure insanity' to hear NBA players trash talk, says Steph CurryFrom Bulgaria to basketball's Mecca(Sam Krumov) My first memory of Michael Jordan was when I was living in my home country of Bulgaria -- where basketball was not nearly as popular as it was for most of our Balkan neighbors. I was 9 or 10 years old and went to knock on the door of one of my friends to ask him to come outside to play. I remember that upon opening, he told me that he could not make it because he was watching Michael Jordan play. I was in disbelief: \"You won't come play with me because you're watching who?\" Jordan talks with teammate Scottie Pippen during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers in 1992.READ: There's a bull market in Michael Jordan sneakersJust a few years later, I arrived as an immigrant to my new home of Chicago. The date was June 18, 1993, and two days later, I watched my first Bulls game on TV. At the time, my mother was working as a caretaker of a wealthy elderly woman in the northern suburbs and had her own room in the vast house. That's where, on June 20, on a tiny television, I saw Jordan and the Bulls clinch their third straight championship after defeating the Phoenix Suns. I was not a basketball fan but quickly realized the magnitude of the moment. I also took it for granted.\"That's what they do here all the time I suppose,\" I thought to myself. \"I'm living in the city of the best basketball player and team.\" October 7 of that year was just another school day for me. I was in sixth grade and vividly remember the crisp, cool morning air as I walked down an alley approaching the school. That's when one of my classmates shouted -- \"Jordan is retiring!\" -- as he was clutching a newspaper. CNN senior producer Sam Krumov (far right).It hadn't come to my attention that the new season was fast approaching, but the feeling of frustration quickly engulfed me. \"I can't believe that as soon as I move here, this Jordan guy leaves!\" I didn't pay attention to the Bulls over the next 18 months. I remember playing video games at a neighborhood Best Buy while the big televisions on sale were broadcasting a playoff game between Chicago and the New York Knicks. I couldn't care less as I focused on my controller. In March of 1995 everything changed for me. Jordan sent his famous \"I'm Back\" fax. Now, as a 13-year-old, I knew I was given a second chance and I wasn't going to waste it. I watched his first game back -- a close loss in Indianapolis -- and barely missed a game from that point on.

How many athletes at the age of 30, in the prime of their careers, just flat out retire. It didn't make a lot of sense. He had achieved so much yet you could feel then (and the documentary did a great job of describing it) the enormous pressure the man was under to live up to his own expectations and those of his fans around the world who were hanging on his every move. In early 1994, I was in my first year of college in Milwaukee, only a two-hour drive north of Chicago. It was the first time I had friends who didn't love the Bulls as much as I did. They were buying the conspiracy theories at the time that the NBA had secretly suspended Jordan for gambling and he was just playing baseball (with a Chicago White Sox minor league team) to cover that up. I felt like our icon was under attack. As I said earlier, he was ours. How could you not like Michael Jordan?Now Phil Jackson, Scottie Pippen and others did pretty well in the year and a half that Jordan was gone. But when that \"I'm back!\" fax came in, I knew we were ready to be the center of the basketball world once again. Although it didn't come right away.

I took it personally. I was a Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan fan through and through -- if only my friend in Bulgaria could see me now! The next three years were endless entertainment. Jordan and the Bulls were invincible. They could never lose. And when they did, it was a rarity and a shock. In the bitter Chicago winters, the United Center -- the Bulls' home court -- seemed especially cozy on TV. One December morning's walk to my school bus stop was only warmed up by the previous night's 20-point comeback victory against Shaquille O'Neal and the LA Lakers. Once on the corner, waiting for the bus with a handful of kids, we would all reminisce and talk about our favorite plays. Come spring, I would come back from school at 3 p.m., quickly change and grab my ball, and ride my bike to the local park's basketball courts. They were always packed with 15 to 20 neighborhood kids. I would play for three hours straight most afternoons. We were all Michael. We would all talk about the last game and some of us would stick our tongues out while driving to the hoop.

I didn't watch to see if they would win. I watched to see how they would win. To see what wonders Jordan, Pippen and Rodman could come up with now. Winning was never in question. My friends and I, like all Chicago Bulls fans, were spoiled to no end. When Jordan hit a game-winning three against Charlotte in 1997, I said to myself -- \"The score was tied; it would have been cooler if the Bulls were down when he hit that.\" When MJ hit another buzzer-beater against Atlanta the next season, I was frustrated that it even got to that point as the Bulls had blown a big lead late on. But amongst it all, we knew Jordan was the best. And he was ours. Roughly 100 games each season were pure theater. His last game in 1998 was the ultimate finale. Highlights don't do it justice, but my memories do. There are dozens and dozens more moments and exact dates that I can recall as if they were yesterday. They form a timeline of my childhood. I got to witness three straight championships after I thought I would never see Jordan play again. I consider myself very lucky, but also spoiled for life. My friend back in Bulgaria was way ahead of the game on this one.

That final season was the first one that I really felt I was truly away from Chicago. I graduated from college in Milwaukee in May of 1997 and in August got my first television job in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Seven months later, in March of 1998, I came to work in Atlanta for CNN and have now been here for 22 years. Three weeks after I arrived in town, Jordan would play his last game in Atlanta. There were 62,046 fans in the Georgia Dome, still the largest crowd to ever see an NBA game. The buzz in town was electric. It was almost like being in Chicago. It was the last time fans in Atlanta would see this team play and everyone wanted a glimpse of it. Unfortunately, I wasn't one of the lucky ones to get tickets. But, hey, I saw a playoff game in 1989 and was lucky enough to go to two championship parades back home. I didn't feel too badly about it. I found my first roommate in Atlanta through work and he happened to be from the Chicago area. Alex and I watched Jordan's final shot over Bryon Russell which beat the Utah Jazz and handed the Bulls a sixth title. We raised our glasses and toasted the champs one final time. I was producing newscasts at CNN International when Sam started as an associate producer and then producer of \"World Sport.\"When I began producing \"World Sport\" in 2011, we became fast friends because of our Chicago connections and our love for Jordan and the Bulls. Even today, we reminisce about that incredible run, what might have been if management decided to keep it going, and why the Bulls are now one of the worst teams in the NBA again. Other Chicago teams have won titles and won back the front pages of the paper. But I'm not sure we'll see a 10-hour documentary about them 20 years from now. The Bulls were one of a kind.",

        "content": "(CNN)Russia hit a grim Covid-19 milestone this week: According to Johns Hopkins University, the country now ranks second in the world for confirmed coronavirus cases.The Russian capital has been hardest hit. Of Russia's total of 281,752 confirmed cases, over half -- 142,824 -- are in Moscow, the country's coronavirus headquarters said Sunday. But the virus is now spreading across Russia's regions, an enormous landmass that covers 11 time zones and includes some of the country's most remote and impoverished places.More on the coronavirusLatest developments on the pandemicWhy Moscow didn't count 60% of suspected Covid-19 deathsOpinion: Why is Russia's Covid-19 mortality rate so low?Track cases around the worldIn a video conference meeting on Monday with Russia's 85 regional heads, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the burden would fall to local leaders to decide whether to continue lockdown measures or to begin cautiously lifting restrictions to reopen the economy.\"We have a big country,\" he said. \"The epidemiological situation varies across the regions. We factored this in before, and now at the next stage, we have to act even more specifically and carefully.\"According to official statistics, the pandemic has reached all of Russia's constituent parts, from the Kaliningrad exclave between Poland and Lithuania to the remote Chukotka autonomous okrug, across the Bering Strait from Alaska. Russia's regions are also starting to report their own numbers, sometimes showing a disparity between the nationally published statistics on mortality and infections published on the stopcoronavirus.rf portal and on local government websites.Read MoreKaliningrad region, for instance, reported 13 deaths as of Friday, while the nation's coronavirus headquarters reported 11. The contrast between national and local mortality figures was even more stark in Chelyabinsk region in the Ural mountains: Local authorities there reported 10 Covid-19-related deaths in addition to the six deaths attributed directly to coronavirus on the national portal.Russian Vice-Premier Tatiana Golikova told Russian news outlets this week that the Russian government has not manipulated statistics, but Russia's mortality figures have become a political football. Observers have noted the comparatively low overall number of deaths in Russia -- a total that currently stands at 2,631, according to the country's coronavirus headquarters -- even as the country takes second place in the world for the number of confirmed cases, behind the United States.People wearing face masks and gloves on a subway escalator in Moscow on Tuesday.In Moscow, health officials hit back at media reports that it was underreporting Covid-19 fatalities, saying its data was \"absolutely open.\" But the city's health department also acknowledged that it only counts deaths that were found through post-mortem autopsy to have been caused directly by coronavirus complications.And the capital is proceeding with caution. Earlier this week, Putin announced a gradual easing of restrictions around the country, at the discretion of local leadership. But Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin subsequently made clear he was in no rush to end lockdown.\"Premature removal of restrictions carries a real risk of a second pandemic,\" he said in a statement Thursday. \"Unjustified delays will also hit people in the strongest way.\"Sobyanin, in many respects, has been the public face of Russia's fight with coronavirus, as Putin shelters at his residence of Novo-Ogaryovo. President Putin takes part in a video conference call from his Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, on May 14.As cases began to pick up pace in April Moscow authorities opened a new coronavirus hospital, built in around a month. And Sobyanin's government oversaw the introduction of electronic passes to enforce lockdown measures, controversial measures ahead of the rest of the country. The city is also launching a large coronavirus screening program that will be free to the public.Healthcare system in crisisMoscow, in many ways, is better equipped to deal with the crisis than Russia's less well-off regions. It has a concentration of wealth and budgetary resources that is the envy of the rest of the country.Under Sobyanin, the Russian capital, which in pre-coronavirus days was transforming itself into an Instagram-friendly landscape of refurbished parks, hip restaurants and high-end real estate, has enjoyed a municipal spending spree. The leading business daily Vedomosti reported last year that the city's budget on beautification projects over the past decade -- more than 1.5 trillion rubles ($20.5 billion), according to Moscow budget data -- was nearly equivalent to the total amount spent on similar projects around the country.People in protective gear disinfecting Red Square in Moscow.Grave diggers bury a COVID-19 victim as relatives and friends stand at a safe distance, at a cemetary in Kolpino, outside St. Petersburg, on Friday.One doesn't have to travel far outside of Moscow to see the disparities in living standards and the decrepitude of the healthcare system.A viral YouTube video recently posted by the popular Russian journalist Irina Shikhman showed a visit to the town of Ivanteyevka, a town just over 10 miles outside the city limits of Moscow of a local clinic as it receives a delivery of personal protective equipment. As Shikhman begins the formal interview, a masked doctor says she had \"no complaints\" about the supplies and had enough personnel to handle patients.But the images in the video, which has had more than 3,327,000 views, shows the peeling paint and poorly lit interior of the facility, and underscores the shocking condition of Russia's provincial healthcare system.

        "content": "(CNN)It wasn't soccer as we usually know it but games were finally played again on Saturday in Germany, bringing high-profile sporting competition back during the coronavirus pandemic. While fans weren't allowed -- the most obvious difference to normal match days -- the Bundesliga's six games no doubt boosted morale among those watching on television around the world who craved action in a top league. Not to mention the clubs themselves which desperately need the lucrative television money to operate and thrive. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIndeed, the Bundesliga is the first major European soccer division to return to action, perhaps providing a template in some ways for how American sports leagues can proceed. Germany's top tier regularly attracts an average of 43,300 people every game, but these matches are being played behind closed doors. \"It was weird, but we were ready for the fact that there wouldn't be any spectators,\" said Leipzig defender Lukas Klostermann after his side's 1-1 home draw against Freiburg.  Read MoreThe Bundesliga's hiatus lasted nine weeks, with the three other elite soccer divisions in harder-hit countries in Europe -- the UK's Premier League, Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A -- not yet providing a set date for their comebacks. Those leagues surely were keeping an eye on how Saturday went. Borussia Dortmund's game against local rival Schalke 04 was played with no fans as soccer returned. Germany, which has been praised for its handling of the pandemic, has reported over 173,000 coronavirus cases with nearly 8,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.The Bundesliga enforced strict rules ahead of the restart. \"We've had so many other things to organize, to respect, and to solve,\" FC Koln's head of football, Frank Aehlig, said in a virtual press conference before this weekend's games. \"It's completely different from what we know from our normal business.\" \u00a0Other differences Teams spent a week in quarantine before games, shuttled players -- who are regularly tested -- to stadiums in multiple buses rather than one, and more than one dressing room was used per team, too. Even then, social distancing rules had to be followed. There were staggered warmups and teams entered the pitch at different times with no mascots, in another change. Substitutes donned masks and sat not in the dugout but between the dugout and stands at Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park, well apart from teammates. The match ball was disinfected prior to kickoff, presumably resulting in the referee appearing to enter the field last. More than 80,000 fans would usually have shown up to watch Dortmund face Schalke 04 in one of soccer's fiercest rivalries but instead the lone sounds were coaches and players yelling out instructions and clapping encouragement and shrieks of pain from players when fouled. The first goal in any game came at Dortmund and from the most likely contender, Erling Braut Haaland. The 19-year-old deftly deflected Thorgan Hazard's cross with his left foot in the 29th minute as Dortmund thrashed Schalke 4-0 to move within a point of idle leader Bayern Munich.Erling Braut Haaland celebrates after scoring for Borussia Dortmund Saturday. He celebrated with a dance at a distance from his teammates, devoid of much noise. When Dortmund medical staff attended to Haaland on the pitch in the second half, they also wore masks. A mask was given to Dortmund's Thomas Delaney when he was substituted in the 67th minute. The customary celebration post game from Dortmund players -- arms being raised and lowered -- happened but not while holding hands with teammates and when Haaland spoke after the game to the Bundesliga, the microphone was covered with something looking like cling film. The new normal in soccer. \"It was an extremely painful afternoon,\" Schalke midfielder Daniel Caligiuri told his club's website. \"None of us were at our best today. We obviously missed the support of the fans, but we have to just accept the situation.\" Things could changeDespite games proceeding as the Bundesliga seeks to complete the season, things could change at any moment. Substitutes were kept well apart and wore masks. If players test positive for the virus, matches will be canceled. It happened in the league's second tier when two Dynamo Dresden players tested positive, prompting Sunday's clash against Hannover to be scrapped. Augsburg manager Heiko Herrlich missed Saturday's 2-1 Bundesliga loss to Wolfsburg, meanwhile, for breaking quarantine rules when he bought toothpaste.But Saturday's play in the world's most popular sport was bound to be respite for many, if only temporarily, as the coronavirus continues to rage. Visit our football page for more news and videos\"To have the possibility to discuss whether it was a penalty or not, to discuss whether it was a handball or not...all these things can bring back a little bit of normality for a few hours for a lot of people,\" said Aehlig, whose club hosts Mainz on Sunday. \"I hope it will give a positive feeling to people for their own lives.\"CNN's Ben Church contributed to this story",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Dozens of babies born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers are trapped in lockdown and unable to join their adoptive parents abroad as the country's borders remain closed, a prominent Ukrainian lawmaker said Thursday.Lyudmila Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament's human rights ombudsman, said in a briefing on Thursday that she is working with the country's Foreign Ministry to help their parents get permits to enter the country, whose borders are shut due to the coronavirus pandemic. BioTexCom, a reproduction clinic, said in a video posted online that 46 babies are currently in its care at the Hotel Venice, a facility in Kiev that parents from US, UK, Spain and other countries are hoping to reach so they can take home children born of surrogate mothers.\"We ask other countries to make an exception from their policy and to let their citizens to unite with their children,\" BioTexCom lawyer Denis Herman said in the video.The clinic's video, which BioTexCom said was an attempt to raise awareness about the matter, has gone viral.Read MoreUkraine's borders are still shut due to the pandemic, leaving dozens of babies trapped at the clinic.In total, around 100 babies are stranded in reproduction clinics across the country, according to Denisova, who visited the center. If borders in Ukraine remain closed, about 1,000 children could be stranded, she said in a Thursday briefing, citing BioTexCom estimates.Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN that the country's borders remain closed in accordance with law, but that foreign nationals looking to resolve issues related to returning their children to their home country can send a request through their embassies to seek an exception.The clip has revived a debate in Ukraine about the ethics of commercial surrogacy, with some officials and human rights activists renewing calls on the government to ban the practice.Ukraine is one of the countries in the world that has not outlawed commercial surrogacy, and its clinics offer competitive prices compared with other countries. Ukraine also saw a surge in demand in 2015, after several countries in Asia banned the practice. Surrogacy laws vary by state in the US.More on the coronavirusLatest developments on the pandemicWhat Uganda's transport ban means for domestic violenceThe global tourism catastrophe is only beginningWhy this generation will be the hardest-hit by the falloutTrack cases around the worldDenisova, the ombudsman, has been a critic of the industry, saying in a Facebook post Wednesday that BioTexCom's video shows Ukraine's surrogacy industry advertises babies as a \"high quality product\" to prospective parents. \"Children in Ukraine must not be subject to human trafficking,\" Denisova wrote, adding that she proposes to change the laws in order to allow only Ukrainians use such services.BioTexCom, which is one of the higher-profile providers in Ukraine, was previously the subject of news reports for allegedly mistreating surrogate mothers. The company did not return CNN's multiple calls for comment, but Albert Tochilovskyi, the head of the clinic, addressed the criticism in an interview with a local outlet, Ukrainski Novini.\"Honestly, we caused some hype around this and drew attention, but I think this is a success,\" Tochilovskyi said. \"Now the issue will be resolved, the officials are paying attention ... Even though it provoked a storm of rage in some people, the problem will be solved.\" Tochilovskyi said he agrees that some regulations could be imposed in Ukraine, like increasing the cost of licenses the clinic must obtain to become a provider, but added he is \"fine with the current situation in Ukraine.\"Denis Lapin in Kiev contributed to this report.",

He won the African Player of the Year award four times and helped Cameroon win its first ever gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.The man who once teamed with other greats such as Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho at Barcelona became famous for his play on the field, but here in Cameroon, he's regarded for more than just his sporting prowess.

Through the foundation that he started in 2006, Eto'o has also funded the development and training for many of Cameroon's promising young footballers.\"We tried to create dreams,\" Eto'o explained, naming a number of former academy players who now play for European teams.Tchokote Gassi Christian hopes to join that list. He is one of the aspiring pro footballers receiving funding from the foundation. \"I was not born to a wealthy family, so it was often difficult to come back from training and find a meal ready to help me recuperate ...

Samuel Eto'o, who has been outspoken about racism in football, was among many well-known Africans who condemned that thinking, calling the comments \"colonialism,\" and expressing his frustration on social media.Although he's confined to his home in Paris during the pandemic, he has deployed his foundation to deliver \"Stop Covid-19\" kits that contain masks, soap, rice, water and other items to help people in Cameroon stay home and stay sanitized.

The foundation also distributed 22,000 washable masks to motorbike and taxi drivers, according to Happi.  While the world was a different place when Eto'o was back in Cameroon, he still spoke about facing adversity in his country head-on. \"I like challenges and I especially like success,\" the football legend said. \"So for me, motivation is: I am done here, what do I do tomorrow?

F\u00e9licien Kabuga, \"one of the world's most wanted fugitives\" who is alleged to have been a leading figure in the 1994 genocide against Tutsi and moderate Hutus in Rwanda, was arrested Saturday in a joint operation with French authorities, the United Nations (UN) said in a statement.  The 84-year-old was living under a false identity in a flat in Asni\u00e8res-Sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, according to a press release from the public prosecutor and regional police. He was arrested on Saturday morning by French gendarmes, France's Justice Ministry told Reuters.

An estimated 300,000 of the genocide's victims were children. In addition, 95,000 children were orphaned.Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus, in some cases slaughtering families in their homes and burning down churches with people inside.The violence erupted after a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu, was shot down on April 6, 1994.\"For international justice, Kabuga's arrest demonstrates that we can succeed when we have the international community's support,\" Brammertz said.",

But now, eight weeks on, her two-bedroom bungalow in Norfolk, eastern England, is so packed with succulents, cacti and other breeds of house plant that she has to move several pallets of plants out of the way just to get into her bed at night. Notman shares her home with partner Byron and daughter Maggie -- who is enjoying having so many plants around.Notman, who lives with her partner, Byron, and 11-month-old daughter, Maggie, initially brought 2,000 plants home from her store, the Leslie Terrance Home Gift and Garden shop, after taking the decision to close it a day before the UK-wide lockdown was announced on March 23.But since selling out of them she has now ordered in and sold 12,000 plants from her home in total, after a surge in online orders.And now her home is now so packed with plants, on every possible surface, that they are hanging on drainpipes, from the curtain rails, and even in the shower. Read More\"We closed the shop and ferried all the plants to my house,\" she told CNN.  \"And now because we've had so many orders I've had to order more.\"We live in the middle of nowhere down a little road and have had to get lorries to drop them off at the top of the road, and then I've had to go backwards and forwards with Maggie in in the car,\" she said.Baby Maggie is used to having lots of plants around -- just not quite this many.\"I had a big enough collection (of plants) as it was, let alone with this lot in here.\"Little Maggie is used to being surrounded by plants, Notman said -- albeit not usually by this many, and now the couple are having to ensure the plants don't get left on the floor in case she tries to eat them or accidentally knocks them over. Looking after the plants at home is a 24-hour operation, Notman added.\"It's mad -- I spend most of the day packing (orders) and then when my daughter goes to bed I put more stock online, and then in the morning -- because they are quite high-maintenance plants -- I have to go round tending to them.\"I've got into a habit now of sometimes doing it as I go, when I'm cooking tea or something, and when I'm in the shower I end up plucking the plants!

        "content": "(CNN)It's an experiment and the stakes couldn't be higher. The eyes of the world will be on the German Bundesliga this weekend as it becomes the first major European soccer league to return amid the coronavirus pandemic. The country has 174,098 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with 7,861 deaths, according to the latest figures, but Germany's Football Association (DFB) has worked closely with league organizers (DFL) and hope strict safety protocols will protect those involved when matches are played. If the measures work, it could provide a template for other sports to get back underway. If they don't, then questions will be asked as to why football returned so soon. Philipp K\u00f6ster, chief editor of soccer publication '11 Freunde,' puts it more bluntly -- German football is on \"parole.\"Read More\"This is an experiment with an unknown outcome,\" K\u00f6ster told CNN's Fred Pleitgen. \"It could indeed happen that we see two or more weeks of football and then everything gets canceled [...] if there are many infections or serious infections.\"READ: Chaos beckons as European soccer season is devastated by coronavirusBayern Munich striker Thomas Mueller wears a face mask as he leaves a training session.Soccer's new lookIt's an experiment which will involve no supporters, the component that provides the sport with its pageantry and emotion. As the saying goes: football without fans Is nothing.Germany's top-flight division regularly attracts an average of 43,300 people every game, but no more than 322 will be able to attend matches until the end of the season, with matches to be played behind closed doors. The select few allowed to attend games will then be split into three distinct zones -- the stadium exterior and interior as well the stands.Only 98 people (including players, coaches and referees) will be allowed around the pitch itself with a further 115 in the stands (including journalists, hygiene staff and emergency services) and 109 more outside of that (consisting mainly of security guards).A timetable will limit who is permitted into the stadium at any one time, including the staggered arrival of the teams around 90 minutes before kickoff. \"The matches will feel different,\" said DFL CEO Christian Seifert. \"After the first match-day we will all know why we prefer games with fans.\"\"But that is the framework we have to operate in, and I expect the best possible sport within this framework.\"READ: Dynamo Dresden's game canceled after positive coronavirus testsBorussia Moenchegladbach has filled its stadium with cut-outs of supporters. Widespread testingOn the face of it, the DFL guidelines for football's new normal appear to have covered every eventuality. Everyone must practice social distancing, and players should alternate their time spent in the dressing room, while keeping 1.5 meters apart and continuing to wear a face mask. Hygiene staff will be on hand to disinfect the dressing rooms once the players have left for the pitch where the pre-match handshakes and team photos are among some of the pleasantries scrapped. The balls themselves will be disinfected before the match, and ball-boys (over the age of 16) will continue to clean them during games.The same goes for players and coaches on the substitutes bench who must sit at least one seat apart from each other and continue to wear masks where possible. Teams will now be able to use five substitutions per game to cope with the congested fixture list.Ahead of Saturday afternoon, all teams have been isolated in seven-day training camps where the DFL has demanded similarly strict safety protocols.Players will be tested at least twice a week throughout the season, needing a negative result before traveling to the stadium to play.Nonetheless, the decision to bring football back in Germany was dealt a further blow this week after two players from Dynamo Dresden tested positive for the coronavirus.Dresden's second-tier game against Hannover on May 17 won't be contested as a result, and the entire team has gone into a two-week quarantine. There have also been three confirmed cases at top-flight side FC Koln but the first-team has been able to continue training according to the hygiene and infection control measures. \"It's free for every player to say they want to be part of it or they don't want to be part of it,\" FC Koln's head of football Frank Aehlig told CNN Sport ahead of the restart. \"It was very important to talk to them and show them all the things in the concept [DFL protocols] and how it can work if we fulfill it.\"READ: Cut-out fans and virtual menus mark the new normal for German footballJUST WATCHEDCOPA90: Derby Days - FC Union Berlin v Hertha BSCReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCOPA90: Derby Days - FC Union Berlin v Hertha BSC 03:33Audience of billions A restricted number of television crews will be permitted inside the stadium with a potentially huge global audience keen for their first taste of competition for months. \"The Bundesliga is now the first major league in the world to resume playing,\" Bayern Munich chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Sport Bild.\"And if the Bundesliga is the only league around the world to be broadcast on TV, then I assume that we will have an audience of billions all over the world.\"DFL's Seifert previously said clubs in the country's top two leagues stood to lose a total of $823 million if the season couldn't be completed, through losses in television rights, advertising and ticket sales.However, a new survey by ARD Deutschlandtrend found 56% of respondents were critical of the league's resumption and just 31% favored the restart.On the pitch, there will be plenty of interest in what promises to be a fascinating end to a season with all still to play for.Reigning champion Bayern Munich leads the table but has a number of rivals in hot pursuit. Borussia Dortmund sits just four points behind in second place, with RB Leipzig and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach also within reach of the title with nine games remaining. Meanwhile, Werder Bremen and SC Paderborn are anchored to the foot of the league but can both reach safety.The DFL has confirmed there will be relegation in the top two divisions if the season can be completed and the deadline for season can be extended beyond June 30 if necessary.

        "content": "London (CNN)Six in ten LGBTI people in Europe avoid holding hands in public for fear of discrimination, according to a major EU survey that lays bare the everyday inequalities faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people and the lack of progress made in stemming it.The study, which interviewed 140,000 people across Europe, found that 43% of LGBT people had been discriminated against in the past year -- an increase of 6% on the agency's previous survey in 2012. That trend was even more pronounced for trans people, six in 10 of whom said they had experienced discrimination -- up from 43%.Authors say the survey, by the EU's Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), is the largest of its kind ever carried out. Its findings highlight how in 2020, LGBT people in every European country continue to face difficulties in the workplace, while socializing and even while walking down the street.\"The results show little progress over the past seven years,\" FRA director Michael O'Flaherty wrote in the foreword. \"Imagine being afraid to hold your loved one's hand in public, skipping office banter to avoid divulging with whom you share your life, choosing the long way home to side-step potentially hostile ground, or enduring ridicule every time you show your personal identification,\" he added.Read More\"In the year 2020, these remain realities for all too many lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people across the European Union and beyond.\"Intolerance worsening in France and PolandPeople in the EU's 27 member states, as well as the United Kingdom, North Macedonia and Serbia, responded to the study.Two in five said they had been harassed in the year before they took part, while one in five trans or intersex people said they were physically or sexually attacked.Economic inequalities also shone through; a third of LGBTI people said they had trouble making ends meet, and many said they faced discrimination in other areas such as finding housing or obtaining medical treatment.A city's first pride march was meant to be a day of joy. The far right turned it into chaosAnd a strikingly small proportion of people said they have or would report harassment to authorities; the figure was as low as 4% in Romania and 5% in Hungary.\"More worryingly, we have recently witnessed within the EU anti-LGBTI incidents such as attacks on prides, the adoption of 'LGBTI ideology-free zone' declarations, fines for LGBTI-friendly advertisements and others,\" added Helena Dalli, the European Commissioner for Equality.The past decade has seen a curtailment of LGBT rights and an increase in public discrimination in some parts of Europe. In Poland, for instance, the governing Law and Justice Party has increased its use of homophobic rhetoric, pride parades have been targeted by counter-protesters, and pro-government publications have distributed stickers declaring cities an \"LGBT-free zone.\" And 68% of Polish respondents said intolerance there has increased since 2012, the largest change in any country.More than half of respondents in France also said intolerance had increased in their country. By contrast, over 70% of people in Ireland and Malta said it had declined. Ireland legalized same-sex marriage in 2015 and Malta became the first country on the continent to ban conversion therapy in 2016.But after a decade of slow progress, O'Flaherty warned that inequalities could be made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.A couple kiss during London's annual Pride Parade, which has been canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"Too many LGBTI people continue to live in the shadows, afraid of being ridiculed, discriminated or even attacked,\" he said. \"Their job and healthcare difficulties may worsen due to Covid-19. Policymakers should take note and do more to actively promote full respect for rights of LGBTI people.\"The UN sounded a similar warning on Thursday, as 96 of its member states signed a joint statement on ensuring that coronavirus relief measures do not widen structural barriers faced by LGBT people.\"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-and gender-diverse people, who are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the poor, the homeless, and those without healthcare, will be deeply impacted by the pandemic and, unless we take urgent action, this impact will be felt over generations,\" said V\u00edctor Madrigal-Borloz, the UN's Independent Expert on Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.",

The videos have since been removed from YouTube, but remain on the collective's official website.A spokesperson for 4e Oeil told CNN they started investigating Bourgoin in August 2019 after discussing his work in a Facebook group dedicated to criminal cases.Read MoreMembers of the group had their suspicions that Bourgoin had plagiarized books originally written in English and noticed dates that didn't match up or inconsistencies from one of his books to another, said the spokesperson.\"His television interviews convinced us that he was truly making it all up,\" they told CNN.Bourgoin has now admitted falsehoods, both in the press and on his personal Instagram account, and CNN has attempted to contact his representatives\"I'm ashamed to have lied, to have hidden things,\" he said in an interview with the Le Parisien on Sunday. \"It is true that when I was in the public eye I sometimes happened to embellish, to extrapolate, to exaggerate my importance because I always had the deep feeling of not really 'being loved.'\"One of the fabrications relates to a woman who was murdered in 1976 in Los Angeles, in the United States.Bourgoin had said for years it was his wife that was killed, but it was in fact a bartender he had met five or six times.\"It is completely true that I voluntarily concealed her identity,\" he said.Bourgoin also admitted making up a meeting with serial killer Charles Manson and opened up on why he is now confessing.\"This has weighed on me immensely for two, three years,\" he said. \"Very strangely, there's the relief of having told the truth, and from the shame, a will to redeem myself, to never again say nonsense like that in public.The spokesperson for \"4e Oeil\" told CNN they want Bourgoin to stop working in the field.\"We sincerely doubt that his excuses, even though he has presented them, are indeed sincere,\" they said.",

        "content": "(CNN)A fire in a hospital treating coronavirus victims claimed the lives of five patients and forced the evacuation of 150 people in the Russian city of St. Petersburg on Tuesday, further testing the Russian government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic amid a growing crisis that has reached the Kremlin's inner circle. The St. Petersburg fire broke out on the sixth floor of an intensive care unit at the St. George Hospital, killing five coronavirus patients connected to ventilating equipment, the TASS news agency reported, citing medical personnel.According to initial findings, the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a ventilator or its malfunction, state news agencies said. The Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement body, said a criminal investigation had been opened into the matter.The grim news from St. Petersburg was quickly overshadowed by the disclosure that Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's longtime spokesperson, had been hospitalized with coronavirus.  Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS that the last time he had seen the President in person was \"over a month ago,\" but the news follows the hospitalization of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin for coronavirus and is likely to intensify concerns about Putin's own health.Read MoreTuesday's fire in St. Petersburg was the second fatal incident in days involving a hospital treating coronavirus patients. On Saturday, a blaze erupted in an intensive-care wing of a Moscow coronavirus hospital, killing one person and forcing the evacuation of patients, Russian state news agencies and officials stated.First responders work at the site of the fire Tuesday. While investigations are ongoing in both incidents, a law-enforcement official told TASS that officials were examining the ventilators involved in Saturday's and Tuesday's incidents, saying they were produced by the same Russian manufacturer.Those incidents occurred as the spread of coronavirus appears to be cresting. Russia on Tuesday reported 10,899 more coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 232,243. The country is now ranked second in the world for confirmed cases, behind the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Moscow is the worst hit city in Russia, with 121,301 cases.Putin under fireCoronavirus has become a cascading crisis for Putin. In March, oil prices collapsed after Saudi Arabia launched a price war against Russia, its onetime ally in energy markets. The immediate trigger was Russia's refusal to sign on to an OPEC proposal to prop up oil markets by extending production cuts. Russia and Saudi Arabia subsequently struck a new production-cut deal, but oil prices -- an important source of income for the Russian government -- are still very depressed, having been battered by the slump in economic activity caused by the pandemic.That's raised serious questions among Russia watchers about the Kremlin's ability to respond to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Putin is already under fire for refusing to tap a rainy-day fund created by previously high energy prices to revive the economy, particularly small businesses.In televised remarks Monday, Putin said his priority was \"getting the economy back on track as soon as possible.\"Putin has been leading the nation via video conference. But Putin appears distant and detached as he presides remotely over the government's response to coronavirus from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. Russians may be used to seeing an image of Putin that is carefully managed by the Kremlin's PR machine, but his appearances in video conferences project very little macho swagger.And his management style has been curiously passive. On Monday, Putin said the government would begin lifting nationwide \"non-working days\" -- the official shorthand for paid holidays for Russian employees -- around the country. But Putin has delegated the difficult work of easing lockdown to regional governors, who must decide when conditions are right to lift restrictive measures. And that's where the seriousness of the crisis is reflected: local leaders have already moved to prolong lockdown measures.That's clear in the capital, where Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that restrictions would remain in place until May 31. Moscow authorities have tightened the rules by mandating the wearing of masks and gloves in public.The reasons for this are clear: The public-health crisis has been severe. Moscow saw a year-on-year surge in its monthly mortality rate in April, as well as compared to the April average for the past decade, according to data released by the city's civil register office. In an interview on state news channel Rossiya-24, the Moscow mayor said screening studies found that infection rates were around three times higher than the officially confirmed number. And in St. Petersburg, scene of Tuesday's fire, cases also continue to rise -- according to Russia's coronavirus headquarters, the city now has 8,050 confirmed cases, adding 339 over the past 24 hours.Additional reporting by CNN's Mary Ilyushina in Moscow.",

Tomorrow we will start trying to understand what happened.\"Katja Philippart is a marine ecologist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research. She told CNN that she is investigating whether algae density may have affected the level of foam in the water. Philippart said that the levels of the algae are often blooming -- or high -- in April and May. \"At the end of a bloom, these colonies start to deteriorate, releasing the mucus into the water. Wind-driven waves that stir up the mucus-rich water result in the formation of foam. Depending on the wind direction, this foam can be blown to the coast where it then accumulates.\"The surfers were all \"very experienced watermen,\" according to the Holland Surfing Association, which posted its condolences on Facebook. \"They were robbed due to the exceptional circumstances and fate has struck: 5 of them tragically died,\" the post said. \"We express our sympathy to the relatives and everyone involved.

        "content": "London (CNN)As thousands of people returned to work across England on Wednesday morning, images of packed London Underground trains have sparked fresh criticism of the government's strategy for easing the country's seven-week lockdown.  Photos circulated on social media of commuters crowding onto congested train platforms, some without masks, or piling into crowded double-decker buses, raising questions about how Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to get the country back to work without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.  Criticism of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis was compounded over the weekend, when Johnson delivered a confusing and seemingly contradictory speech about how the country would ease its way back towards normality.Busy trains and platforms in London sparked threats of strike action from one union boss. In a pre-recorded address to the nation on Sunday night, Johnson announced that anyone who couldn't do their job from home \"should be actively encouraged to go to work\" while adding that workers \"should avoid public transport\" because there would be limited capacity on trains. Johnson also suggested that people should get to work by car, bike or on foot if possible.  Johnson's speech, which seemed to imply that people would be allowed back to work the following day, was criticized by the leader of the opposition, who said it was \"quite a thing to spring on people for tomorrow morning,\" and the chief of one trade union who described the messages as \"both confusing and disbelieving.\"  What Donald Trump can learn from Boris Johnson as coronavirus cases are found in White HouseRead MoreBy Monday morning the government was forced to clarify that people should only return to work on Wednesday, while the other nations in the United Kingdom told people they should continue to remain at home.  In London, as with any major urban area, many people work in the service industry, and many will not have their own mode of transport, so the scenes of packed Tube carriages were somewhat inevitable given Johnson's guidance. And while the government on Tuesday advised people to wear masks in enclosed spaces, they are not mandatory.  At Wednesday afternoon's weekly session of Prime Minister's Questions, Johnson expressed concern at the number of commuters using London's public transport network, and said the government was urging people to avoid traveling during rush hour. While some commuters wore masks, some didn't. \"We are working very actively with TfL [Transport for London] to ensure that what we do is we have more capacity, we discourage people from going to work during the peak, and that operators -- particularly TfL -- lay on more tube trains when those are necessary throughout the day,\" Johnson told lawmakers in parliament.He is likely to find stiff opposition to this suggestion. Mick Cash, general secretary of the powerful Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, said transport workers would go on strike if better protections weren't put into place.  \"If our members aren't safe, we're saying to them, put yourself in a place of safety and refuse to work,\" Cash told Sky News. \"We're talking about keeping passengers as well as staff safe ... crowded trains, crowded platforms, crowded buses are actually not safe for anybody and we could risk more people getting the Covid-19 virus and actually make the situation worse.\"UK railway ticket office worker dies from Covid-19 after being spat onThe outcry on England's first proper day out of lockdown is more bad news for Johnson after returning to work following a life-threatening bout of the coronavirus. The criticism of his handling of the outbreak is coming not only from politicians on the other side of the aisle but also from previously supportive lawmakers and commentators. And he has a new leader of the opposition in Labour's Keir Starmer, who happens to be a former director of public prosecutions, now building a political case against Johnson and his government.  The roadmap to exiting lockdown was a real chance for Johnson and his team to gets its coronavirus response back on track. If the government cannot straighten out its messaging, it might face the humiliating prospect of having to reverse its relaxation of restrictions. And that could be dangerous -- both to his political reputation and more importantly, to millions of Britons -- as the public grows increasingly weary of this crisis.",

The Swiss cyclist has chosen to house his three cobblestone trophies -- given to the winner of the prestigious French race -- in his sauna at home, as CNN Sport's Amanda Davies found out during their Instagram Live chat. Cancellara is one of only a few riders to have won the race -- famous for its rough terrain and cobblestone -- at least three times, and the decision to display the unique trophies in his sauna could come back to the hard work he put into his victories.\"Normally, in the sauna, I'm not with clothing but at the moment, it is off,\" he told Davies. \"It's a rough race, but it's a lovely race.

Besides some outliers, most events have been canceled or postponed. The Paris-Roubaix, originally set for April 12, has been rescheduled to October 25.As countries begin to recover, sport has started up again, without fans in attendance. The Tour de France is one of the sports events to be affected, moving from June 27-July 19 to August 29-September 20. The iconic French road race is typically held each year, with millions of fans lining the streets to cheer on competitors. The retired Cancellara, who won seven individual stages of the Tour de France, believes the race can certainly be held without fans, as French regulations may dictate, as some athletes block out fans when they are concentrating fully. Cancellara poses with one of his two gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.\"When a sports athlete is in his tunnel of concentration, sometimes he doesn't even see or hear fans because he is so in the mode of concentration that energy is only for that,\" the two-time Olympic gold medalist said. \"And if you go to the podium and there are no fans, of course it looks strange but everyone knows the situation.\"Professional football in Korea started its 2020 season last weekend and the German Bundesliga is scheduled to restart this weekend.

        "content": "(CNN)When he played football, Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar was known for his prodigious ability to stop, deflect and parry nearly everything that came his way. But for all the occasions he came to the salvation of his sides, has the former Manchester United shot stopper pulled off a more surprising save by coming to Liverpool's defense? The global coronavirus pandemic could deny United's bitter rival Liverpool a first English Premier League title if the season cannot be played to its conclusion, despite holding a 25-point lead over nearest challengers Manchester City.On Monday, the UK government offered some clarity, by publishing a 50-page guidance document detailing how England hopes to ease lockdown measures.However, a number of leading players notably Sergio Aguero, as well as Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling have raised concerns about the Premier League's return. Before the season was interrupted, the Premier League had been due to conclude on May 17.When it comes to the resumption of professional sport, the UK government document confirmed that nothing can take place, even behind closed doors, in England until June 1 at the earliest. There are still 92 games left to play in the EPL.Read MoreItalian soccer league should 'finish properly,' says Alessandro Del PieroREAD: 30 years of dreaming: Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football's biggest prize\"In my view, with the type of football they played and the points they are ahead, it would be extremely harsh,\" Van der Sar tells CNN Sport. \"The Premier League is a well-run league and of course there are big interests on the financial side, the commercial sides,\" he continues. \"But I'm sure they will make a wise decision if they keep on playing or if the league stops, what the results will be depending for Champions League places, relegation or awarding a title to Liverpool.\"If the league doesn't resume, I presume everybody will be OK if Liverpool wins the title.\"It's a far cry from the opinion espoused by his former teammate Gary Neville who -- with tongue in cheek -- recently noted that while it would be \"ridiculous\" not to award Liverpool the title, \"I'd have my little asterisk T-shirt printed ... just for a bit of fun\" if Jurgen Klopp's was essentially handed the league by default. Yet Neville's opinion is possibly one shared by many football fans, rather than Van der Sar's stance, which some might view as unlikely as looking out of the window and seeing cats chasing dogs down the street.Van der Sar holds up the Champions League trophy after Manchester United beat Chelsea in the final on May 21, 2008.READ: Chaos beckons as European soccer season is devastated by pandemicUnited in his beliefVan der Sar represented United with distinction from 2005 to 2011, winning four Premier League titles and the Champions League, and cannot help but observe the recent progress the Red Devils had been making under another former United star before football came to a sudden halt in March.Current United boss Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r made management look ridiculously easy when he succeeded Jose Mourinho in the Old Trafford dugout at the end of 2018. The Norwegian won 10 of his first 11 matches as caretaker manager and went on to win 14 out of 19 games -- including a memorable Champions League victory against Paris Saint-Germain -- before being appointed permanently in March 2019. For the remainder of the year, league victories were harder to come by but in 2020 there was an uptick in form, with United moving to fifth in the league thanks to four league wins in five matches which came as part of an 11-match unbeaten run. \"The honeymoon period was great,\" Van der Sar recalls of Solskj\u00e6r's time in charge. \"Then they hit a rocky patch and I think the last seven, eight, nine weeks, they've been playing better football. The points were coming in. They had some good results against good teams also. \"Of course, for them, I hope that the league is going to resume because they probably will need those Champions League places. I think the main thing for them is to focus on the next season and hopefully with two or three additions, they'll be competitive again to Liverpool and Manchester City.\"Edwin Van der Sar in action for Manchester United.READ: Italian soccer league should 'finish properly,' says Alessandro Del PieroBut just what will it take for the club -- which lifted 13 Premier League titles, before being starved of success following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013 -- to start wining again?\"Consistency, a winning mentality,\" believes Van der Sar, who hopes that \"maybe they can solve what's going to happen with Paul [Pogba], is he going to stay? \"I'm sure that with De Gea, with Maguire, with Fernandes, with Rashford, with Martial, they have a good line, I think, in the middle. And besides that, they've also a lot of young players developing as always at United, so in that way I'm positive for next season for them.\"While that sounds more in keeping with the role required to run the Old Trafford club from the boardroom -- a position the Dutch great has previously ruled himself out of -- Van der Sar is more focused on his current day job at Ajax, the club he returned to as CEO in 2016.Van der Sar poses at the Johan Cruyff ArenA in Amsterdam.READ: Paris Saint-Germain named French Ligue 1 champion after season canceledThe Dutch Eredivisie recently decided to end the season without crowning a champion for the first time in the league's 64-year history. With nine matches left to play, Ajax was top of the table, albeit on goal difference from AZ Alkmaar, but would have been considered favorite to win a staggering 35th league title and sixth in the past 10 years. Van der Sar notes the players and supporters are \"disappointed,\" but \"we know health is important and there's no way to finish the league.\"Ever the realist, Van der Sar realizes that even with the Bundesliga in Germany returning on May 16 -- a scenario the Premier League would reportedly like to replicate -- it pales in significance compared to a country's priorities. \"How do you test players if staff from hospitals or bus drivers or teachers are lacking those tests?\" he wonders. \"So that will be more like an ethical question.\"\"Five seconds too long\"Van der Sar, 49, exudes the same no-nonsense approach as he did when organizing his defenders.Weighing in on the impending transfer window he says \"it will be difficult for the first club who was going to sign a player for a substantial amount of money\" and admits Ajax cannot rely solely on TV revenue, adding \"at most our income is from supporters, from business, from corporate boxes ... so we rely immensely on filling a stadium.\" Ajax players dejected after losing their UEFA Champions League semi-final against Tottenham on May 8, 2019.READ: Premier League under pressure over Saudi stake in soccer club takeoverHis unwavering belief in manager Erik ten Hag's squad to deliver trophies at the highest level is evident.

And that way, it's been amazing.\"An eventual return to the pitch for Ajax, and the rest of the world's sides, will surely feel just as amazing in its own special way.",

No 'one size fits all' solution Barring the anomaly of Belarus, football across the continent has been on lockdown since mid-March.As countries begin embarking on phased reopenings, leagues are having to delicately navigate how and if to end the current season.Whilst there's a strong desire by European governing body UEFA to see domestic competitions through to their completion, the menu of best worst-case restart options is largely unpalatable.And for some the consequences proved too hard to swallow.Last month, the Dutch Eredivisie declared its season effectively null and void.Ajax was on course to lift its 35th title, though there'll now be no champion crowned for the first time in the league's 64-year history.\"Of course (we were) disappointed,\" former goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who is now the club's chief executive, told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell.\"At the end of your career, you always look at how many league titles you won [...] and so that's why for the club, it's maybe understandable that [...] the players would have rather [...] seen it differently.\" To add insult to injury, there'll be no relegation from and no promotion to the top-flight -- a decision which led Cambuur head coach Henk de Jong to call it \"the biggest disgrace in the history of Dutch sports.\"De Jong's side were 11 points clear at the top of the Eerste Divisie (Dutch second division) and primed for the big time.That dream has been snatched from them, and a legal challenge against the ruling has followed suit with a final decision pending.READ: Potential Premier League return divides fans at top and bottomAjax was denied the Dutch title after the current season was scrapped. Brewing discontentThe picture is equally fraught in France where the top-two divisions were ended through a weighted points-per-game system.Whilst Paris Saint-Germain can now toast a third successive Ligue 1 title, discontent is brewing.Lyon, who finished seventh and have subsequently missed out on European football for the first time since 1997, announced on Friday it is taking action against the French League's (LFP) decision to end the season, by first going to the Administrative Court of Paris.Meanwhile Amiens, who finished second from bottom, has launched a petition calling for the league (LFP) to review its decision to relegate the club -- one which is \"fraught with consequences that goes against fairness in sport.\"Across the Channel, the UK has recorded the most number of COVID-19 deaths in Europe, jeopardizing England's Premier League hopes of resuming the season.Proposals by the league to conclude the season at several neutral grounds have reportedly been met with a less than enthusiastic response.Sports lawyer Daniel Geey explained that whilst each league is governed by its own constitutional and contractual relationships, all face a fine balance between pragmatism and satisfying its members in the fairest way possible.He told CNN Sport: \"It's imperative to prepare and plan with the possibility that things might not go to plan [...] You have this football ecosystem of lots of different stakeholders trying their best to mitigate against what is a completely unforeseen situation.\"The reasonableness and proportional aspects will play a part of the rationale [...] Would a reasonable league administrator come to a decision which it believes resulted in the fairest, most proportionate and non-discriminatory outcome for all of its league participants.\"READ: Paris Saint-Germain named French Ligue 1 champion after season canceledJUST WATCHEDSadio Mane's journey from Senegal to the top of the footballing worldReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSadio Mane's journey from Senegal to the top of the footballing world 02:30Big financial hitStriking a balance, though, between upholding sporting integrity and preserving financial sustainability has never been more important.Van der Sar is under no illusions that there'll be a \"big hit\" for everyone involved with income streams from broadcast deals to commercial and matchday revenue drying up like never before.Although clubs in the world's richest league -- England's Premier League -- enjoy the spoils of a multibillion-dollar domestic TV rights deal, it is they who stand to lose the most in this crisis.Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has calculated that should the season be scrapped, domestic broadcasters could be entitled to an eye-watering rebate of almost $1 billion.\"A lot of that money has already been advanced by the TV companies to the Premier League, who has then distributed it to the clubs,\" Maguire told CNN Sport.\"So the clubs will be in this real pincer movement in the sense that they're going to have to pay money back but they've got no money coming in to pay that money back.\"And what about wages?According to Maguire, they have increased a staggering 2,811% since the league's inception in the 1992-93 season.Although a handful of clubs have negotiated wage reductions or deferrals during this period, Maguire did not believe an umbrella wage cap would be introduced any time soon.\"If you are one of the elite clubs in the big six you're competing against Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich. PSG and so on. If there isn't one being applied against your peer group across the rest of Europe, then you're going to be at a competitive disadvantage.\"Whilst football is big business behind the numbers are livelihoods at all levels of the game.Pfannenstiel is one of 60,000 people employed in the Bundesliga. The consequences of not playing football, he said, posed a very real question of survival.\"If there would be no football played for many, many months or [...] the unthinkable would have happened not till the end of the year, then of course, for every club in the big leagues, it would have been very difficult,\" he said.READ: Premier League under pressure over Saudi stake in soccer club takeoverThe German Bundesliga is set to return behind closed doors later this month. Return to normalityDespite the gloomy outlook, glimmers of light are emerging.Following government approval, Germany is set to be the first of European football's big leagues to return to action on May 16 -- albeit with strict caveats in place.Games will be played behind closed doors with around 300 people present on matchdays, and there'll be extensive testing and monitoring of staff.Pfannenstiel, though, said it was a step towards returning to normality.  \"We [clubs, footballers, individuals] have now this big responsibility that all the requirements of the [hygienic and health] concepts are implemented,\" he said. \"That is an unbelievable amount of discipline. It's really up to us [...] to get some blood into the veins of this concept.\" Basic rules involving social distancing -- washing of hands, wearing of face masks -- will be followed with \"full discipline\" and players have been kept up to speed with the very latest information through virtual workshops to alleviate any lingering doubts.Getting complete buy in, though, across the board on moral, medical and ethical grounds, presents perhaps the biggest challenge of all.There's an acute awareness that whilst football's return may boost morale it should not come at the cost of taking away vital resources for key workers at such a critical time.\"How do you test players if still staff from hospitals or bus drivers or teachers are lacking those tests? I think it's most important that if you want to start a country, that you also look at other professions and not only professional sports,\" said Van der Sar.Manchester City star Sergio Aguero has spoken of Premier League players being \"scared\" about a possible return to action with COVID-19 still a threat whilst it has been reported that doctors from the 20 clubs have emailed the league listing around 100 questions and issues over returning to training.READ: 30 years of dreaming: Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football's biggest prizeSergio Aguero (C) celebrates with teammates Bernardo Silva and David Silva after scoring against Watford in an EPL match.

My son, Alex, is used to me traveling so our goodbyes were relaxed and I was content, sure that if I needed to, I'd be able to just jump on a plane and catch up with them.Coronavirus DiariesHow a crazy life prepared me for Covid-19 by AnneClaire StapletonCoronavirus shaped our relationship by Ivan WatsonSweden was supposed to be 'normal' but felt reckless by Sebastian ShuklaCoronavirus and shingles left me so alone by Sarah JorgensenI just wanted a break but got stuck with my parents by Julia Hollingsworth More CNN coronavirus diaries ...In the days after they left, I kept convincing myself that it would be fine, that there was no way Turkey would just stop all flights. But it did. My heart sank when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced \"international flights have ended.\" That was the moment when all those \"what ifs\" and worst-case scenarios started racing through my head. What if there's an emergency? What if I cannot get to them? What if they can't get to me?Read MoreClosed shops and empty spaces at Istanbul's airport.After a couple of weeks of separation and self-isolation, I had to get back with my family. But with shut borders and airports it seemed impossible. Until my hours on Twitter proved fruitful, with advisories from the UK and US embassies about commercial flights still operating out of Istanbul for those who wanted to leave.Qatar Airways was up and running with a #Takingyouhome campaign. Ticket prices were significantly higher than usual but I booked my route to London via Doha.The thought of going through airports and sitting on planes at a time like this was terrifying, so I packed my carry-on with the essentials for traveling during a global pandemic: several masks, hand sanitizer, gloves and surface wipes.Social distancing was encouraged at Istanbul's airport with signs on seats,The night before the flight I woke up several times, and nervously took my temperature, knowing that there were already fever checks in place at Istanbul airport. Then the next morning I woke again to a message that the flight has been delayed.  And from there it went from bad to worse. Another delay, then another, then what I really did not want to hear -- the flight was canceled.   With weekend lockdowns and age-specific restrictions, Turkey takes a different coronavirus approachMentally, I was prepared for the trip, the risks, the restrictions, the unknown -- but I was not ready for this. I just wanted to see my family and the weeks of bottling up all the anxieties and emotions came rolling out with a flood of tears.My booking was moved to the next scheduled flight. My husband, Matt, on the other end of the phone kept saying, \"It's OK, it's just another five days.\"But it wasn't. Before the next flight, Qatar Airways suspended its services out of Istanbul. Months of separation from my family was suddenly a very real possibility. I was too emotional to think clearly, but thankfully colleagues in Istanbul and Abu Dhabi helped me look up different options. We found one way out, on Belarus' national carrier via its capital, Minsk.I'll confess I had never heard of the Belavia airline before but some research and reassurance from coworkers in Moscow who'd flown with them made me decide to take the flight.I fly regularly on one of the many three and a half hour daily flights to London from Istanbul. But this journey was scheduled for 28 hours -- 22 hours of them a layover in Minsk Airport. 'Better to die standing than to live on your knees,' says Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at ice hockey matchThe flight to Minsk was almost like being in the pre-coronavirus days. Many passengers wore masks and regularly used hand sanitizer, but the flight crew seemed pretty relaxed.  They didn't all wear masks and gloves, and it did not seem like there were any attempts to enforce social distancing on board.Days earlier, Belarus's longtime President Alexander Lukashenko had been dismissive of the pandemic's severity. He suggested drinking vodka and going for the traditional sauna to protect one against the virus It was a similar story at Minsk Airport -- no temperature checks or social distancing guidelines, a far cry from the strict measures of Turkey where masks are mandatory.But Belarus does impose 14 days of compulsory quarantine for anyone entering the country, so remaining in the airport was the only option for transiting passengers like me.In the transit area, people were spaced out simply because there weren't that many passengers around. But there was no way I was going to sit in a communal area for 22 hours. I am a journalist and I usually enjoy exploring new places even if it's just a country's airport. But this time, all I wanted to do was find a corner and hide.So I rented a \"sleep box\" -- a little wooden cabin in the middle of the airport. It offered a bed, an electrical outlet and social distancing -- all that I needed!The bed had disposable linens, but I still covered the pillow with my scarf.A place to rest and charge a phone amid a 22-hour layover.It was a long 22 hours. I was counting the hours to seeing my family and trying not to think of all the things that could still go wrong. A Turkish friend joked I could become stranded like Tom Hanks in \"The Terminal\" but I didn't want to even think of that. There was always the possibility my onwards flight would not materialize, so Matt and I had decided not to tell Alex I was coming until I landed in the UK.I sat around the corner from the gate long before other passengers or airline staff showed up. Anxiously I watched the information board and almost burst into tears when it was time to get on.The flight was pretty empty but again seemed to be business as usual, with the exception of a \"Public Health Locator Form\" we were given to fill out, to allow health officers to contact you if a communicable disease was later found to have been on board.We touched down at Gatwick, the airport south of London that hosts many holiday charter flights. I used to fly into there regularly when I was based in Libya and I remember the long waits for baggage surrounded by hundreds of British holidaymakers in flip flops and shorts and children running around screaming and laughing. This was a very different Gatwick. A desolate place. As we got off the plane, we were greeted by armed police officers spread out across the terminal. Elevators and escalators were turned off, ATMs were out of service and currency exchange shops shuttered. With no other flights, our baggage was straight out.Normally bustling, Gatwick's south terminal arrivals hall was near empty last month.But finally, more than 30 hours after I left my Istanbul apartment, there was my husband, waiting for me in a stunningly quiet arrivals hall. We have had no airport pick-up like this one -- no hugs, not even a touch. I had been in public places and on planes for two days. The hugs and surprising Alex would have to wait until after a shower and change of clothes.As we walked out to the car, down deserted stairwells and through empty parking lots, I realized I was still holding my pandemic tracing form. No one had asked me for it.",

Peskov told the TASS news agency later on Tuesday that the last time the two men met in person was \"over a month ago.\"Three Russian ministers have previously tested positive for the virus, including Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, who is still in hospital, as well as Minister of Culture Olga Lyubimova and Minister of Housing Vladimir Yakushev.Putin and Peskov pictured in Moscow in December. Peskov's announcement comes as Russia struggles to contain its outbreak of the coronavirus. The country now has more confirmed cases -- 232,000 -- than anywhere in the world outside of the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Read MoreWhile the country's official death toll is relatively low, with more than 2,000 fatalities reported, some critics and experts say the figure is almost certainly underestimated. Moscow's mortality rate surged by 18% in April compared to the same month last year, as well as compared to the April average for the past decade, according to data released by the city's civil register office. The situation has led to growing anger in the country, with concerns raised about the conditions in which medical workers are forced to operate.Russia hospital fire kills five ventilated coronavirus patients, state media reportsHours before Peskov confirmed his diagnosis, a fire at a hospital in Russia left at least five coronavirus patients dead. The fire broke out on the sixth floor of an intensive care unit at the St. George Hospital in St. Petersburg, killing five people connected to ventilating equipment, TASS reported, citing medical personnel.According to initial findings, the fire may have been caused by a short circuit in a ventilator or its malfunction, state news agencies said.It was the second deadly blaze at a medical facility in recent days; on Saturday, another fire at a Moscow hospital killed one person and forced the evacuation of patients, Russian state news agencies reported.Before those incidents, three frontline health care workers fell out of hospital windows in Russia over the space of two weeks, heightening public attention to the working conditions for doctors and medical professionals.All three incidents, which are being investigated by Russian law enforcement authorities, prompted intense discussion in the Russian press and on social media.",

        "content": "(CNN)A British railway ticket office worker has died from Covid-19 after being spat on while she was working at Victoria station in central London. Belly Mujinga, 47, was working with a colleague when a member of the public assaulted them, spat and coughed over them and said he had the novel coronavirus, said her union, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), in a statement Tuesday.Mujinga, who had an underlying health condition, was working for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) on the station concourse at the time of the incident on March 22.British Transport Police said in a statement to CNN that an investigation into the incident had been launched.  Black people in the UK four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, new data showsRead More\"Belly and her colleague begged to be let to work from inside the building with a protective barrier between them and the public for the rest of that day,\" TSSA said in its statement. \"Management said they needed people working outside and sent them back out onto the concourse for the rest of their shift.\" Both women went back outside and completed their shift, added the union, but they had no personal protective equipment.Mujinga had underlying respiratory problems for which she had had an operation, regular hospital appointments and had previously needed to take time off work, according to TSSA. The union says GTR knew about her condition and, even after the incident, only stood Mujinga down after her doctor called her work around March 25.Manuel Cortes, TSSA general secretary, accused GTR of not taking Mujinga's assault \"seriously enough\" and criticized the company. \"As a vulnerable person in the 'at risk' category and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why GTR didn't stand her down from front line duties early on in this pandemic,\" Cortes said in the TSSA statement. \"There are serious questions about her death, it wasn't inevitable.\"GTR is investigating the accusations, it said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday, adding it takes the allegations \"extremely seriously.\"Boris Johnson accused of botching announcement of new UK lockdown rules\"The safety of our customers and staff, who are key workers themselves, continues to be front of mind at all times and we follow the latest Government advice,\" Angie Doll, managing director at Southern Railway and Gatwick Express, said in the statement.   \"We are devastated that our dedicated colleague Belly has passed away and our deepest sympathies are with her family, with whom we have been in touch through this very difficult time,\" she also said. Both Mujinga and her colleague fell ill from Covid-19 within days of the assault, according to TSSA. On April 2 -- just 11 days after the incident -- Mujinga was taken to Barnet Hospital, north London, in an ambulance and put on a ventilator.\"Belly died on 5 April, 14 days after she was assaulted at Victoria station,\" TSSA said. She leaves behind an 11-year-old daughter and a husband, who last saw her when she was taken away by ambulance, the union added.\"We are shocked and devastated at Belly's death,\" Cortes said in the TSSA statement. The union said it is taking legal advice on the situation and supporting Mujinga's family and colleagues.Is Britain's minority community disproportionately affected by the coronavirus? Lack of public data makes it difficult to answerIt also reported the incident to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail (ORR).An ORR spokesperson told CNN the office is investigating the incident.TSSA revealed Mujinga's story as the British Government urged some people to return to work if they are not able do so from home, easing some of the restrictions it had put in place to stop the spread of Covid-19. The union says there is not enough guidance or protection for workers on the front line, such as Mujinga.\"Rather than talking about the easing the lockdown, the government must first ensure that the right precautions and protections have been taken so that more lives are not lost,\" Cortes said. \"Our rail industry needs to have a very serious look at what tasks are deemed 'essential' and must put protections in place for all our members and our passengers.\"The TSSA also called on the government to implement additional measures to compensate frontline workers from the railway industry for their work during these difficult times.",

The analysis, which looked at coronavirus-related deaths registered up to April 20, also found that men and women working in social care -- a group that includes both workers in care homes and home carers -- had \"significantly raised rates of death\" involving Covid-19. Boris Johnson calls on UK to go back to work in plan to ease lockdownHowever, healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses, did not. The statistics were adjusted for age but not for factors such as ethnic group or place of residence, the ONS said.Read MoreThe United Kingdom has been one of the world's hardest-hit nations in the pandemic. More than 31,000 people have died, according to government data. Meanwhile, the government has repeatedly come under criticism for failing to reach testing targets, lack of protective gear for healthcare workers and a perceived lack of clarity when it comes to messaging. Neil Pearce, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, told the Science Media Center that the analysis showed Covid-19 is \" largely an occupational disease\" in the working age population. Noting that the findings were not adjusted for ethnic group, place of residence or pre-existing conditions, Pearce said: \"Nevertheless, the findings are striking, and emphasise that we need to look beyond health and social care, and that there is a broad range of occupations which may be at risk from Covid-19.  These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.\"On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on people across the UK to return to work if they cannot do so from home, saying: \"We now need to stress that anyone who can't work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.\"Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?Groups representing UK businesses and workers have criticized the government's plans to ease lockdown rules, complaining that the announcement lacks crucial details on how companies should prepare for a safe return to work.\"Lots of working people will feel anxious and confused after listening to Boris Johnson,\" Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, wrote on Twitter, noting that the government hasn't published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.\"So how can the (Prime Minister) \u2014 with 12-hours' notice \u2014 tell people to go back to sites and factories? It's a recipe for chaos,\" added O'Grady, whose organization represents 48 trade unions and 5.5 million workers.In a radio interview with the BBC on Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said people who cannot work from home should go back to work on Wednesday, but he declined to answer whether employees would be able to refuse to work if they did not feel secure, saying \"it's very difficult to answer that hypothetically.\"CNN's Angela Dewan, Nada Bashir and Hanna Ziady contributed to this report.",

Politicians are demanding clarity and regional leaders are breaking from Downing Street's message.The Prime Minister batted back criticism in Parliament on Monday, as his government unveiled its 50-page plan to creep out of lockdown and \"rebuild the UK for a world with COVID-19.\" Johnson has ditched the nationwide \"stay at home\" slogan and replaced it with \"stay alert,\" and said in a televised address on Sunday that everyone who was unable to work from home -- such as construction and manufacturing workers -- was now being \"actively encouraged\" to return to work.But as the country enters its eighth week under unprecedented social and economic restrictions, his call sparked confusion among many Brits about when and how they can go to work, leave their homes, or socialize. Johnson urged people to avoid public transport and stay at home if possible, leading to accusations of mixed messages. Leaders in Scotland and Wales meanwhile said they would stick to the \"stay at home\" message, and London's public transit authority said it would only be able to carry 15% of passengers even after it restores 100% of services. Read MoreAnd Johnson's deputy Dominic Raab muddied the waters further in a round of media interviews on Monday morning when he gave conflicting statements around the size and nature of gatherings that would be permitted between people from different households. \"What the country needs at this time is clarity and reassurance and at the moment both are in pretty short supply,\" opposition leader Keir Starmer told Johnson in the House of Commons on Monday. \"At the heart of the problem it seems that the Prime Minister made a statement last night before the plan was written, or at least finalized.\"Business groups and labor unions demand clarity after UK eases lockdown rulesJohnson told Parliament that as the UK starts to move towards re-opening, \"our journey has reached the most perilous moment where a wrong move could be disastrous.\" He said that at this stage the government \"can go no further than to announce the first careful modification of our measures.\"From Wednesday, people would be allowed to take unlimited outdoor exercise instead of just one trip per day, and would be allowed to sit in parks, drive to other destinations and play sports -- but only with members of their households -- Johnson said. People will also be able to meet one member of another household outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing.The next step in the plan, which will come no earlier than June 1, will include reopening schools for younger students, and a third stage planned for July will involve reopening non-essential businesses and hospitality and holding events behind closed doors.But the government warned: \"It is clear that the only feasible long-term solution lies with a vaccine or drug-based treatment.\" It said the plan was \"not a quick return to 'normality.' Nor does it lay out an easy answer. And, inevitably, parts of this plan will adapt as we learn more about the virus.\"Even in the third stage, the document warned, some \"venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove difficult to enact distancing\" may still not be able to safely re-open.It is a sobering assessment that shows a return to ordinary life may be some way off -- and may never come for some. 'Stay alert' slogan proves controversialJohnson defended his new \"Stay alert, control the virus, save lives\" slogan in Parliament as a \"valid\" piece of advice, despite criticism from opposition MPs and leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scottish Nationalist Party leader Ian Blackford said \"it is obvious that the last 24 hours has spread confusion ... mixed messaging risks lives.\"Johnson had unveiled the messaging along with an alert system ranging from level 1 to 5 to help determine how quickly measures can be relaxed without triggering a second wave of infections.A busy London Underground carriage this morning, after Boris Johnson encouraged some people to go back to work but before he advised Brits to wear face coverings in public.It was quickly disregarded by leaders in the UK's other nations. \"It is of course for him to decide what's most appropriate for England but, given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus, #StayHomeSaveLives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage,\" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted, before warning people not to travel from England to Scotland unless they have a valid reason.Her Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, said that Wales would also not be dropping the \"stay at home\" message, while Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said she will continue to promote the \"stay at home\" message, according to the PA Media.   Defending his plan on Monday, Johnson accepted that further lockdown rules might be re-applied or lifted for some parts of the UK but not others. \"If the data goes the wrong way, if the alert level begins to rise, we will have no hesitation in putting on the brakes and delaying or reintroducing measures locally, regionally, or nationally,\" he said.\"If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control the virus, keep the rate of infection down and keep the number of infections down,\" Johnson added.But in a televised response on Monday evening, Labour leader Starmer said the plans were light on details, and criticized the Prime Minister for not confirming \"when we can see our loved ones again.\" \"Many of us have questions that need answering,\" Starmer said. \"How can we be sure our workplaces are now safe to return to? How do our police enforce these rules? And why our some parts of the United Kingdom now on a different path to others?\"Raab had earlier tried and failed to smooth over the confusion. He claimed in a radio interview with the BBC that the measures had been \"clear,\" but deviated on some of the detail given by Johnson.Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?Raab refused to answer whether employees would be able to walk out of work if they felt insecure, saying \"it's very difficult to answer that hypothetically.\"\"Employers have a duty on them to provide Covid-secure settings,\" he added. Responding to a question over whether the measures create a \"two-tier\" system where \"lower earners take the risk of catching the virus and spreading it,\" Raab said that was \"not right.\"Business leaders and labor unions nonetheless demanded clarity.  Len McCluskey, Secretary-General of Britain's second-largest trade union Unite said \"millions of people\" would be \"dumbfounded\" by the government's plan. \"The Prime Minister's response last night was both confusing and disbelieving,\" McCluskey told BBC radio. \"Listening to Dominic Raab, I'm wondering why we didn't wait until we've seen the 50-page document and the guidelines that are about to come out before there was any indication about going back to work.\"Raab also confirmed that exceptions to the quarantine to include at least some arrivals from France and transporting freight. The Chief Executive of the UK Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, warned that the introduction of a quarantine period could have a \"devastating impact\" on the UK aviation industry.  \"Quarantine would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy ... if the Government believes quarantine is medically necessary, then it should be applied on a selective basis following the science, there should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated,\" Dee said.CNN's Max Ramsay, Ivana Kottasova and Simon Cullen in London contributed reporting.",

I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to die.\"This isn't just some crazy...this is a well-thought-out plan. We've had very, very smart people, doctors and people that have been involved with the UFC for a very long time working on this thing nonstop since it started.\"We believe that we have this thing in a place where it can be as safe as it can possibly be.\"More fights this weekTwo more fight nights are on the cards for Jacksonville on Wednesday and Saturday, but White didn't discount holding bouts on an island in the future. As for the action Saturday, Justin Gaethje stopped favorite Tony Ferguson in the fifth and final round to land the interim lightweight title, and Henry Cejudo successfully defended his bantamweight crown by knocking out Dominick Cruz in the second round -- before announcing his retirement. \"I'm happy with my career,\" said Cejudo, a wrestling gold medalist at the 2008 Olympics. \"I've done enough in the sport. I want to walk away and enjoy myself. I'm 33 years old.\"A bloodied Tony Ferguson (left) was upset by Justin Gaethje at UFC 249. Ferguson was scheduled to meet the undefeated Khabib Nurmagomedov of Russia, but that was canceled for a fifth time. On this occasion, it was due to travel restrictions placed on Nurmagomedov because of the pandemic.

        "content": "Hong Kong (CNN)It's the bottom of the ninth inning. Kim Sang-su steps into the batter's box for the NC Dinos, who are down 4-0 to the Samsung Lions on Tuesday's opening day of the Korean Baseball Organization's (KBO) 2020 season. This is the Dinos' final chance for a comeback. But play-by-play announcer Karl Ravech has disappeared. Ravech, the host of ESPN's flagship MLB program \"Baseball Tonight,\" is experiencing technical difficulties from his home in the northeast United States, where he's calling the game -- thousands of miles away from where it's actually taking place.His partner in the virtual broadcast booth, longtime professional baseball player Eduardo Perez, takes the reins from his own home in the southeast of the country, filling in briefly before Ravech is able to return. Ravech told viewers it was likely an internet dropout and to \"be prepared, it might happen again.\" Read MoreThat game was the first Korea baseball contest aired by ESPN as part of an agreement that will see the US sports network show six KBO games a week. Though the Dinos were able to get two players on base during the final frame, they failed to score and the Lions won the game.Technical difficulties, like those experienced during Tuesday's broadcast, are just one of the many challenges ESPN faces in its first major attempt to air live sports since professional sports in the United States paused play indefinitely amid the coronavirus pandemic. The network is betting that Americans are craving live sports enough to follow an unfamiliar league halfway around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there was an absolute hunger and desire to watch live sports programming,\" Ravech said. \"This is the time of year where baseball is played. And if you can provide that meal to a hungry audience, they're going to eat it.\"Though some states are beginning to reopen and lift lockdowns, the United States is still in the throes of its battle against the virus, where 1.3 million people have been infected and 78,000 have died.But countries that have been able to flatten the curb are starting to bring competition back online.Taiwanese baseball started last month without fans. South Korea's league began this week. As the rate of new infections slows in Germany, the Bundesliga is gearing up to come back -- a move that will likely put pressure on the rest of European soccer to follow suit when specific countries are ready.  Australia's National Rugby League is on track to resume play on May 28. And the Australian Football League could follow in June, if the country's cases continue to decline and people continue to follow social distancing, federal Sports Minister Richard Colbeck said this week.For sports fans around the world, these events offer a semblance of a return to normalcy. For those in the US and other countries struggling to contain the pandemic, the return of sports like the KBO offers fans something to satisfy their live sports cravings as well as a picture of what other sports might look like when they eventually resume.\"I think this is a blueprint and a template for the future,\" Ravech said. \"That may be short-term, but the know-how now and the awareness that it can be done this way has, I imagined, opened up some eyes about the feasibility of continuing this.\" The SK Wyverns and the Hanwha Eagles play in an empty SK Happy Dream Ballpark on Tuesday, which was opening day for the Korean Baseball League.A vigilant response and careful steps forwardThe empty stands at Samsung Lions Park in the southern city of Daegu and the Korean-language jerseys were omnipresent reminders that Tuesday's game was not the national pastime as Americans know it. But it was still baseball. It may not have been Major League Baseball, but the game itself was largely the same minus a few minor differences in rules and regulations. Hearing Ravech's dulcet tones and Perez's insightful commentary during the game were reassuring, comforting and familiar for baseball fans who tune in to ESPN to follow the majors.But it will likely be some of the only baseball fans in the United States can enjoy for some time, because the MLB does not appear close to ready to start its season.The league has floated a plan to sequester all 30 teams in Arizona and play games there without fans, but it's not clear if that is feasible. There are major logistical hurdles from testing capacity to housing all 30 teams, and several players told ESPN they are not crazy about the idea of being sequestered away from their families in the middle of a pandemic.\"We have tried to be cautious about trying to go too soon, based on what the public health situation is,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. \"I think it's incumbent upon us to turn over every stone to try to play the game in 2020 if there's any way we can in the environment.\" Hanwha Eagles players wear masks before the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League opening game between SK Wyverns and Hanwha Eagles.South Korea's league is starting because, unlike the US, the country largely has its outbreak under control. Public health experts have hailed Seoul's strategy, which emphasizes rapid and widespread testing and thorough contact tracing, as one of the most effective responses to the virus on the planet.The numbers speak for themselves. To date, South Korea has recorded only 10,840 coronavirus patients and 256 fatalities. However, the capital of Seoul is cutting trying to contain a cluster of cases connected with nightclubs in Itaewon, a popular nightlife district in the capital.  But the KBO is still putting in place a host of measures to keep people safe. Players and team personnel must wash their hands or use hand sanitizer often and undergo frequent temperature checks. Almost everyone will be required to wear masks and gloves, except when in the dugout or on the field. Players and team personnel are being asked to stay 2 meters (6.6 feet) away from others in locker rooms, showers and the dugout -- a difficult task considering it's a small space. High-fiving and spitting are discouraged.There are plans to bring fans back eventually, though they will have their temperature checked and be required to a wear mask, a league official said.The league is also putting contingency plans in place in case a player gets sick. If a player begins showing symptoms after the league starts, they'll be quarantined. But others will continue playing.If a player tests positive, their close contacts will be self-quarantined for 14 days and the league will review if it needs to be suspended or not.SK Wyverns cheerleaders at club's Happy Dream Ballpark during the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) League opening game Tuesday.The KBO's plan shares many similarities with Taiwan's professional baseball league, which began play last month and broadcasts its games in English to the rest of the world. The island has a population of about 24 million people, but it had detected only 440 coronavirus cases and recorded just six deaths as of Saturday morning local time.That's thanks in large part to its rapid response, world-class healthcare system, early travel ban and the decision to ramp up domestic face mask production -- several lessons learned in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS pandemic. Having the virus under control allowed Taiwan to bring back professional baseball last month, though like the KBO, Taiwanese games are played with no human spectators.Similarly, Australia is inching closer to bringing its multibillion-dollar sports industry back. Compared to most countries, Australia has a low rate of infection. As of Friday, fewer than 100 people had died. Authorities there moved quickly to ban international travelers from high-risk areas, close businesses and establish lockdowns, all the while making testing widely available. Can KBO catch on? It's not clear when the United States will be able to bring the rate of new infections down to the same level as Australia, South Korea or Taiwan. Though some states are gradually reopening, the virus is still killing hundreds of people each day.An influential model often cited by the White House doubled its projections for the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the United States to more than 134,000 by August, largely because of relaxed social distancing measures.If the situation fails to improve, it could further delay the return of live sports -- and push more viewers to options like the KBO.   ESPN's decision to air Korean baseball and dedicate editorial resources to covering it is very much an attempt to win back viewers who have stopped watching the network while American sports leagues are on hiatus. ESPN's business model is hugely dependent on covering these leagues. Without live sports to broadcast, report on or discuss during talk shows, the network and its website have had to get creative, including re-airing old material and moving up the release of its critically acclaimed documentary series \"The Last Dance.\"But it's a gamble. ESPN is betting the experience of watching baseball in real time -- or slightly delayed -- will prove enough of a draw to fans of the game, even if they don't have a team or stars to root for.It's likely too early to say if the bet will pay off, but ESPN's decision to air the KBO taps into the same value proposition the network was founded on 40 years ago: that live sports are dramatic and entertaining enough to attract a loyal audience and, sometimes, offer necessary respite from the harsh realities of the world.And so far, Ravech said the response has been largely positive. \"It's been funny. People are on social media saying help me pick a team, who should I invest in,\" he said. \"Given the uncertainty of Major League Baseball in this country, I do think over a period of time there will be a large number of people who say, how about those NC Dinos? They are playing great. Can you believe what just happened in the Samsung game?\"CNN's Yoonjung Seo and Sophie Jeong in Seoul, South Korea, and Ivan Watson and Rebecca Wright in Hong Kong contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)It's the first major European league to return to action later this month, but with games being played behind closed doors, Bundesliga clubs in Germany are having to think of creative ways to create an atmosphere with thousands of fans unable to attend matches.Top-flight side Borussia Monchengladbach, which is in fourth place and chasing a Champions League slot for next season, has come up with a novel solution to the problem of playing in an empty stadium.And ahead of the Bundesliga's resumption on May 16, the club is in the process of filling its stands with life-size cut-outs of fans. More than 4,500 cut-outs have already been installed at Borussia-Park with another 12,000 ordered by the club as it prepares for the resumption of fixtures, according to Gladbach's Twitter feed.Supporters pay around $20 (19 euros) for the cut-out with all profits going to local causes, including coronavirus relief efforts.Read MoreGladbach's first game at home will be against Bayer Leverkusen on May 23.

However, despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel setting out plans Wednesday for the gradual reopening of the country after weeks-long restrictions, it will be some time before fans are able to watch their sides play in person. The country has 169,430 confirmed cases of the virus with 7,392 deaths, according to the latest figures. As a result, games promise to look very different once they resume with a number of safety protocols introduced. Teams will arrive at different times and will be required to adhere to social distancing measures off the pitch. Pre-match handshakes and team photos will be scrapped and the ball disinfected before and during the game.Players will be tested for the virus at least once a week and will require two consecutive negatives results to play, according to DW.Lutz Pfannenstiel, sporting director at Bundesliga club Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, says the return of action behind closed doors is vital for the survival of a league that depends so much on money from television rights. \"There is no point to beat around the bush that it is extremely important for the Bundesliga and for the individual clubs to get back on the field and play,\" he told CNN Sport.\"We are a league that is very much depending on the television money. So to get that, playing is obviously what you have to do.\"You would have a lot of people who are not playing, who are not coaching and not sitting in the big positions -- they would also be getting into a bad economic situation.\"Profits from the scheme are being donated to local causes. Building an 'atmosphere'Many other teams around the world have adopted similar innovative initiatives to fill otherwise empty stadiums during the pandemic.Belarusian football club Dynamo Brest sold virtual tickets to its home games, with all profits being donated to the relief effort.  The baseball season in Taiwan has also resumed behind closed doors in recent weeks, with teams filling seats with mannequins, cardboard cut-outs and drum-playing robots. Whilst the imminent return of Bundesliga action may be a welcome morale boost for many, playing games behind closed doors means teams will still be missing out on their usual matchday revenue. To help ease the financial burden, Union Berlin has devised a virtual match day menu, allowing fans to support the club by buying what they normally would do at the stadium -- albeit without the receiving the actual product.Last month, the club's registered supporters also encouraged other fans to not accept refunds on previously purchased tickets in order to minimize the financial impact on the team. JUST WATCHEDTaiwan says, 'Game on!'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTaiwan says, 'Game on!' 02:42Easing the financial hit Since the league's suspension on March 13, clubs have taken a huge financial hit and are longing for a return to help stabilize their position.   German Football League (DFL) chief Christian Seifert previously said clubs in the country's top two leagues stood to lose a total of $823 million if the season couldn't be completed, through losses in television rights, advertising and ticket sales.Many players, coaches and boardroom members have taken pay-cuts to help ease the financial burden in the meantime.  In addition to looking after their own pockets, clubs and their players have also been using their initiative to raise money for the wider community. For example, Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski donated over $1 million to help fight the outbreak in Germany, whilst Borussia Dortmund turned its stadium into a treatment center. The league resumes with the title still up for grabs. Bayern Munich currently sits top with rivals Dortmund just four points behind with nine games remaining. Meanwhile, Werder Bremen and SC Paderborn are anchored to the foot of the league but can both reach safety with the matches remaining. CNN's Aleks Klosok contributed to this reporting.",

Local transmission has since been curbed, however, with the outbreak now considered broadly under control.There were only 19 new infections on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University, bringing the country's total number of reported cases to 6,913, with 97 fatalities.Speaking at a press conference Friday, Morrison said it was time to re-open the country.\"The next step beyond this will be to build confidence and momentum that will see our economy get back up and running and get Australians back up on their feet and moving ahead with confidence,\" said Morrison.Read MorePrime Minister Scott Morrison speaks during a press conference following a National Cabinet meeting on May 8 in Canberra, Australia.According to Morrison, the relaxing of restrictions will be carried out in three stages. The first will allow greater connections between friends and family, allowing for more people to gather at home and visit each other.Morrison said that pupils will likely be able to return to school, while restaurants, retail stores and cafes can  reopen. Thirty people will be allowed to attend funerals and ten will be able to attend weddings.In Step two, larger gatherings of up to 20 people will be allowed in venues such as cinemas and galleries, while organized community sport events and beauty parlors will be allowed to reopen.Finally, in the step three, gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed and interstate travel will be permitted to resume.Morrison said there would be no strict timeline for the measures, with states and territories allowed enact them at their own pace, but that the goal would be to move through all of the steps to achieve a \"Covid safe economy\" by July of this year.JUST WATCHEDHere's why experts worry about reopening restaurantsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHere's why experts worry about reopening restaurants 01:14Australia is not the first country to relax restrictions in the face of a shrinking number of coronavirus infections. Countries such as Germany, Italy and Spain are already slowly returning to normal while China has relaxed many of its preventative measures.Morrison said Friday that more than a month under widespread restrictions had done great damage to Australia's economy. More than one million Australians have applied for unemployment allowance since the measures began, while another five million are currently on government payments to avoid losing their jobs.Another million are tapping into their retirement savings early to stay afloat, according to Morrison.\"So many Australians are hurting right now. Lives turned upside down. Painful separation form their loved ones. Livelihoods that they've spent a lifetime building, stripped away,\" he said.But Morrison said it had also shown how Australia could come together in times of crisis. \"Every Australian matters, every life, every job, every future.\"",

A date that would traditionally have been commemorated with pomp and pageantry, May 8 this year will be celebrated very differently.The coronavirus pandemic has meant that millions around the world are staying at home, so people have to find new ways of marking Victory in Europe (VE) Day.Why is this year so important? As the name suggests, VE Day only marks the end of the conflict in Europe, when Nazi Germany surrendered after almost six years of war. However, the war against Japan rumbled on until August that year, and is marked by celebrations on August 15 for Victory over Japan (VJ) Day.

While members of the public thronged the streets to celebrate in 1945, social distancing measures mean that public gatherings such as veterans parades and street parties have been canceled this year.Hans Kluge, regional director for Europe at the World Health Organization (WHO), agreed with the measures.\"There is a very important day coming for us, VE Day, and I would like to commend those governments who have made the brave decision to postpone parades, to put health at the center,\" he said at a briefing Thursday, the UK's PA Media news agency reported.The UK ordered 400,000 gowns from Turkey to address its PPE crisis. Some didn't meet safety standards\"We have great respect for that date... but we need not to jeopardize human lives.\"However, there are other ways to mark the occasion while adhering to social distancing measures.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson lit a candle in Westminster Abbey on Thursday night in remembrance of those who died during the war.The UK government has launched a website where people can find resources to mark VE Day, including how to make bunting and posters at home.Meanwhile, cultural organization English Heritage has put together a special pack, which includes 1940s recipes, a Spotify playlist and dance steps that were popular at the time.UK authorities are also encouraging people to use the online materials offered by the Imperial War Museums, The National Archives and the National Army Museum to find out more about the war and its history.

It seems even his children weren't immune, as three of them -- Jasmine, Marcus and Jeffrey -- recalled an incident playing tackle football with their dad, inside their home. \"Jeff was going for a touchdown and, I'll never forget it, my dad tackled Jeff into a glass table and Jeff hit his head,\" Marcus Jordan told The Breakfast Club radio station, revealing the incident required his brother to get stitches. Read More\"That's the competitiveness. Obviously, it was an accident.\"READ: The billion-dollar move that Michael Jordan almost missedMichael Jordan's children reveal his incredible will to win. 'The last time I've smack talked him'Examples of such competitiveness were clear throughout the docuseries, which chronicled how nothing and no one stood in the way of Jordan. His US teammates experienced that first hand during a legendary practice session ahead of the 1992 Olympic Games, as documented by the show. The US had assembled a dream team of NBA stars, including legends such as Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley, but it soon became clear who the true leader was. Jordan famously pulled out all the stops to drag his team to victory in what was supposed to be a training game, settling the score with a number of teammates in what he described as the best game he's ever played in. It seems such an edge has continued into his retirement and transcends the sport of basketball. Former world no. 1 golfer Brooks Koepka remembers a time when he learned never to trash talk Jordan ever again, during a round with the hall of famer. Going into the final two holes, Koepka made the mistake of teasing his opponent, to which Jordan had a simple response. \"He just tees the ball up, takes his practice swing and looks at me. 'It's the fourth quarter, baby, I don't lose,'\" Koepka told SportsCenter, revealing Jordan went on to win the last two holes. \"It's probably the last time I've smack talked him.\" READ: Buy! Buy!

And his focus has remained on calling the action.Al-Hossain doesn't support an individual team though.\"I don't support any one team,\" he explains. \"Any commentator should be neutral. I must not support any single team. \"I love the Spanish league, the English league, the Italian and French leagues. I love the game.\"When he cannot commentate on his friends playing, he instead commentates over the video games his older brother plays.\"When I play PlayStation, he always sits next to me and starts commenting on the match,\" al-Hossain's brother Mulham says. \"I wish him luck and wish to see him a famous commentator one day.\"Sergio Aguero says Premier League players are 'scared' about possible return to actionFan followingHazem records himself and uploads his videos to hundreds of online followers, and hopes one day to receive formal training. One of his fans rues the lack of infrastructure to support people like Hazem: \"His videos are very nice and he has a beautiful voice,\" they explain. \"We have to remember that he is only 12 years old and in sixth grade. \"It is nice that he has this talent but the problem is that we do not have academies here to support these children in order to improve and train them to become commentators. \"In Syria we have a lack commentators.\"Syria has so far 45 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 3 deaths.Authorities have eased a lockdown in the past week and allowed a wide range of professions and businesses to return to work.",

I don't want to die. \"This isn't just some crazy, this is a well thought out plan.

The UFC's own website noted: \"All athletes and staff will be required to adhere to a number of precautionary measures, such as participating in advanced medical screenings and temperature checks and following social distancing guidelines.\"UFC 249 will be hosted in the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena which has hosted NCAA basketball tournaments.In a press release issued by UFC, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry says the promotion has presented a \"safe and sensible\" plan while Patrick Cunningham, executive director of the state's Boxing Commission, said \"health and safety protocols will be in place to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals who are helping to3 make these events possible.\" And in a statement to CNN Sport, Brian Hughes, chief administrative officer for the City of Jacksonville, said \"UFC presented state regulators with a well thought out plan and they are aware of our guidance through local executive orders\"Based on our discussions and the capacity to have code and safety enforcement at the events, we are confident the events will protect the athletes, management and production staff on-site.\" As regards a key component of tests, Hughes went on to note that \"everyone in the building will have been through a testing regime based on the UFC's plan.\"UFC president White -- who's also submitted a 30-page safety protocol document to state authorities ahead of this weekend's pay-per-view event -- says the fighters want to fight, the fans are excited, and that there's been a \"phenomenal\" reaction, but he also concedes there are no guarantees in life, calling on everyone to play their part.White gets in between Derrick Lewis (left) and Alexander Volkov.READ: The life and times of Conor McGregor -- how social media changed UFC fighter\"Fighters just can't show up in Florida and just start hanging out and partying and walking up and down the street,\" White acknowledges. \"We're going to need some help from them, too.\" White -- who doesn't think we'll be seeing crowds back at live sports for a while -- also wears another hat these days. He's one of US President Donald Trump's advisers, when it comes to getting America's economy back on track. White told CNN Sport that he's been on some \"great\" conference calls with Trump, adding \"everyone is motivated to try to figure this thing out and bring back sports.\" Trying to return during the pandemic comes at a high-profile risk but White sees the UFC as up for the challenge.\"I could stay home right now. I could be in my swimming pool, hanging out, playing with my kids at home,\" he asserts. \"I'm not. I'm out here trying to figure this thing out. I'm making sure that every one of my employees and their families are taken care of. My fighters and their families are taken care of. And we're spending a lot of money to do it.

        "content": "London (CNN)A high-profile shipment to the UK of surgical gowns, hailed by ministers as a solution to Britain's personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages, has ended with little of the expected fanfare -- with more than 2,000 garments deemed unusable after arriving from Turkey and none yet distributed to health workers.The gowns, made by a Turkish company and flown into the UK by the Royal Air Force on April 22, had been touted as an answer to the calls of underprotected health care workers.But they were never given to frontline workers, it has emerged. Some were instead impounded at a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, according to The Telegraph newspaper, which first reported the story.\"If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass our quality assurance processes it is not distributed to the front line,\" a spokesperson for the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) told CNN on Thursday, when asked whether the shipment in question had failed to meet safety standards.Britain had ordered 400,000 gowns in this particular order. Thursday evening, DHSC said it had so far received just 67,000 -- of which 4,500 passed \"rigorous quality control checks\" and 2,400 failed. The rest are still undergoing tests, DHSC said. Read MoreA further 170,000 gowns are in Turkey, being checked by the Turkish Standards Institute, the statement added.The government will request a refund if it cannot get a replacement order of gowns that meet requirements, a spokesman told reporters Thursday.The faulty PPE came from a private supplier, and no part of the Turkish government was involved in producing, packaging or delivering that equipment to the United Kingdom, a senior Turkish official told CNN. Turkey authorized the private sale to the UK despite an export ban \"out of solidarity with the UK authorities,\" the official said.There were also no quality issues with a separate donation of PPE by the Turkish government to the UK, the official noted. UK government officials had repeatedly talked up the original delivery in the days prior.Black people in the UK four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, new data shows\"Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line,\" Housing Minister Robert Jenrick said April 18, when he unveiled the \"very significant\" order from Turkey.The next day, Michael Gove, a member of Parliament, touted the arrival of the gowns in TV interviews. April 21, government minister Simon Clarke conceded that while the UK will not run out of PPE, the \"margins can be tight.\" He cited the Turkey shipment as a factor behind that conclusion.\"We've had three flights with gowns from Turkey -- because we know that every single one of those items of PPE is needed by those working so hard on the front line,\" First Secretary of State Dominic Raab added at the government's daily coronavirus briefing on April 29.Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has faced repeated scrutiny over the lack of PPE in hospitals and care homes, as well as the availability of testing, and the new setback raises further concerns about his response.In an industry survey in late April, more than a third of British doctors said they did not have appropriate PPE.Of those surveyed, 75% said they did not have long-sleeve gowns, while 38% said they lack eye protection, according to the survey by the Doctors Association UK.\"This is a global pandemic with many countries procuring PPE, leading to shortages around the world, not just the UK,\" the DHSC spokesperson said Thursday. \"We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically and brought together the NHS, industry and the armed forces to create a comprehensive PPE distribution network to deliver critical supplies to the front line.\"A protester demands more PPE in London last month.In March, the UK ordered millions of antibody tests, described by Johnson as a potential \"game-changer,\" but ministers later walked back that optimism after the tests were found not to work.More recently, a self-imposed target of conducting 100,000 tests per day by the end of April was met -- but for only two days, and with the help of thousands of tests that were mailed to homes just before the deadline. Tests have subsequently dropped below that mark for four consecutive days, and slumped to just 69,463 on Tuesday.Earlier this week, the UK took from Italy the unwanted mantle of having the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in Europe, according to official figures.At least 30,076 people have died in the country since the start of the outbreak, compared to 29,684 in Italy. Only the US has suffered more fatalities.Correction: This story and headline have been updated to correct information regarding the condition of the PPE from Turkey. Only a portion of the gowns have failed quality tests, not the entire shipment. CNN's Vasco Cotovio and Simon Cullen contributed to this report.",

A report by the Office for National Statistics found black women (defined by the study as Black Caribbean, Black African and Black Other) are 4.3 times more likely to die with Covid-19 than white women, while black men are 4.2 more likely to die.People of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities also had a \"statistically significant raised risk of death,\" the report found.The disparities are \"partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\" the study said. Even after taking into account age, demographic factors and measures of self-reported health problems, black people were still almost twice as likely to die from Covid-19 than white people.Read MoreWhile the report was unable to clearly outline every factor behind the trend, its conclusions make clear the the pandemic -- frequently referred to as a \"great equalizer\" -- is anything but. \"It is urgent the causes of this disproportionality are investigated,\" the UK's shadow justice secretary David Lammy tweeted on Thursday, calling the findings \"appalling.\" \"Action must be taken to protect black men and women -- as well as people from all backgrounds -- from the virus,\" he added.UK overtakes Italy to record highest coronavirus death toll anywhere in EuropeThe data covers the period up to April 10. Its figures are supported by previous studies, which have also found black people in the UK are dying at a far higher rate than their white peers.An analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank found last week that people from black African backgrounds were 3.7 times more likely to die in hospital from the disease than white people. That study said excess deaths cannot be explained by differences in geography and demography alone -- nor is it accounted for by non-hospital deaths.And the findings also chime with similar reports in the United States, where African Americans have died from Covid-19 at a disproportionately high rate.In Chicago, 72% of people who died were black, officials said in April, despite African Americans only making up 30% of the city's population. In Louisiana, African Americans make up 32% of the population, but account for around 70% of deaths.The UK has the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, announcing on Wednesday that more than 30,000 people have died since the start of the outbreak.This story has been updated.CNN's Zamira Rahim, Vasco Cotovio and Sharon Braithwaite contributed reporting.",

Read MoreCultural significanceAccording to Stockx, a website where people can buy and sell sneakers and streetwear -- much like traders buy and sell stocks -- between January 1 and the premiere of the series on April 18, 217 pairs of the 2015 Air Jordan 1 'Chicago' retro trainer were sold for an average price of $925.In the two weeks since the series first aired on April 19, 60 pairs of the model were sold at an average price of $1,241.Sneakerhead Paul Barber from Sunderland in the UK runs a sneaker art Instagram account called @Sneaksketchuk and is a collector of Air Jordan 1s.\"I purchased my pair of Chicago's back in December 2018,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"Even back then they weren't cheap, but I found a pair in the States that came in 'cheaper' than what I could get them for on this side of the pond. That said, they still set me back just under \u00a3500 ($623).\"Nike had hoped to make $3 million in four years of sales but such was the popularity of the shoe in 1985, by the end of year one they'd made $126 million.For Barber and many other sneakerheads, the Air Jordan 1 holds special significance, not just for its design but its cultural importance.\"That sneaker started a revolution, it sparked a fire that even 35 years later still burns bright. The Jordan 1 is symbolic, but also it's a good identifier for who you are,\" said Barber.\"People see you in that sneaker and they know instantly that you're into your kicks. You'll see people check out your sneakers and they'll give you a little nod of the head of appreciation.\"It isn't just the 1s which are growing in value; the price of many other Air Jordans has risen since the show's premiere.'Kobes'Much like the stock market, the sneaker market is a reflection of real-world events.When Kobe Bryant died in late January, the former LA Lakers star's line of sneakers rocketed in value.Some \"Kobes\"  that had previously been worth a few hundred dollars suddenly were being sold for thousands of dollars.It was reported by a number of outlets that in response, Nike pulled Bryant-related merchandise to prevent profiteering by resellers.Nike later denied this, saying instead that the company had just sold out of Kobe products.Jordan wore the model during his rookie year in the NBA.The cultural significance of the Air Jordan 1 shouldn't be underestimaed.In 2018, journalist and sneaker aficionado Russ Bengtson wrote: \"If it's hard to separate the Air Jordan 1 from sneaker culture, it's because most of what we know as \"sneaker culture\" sprung up around the Air Jordan 1 itself.\"Some 35 years on from the shoe's release, it is still making waves.",

(CNN)The motto that runs through the veins of CNN producers and reporters is \"Go There.\" Yet coronavirus has turned \"going there\" from normal to abnormal.On pre-Covid assignments to Syria, Ukraine or the Central African Republic, we left our loved ones knowing they were safe at home. But now, possible travel has me thinking, \"I could bring the virus back and infect my fianc\u00e9e, who could infect others and who could end up in bed, hospitals or worse.\"Coronavirus DiariesCoronavirus and shingles left me so alone by Sarah JorgensenI just wanted a break but got stuck with my parents by Julia Hollingsworth We nixed our wedding to protect our friends and then they surprised us with one by Zach WadeHow social distancing may be hurting my mom by Amara WalkerHow fighting coronavirus taught me about the gift of connection by Brooke BaldwinI'm the quarantine buffer between three generations in one house by S. Mitra KalitaMore CNN coronavirus diaries ...So, when I was asked recently if I could travel to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, which has not imposed lockdowns, I gave it due consideration. We would be abandoning the regulations of social distancing imposed by the UK government and most of Europe. But it would mean a return to a semblance of a regular working life. We would once again be on the road, the first time in five weeks.So I said yes, and started preparations. Instead of the malaria tablets and flak jacket I've needed before, I had a box of surgical gloves, two types of face mask, antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer delivered.The cab ride to Heathrow took only 20 minutes, about half the normal time. But if the empty roads seemed strange, the departure hall was eerie. Usually teeming with businesspeople and tourists, there were just 20 people checking in with agents sheltered behind plastic screens.Read MoreA near-empty terminal at Heathrow could be a new normal.Along with my colleagues, correspondent Phil Black and photojournalist Martin Bourke, I did my best to keep a distance, joking, \"I would shake your hand but ...\" Phil and I even stood back, abandoning our usual team effort, to let Martin handle all the kit.Once through security, the only shops open were a newsagents and a chemist. If I wanted an oat milk flat white, or a fresh shirt from Thomas Pink, this was not the place.  As we waited, it dawned that this this empty terminal would not be an exception in Europe. It could be an enduring image for some time to come -- a new normal.British Airways planes sit parked at Heathrow.With no direct flight from London to Stockholm at the moment, our journey would take 6 hours with a change in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. Just as we soared into the clouds I spotted British Airways aircraft parked-up, like the rest of the world, at home.   As we settled into our three hour flight, the bite of my mask around my nose started to take hold. Even breathing has become irregular. There were no more than 20 people on the flight. We spread out, leaving gaps between us. Cabin crew in protective gear offered sandwiches, opening the tray of any takers so we didn't have to touch anything.The crew kept some distance on board the first flight.Helsinki airport was as somber as Heathrow. More closed shops. More planes out to pasture and the now expected dearth of people.Flying to the old worldBut with the connecting flight to Stockholm came a shift in gear. People were sitting next to each other in a two-by-two configuration. It was uncomfortable. Suddenly everyone was too close.Even from the air it was easy to see things were going to be different in Sweden. I spotted a telltale sign of life: traffic. The first trace of what used to be normality.In Stockholm, working or chatting over coffee is still an everyday activity.At our hotel I was asked to sign the terms and conditions of my stay on an iPad with my finger. Really? Then I spied a busy lobby bar with friends meeting for a drink. I saw hugs and a peck on the cheek. Not a mask or glove in sight. That's not normal. Hand me that hand sanitizer.As we started work, we tried to keep our distance and sanitize as regularly as possible. But it soon became clear a few compromises were needed. We had to travel in the same car. We could not expect Marty alone to load, carry and set up the gear for shoots.  The main shopping street in Stockholm was full of people.After 6 weeks of lockdown in the UK, it was incredible to see so many people out on the streets, commuting to work, going to school and even socializing. We stood on Stockholm's main shopping street bemused, as people wandered in and out of H&M or grabbed a coffee.We returned to our individual hotel rooms to work on the story, savoring some isolation, before having to cram together to get set for the live shot.The next day, as we looked for a broadcast location, we stumbled across a bar crammed with people frolicking and cavorting in the early spring sunshine.If I sound jealous, it's because I was. Yet, I was also conflicted. How nice it would have been to wander over, pull up a chair and enjoy a beer. But I also knew the death rate in Sweden is now significantly higher than many other countries in Europe, with 2,500 dead.Sweden did not close down in the way much of Europe did, but it has a higher death rate.They used to say there was safety in numbers. But the counts of dead and infected across Europe suggest the complete opposite.I thought the most abnormal thing about visiting Sweden would be the trip there. But actually, the view of \"normal life\" happening in Stockholm now, a glimpse into our own so-recent past, now seems like the least normal thing in the world.",

Many traditions and routines have had to be altered because of a virus which has changed the world. \"It's been very difficult,\" Olympic champion Dalilah Muhammad, who is observing Ramadan, tells CNN Sport. \"My family is in New York and New York was hit really hard. Just being away from them, it's been a little bit difficult.\"Both my parents, they're doing well. My sister also lives in New York and she's doing well with her family. It's good to know that they're doing well, but I definitely wish I can kind of take this time to see everyone.\"Mandy Marquardt: Diabetic Olympic hopeful adapts to training in quarantineRead MoreAt the 2016 Olympics, Muhammad won gold in the 400 meters hurdles on a rainy night in Rio de Janeiro. Her victory made her one of two American Muslim women to win medals at the Games (fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad won a bronze). Last year, Muhammad broke her own world record in claiming the 400m hurdles world title in Doha. Over the month of Ramadan -- which this year started on the evening of April 23 -- Muslims abstain from food and water during daylight hours, a practice that is seen as one of the five pillars of Islam. They can eat before sunrise, and break their fast after dusk each day.With athletics events canceled across the globe, these unusual times have at least given Muhammad, 30, a chance to fast for the whole month, something she would not normally be able to do when competing. \"I'm definitely using this opportunity to fast more than I normally would,\" she explained. \"I always try to fast some days during the season. It's just honestly extremely difficult for me to train as hard as I do and fast.\"I'm never able to do the full 30 days or the full month and this time I kind of made a promise myself to really do it. I can do it now that my training isn't as intense. There's no major championships to get ready for.\"Muhammad poses next to the screen reading the new world record she set in the Women's 400m hurdles at the 2019 IAAF Athletics World Championships at the Khalifa International stadium.At this time of year daylight can last for over 13 hours in Los Angeles, where New Yorker Muhammad lives. So, fasting is no easy feat and, of course, there are cravings to overcome and traditions to keep. \"Growing up, my father always broke his fast with dates and just being home in California, I'm just kind of keeping that tradition,\" she said. \"I've been craving sweets right now, and that's something I never really crave. I'm not like a big sweet person, but for whatever reason, even last night [April 27] I was craving a cinnamon bun, I was like crossing my fingers that Cinnabon would be open. Of course, it was not. So definitely craving sweets; had some Dunkin Donuts last night.\"Dalilah's father, Askia, is an imam and has been ensuring the Muhammad family stay in touch throughout the crisis.\"My father implicated that we need to do this once a week. I don't think we've made it quite once every week, but we do try to make a time to do Zoom calls. Just see everyone's face. I've definitely been FaceTiming a lot.\"Muhammad poses for a portrait during Team USA's Tokyo 2020 Olympics shoot on November 19, 2019.Potential Olympic \"heartbreak\"In March, it was announced that the Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled to take place this summer, would be postponed to 2021 \"to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.\"For Muhammad, plans to defend the title she won four years ago are on hold. \"I understood the decision to hold it in 2021, of course I absolutely agree with it,\" she said. \"But, for me personally, it was a little bit disappointing. We as athletes, our lives are planned around these four years and we know every fourth year is going to be an Olympic Games and we kind of schedule our training around it and really our lives, our personal lives.\"Muhammad pictured on her way to winning gold at Rio 2016.Since the announcement of the initial postponement, Tokyo 2020 Games president Yoshiro Mori has indicated that if the pandemic continues the Olympics could be canceled.\"That would be really heartbreaking,\" admitted Muhammad. \"We sacrifice so much for the Olympic Games and just to represent our country, and we love what we do.\"I'm striving to get a medal at the Olympics and I'd be the reigning champ, Olympic champion, and so it has definitely been disheartening. We'll just have to see how it all plays out.\"Minding the dogsWith running tracks closed, Muhammad has been training in the grass fields in Northridge, Los Angeles. After initially training alone, she has now resumed working with her coaches while keeping a social distance from members of the public -- though there are the dogs to navigate around. Muhammad said: \"There are a lot of dogs in the park right now, a lot of people walking their dogs and the dogs are not doing that [social distancing]!\"I'm honestly enjoying just kind of running for fun again. I think we focus so much on the competition aspect and, of course, that's important being a professional athlete, but I'm really just enjoying getting out there and running.\"An asthma sufferer, sprinter Noah Lyles is taking extra precautions amid pandemicThe reigning World Athlete of the Year has also been spending time in lockdown taking part in online challenges. She helped tee off an indoor relay challenge on her Instagram account with other Nike-sponsored sports stars, including NFL wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., while fellow American hurdler Queen Harrison got her to take part in a Don't Rush-style challenge, which features people seamlessly transforming from everyday clothes to more glamorous attire with the flick of a make-up brush. \"It was just a way for us to kind of express ourselves. Get on some nice clothes, or some different clothes, that we normally wear when we're out training, so it was fun,\" she said. Although one challenge she hasn't taken up is dressing up to take out the trash.\"No, I'm not one of those people, not yet. Maybe sometimes to the grocery store, but that's about it,\" she said.",

You have to be positive and keep moving forward. There is no other choice.\"Tennis returns ... sort ofWhile the ATP and WTA tours may have been suspended, tennis returned for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic with the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany.World No. 143 Yannick Hanfmann defeated Dustin Brown, the tournament's star name, in straight sets to claim the title in quite unusual circumstances.The exhibition was held without fans and there were only ever three people on court at a time -- the two players and the umpire. The players entered and exited through different doors and sat opposite each other so they never crossed at the net.Matches were best-of-three sets and sets were shortened to the first to four games, with tiebreaks at three-all and next point wins when games reach deuce.The tournament was organized to help lower-ranked players earn some income during the pandemic.Novak Djokovic, the president of the ATP Player Council, has called for top players to contribute to a fund set up by the game's governing bodies to help those lower down, but world No. 3 Dominic Thiem recently rejected the idea.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A leading epidemiologist who advised the UK government on its coronavirus response resigned from his government post on Tuesday, after the Telegraph newspaper revealed he broke the lockdown rules he helped shape by allowing his reported lover to visit his home.Professor Neil Ferguson, who is based at Imperial College in London, is one of the architects of the UK government's stay-at-home strategy and was a prominent member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which has been spearheading the country's coronavirus response. The Telegraph reported Tuesday that a woman whom it described as his married lover had visited Ferguson's home in London at least twice despite social distancing guidelines.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News that he was left speechless by the \"extraordinary\" revelation and that Ferguson had taken the right decision in resigning from his advisory position.\"Clearly the social distancing rules are there for everyone and they are incredibly important and they are deadly serious, and the reason is that they are the means by which we have managed to get control of this virus,\" Hancock said Wednesday.UK overtakes Italy to record highest coronavirus death toll anywhere in EuropeRead MoreNews of Ferguson's resignation came on the same day that the UK overtook Italy as the country with the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe. The UK Department of Health and Social Care said 29,427 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 had died as of Monday afternoon.In a statement to CNN, Ferguson said he accepted he made \"an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action,\" and had therefore stepped back from his involvement in SAGE.\"I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms,\" he said.\"I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic.\"The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.\"UK starts testing its own coronavirus contact tracing appHancock told Sky News it was up to the police to decide whether any action should be taken against Ferguson.\"Professor Ferguson is a very eminent and impressive scientist and the science that he has done has been an important part of what we've listened to,\" the health secretary said. \"I think he took the right decision to resign.\"Scotland Yard said Ferguson's behavior was \"plainly disappointing\" but ruled out taking action against him -- such as issuing a fine -- because he had \"taken responsibility\" for his error of judgment, according to the UK's PA news agency.Professor Sir Robert Lechler, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, told the UK's Science Media Centre that he did not believe Ferguson's resignation would have any material impact on the advice received by the government, despite his high profile.\"It's critical, I think, to understand that we are in an era of team science. Prof Ferguson is an individual -- he's the leader of a team, but it's the team as a whole who will, I am sure, continue to provide valuable input to SAGE,\" Lechler said.The epidemiologist is not the only leading figure in Britain's coronavirus response to have been caught flouting the rules on social distancing.Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, resigned from the position last month after she was photographed by a Scottish newspaper near her family's second home, in a different part of the country to her Edinburgh address.She was given a formal police warning for leaving her home without proper excuse.",

        "content": "(CNN)As old sayings go, not many have stood the test of time better than \"mother knows best.\"But when faced with two of the most consequential decisions of his life, Michael Jordan listened to his mother only once. Heeding her advice would end up making the basketball icon rich beyond his wildest dreams; spurning it potentially damaged his legacy.   Both events were profiled in the latest episode of the blockbuster 10-part documentary series, 'The Last Dance,' airing on ESPN in the US with Netflix having the international rights. The show chronicles Jordan's epic final season with the Chicago Bulls.       While his sublime talent has never been in question, and his six NBA titles in the 1990s remain an almost mythical accomplishment, some questions have lingered about the man behind that myth.READ: Michael Jordan declined $100 million to appear at an event for two hours, agent saysRead MoreAir JordanIt seems unthinkable now that the superstar who sold millions of basketball shoes with Nike wasn't even interested in meeting with the company in the first place. In the early 1980s, Nike was a fledgling start-up in Portland, Oregon, a brand more synonymous with manufacturing track shoes. HIs agent, David Falk, asked Jordan's parents to persuade him to get on the plane. \"My mother said 'you're going to go and listen. You may not like it, but you're going to go and listen,'\" Jordan recalled in episode five of the hit television series. The rest is history. The \"Air Jordan\" was born and both Jordan and Nike immediately hit the jackpot.As Falk put it: \"By the end of year four, Nike hoped to make $3 million in sales. But by the end of year one, they'd made $126 million.\" The shoe was iconic and so was he, a team player marketed more like a tennis player or a boxer. A talented, handsome athlete who quickly emerged as a global pop-culture sensation.\"Michael came right at a time when satellite TV and cable TV were proliferating,\" 'The Last Dance director' Jason Hehir told CNN Sport. \"He had the looks, he had the charisma. He was well spoken. He was intelligent and he was probably the most captivating performer in the history of the NBA. It was a perfect storm.\"READ: 'My mom is the hardest coach I've ever had,' says Zion WilliamsonIn addition to becoming a legend of the game, Jordan grew a successful brand. Pretty much everything that Jordan has touched turned to gold. His narrative is inspirational, his dedication almost impossible to rival and his enthusiasm infectious. Watching him grinning from ear to ear on the sidelines at the 1998 All Star game, you can almost feel the joy wafting into your veins. Jordan helped establish Chicago as a major player on the world sports map. Before his arrival in the summer of '84, the Bulls were known as the \"traveling cocaine circus\" and he didn't just clean up the team, he arguably helped clean up the city. \"The reputation of Chicago was kind of gangland and corrupt politicians,\" mused Hehir. \"It was the home of Al Capone, mob gangster stuff. That city was fiercely divided on color lines, one of the hotbeds of prejudice in the country and Michael united people.\" Jordan, seen here with Phil Jackson, raises his NBA Finals MVP trophy.PoliticsSports anchor Dan Roan had a ringside seat from his vantage point at the Chicago TV station WGN.\"Everybody was a Bulls fan, no matter your political preference,\" Roan told CNN Sport. \"It didn't matter where you lived, it was kind of a galvanizing issue for the city.\" If Jordan had transcended Chicago, not everybody was content with him being only a basketball player. In 1990, a senate race in North Carolina presented a quandary for the NBA star. Charlotte's first African American mayor Harvey Gantt, a Democrat, was trying to unseat Republican Jesse Helms to become the state's first black senator.Helms had campaigned doggedly to try and prevent the senate from approving a federal holiday to honor the civil rights icon Dr. Martin Luther King. \"My mother asked me to do a PSA about Harvey Gantt,\" Jordan recalled in 'The Last Dance.' \"I said, 'Look mom, I'm not speaking out of pocket about something I don't know, but I will send a contribution to support him.'\"Gantt lost the election, but it was Jordan's off-the-cuff remark on the team bus -- \"Republicans buy sneakers too\" -- that defined his position in the eyes of his critics.  Jordan admits that he said it, \"as a joke,\" but he's been haunted by those four words for decades. While the Chicago native, former President Barack Obama, would have preferred Jordan to enter the political fray, he has some sympathy for his stance, saying in the film: \"America is very quick to embrace a Michael Jordan, an Oprah Winfrey or a Barack Obama, so long as it's understood that you don't get too controversial around broader issues of social justice.\"READ: Kevin Love -- 'For me a form of therapy or feeling better is practicing acts of kindness'Jordan and Muhammad Ali together in 1999.Still, if you've ever wondered why Jordan isn't mentioned in the same breath as Muhammad Ali, this is arguably the reason why.\"I do commend Muhammad Ali for standing up for what he believed in, but I never thought of myself as an activist,\" Jordan affirms. \"I thought of myself as a basketball player. Was I selfish? Probably.\"And Jordan makes no apology. \"I set examples and if it inspires you, great. And if it doesn't, then maybe I'm not the person you should be following.\"Roan is reluctant to join those who criticize Jordan's unwillingness to get involved in matters beyond basketball, pointing out the superstar rarely made any kind of public appearance. But he was also quick to add that \"had he been able to do some more social stuff, I think he would have been so impactful.\"  Then there's the question of whether or not Michael Jordan is the kind of guy you'd want to hang out with. There's a well-known phrase in sports -- \"nice guys finish last\" -- so what does that say about Jordan?\"Everything you think it might say about him,\" chuckles Roan, who arrived in Chicago just a few months before Jordan in 1984.\"He was great to me, but when somebody was trying to play basketball against him or when he had an issue with somebody in the front office like (general manager) Jerry Krause, Michael could be a pretty mean customer.\"Jordan talks with teammate Scottie Pippen during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers in 1992.Intense rivalryRoan vividly recalls the time he witnessed Jordan egging on his teammate Scottie Pippen, who famously had an acrimonious relationship with Krause, to take the wheel off the bus and run him over, exclaiming, \"Now's your big chance!\" His former Bulls teammate, Horace Grant, described Jordan  as a devil in the documentary, saying, \"You make a mistake, he's going to scream at you, he's going to belittle you.\" And time certainly hasn't healed the intensity of Jordan's rivalry with opponents like the Detroit Pistons, \"I hated them then and that hatred continues even to this day.\" But during the production of 'The Last Dance,' director Hehir found Jordan to be nothing but kind and considerate.\"I think a lot of Michael as a guy, he was nothing but respectful to me and to my camera crew and to the entire production staff. Our makeup artist was pregnant and he admonished somebody wanting to light up a cigar. He says 'ma'am' and 'sir.' I mean, he's a country kid at heart.\"For Hehir, Jordan's personality is one of the most fascinating things about him. \"I was interested in getting his perspective on how he feels as a 'nice guy' to not be perceived as one. I was interested if he had any ambivalence about that.\"'The Last Dance' is a captivating waltz down memory lane; the main drama played out 22 years ago, in a more innocent time, before we were all obsessed with our mobile phones and social media.It's hard to imagine that the goldfish bowl that Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman were swimming around in could have been even more intense than it actually was at the time.\"I think the coverage of the Bulls today would be much different than it was then,\" Roan speculated.\"All the haters out there trying to pile on. It may have been different enough to affect the way they went about winning their games. My feeling is that were he playing today, he'd really close himself off, worry about his business interests and playing basketball. I think that might be about it.\"'The Last Dance' has received positive reviews.  Although 'The Last Dance' covers many aspects of Jordan's intriguing persona, it's ultimately all about the sport, highlighting the grit, the determination, the competitive spirit that still burns fiercely in the eyes of this 57-year-old new grandfather.Despite all of the marketing hoopla away from the hoop, Jordan himself knew that it was only ever about the basketball.\"My game was my biggest endorsement. Believe me, if I was averaging two points and three rebounds, I wouldn't have signed anything with anybody,\" he says.Director Hehir says that beyond any of Jordan's perceived character flaws, our lasting impression of the show will be of an incredible athlete willing his team to extraordinary success. \"He came into the league and he was the team's only hope,\" Hehir says. \"By the end of that '98 series, Michael has to carry the team again. If you wrote the ending to that series in the script, you'd be laughed out of a Hollywood office because it's so corny, but it actually came true.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Before coronavirus brought the world to its knees, 2020 was slated to be a crucial year for the European Union and China.At a showpiece summit in September, the two are set to take a significant step forward in their economic and strategic relationship. At least that was the plan.China's response to covid-19 has left a bitter taste in the mouths of European officials. From draconian clampdowns on its own citizens to accusations of spreading misinformation in Europe, this crisis has been a reminder that closer engagement with China comes with risk.  German hairdressers reopen after six weeks -- but in Berlin, you need to fill out a questionnaire to get a cutAs things stand, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to gather EU leaders and China's President Xi Jinping in the German city of Leipzig on September 14.German diplomats say the location was selected because of the former East Germany's historical relationship with China. They say that Merkel, chairing the EU Council presidency for the final time in her chancellorship, was personally invested in the summit's success.Read MoreIndeed, pulling China closer to European values on human rights, climate change and multilateralism is the sort of thing leaders' legacies are made of. And while the Leipzig summit is far from a make or break moment in Europe's relationship with China, this level of fanfare has a lot to live up to.However, there is a real sense in Brussels that the pandemic has led to a reset in European thinking on China.\"I think the coronavirus has been a necessary reminder to a lot of EU states that however attractive Chinese money looks, it is also a systemic rival,\" says Steven Blockmans, head of EU foreign policy at the Centre for European Policy Studies. I think the coronavirus has been a necessary reminder to a lot of EU states that however attractive Chinese money looks, it is also a systemic rival.Steven BlockmansBlockmans is referring to a communique released by the EU Commission in March 2019, in which it described China as \"a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance\".In the context of coronavirus, that Chinese model of government is concerning EU officials.Last month, the European External Action Service published a report on disinformation surrounding covid-19, saying that \"Official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and -- to a lesser extent -- China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation.\" Days earlier, Politico Europe published an excerpt from what it said was a draft version, which explicitly accused China of running \"a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image.\" A spokesperson from the EU's Foreign Affairs and Security Policy told CNN the document cited by Politico was not in fact a draft report.Whatever the truth, it's clear that some in Brussels are very concerned about China's behavior. \"It's all about seeing which (political) system is better at handling the virus. Is it a system that allows personal liberties? Or is it single-party autocracy where you can impose measures without worrying too much,\" said one EU official working across external affairs.A picture shows a screen of a video conference call between members of the European Council, seen at the Elysee Palace in Paris, on March 26, 2020, to discuss coordination of EU efforts to tackle the outbreak of covid-19.This lack of trust seems to be taking hold across Brussels. Over the weekend, the EU's Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, said in an interview with France's Le Journal du Dimanche that Europe had been \"na\u00efve\" in its dealings with China. He went on to acknowledge that China has a \"different understanding of the international order.\"So, where does this all leave what was supposed to be the year where China and Europe finally got on the same page?At the time of writing, very few believe that the Leipzig summit will be as Merkel and co first imagined.On a practical level, the virus has meant that the two sides have not been able to physically meet. European diplomats point out that in the EU Council building, there are normally around 30 meeting rooms for representatives from the 27 member states to meet in and discuss sensitive issues. \"Now there are only about 10 that can guarantee social distancing,\" said one diplomat.Velina Tchakarova, head of institute at the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy, predicts that \"China's actions during and after the covid-19 would result in further disagreements and fragmentation within the European countries [on] how to settle the relations with Beijing.\" She points to disagreements on issues like allowing Chinese firms to build 5G networks and EU-level decisions on who can and cannot invest in member states.For these reasons and more, most believe that the Leipzig summit will be totally overshadowed by coronavirus.However, despite these low levels of trust and overt acknowledgment that China is a \"systemic rival,\" it seems likely the EU will try and get things back on track.\"It will make us rethink, but at the same time we cannot walk away from China,\" an EU diplomat told CNN. \"All of our economies rely on supply chains that run back to Wuhan and beyond. We've always said no one's interests are going to be served from not trading with them. So that problem will always be there.\"Related storiesEU chief denies disinformation report was watered down for ChinaIt's an insane time for Trump to pick (another) fight with ChinaChina is a massive headache for EuropeAnother German diplomat defended pressing on, saying that \"China's influence is rising, but it's not one-sided. Obviously, China also needs Europe.\" This, Brussels officials hope, means it can pressure China on things like its position on human rights.For the EU, engagement with China is about more than money. \"Increasing its engagement with China gives the EU a chance to double down on its strategic priorities,\" says Blockmans, referring to the key EU foreign policy priority of balancing its relations with China and the US, giving the EU more autonomy on the world stage.However, concerns over China's transparency during the pandemic has been a sharp reminder as to exactly what engagement with China actually means.On one hand, the EU's calculation on China hasn't changed: it's still desirable to not get squashed between the two great superpowers, China and America. On the other, recent history shows China to be an unreliable partner who divides opinion among EU member states.Sooner or later, Europe will have to weigh these two realities up and decide exactly how much that diplomatic independence from America is really worth.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK has suffered more deaths from coronavirus than any other country in Europe, reaching a grim milestone that piles further scrutiny on the response to the pandemic by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Tuesday that 29,427 people have died with Covid-19 since the outbreak began, more than in Italy and lower only than the United States. The official figure includes 693 new deaths in the most recent 24-hour period, up to 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) Monday.Italy revised its death count up to 29,315 on Tuesday. The official death toll in the US currently stands at more than 70,000, according to figures collected by Johns Hopkins University.Coronavirus death toll 54% higher in England and Wales than daily stats showedInternational comparisons are not flawless because countries count deaths in different ways and with varying levels of accuracy. Raab said at the daily UK government press briefing that a \"real verdict on how countries have done\" will not be fully available until after the pandemic is over.Read MoreBut Italy and Spain -- previously considered Europe's two hardest-hit countries -- are also significantly further along in their outbreaks than the UK and are already tentatively lifting some lockdown restrictions.The development comes just days before Johnson is due to address the country on Sunday.Johnson is expected to announce the nation's next steps, with widespread reports in the UK media this week of how the country will ease its lockdown measures.\"It's now clear that the second phase will be different. We will need to adjust to a new normal,\" Raab said on Tuesday. \"We want to make sure that the next phase is more comfortable, is more sustainable,\" he added. \"But we need to be under no illusions, the next stage won't be easy.\"But even the most recent government figures only tell a partial story. More data, released earlier on Tuesday, indicated that the true number of deaths by late April far exceeded that which was reported daily by ministers.What you need to know about coronavirus on Tuesday, May 5England's Office of National Statistics (ONS) said there were 29,998 deaths in which Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the period ending on April 24, or two days later in Scotland. That includes suspected coronavirus-related deaths in all settings, including care homes.Its figure far exceeds the death toll of 20,732 announced by the government at the same point. At the time, the government did not include patients who died from Covid-19 outside of hospitals.The UK government last week started including data on deaths outside hospitals in cases where people had tested positive for Covid-19. Previously, the UK-wide figures were only for hospital deaths.Johnson's government has been criticized for a lack of testing and for failing to provide adequate amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline workers. It did claim to reach its own target of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but only for two days and with the help of thousands of tests that were mailed out to households but not completed. The number of tests carried out daily subsequently dropped to 84,000 on Monday and 85,000 the day before.",

While boredom has driven some people to cut their own bangs or maybe dye their hair that one color their mom begged them not to, one man has taken it to an entirely different level.Chris Woodhead, a 33-year-old from East London, has been tattooing himself every day he's been in quarantine. As of Monday, the artist is on his 49th day of tattooing, and he has no intention of stopping.\"The idea of tattooing myself every day through the isolation came about in a way quite naturally,\" Woodhead told CNN. \"I thought it would be a good way of implementing some structure into my day, now that I can't tattoo from the studio.\"Woodhead is not unfamiliar with the process of tattooing his own body. The artist -- who works at a studio in London -- learned the art by giving himself 100 tattoos before ever tattooing another person.Read More         View this post on Instagram           Self-isolation tattoo no.14 A post shared by  Chris Woodhead (@adverse.camber) on Mar 30, 2020 at 8:13am PDT\nBefore his decision to turn his passion into a distraction, Woodhead's body was already covered in nearly 1,000 tattoos. While an additional 100 or so tattoos \"won't make a difference,\" Woodhead said he plans to keep going until he is able to return to his studio, regardless of how long it takes.After all, he has only so much skinHowever, Woodhead has about one month before he runs out of easily available space on his body. When that happens, the artist plans to draw designs that fit in the tiny spaces that may overlap with existing pieces.So far, Woodhead tattoos his body by contorting himself without even needing a mirror. While some spots were easier to tattoo than others, the back of his legs and elbows were the most difficult. Coming up with ideas for new tattoos everyday has not been a challenge for Woodhead, who is constantly drawing and trying out new ideas. Some of his isolation tattoos included a virus, butterfly, tiger, clown and a mermaid -- and the ideas just keep flowing.Chris Woodhead tattooing himself.\"It's definitely helped me get through the endless day-to-day. It's really boring being stuck at home, and without that creative process I would be pretty lost,\" Woodhead said. \"Also, I've been able to play with different techniques that I would potentially not be able to try on other people, so I am progressing my skill, which is really nice.\"Along with practicing how to tattoo tiny designs, which are more difficult, the artist is also learning more about the healing process. Woodhead said that he does not encourage anyone who is not a professional tattoo artist to try this at home on themselves. While tattooing himself has helped him stay grounded as the pandemic upends life around him, Woodhead said the process is much more than a mere distraction.\"Tattooing isn't a hobby to me or any other tattoo artist. It's a huge part of me. The human body is an incredible canvas to play around with, and there is endless space.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The year 2020 was supposed to be a golden one for sport, with this summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo a mouth-watering showpiece that should have had the world tuning in to see incredible feats of human athleticism. Instead, as with virtually all aspects of public life, the coronavirus has had an immeasurable impact on the world of sport, leaving a trail of empty arenas, canceled events and economic turmoil in its wake. RELATED: Covering the pandemic -- CNN correspondents reflect on how we got hereFrom the beginning of the outbreak in late 2019 and the first sporting fixtures canceled in the early weeks of 2020, CNN journalists have covered this unprecedented event from every angle. This is the story of the pandemic that brought sport to a standstill, from those who have witnessed and reported on it first-hand.The beginning of the outbreakIn late 2019, the World Health Organization receives word of a pneumonia-like disease in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The story develops into 2020 with the first known death in Wuhan on January 11. Read MoreJUST WATCHEDCNN reporter describes scramble to flee Wuhan before lockdownReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN reporter describes scramble to flee Wuhan before lockdown 04:13On January 22, following reports the death toll has risen to 17, a \"temporary\" closure of Wuhan's railway stations and the airport to prevent people from departing is announced. Eleven million people are suddenly on lockdown -- the first of many. This is the point at which the sporting world first feels the impact of the virus, with the cancellation of an Olympic boxing qualifying tournament (January 22) and an Olympic football qualification event scheduled for February being moved away from Wuhan due to the outbreak.Christina Macfarlane, CNN World Sport Anchor, based in London: We began to see the first real sporting impact of the coronavirus in January and February when in China international events began to be postponed and shut down -- sports like football, tennis, golf. At the time, it felt like something that needed to happen because the Wuhan lockdown had just been put in place. So, it felt somewhat inevitable.Will Ripley, CNN International Correspondent, based in Hong Kong: I landed in Japan in early February and the big story at that time was the Diamond Princess cruise ship. There were 3,700 people on board; the virus is spreading on the ship. And at that time, there wasn't a thought in anyone's mind that what was happening could affect the Olympics. It just wasn't even on the radar. The show must go onAtalanta fans cheer during the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg football match Atalanta Bergamo vs Valencia on February 19, 2020 at the San Siro stadium in Milan.The spread of the virus gathers pace through February with more cases identified outside China. By the end of February, Europe is experiencing a large increase in cases of the virus -- Italy has become the epicenter of the outbreak and on February 25 the Lombardy region is forced to impose the country's first lockdown of some 100,000 people. Sporting events have been continuing in Italy and throughout Europe. As the outbreak worsens, questions are being asked about why sports is still taking place.Amanda Davies, CNN World Sport Anchor, based in London: People were still using sport as an opportunity to come together. The organizers, the sporting authorities at that point say they were following government advice, and the governments up to that point were saying that sport didn't necessarily need to be impacted. It is easy to use hindsight but, should they have gone ahead when they did? I don't think so.Macfarlane: It seemed like it was business as usual. I mean, we were all getting on the train going to work. And in sport, there was no reason for people not to travel to big games and to pack into stadiums and it just felt uncomfortable, but there was no one at that time saying that it should be any different.Don Riddell, CNN World Sport Anchor, based in Atlanta: The mayor of Bergamo -- which ended up becoming one of the epicenters of the outbreak in Italy -- blamed the UEFA Champions League game between Atalanta and Valencia on February 19th for the spread of the virus. It was played in front of over 40,000 people in Milan.Pressure building on the International Olympic CommitteeInternational Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach, pictured Decemeber 5, 2019.On March 3, Japan's Olympic minister, Seiko Hashimoto, says the Tokyo 2020 Games \"could be postponed until later this year.\" On March 4 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President, Thomas Bach, responds following a meeting of the IOC's Executive Committee, stating \"postponement\" and \"cancellation\" were not mentioned in relation to the 2020 Tokyo Games.Riddell: For the Executive Committee to have that meeting and say not once did they use or hear the word postponement or cancellation, I think is absolutely extraordinary. When you think of what was already happening around Europe, the bodies were already piling up.Davies: Let's be clear, the decision to cancel the Olympic Games is not a small one. There has been such a level of investment over a number of years, not only from the Japanese and Tokyo, it was so obvious how much they wanted this Games to happen and how important it is for Japan as a country -- also from an IOC perspective.Ripley: I lived and worked in Japan for more than four years. I've seen the blood, the sweat and the tears that have gone into preparing for Tokyo 2020. You cannot turn a corner in this city without seeing signs for Tokyo 2020. Every taxi, buildings, advertisements, it's everywhere. If you would have told me a few months ago that there was even a remote chance that Tokyo 2020 would be postponed, I would have thought you were crazy. I would have thought the Japanese would never allow the Olympics to be postponed. In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, while the rest of the world was fighting the virus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was fighting to save the Olympics. That was his focus.March 11 Eric Paschall of the Golden State Warriors dribbles between JaMychal Green and Reggie Jackson of the LA Clippers at Chase Center on March 10, 2020 in San Francisco, California. The next day the Golden State Warriors announced it would begin playing behind closed doors.The virus is now rampant throughout Europe with some sporting fixtures being played without spectators or canceled altogether. On March 10, Italy's Serie A announces the season will be suspended due to the severity of the situation. The virus is also beginning to spread throughout the US, with northern California one of the worst affected areas. As a result, NBA powerhouse the Golden State Warriors announce on March 11 that they will be playing the Brooklyn Nets in an empty arena following guidance from San Francisco Mayor, London Breed. Riddell: March the 11th I know is a day that I will remember probably for the rest of my life. So much was happening, there was breaking news just cascading every 20-30 minutes. Donald Trump was speaking and it sounded really quite consequential. So, I turned that on, and he announced that pretty much all international travel incoming to the United States was shut down. I was like, \"wow, now this is really going to impact all of us in quite profound ways.\" And then my phone started buzzing again. And it was with everything that was unraveling rapidly in the NBA, so I changed the channel.Andy Scholes, CNN Sports correspondent, based in Atlanta: It was really a surreal scene. The Oklahoma City Thunder and the Utah Jazz were out there on the floor. I mean, just moments away from tip off, but Utah Jazz All Star center Rudy Gobert had been feeling ill and they tested him for coronavirus. His positive tests came in just moments before they were going to start that game. So, officials came out and said, \"Hold on, we need to talk this through.\" And after some discussions, they decided we're not going to be able to play this game. And then moments later NBA Commissioner Adam Silver made the decision to suspend play indefinitely for the entire league. So the NBA was the first to shut down, and it really just snowballed from there.JUST WATCHEDNBA suspends season after player tests positive for coronavirusReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNBA suspends season after player tests positive for coronavirus 02:02Coy Wire, CNN Sports Correspondent, based in Atlanta: Immediately you thought of the worst case (scenario). You knew that if the NBA did this -- if they suspended their season -- well, then the NHL is going to do that, the MLB ... And then you're starting to think about this avalanche of sporting events that are on their way, but now are potentially in jeopardy.The Domino EffectIn the 24 hours that followed, the English Premier League, Major League Baseball, Formula One's Australian Grand Prix, The Masters and Germany's Bundesliga are all suspended, postponed or canceled. European football's governing body UEFA then announces the suspension and postponement of their flagship international and club tournaments, Euro 2020 and the Champions League. Macfarlane: All these events had been canceled in a short space of time; it was clear that the Olympics were now under threat.On March 24, after coming under increasing pressure to postpone, a decision is reached and a statement delivered: \"The IOC president and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games ... must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.\"Ripley: By the time the Olympics were actually postponed, most Japanese people had seen it coming for weeks. I was surprised when I was talking to people out on the streets, weeks before the announcement, they were saying there's no way that Japan can safely host these Games.JUST WATCHEDThe Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been postponed to 2021ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Tokyo 2020 Olympics have been postponed to 2021 02:43Riddell: I think the one thing that the IOC really let themselves down with was the athletes. The athletes who are finding it harder and harder to train train. The athletes who are finding it harder and harder even to qualify. And the IOC is supposed to represent them. These guys are the stars of the show and it seems as though they were the last thought and consideration by the International Olympic Committee. They failed those athletes and that really is a great shame. Wire: Look, these Olympic athletes are really impacted by the Games being pushed back. The mental and physical transition of Olympians having to shift their plans or goals and aspirations back by a whole year is so tough. Operating at a high level in sport is 99% mental. The pros, the Olympians, they are all physically gifted. So, the thing that separates the mighty from the mundane is their competitive nature, their preparedness, their mindset.UnprecedentedNovak Djokovic plays Roger Federer in the final of the Men's Singles at Wimbledon on July 14, 2019.Wimbledon's illustrious tennis championships is canceled for 2020 on April 1. At this stage, almost all professional sport is on hold with a few minor exceptions.Scholes: Never in my lifetime have I never had any sports to watch or events to go to. So it's definitely been rough, and when we look back at the sports calendar of 2020 it's definitely going to be unforgettable. Riddell: We've all lived through news events, and we've lived through some major news events, but nothing that impacts us in every way of our lives as this has done. And sport has suffered greatly --and not just professional sport, amateur sport, too. If you're not a runner or a cyclist, you're not doing sport either right now. Wire: For sports in general, this pandemic, it's been a complete knockout punch. Virtually the entire sports world is flat on its back, with no real hope of seeing it stagger to its feet anytime soon. What Next?JUST WATCHEDMagic Johnson: 'We need sports especially in a time like this. But only if everybody is safe'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMagic Johnson: 'We need sports especially in a time like this. But only if everybody is safe' 03:03As gate receipts dry up and huge questions remain over TV deals, almost all sports leagues, teams and athletes are feeling economic pressures brought on by the pandemic. With sports on hold, many athletes take to social media to share their home workouts and spread positive messages to the fans. As lockdown measures in some parts of the world begin to loosen, and with billions of dollars of revenue on the line, the focus of the sports world turns to how and when to return to the field of play.Davies: We still don't truly know what the long-term financial impact will be. There's some money washing around in the top level of sport, but it doesn't necessarily filter all the way down through the leagues, through the clubs. The individuals who aren't in the world top 10, for example, their life is going to change on a pretty large scale. From a fan's perspective, with everybody across society being affected, is sport still going to be up there as the thing you do at the weekend? Are the Olympics still going to be the thing that you go to for your holiday? Or are you going to stay at home this year? A cameraman records footage among empty stands during a pre-season baseball game between Seoul-based Doosan Bears and LG Twins at Jamsil stadium in Seoul on April 21, 2020. Professional sport returned to South Korea on April 21 as coronavirus restrictions ease.Riddell: We don't know when sport is going to start again and when it does start again, what is it going to look like? So, there are these major short-term factors we need to consider. When is it going to be safe enough to be able to get athletes onto the same field or on the same court competing against each other and not infecting each other? Then, when are we going to be able to pack stadiums with tens of thousands of fans safely? Nobody knows. Scholes: The day sports do return is going to be one amazing day. It might have to be a national holiday going forward, because people just want their sports back so badly. If we're able to ride this out, and able to get through this tough time here in the spring, then the late summer into the fall could be epic. You're going to have possibly an NBA Finals in September-October. You could have golf majors and tennis grand slams taking place one after another, not to mention football starting. And then you'd have baseball going at the same time. It's rough right now, but we could be in for one awesome, awesome late summer or fall for sport.",

        "content": "(CNN)Russia hit a grim milestone over the weekend, officially recording the highest number of coronavirus cases the country has seen in a 24-hour period, with 10,633 people testing positive. And the economic pain is worsening: Last week, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on state television that he had never seen a crisis like Covid-19.\"I don't recall anything like this,\" he said, adding that plummeting global oil prices -- a primary source of Russian state revenue -- had delivered a \"double hit\" to the country's economy.  It adds up to a dangerous political moment for Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a new survey published by independent pollster Levada-Center, less than half of respondents -- 46% -- said the Russian government had responded adequately to the crisis. Russia adds record 10,000 coronavirus cases in dramatic turnaround as Putin's problems stack upThe pandemic has even hit Putin's usually sky-high approval ratings. In March, as authorities acknowledged the spread of coronavirus in Russia, Levada-Center found that Putin's approval rating had dropped to 63%. That may sound high, but it's a level not seen since 2013, before Russia's annexation of Crimea prompted a groundswell of public support for the president.Coronavirus has hit Moscow, the country's political center of gravity, particularly hard. According to official statistics, the capital accounts for around half of the country's cases. Before the pandemic, Muscovites were politically active and mobilized, for instance, in massive street demonstrations that followed the country's flawed legislative elections in 2011. Read MoreWhile lockdown measures mean that new street protests are out of the question, Russians have taken their discontent online: One live-streamed discussion last week earned over 67,000 views on YouTube.Related storiesAnger rises among Russia's doctorsMoscow's digital system to enforce lockdownTrack the spread of the coronavirusLive updates on the pandemicRussia's embattled opposition has seized on the coronavirus crisis to step up its criticism of the president, particularly over the Kremlin's economic response to the crisis. Opposition leader Alexey Navalny, for instance, has called for tapping the National Welfare Fund, a $165 billion pot of money created by previously high energy prices to help individuals and small enterprises recover. While Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed Navalny's idea as \"populist\" and \"superficial,\" three online petitions for Navalny's proposals have gathered over 1 million signatures.It's important to state up front that coronavirus is not yet an existential threat to Putin. The Russian president enjoys flattering coverage on state television, which has cast him as a cool-headed and competent leader in the response to the crisis. Kremlin-controlled airwaves routinely feature Putin presiding remotely over meetings from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow. In a meeting last week, he hectored top government officials about the need to produce \"tangible results\" for Russians struggling with the economic fallout of coronavirus.\"What about the special insurance for the medical specialists that are now helping these patients, risking their lives and health?\" Putin said. \"What about the additional monthly payments of 5,000 rubles [$67] for a child up to three years old for families that are entitled to maternity payments? Let me remind you that these payments are due for April, May and June.\"The president added: \"I would like you to report on the implementation of these measures and whether this aid is perceptible for the people.\"Doctors at the intensive care unit of a hospital in Moscow.Workers clean a street in central Moscow on May 2.The Kremlin, it seems, is belatedly waking up to the peril that Russia's budding middle class of shop owners, restaurateurs and fitness studio entrepreneurs face from coronavirus. On Monday, the Russian government launched an online portal for citizens and businesses seeking government assistance. The site is supposed to be a one-stop shop listing government measures available to different sectors of the economy.Whether that website changes public perception is another matter entirely. Putin has already postponed a nationwide vote that could pave the way for him to stay in power after his current term ends, potentially until 2036. And as lockdown continues and coronavirus spreads, the Kremlin is likely to face more questions about whether ordinary Russians can expect the same kind of sweeping economic intervention seen in the US and European countries.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Millions of people across Europe were returning to some semblance of their former lives Monday as more countries across the continent began to reopen after weeks or months of coronavirus-related lockdowns. But not everyone is happy with how the \"new normal\" looks.Italian businesses are wondering how they'll survive as restrictions are eased but not fully lifted. Students are heading back to socially-distanced schools in Germany, where newly reopened barber shops are facing huge demand to right the wrongs of weeks of home haircuts. Belgians can once again use public transport, but face coverings are mandatory, while small shops are reopening in Greece and Portugal. \"Phase 2\" of Italy's plan to ease restrictions began Monday, with more than 4 million people expected to return to work, some public transport services restored, and many businesses set to reopen, Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on Facebook. \"Like never before, the future of the country will be in our hands.\"Although industries such as textiles and manufacturing are restarting, many non-essential stores remain closed. While bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen from Monday, they can only offer takeaway. A waitress handles takeaway coffee at a cafe in Rome on Monday.Franco, the owner of Il Bello Cafe bar in Rome, said the partial easing of restrictions would not be enough to keep many establishments afloat. Read More\"I just reopened today, but it's not even worth it. There is so little work for us, few people are coming in, but also the bar isn't about just buying a coffee, or cappuccino, it's about a conversation. It's social,\" Franco, who declined to give his last name, told CNN. \"The government does what they have to do for the pandemic, but the bar and our work is something else -- it doesn't go with these measures.\"He said that he was still paying rent, electricity and gas but only making 30% of what he was making before the lockdown. \"My staff are worried but so am I. I may have to close and I've been here 14 years,\" he said. \"There will be so many firings soon in this line of business.\"The Italian government said that to fully reopen stores, bars and restaurants it must slow the reproduction rate of the coronavirus to 0.5, meaning that each infected Italian is infecting less than one other person (an \"R0 value\" of 1, for instance, means that every infected person is infecting one other person). To reopen theaters, conventions and stadiums, Italy wants the number to be as close as possible to 0. Currently the figure is around 0.6-0.7 nationally.Restaurant, bar and store owners around Italy were last week \"handing over their keys\" to local mayors in protest over the slow reopening, and Conte apologized on Friday for a delay to financial aid payments to businesses impacted by the pandemic. A joint letter from 13 of the 20 Italian regions last Wednesday asked the government \"to guarantee the possibility of reopening activities to all those who respect the measures already provided\" by the lockdown decree. \"It's clear that health is the first essential objective, but it can't be the only one,\" the letter added.A line forms at a salon in Berlin on Monday after hairdressers were allowed to reopen.There were frustrations in other countries, too. German hairdressers opened Monday after weeks of shutdown, but customers are not able to walk in -- they now need an appointment and in Berlin have to fill out a questionnaire.One salon in Hamburg said it was \"overrun\" by customers, while Udo Walz, a hairdresser to the stars in Berlin, told CNN his salons were booked out for the next three weeks.\"I was in the shop this morning, everyone is wearing masks, the customers, the hairdressers, it is a bit funny,\" said Walz. \"Most of the customers have 2 centimeters of roots showing. Some of them tried to cut their hair themselves or cover up the color, but that usually went wrong, although I gave tips on the telephone.\"Salons must observe social distancing rules, so Walz said every other chair has to remain empty, which works for him as he has large salons. While Walz has not had to lay off any of his 86 employees, he acknowledged they have lost out financially. \"They did not get tips and that is important as we have a good clientele. Their salary was reduced a bit, but we have a great team.\"Other European countries are gradually relaxing restrictions. Spain allowed people outside for solo exercise this weekend for the first time in seven weeks. Portugal opens small stores Monday, and people in Belgium may travel on public transport but must wear a masks, AFP reports. Traffic increased on Greek streets Monday as small stores including hair salons, flower shops and bookstores reopened and lines formed outside electrical appliance retailers, Reuters reported. Greece, which has been praised for its coronavirus response, is planning to welcome tourists again this summer. Lifting lockdowns safely relies on effective testing. Germany surges ahead, but US states are flying blindThe UK, meanwhile, has not relaxed restrictions yet but is also making plans for returning to work. A draft government plan is looking at staggered starts, maximizing work from home and hygiene measures such as two-meter distancing and physical screens, according to British media reports. UK transport minister Grant Shapps said more public transport would be running soon, although he suggested people would be encouraged to walk or ride to work when they return. The suggestion was met with concern by Britain's three main rail unions, who said in a letter to the Prime Minister on Monday that now was not the time to run more trains because there was no agreement on how to protect workers and passengers. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said at the Downing Street briefing on Sunday that \"the worst thing to do\" would be to prematurely  relax measures and risk a second spike in the disease. He said the UK should proceed with caution, raising serious questions over what the long-term financial impact could be.As Europe reopens, the big question is how the once vibrant continent will look as we move into a different future to the one we all expected. It has certainly changed forever.Emma Reynolds wrote from London, Valentina Di Donato reported from Rome, and Stephanie Halasz reported from London.

The emergency was initially declared in late March and had been set to expire May 11.The extension is part of a set of measures to be proposed to Parliament on Tuesday, Health Minister Olivier Veran said in a news conference.French Health Minister Olivier Veran, left, said a proposal to extend his country's emergency measures would go before lawmakers Tuesday.Veran addressed reporters following a cabinet meeting on the coronavirus crisis. He said that lifting the emergency order earlier would waste the \"considerable efforts made by the French people.\"\"If we were to decrease overnight on May 11 the efforts we made, we can bet that all these efforts, made admirably by the French people, would have been in vain,\" Veran said.Other proposed measures include limiting foreign travel and introducing a quarantining process for some travelers entering France.\"The government's objective is not to prevent the French people from traveling; the government's objective is to prevent the virus from traveling,\" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said at the news conference.Castaner added the proposed measures would not include restrictions on people traveling between districts within France. Quarantine measuresVeran said Saturday that people entering France from \"abroad, Corsica and other overseas territory\" could be quarantined under the new measures, but Sunday the Elysee Palace told CNN a quarantine would not apply to travelers from the Schengen Area of the European Union and the United Kingdom.This is regardless of the nationality of those traveling to France, the palace said.The Schengen Area is a zone of 26 European countries that allow people to move freely among them.

        "content": "(CNN)Plans had been laid, drinks had been contemplated and celebrations imagined.Before the coronavirus pandemic brought the Premier League season to an abrupt pause, Liverpool were just two wins away from winning English football's top prize -- their first league title in 30 years.But as the Premier League examines ways of restarting the season, a potential resumption of the current campaign is bitterly dividing fans.\"All those celebrations we had planned, those drinks with friends and the hugs and kisses that we imagined when it finally got confirmed, we've had to wait on that now and obviously we're going to have to think about it in different terms,\" Liverpool fan and co-founder of The Anfield Wrap Gareth Roberts told CNN Sport.\"But I still think it would be a huge thing for Liverpool to finally win it and, like any Liverpool fan, I'd like to see that confirmed.\"Read MoreREAD: 30 years of dreaming: Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football's biggest prizeOrganizers have stepped up attempts to bring back the English Premier League. Safety firstThere have been 172,481 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom with 26,842 deaths, according to latest figures. A number of Premier League teams have had multiple members of their squad test positive for the virus. So whilst he is desperate to see a return of action, Roberts doesn't want the health and safety of others to be compromised as a result. He accepts the dream of watching his team lift the trophy in front of a packed Anfield Stadium is a long way from fruition, with any return inevitably to be played behind closed doors. But Roberts knows just how important football is to the community and says watching the games on television will still bring some much welcome relief. \"For me, it's an issue around integrity. Football means so much to people and they put so much into it,\" added the 43-year-old. \"If you suddenly strip that away, I think a lot of people would find that hard to deal with.\"I actually think a lot of people would walk away from the game if you said Liverpool are not going to have the chance to win the title now.\"Liverpool fans let of smoke flares as their team coach arrives at the stadium prior to the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Manchester City at Anfield on November 10, 2019.READ: From Senegal to superhero, but Sadio Mane's story isn't a fantasy'Bonkers' to rush backHowever, the mood at the other end of the Premier League table is very different.  Newly-promoted Norwich City has struggled in the top flight this season and is anchored ominously at the foot of the table -- needing a major turnaround in form to avoid relegation. For Jack Reeve, founder of the Talk Norwich City podcast, football means relatively little in the context of the crisis and, on balance, he would prefer the season to be abandoned, describing any return at the moment as \"bonkers.\" \"We haven't got a vaccine, the deaths aren't going down that much and we're still planning on bringing the season back. It just seems ludicrous to me,\" Reeve told CNN Sport.Like Roberts, Reeve says safety in the stadiums is paramount to any return to action but, unlike Roberts, he says football behind closed doors is not a prospect he's looking forward to.   \"I think people would much prefer sports to return in a safe capacity, rather than being rushed back,\" he said, admitting it would be tough to take if Norwich was relegated without having the chance to finish the season.\"I want the fairest possible outcome but, unfortunately, I don't think there is a particularly fair outcome unless the season continues and I don't think that's a particularly wise move either.\"READ: Thiery Henry talks about the coronavirus pandemic JUST WATCHEDSportswashing: What is it and who practice it?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSportswashing: What is it and who practice it? 02:32'Central pillar to your life'Earlier this week UK lawmaker Oliver Dowden said: \"I have been in talks with the Premier League with a view to getting football up and running as soon as possible in order to support the whole football community. But, of course, any such moves would have to be consistent with public health guidance.\"Advocates of a potential return to action have suggested it might help lift the mood of the nation.\"Some of the conversations appear to be around the general morale of the country and I think football does play a part in that,\" added Roberts.\"When you devote so much of your life to something and it's such a central pillar to your life, to have that suddenly taken away with very little notice is difficult for people to deal with.\"You've got that moment of sheer joy [when Liverpool win]; the expression on your face is the expression on the face of thousands of other people as well. You can't recreate that.\"Teemu Pukki of Norwich City celebrates with teammates after scoring his team's third goal during the Premier League match between Norwich City and Manchester City at Carrow Road on September 14, 2019.It's an observation also shared by Reeve who says he's missed the social side of sitting in a crowd of thousands and cheering his team on, even despite its lowly position. \"It's always been about the people I see at the ground that I think has been been the biggest loss for me,\" he added.\"Not having that has really sort of thrown me off and I know it's thrown a lot of other people off. For some people, football is their life and I feel sorry for them.\"Premier League organizers have this week ramped up plans to restart the current season with reports suggesting a soft target of June 8, with players expected back at training next month. England's top-flight clubs are due to meet Friday to discuss a potential return, whilst European football's governing body UEFA has urged domestic leagues to make a decision on the fate of this season by May 25.",

And the actions and decisiveness of these two officers, I believe, has resulted in no other persons being further injured,\" Dawson said.David J Derschow told CNN that his girlfriend Esther Brooks was hurt in the attack.\"I started hearing screaming coming from the entrance where she [was supposed] to come out from and I went to see if she was [safe] but people and kids where running out,\" he said.\"I saw my partner walk out. I asked what happened and she just asked if she had been stabbed and sure enough she was.\"Brooks was taken to hospital and later discharged after receiving stitches. She has since given a statement to the police.Police said the attack was not believed to be politically or ideologically motivated.",

Locked out of the family home, she says she spent two years homeless and endured a fractious legal battle with her father. Things got even worse when she was imprisoned, convicted of blackmail in 2011. She says she came within seconds of stepping in front of a train to end her life.She says redemption came working as a porn actress and, now at the age of 34, Van de Leur has penned her autobiography, laying out details of her life.Read MoreShe is adamant there are no regrets. Of her foray into the adult movie industry, which she says she stopped last year, Van de\u00a0Leur told CNN Sport's Don Riddell: \"Actually no regrets because I was living on the streets ...\u00a0I would still do it, so I don't have any regrets, not the way I did it, no.\"Engrossed by watching gymnastics at the 1996 Olympics, she set her heart on competing at the Games. The medals followed, with silver both at the World and European Championships. She was named Dutch sportswoman of the year in 2002 just before turning 17.

But you have all the pressures coming and you have to succeed at the next competition again and again.\"Trying to pinpoint when things began to unravel is hard for Van de\u00a0Leur.\u00a0Van de Leur quit gymnastics in her early 20s.At times, she thinks it could have been as early as the age of nine when she took up gymnastics competitively.What's not in doubt is that the downward spiral started in 2003 following an injury. Suddenly, Van de Leur says, she had nothing.\"If I look back, it's just a sport, a hobby you're good at,\" she says. \"But at the time it was printed in my head, 'This is what you are. You are only a gymnast'. And for me there was no life besides it ...\u00a0For the people around me, I was only that robot, only the gymnast and I didn't have friends.\"So, if your sport is falling apart, there's nothing left so you have this black hole.\"Van de Leur says her falling out of love with gymnastics reached its peak in 2008 when she announced to the media at the European Championships that she was walking away from the sport that had defined her life. She was just 22.Her first reaction was happiness it was finally over, and for once she felt like she was taking control of her own life. However, when she told her parents, she says they remonstrated with her, concerned Van de Leur was turning her back on potential earnings.In her opinion, their attitude was that \"money was more important than their own daughter.\" Around that time, she returned to the family home only to discover she was no longer welcome, she says.READ: A gymnastics routine inspired by Beyonc\u00e9'Locked out of home'CNN tried to contact Van de Leur's father for comment via email, phone and social media but proved unsuccessful, as well as her sister.\u00a0\u00a0\"I tried the locks, I had a key as I was living there and you try it and it's not working,\" Van de Leur recalled. \"You first think, well, it must be a mistake or I'll just call home. They didn't answer, they didn't open and then I realized I wasn't welcome anymore.\"So, she slept in her car with her boyfriend that night, first annoyed and then heartbroken that her family had rejected her.\u00a0She says, \"The last time I saw them was in court.\"\u00a0A court summary of the case says Van de Leur argued that in 2008, her father, who acted as her agent, \"withdrew an amount of \u20ac9,000 ($9768)  from the claimant's payment account without the consent or knowledge of the claimant, of which only part of the claimant was repaid or related to costs incurred on behalf of the claimant.\"She added: \"I've asked for the accounting and where's my sponsorship money and all the money I get from gymnastics when I won and it was just all gone. The only thing was to get justice to go to court so that's what I did.\"An attorney listed as Van de Leur's father's lawyer at the time declined to comment to CNN citing code of conduct.The court summary states that Van de Leur's father argued that he had \"incurred costs including moving the claimant's personal property out of her trainer's home, buying gifts for the trainer and her family, replacing locks in the defendant's home and staying with family related to potential threats.\"However, in February 2009, a court of The Hague ordered her father to pay her \u20ac1,355.89 ($1471) as well as allow Van de Leur to\u00a0return to his home to retrieve a number of items: a sunbed, tracksuits and leotards, and various presents, and to stop running a website in her name.Reflecting on facing her parents in the court room, Van de\u00a0Leur said: \"From the beginning, I know I lost everything and money doesn't get parents back.\"Verona van de Leur's gymnastics career stalled after an injury.'I wasn't used to showing\u00a0myself nude'For two years after her family fallout, she says she was homeless. During that time, Van de Leur was arrested for trying to blackmail a couple having an extra marital affair -- she was charged with extortion -- which resulted in her spending 72 days in prison. \"In that time, being homeless, I didn't care anymore how I got money for food,\" she said.\"But even in that worst situation I know it was not my right to determine the law and, yes, I regret that I didn't choose or find another option in that period of time. Maybe it's good for me that I have been punished for 72 days to realize I was wrong, and I was.\"\u00a0\u00a0When out of jail, the adult industry -- first as a webcam model and then making videos with her boyfriend -- seemed a good way out. The couple is still together 13 years on.\"I saw it as a chance,\" said Van de Leur. \"It was a big contract so I could build something, starting my business. I was starting as a webcam model. It wasn't physical contact, so computer screen was okay. I wasn't used to showing myself nude, of course.\"The reaction in Holland to her dramatic career change, she says, was mixed, but having been homeless and in jail, Van de\u00a0Leur saw her new job as offering her a fresh start.\"I didn't say at the time I lived on the street or where I was coming from but for me this was actually a step up and they only saw that I was going down,\" she said. \"So, I kept it in my mind, it's my life, it's what I like to do and I always saw it as work.\"Van de Leur also made a return to the gymnastics world at the World Championships in Stuttgart last year where she worked\u00a0as an analyst for the Dutch media, but she returned home prematurely before the event had finished.As she reflects on the various twists and turns of her life, Van de Leur says she wishes she had been smarter at a younger age when her gymnastics career was taking off.Above all these days she wants to embrace life --\u00a0having come so close to ending it all.It was amid the dispute with her family, that Van de Leur says she went to a railway line to kill herself.\"I went to the train and I was just counting from 10 to zero and I didn't jump,\" she recalled. \"I don't know why but it was really the moment that it could be all over.\"I was thinking about my family that I lost, I was living on the street, I had nothing, nothing to eat, no money in my hands, so I had nothing to live for.\"That was what I was thinking at that moment but, when the train just passed, I don't know something snapped maybe. I still don't know why I didn't jump,\u00a0\u00a0I was crying and then just walked away.\"Now, Van de Leur says that moment gives her strength and that she's learned to \"enjoy every moment of her life.\"",

I doubt it.\"Djokovic, Nadal and Federer have 56 grand slams between them.The six-time grand slam winner, who coached Djokovic between 2014 and 2017, described that type of relationship between the tennis icons as \"understandable.\"\"Think of the Formula One drivers,\" he explained. \"Think of Lewis Hamilton having a meal with Sebastian Vettel.

        "content": "London (CNN)The British government has claimed a win in its battle against coronavirus.Health Secretary Matt Hancock asserted on Friday that it had met a headline-grabbing aim of conducting 100,000 daily Covid-19 tests by the end of April. The figure was 122,347, he said -- although officials conceded that 40,369 of those were sent to people's homes or to satellite testing centers, and had not necessarily been processed by labs.The government argued, with some justification, that the huge expansion in testing capacity -- up from 10,000 a day at the beginning of April -- was a huge achievement.But the fact that the target was needed at all, critics say, only served to illustrate the inadequacies of Britain's testing regime in the first place.Whether the target was hit or missed, there are other failings. The UK is on track to have one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in Europe, with more than 26,000 deaths recorded by Wednesday. Its patchwork of care homes for the elderly has been ravaged by the disease. There have been near-daily reports of insufficient personal protective equipment on the front line, meaning doctors, nurses and care home workers risk catching it every time they go to work.Read MoreThe country's leader himself contracted the disease, becoming so ill that his advisers were not completely sure that he would recover from it. At the time, daily briefings breezily proclaimed Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in \"good spirits\" when in fact -- by Johnson's own account later -- the situation was significantly more grave.Boris Johnson, center, is flanked by the Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, left, and Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance at a March 12 news conference.And, despite ministers' repeated insistence that they are being \"guided by the science\" in their coronavirus response, secrecy still shrouds the nature of that scientific advice. The current membership of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), the government's main scientific advisory body, which changes depending on the crisis, has not been listed publicly. The group hasn't published the basis of any of its advice for more than a month. There is, as yet, no published framework for exiting the lockdown that has brought the fifth largest economy in the world to a grinding halt.So far, the government appears to have successfully batted away suggestions that its coronavirus strategy has been a failure by pointing to one, crucial measure of success: The country's beloved National Health Service (NHS) has so far ridden out the crisis without being overwhelmed. The desperate scenes witnessed in northern Italy, where a world-class health system was brought to its knees, have not been repeated in the UK.\"This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice,\" a government spokesperson told CNN, in response to a request to address the criticisms raised in this article. Ministers and officials have been \"working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, [and] made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it.\"But could more have been done to prevent the scale of loss of life? Should ministers have acted sooner? And could there be more transparency in the overall strategy?A crucial dateHistorians might look back on March 12 as the most significant date in Britain's coronavirus response. This was the day the UK formally abandoned the \"contain\" phase -- an attempt to stop the virus in its tracks by tracking every outbreak and tracing its origins; and moved to the \"delay\" phase -- an effort to \"flatten the curve\" and prevent the health service from being overloaded.On that day Johnson stood before journalists, flanked by his scientific and medical advisers, and admitted that \"many more families are going to lose loved ones.\" But he didn't go as far as ordering a lockdown -- that would come over a week later. Ths stands were packed during day four of the Cheltenham Festival on March 13. (Tom Jenkins/Getty Images)\nAs he spoke, tens of thousands of people gathered at the Cheltenham racecourse for its annual festival, an early fixture in England's social calendar. Was that wise, he was asked? \"It is very important that we're guided by the science,\" Johnson said, using a phrase that was to become a favorite of government ministers. \"There is very little epidemiological or medical reason at the moment to ban such events.\"Johnson's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, admitted that even people with \"really quite mild symptoms\" could be contagious. Despite this, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed with Johnson that canceling large events was \"not a major way to tackle this epidemic.\"Indeed, the next day, Vallance told BBC Radio 4's flagship morning news program, in a now-infamous interview, that a \"key\" aim would be to \"build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.\" Government sources have told CNN that herd immunity was never official policy.On March 23, in a televised address to the nation, Johnson switched course, announcing the most sweeping set of social restrictions in the UK since the end of World War II. By that time, 335 people had died from Covid-19 in the UK. Given the weeks-long gap between initial infection and death, it's clear now that by the time Johnson spoke, coronavirus had taken hold in Britain.Three key questionsCritics are zeroing in on three key areas as they seek to find out what went wrong in the UK.First, there was the abandonment of mass testing.At the start of the outbreak in the UK, public health officials tracked and traced every known case. Ministers have never offered a clear reason for why that policy was abandoned. Was it because the testing capacity had been reached? Was it because the system could not cope with the expected upturn in demand? Was it structural, since the public health system in England has, over the years, gradually been centralized?\"Abandoning testing gave the virus the green light to spread uncontrollably,\" says the Royal Society of Medicine's Gabriel Scally. \"If you don't have access to testing, you won't know that you have an outbreak until a lot of people are ill.\"Some in the scientific community say an obsession with central control led officials to set up the testing regime initially in just a few labs, rather than allowing local hospitals to do it themselves.\"Sadly, it seems likely to me that once the government models showed how bad the crisis would be, our testing capacity wouldn't be anywhere near able to cope with the coming surge,\" a leading microbiologist told CNN on condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions. \"God only knows what their thinking was not telling hospitals to get ready. It was a mistake.\" Downing Street declined to provide an on-the-record explanation to CNN on this issue.The second crucial question is whether the government failed to order a lockdown early enough. Even though the government did not know by that March 12 briefing just how many people were infected, Whitty said it was still too early to lock down because \"if people go too early, they become very fatigued.\" If tough restrictions came too early, the theory went, the British public would begin to tire of it just as they were starting to become effective, and demands for them to be lifted would become impossible to resist.Government sources defended that course of action to CNN, pointing out that some mitigation measures were put in place between March 12 and the full lockdown on March 23, like advising vulnerable groups to stay at home and requiring people with certain symptoms to self-quarantine.The UK government ordered a full lockdown on March 23. (Victoria Jones/PA/AP)The third big question is the pursuit of so-called \"herd immunity.\"\"It's not possible to stop everybody getting it,\" said Vallance at the March 12 briefing. However, the experience of countries like South Korea and Germany, where testing and tracking systems have been significantly more rigorous, and in New Zealand, where lockdown measures were taken at a much earlier stage, suggest that it has been possible to stop quite a large number of people from getting it.Medical experts both inside and outside the government's circle of trusted advisers have admitted to CNN that they believe the government waited too long to enter lockdown. \"Many of the decisions the government has made ignore basic public health science,\" says Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter. \"From abandoning track and trace, to the timing of the lockdown, to providing the correct protective equipment, ignoring basic public health science may have led to more deaths than necessary.\"Pankhania believes that despite government claims it has been guided by science at every step, the decision to delay lockdown was likely \"governed by economic consideration, rather than public health science.\"This conflict between the government's claim that it has followed the science from day one, and some in the scientific community's skepticism as to how good that evidence is, has become a key battlefield between those inside and outside the UK government.Following the scienceOne of the most controversial decisions during this crisis has been to keep private the membership of the SAGE, and not to publish minutes of its meetings, in a departure from standard operating procedure for almost all other UK advisory groups. \"I don't personally understand why,\" said Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), a panel that advises SAGE. This secrecy has led to speculation from prominent members of the public health community about the quality and breadth of evidence that is reaching the top levels of government. \"The government's decisions show no characteristics of public health input. I wouldn't be surprised if the public health voice was marginalized both within SAGE and in government,\" says Scally, of the Royal Society of Medicine.It's \"driving the public health guys mad,\" said another scientist who has contributed to the UK's National Risk Register, an overview of the potential threats facing the UK.Signs supporting the National Health Service have been displayed by an artist in east London. (Matt Dunham/AP)Another criticism of the process has been that the government has at times even sidestepped the normal groups of scientific advisers. \"Things are moving so fast that they're rather going direct to the modelers,\" said Openshaw. \"The epidemiological modelers have got a very direct line into government.\"However trivial it might seem, disagreements between public health experts and scientific modelers are a significant part of the story. \"We're seeing a struggle that has been going on for about 20 years between modelers and epidemiologists,\" a scientist who advises SAGE told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential government business.It's no secret that Dominic Cummings, Johnson's top adviser, has a personal interest in scientific modeling. So it's little surprise that public health experts were enraged when the government was forced to admit last week that Cummings had attended SAGE meetings, which are supposed to be independent advisory forums. The government said he attended in order to understand the scientific debate around the virus and its behavior.JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson grateful after release from hospitalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson grateful after release from hospital 08:37Multiple members of SAGE and groups that advise it defended their impartiality to CNN. \"The debate is robust, and everyone sets out their case clearly and articulately,\" said one member, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \"There are lots of people criticizing from the sidelines, but I think it's possible those people are angry they have been left on the sidelines.\"A source who advises SAGE said: \"Frankly, I find it hard to see that the presence of Cummings makes much difference. We're not talking about shrinking violets.\"However, the source went on to express concern at how scientific evidence is being presented. \"Science is not homogenous... The best SAGE can do is present imperfect material. The government has been able to take advantage of the public view of science as a voice of certainty, and present some of its decisions as being taken with more concrete certainty than they have.\"This has prompted fears that at some time in the future, the government might try hiding behind the science for decisions they've taken -- or worse, throw members of SAGE under a convenient bus. \"It certainly does seem to be an anxiety of some of my colleagues, but I am less worried. Many politicians are not exceptional thinkers. Should a public inquiry come, I would be surprised if it's the scientists who do a bad job of making their case,\" said a member of SAGE.What next?That public inquiry seems inevitable, once the worst of the crisis is over.And when it comes, the government will stick to its line that the decision to prioritize the protection of the NHS was the right course of action, and that it succeeded. While it's true the NHS didn't fall over during what look like the worst weeks of the crisis, a cynic might claim that focusing on hospitals ignored what was happening in the wider community.\"People might well reply that it protected the NHS at the expense of shifting deaths elsewhere. Not to mention the physical and mental suffering experienced across the country,\" said one of the scientists advising SAGE.JUST WATCHEDUK PM: Lifting lockdown early would 'risk a second major outbreak'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK PM: Lifting lockdown early would 'risk a second major outbreak' 04:53In the short term, the government is under pressure to tell the public how lockdown will end. It will not simply be a matter of easing social distancing measures.Pankhania says the government must not be too influenced by economic pressures to bring back normality. \"It is important to note that economics can be rebalanced, but lives lost cannot be bought back.\" He stresses that even if lockdown is lifted, the government must be prepared to \"shut it down again.\"Robert Dingwall, professor of social science at Nottingham Trent University and a member of NERVTAG, says: \"The biggest challenge for the government is levels of fear and anxiety in the general population, which may make people reluctant to go along with the release from lockdown.\"The UK's coronavirus story has been dramatic, even by international standards. While Johnson was off sick, legitimate questions concerning his government's handling of the pandemic were asked with few satisfactory answers from those stepping in to fill his shoes.Johnson's inner circle hope his return to work will bring about a refreshed sense of energy and urgency. But many irreversible key decisions have already been made. When, how and why will determine the next phase of this story -- and how successful Johnson's government was when facing the nation's worst crisis in decades.This article has been updated to reflect the most recent testing figures.",

        "content": "(CNN)As April was turning to May in this star-crossed year of 2020, LeBron James thought he'd be answering questions about the Los Angeles Lakers' pursuit of an NBA title.Instead with the league shut down for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic, LeBron is having to respond to reports that some executives and agents believe the NBA season should be canceled. The three-time NBA champion tweeted Thursday that the reports were \"absolutely not true\" and \"nobody should be canceling anything.\"Saw some reports about execs and agents wanting to cancel season??? That's absolutely not true. Nobody I know saying anything like that. As soon as it's safe we would like to finish our season. I'm ready and our team is ready.  Nobody should be canceling anything. \ud83d\udc51\u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) April 30, 2020\n\nThe NBA hasn't played a game since March 11th, when it was revealed just before tip-off that Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for Covid-19.Rumors have been swirling ever since about when and if the 2019-20 season would resume. But commissioner Adam Silver has maintained all along that it's too early to speculate about when the league might resume. NBA Commissioer Adam Silver speaks during a press conference prior to the NBA Japan Games 2019 between the Toronto Raptors and Houston Rockets in Saitama on October 8, 2019.Read MoreIn early April, Silver said the league wouldn't even consider a return until at least May 1st. The NBA said Monday that players will not be allowed to work out in their team facilities before May 8th, and even then, strict social distancing and safety measures would have to be in place. LeBron has spoken out on several occasions about the league's future in the last seven weeks. When it began, the NBA superstar scoffed at the idea of playing games without fans.James revised his stance several days later, saying he would do so if it was in the best interest of the league. In early April, James told reporters, \"I don't think I'll be able to have any closure if we do not have an opportunity to finish this season.\" Anthony Davis #3 of the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers talk during the game against the New Orleans Pelicans at Smoothie King Center on November 27, 2019 in New Orleans, Louisiana.LeBron's motivation to keep the season going may seem obvious. The Lakers had a 49-14 record, the best in the NBA's crowded Western conference, when the season was halted.They won 13 of their last 16 games dating back to February 1st as the partnership between LeBron and Anthony Davis, whom they acquired in the offseason, was really hitting its stride. But the Lakers revival was just one of the many storylines in one of the league's most anticipated seasons in years.L.A.'s other team, the Clippers, had new stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George at the helm. James Harden and Russell Westbrook were proving to be a dynamic duo in Houston, and Jimmy Butler had the Miami Heat rising in the East to challenge Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks, who owned the league's best record, 53-12, when the season stopped. LeBron James #23 of the Los Angeles Lakers walks off the court past fans following the NBA game against the Phoenix Suns at Talking Stick Resort Arena on November 12, 2019 in Phoenix, Arizona. If the season does resume, the safety of players and fans needs to be protected as LeBron James mentioned in his tweet and something Boston Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca says is the league's number one priority. \"LeBron is consistent with what Adam Silver is trying to do,\" Pagliuca told CNN's Erin Burnett. \"He's looking at the data every day. And they're hoping to get the season back, but the key issue with that is will it be safe for players and fans? If it can be, the season will go on. If not, Adam will be patient and wait.\"And adding hope to the prospect of seeing an NBA champion crowned this season was one of the league's most prominent owners, Dallas Mavericks boss Mark Cuban.He told CNN's Poppy Harlow Thursday he is \"cautiously optimistic we'll be able to finish the season\" but without fans in the stands.",

        "content": "London (CNN)European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has denied allegations that the EU watered down a report on coronavirus disinformation after being pressured from China.The allegations arose after Politico Europe quoted an excerpt from a draft version of the report on April 21, which explicitly accused China of running \"a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image.\" Trump administration draws up plans to punish China over coronavirus outbreakThe report appears to have been delayed, and when published on April 24, the excerpt on China had been replaced with a watered-down version.In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, who asked von der Leyen if China had pressured the EU to change the report's language, the EU chief denied the allegation and swiftly diverted her answer to the issue of lessons learned from the pandemic.\"No, this is an independent report done by the external service, and indeed what I think what we will have to do -- I was talking about lessons learned. If there's one lesson we've learned, that is we did not have robust data,\" she said.  Read MoreWhen pressed again and asked whether the EU was self-censoring, von der Leyen denied the accusation and turned to the issue of unfit medical material coming out of China as an example of the EU being unafraid to criticize Beijing. \"No, not at all, what I think is important is that we have [made] very clear, our position. And you know that there were many critical voices concerning material coming from China that was not fit for purpose. So, there are points when there are critics that have to be issued at the level of the European Union. It happens, and we do that, and there are other points that go well,\" she said.Trump contradicts US intel community by claiming he's seen evidence coronavirus originated in Chinese labAfter the report's publication, The New York Times cited EU diplomatic sources saying that China had put pressure on the bloc. The Times also published parts of a leaked email that showed how the draft report was on the verge of publication when Esther Osorio, a senior adviser to the European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, ordered it be held.When CNN reached out to Osorio for comment, a spokesperson from the EU's Foreign Affairs and Security Policy responded, saying that the emails published by the New York Times article were reported out of context. The spokesperson, Virginie Battu-Henriksson, did not respond to the question of whether Osorio personally called for the draft to be held.She denied that the report's language had been changed and said, rather, that the original document cited by Politico was not actually a draft report.\"The allegations seen in some media refer to the fact that there are two different documents.  One, the Information Environment Assessment, is a document for internal information and consumption. The other one, the EEAS special report, is for public consumption. The public reports often contain similar information to the internal documents, as it was the case with the report published on Friday and the last Information Environment Assessment,\" she said.The original excerpt explicitly accusing China of a disinformation campaign was replaced with a softened sentence: \"Official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and -- to a lesser extent -- China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation.\"Borrell faced questions from European lawmakers on Thursday over whether the document was delayed and then revised. \"Did China put pressure? Look, it's clear and evident that China expressed their concerns,\" Borrell said during the specially convened meeting of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. \"I can assure you that no changes have been introduced to the report published last week to allay the concerns of a third party, in this case China.\" Photos: The coronavirus pandemicWorkers at the Inhauma cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, carry the coffin containing the remains of 89-year-old Irodina Pinto Ribeiro on Friday, June 18, 2021.

        ],
        "content": "(CNN) For an intelligence service that is supposed to operate in the shadows, the GRU seems to attract a lot of headlines.The GRU -- formally known as Main Directorate of the General Staff -- has long been accused by the West of orchestrating brazen and high-profile attacks, including the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts during the 2016 US presidential election and the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury, England. Now the spy agency is again at the center of international attention, after reports that US intelligence concluded GRU operatives offered cash incentives to the Taliban to kill American and British troops in Afghanistan. The news has already caused a political storm in Washington, with congressional leaders demanding answers from the Trump administration. But observers also wonder why the Russian intelligence agency would run an operation that potentially conflicts with Russia's own stated goals to bring warring parties to the table in Afghanistan and avoid a precipitous collapse of the central government.From pandering to Putin to abusing allies and ignoring his own advisers, Trump's phone calls alarm US officials Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the story -- first reported by the New York Times -- was a \"hoax,\" echoing President Donald Trump's suggestion that the reported intelligence may be \"phony\" and the story false. Read More\"First of all, these assertions are a lie,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"Secondly, if the US special services still report to the president, then I suggest [you] proceed from the corresponding statements of President Trump, who has already given his assessment to these reports.\"One can be forgiven for having a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: The denials about GRU always come swiftly from the Russian government.In March 2018, then UK Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was \"highly likely\" responsible for the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury -- and that the two suspects in the attack were believed to be officers of the GRU. That July, the US Special Prosecutor's office indicted 12 GRU officers for their alleged involvement in the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts as part of a larger, Kremlin-directed effort to interfere in the 2016 US election campaign. The Kremlin repeatedly denied involvement in both cases, although Russian President Vladimir Putin called Skripal a \"traitor\" and a \"scumbag\" and suggested that the leak of the Democratic Party emails was not necessarily a bad thing.\"Some hackers published information about the unseemly conduct of Ms. [Hillary] Clinton's campaign headquarters -- supporting one candidate for the party nomination at the expense of the other,\" he said. \"Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it? What is important is the content of this information. That's my answer.\"  Now, allegations that the GRU offered bounties to Taliban fighters to kill US troops come at a sensitive time: Russia -- which considers Afghanistan a near-neighbor -- want American troops out of the country.Son of Novichok victim urges Putin to hand over suspectsIn late February, the US and the Taliban inked a peace deal that paves the way for the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and peace talks between the militant group and the government. While relations between the US and Russia are fraught, the two countries have some common ground on Afghanistan: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova, usually a staunch critic of US foreign policy, recently praised US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad for his \"proactive efforts\" to broker peace in Afghanistan. And Russia has made its own efforts to shape outcomes in Afghanistan, bringing representatives of the Taliban and some of Afghanistan's most prominent political players to Moscow.An alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition soldiers would appear to be at odds with those Russian diplomatic initiatives, says Laurel Miller, program director for Asia with International Crisis Group. Russia has cultivated contacts with both the Taliban and other warring parties in Afghanistan as a way to influence outcomes in a region it considers its strategic backyard. \"It's long been known that there were Russian contacts with the Taliban and at minimum some greasing of the relationship with benefits as a hedging technique,\" Miller said. Back in 2017, for instance, Army Gen. John Nicholson, the top US commander said publicly Russia was sending weapons to the Taliban via neighboring Tajikistan. However, she said that an operation to put bounties on US troops would be far more provocative and a \"different thing\" from its typical behavior. \"It conflicts with what Russian official policy is,\" she said. In other words, the alleged GRU operation targeting US and coalition troops could have blowback: potentially undermining US support for withdrawal, or perhaps prompting fresh sanctions on Russia.  But the agency does have a reputation for brazenness -- and can operate seemingly opportunistically or independently of official policy. Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, points out that the GRU does aggressively pursue operations that cause diplomatic fallout. Intelligence experts say the Salisbury poisoning -- which led to the investigative outlet Bellingcat unmasking the alleged GRU operatives through open-source research -- showed a pattern recklessness and overt brutality, rather than a secretive approach to spycraft, that sent a message to the GRU's enemies.\"That was a pattern we've seen many times in Ukraine,\" he said, referring to Russian intelligence activities there. \"The Kremlin is hardly a well-oiled machine, but time and again, Putin -- either by denying blatant Russian misdeeds or throwing a safety blanket over his security establishment -- does little to improve Russia's international image.\"And Putin has shown consistent willingness to give political cover to the GRU.Just a few months after the Salisbury poisonings, which prompted the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats from the West, Putin took part in a gala event to celebrate the centenary of what he called the \"legendary GRU\" and praised the patriotism of its officers, who work for an organization that no longer has \"intelligence\" in its name.\"It is unclear where the name Main Intelligence Directorate has gone,\" he said. \"We ought to restore it.\" Additional reporting by CNN's Mary Ilyushina in Moscow",

The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said Sunday that \"very low\" levels of man-made radioactivity were found over the three countries. There was no impact on the environment or human health, it said.\"The combination of radionuclides may be explained by an anomaly in the fuel elements of a nuclear power plant,\" RIVM suggested after performing a calculation to find the source of the radionuclides, which are atoms with an unstable core.\"The calculations indicate that the nuclides come from the direction of western Russia. Determining a more specific source location is not possible with the limited data available,\" RIVM said on its website. It made clear that \"no specific country of origin can be pointed out at this moment\".In response, Russia stated that no incidents were recorded at two plants in the west of the country.

They have not detected substances detected by STUK in their own emission monitoring. It is therefore unlikely that the radioactive substances detected would be of domestic origin,\" the authority said in a press release.

'Please stay at home'Over the weekend, the mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson reiterated his plea for fans not to gather and said he had been left frustrated by those ignoring warnings from the club, health experts and the authorities.  \"For me, it was hugely disappointing because the message that we gave out after Thursday's gathering outside Anfield was about the public message of health and safety about Covid-19 and the fact that this virus is still very much alive and kicking,\" he said in a video posted on Twitter. \"I say what I say in sorrow, rather than in anger, because people's lives, your lives, their lives, are put at risk.\" The club has repeatedly told supporters to not gather outside stadiums before, during or after the remaining fixtures. Liverpool faces Manchester City in the Premier League Thursday before returning to Anfield to play Aston Villa on Sunday. Klopp promised fans that they would have the chance to celebrate with the team one day, but only when it was safe to do so. \"When the time is right we will celebrate. We will enjoy this moment and we will paint the city red. But for now, please stay at home as much as possible,\" he continued.\"This is not the time to be in the city center in big numbers or to go near football grounds.\" He added: \"I already knew and liked the German word solidarit\u00e4t before I came to Liverpool and now I have learned that the English word is solidarity because I have heard it used by our supporters during the last few months. \"For me, it is the word more than any other that captures what Liverpool people are about.

        "content": "(CNN)The FA Cup semifinals feature a familiar quartet. Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal -- the last four winners of football's oldest cup competition -- advanced to the penultimate round with away victories this weekend in England. After Manchester United beat Norwich 2-1 in extra time Saturday, Arsenal downed Sheffield United 2-1, Chelsea overcame Leicester City 1-0 and defending champion Manchester City defeated Newcastle 2-0 on Sunday. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIn next month's semifinals at Wembley in London, Manchester City faces Arsenal -- Mikel Arteta was Pep Guardiola's assistant at City prior to becoming the Gunners' manager in December -- and Manchester United faces Chelsea. City crushed Arsenal 3-0 two weeks ago as the Premier League resumed behind closed doors during the coronavirus pandemic. Read MoreOn Sunday, Arsenal needed a goal in second-half injury time from on-loan midfielder Dani Ceballos to advance in Sheffield. That after the Blades leveled in the 87th minute through David McGoldrick. Dani Ceballos scored Arsenal's winner in extra time against Sheffield United. Sheffield United -- an impressive eighth in the Premier League after being promoted from the second tier -- had two goals disallowed for offside. Both times they appeared to be the correct decisions, though. Relief for ArtetaArsenal sits below Sheffield United in the top flight but won for the second straight game. It also leads with 13 FA Cup titles, one more than Manchester United. \"I am really pleased with the result. This is a difficult place to come and get a win,\" Arteta told reporters. \"After conceding so late, to show the reaction is not easy and it is very pleasing and we are back at Wembley.\"It is a great opportunity to try and win a title and play in Europe. We still have to improve in many areas but every win gives you some credit and encouragement. Hopefully we can now have some momentum.\"Chelsea currently occupies the final Champions League spot in fourth, one position behind Leicester. But Leicester is now struggling, having not won since English football's return. And top scorer Jamie Vardy has yet to find the back of the net since the restart. Chelsea manager Frank Lampard (middle) said his team didn't play well. But the Blues still beat Leicester. Chelsea benefited from the better chances, with Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel making a fine save to deny in-form US international Christian Pulisic in the first half. It wasn't the Blues' best game, but Chelsea improved after the interval and got the winner in the 63rd minute when Ross Barkley met Willian's cross for his third goal in the competition this season. Willy Caballero flapped at a cross in the Chelsea goal in the dying minutes but defender Cesar Azpilicueta bailed him out by blocking Caglar Soyuncu's header. Then Schmeichel denied Barkley with Leicester stretched to limit the damage. Lampard's honest assessment \"It was a lethargic performance from us,\" Chelsea manager Frank Lampard admitted to his club's website. \"The second half, there were glimpses of it (our good play) and I am delighted that we came through the tie. If we turn up to other games like we did today, though, then no chance. We were lucky today.\"Manchester City didn't need luck at Newcastle in the late kickoff. Like in their league clash in November, City dominated possession, especially in the first half. That ended 2-2. But Newcastle couldn't tie City on Sunday, meaning the Magpies' trophy drought of around 50 years persists. City, meanwhile, is on course for a cup treble, having won the League Cup this season and still in contention in the Champions League after holding a first-leg advantage over Real Madrid in the round of 16. This after being outdone by Liverpool in the league. \"Now in the Premier League, we struggle a little bit to focus,\" Guardiola, whose side lost to Chelsea last week to officially give Liverpool the title, told the BBC. \"But now of course, the FA Cup and Champions League, it's a little different for the fact that being at Wembley again, we were the winners last season. \"We're in the semifinals again, so that's so good and prepare of course at the end of the season for Real Madrid.\" Birthday goal for de BruyneBirthday boy Kevin de Bruyne celebrated turning 29 by opening the scoring from the penalty spot in the 37th minute after Fabian Schar pushed Gabriel Jesus, in for the injured Sergio Aguero, in the box. Kevin de Bruyne scored Manchester City's first goal Sunday on his birthday.  Newcastle opened up in the second half instead of sitting back and should have leveled. But Dwight Gayle -- who had just entered as a substitute -- shot over the bar from close range. It was one of the misses of the season.

Coming home during this difficult time of crisis, one that also hits FC Groningen.\"When the Dutch top division was abandoned in April with no title awarded or relegation due to the coronavirus, Groningen sat ninth.  A lack of football has hit teams hard. In an effort to help out, former Groningen defender Virgil van Dijk -- who just won the Premier League with Liverpool -- last month bought four season tickets and intended to raffle them off to supporters who couldn't otherwise afford them.

I've had many conversations with the club staff. \"And maybe more than anything I've listened to the call of our supporters: 'Arjen, follow your heart.'\"A comeback as an FC Groningen player...I started to play with this idea and now I've made it my mission. I want to make my comeback as a football player, a player of FC Groningen. \"At this time I'm not sure it will happen,\" added Robben, who has suffered his share of injuries. \"What I am sure of is that my drive will be at 100%. It will be a tough physical challenge but I'm going for it.

        "content": "(CNN)The killing of George Floyd in the United States and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests around the world have given reason for some awkward, long-overdue soul-searching in the European Union about the treatment of its Black and ethnic minority citizens.Earlier this month, Margaritis Schinas, a senior member of the European Commission, told the Financial Times that an incident like the killing of Floyd and the demonstrations that followed were \"not likely to happen in Europe at this scale.\" \"I do not think that we have issues now in Europe that blatantly pertain to police brutality or issues of race transcending into our systems,\" Schinas said. \"But we do have an issue in Europe, which is the issue of inequalities and income distribution \u2014 making the best for everyone of what we have.\"Pierrette Herzberger-Fofana told an EU debate on racism that police in Brussels had \"brutally\" pushed her against a wall.But a recent account from another European leader suggests otherwise. Pierette Herzberger-Fofana, a German Member of the European Parliament and who is Black, said in an EU debate on racism earlier this month that she had been the \"victim of police violence\" in an act she believed had \"underlying racist tendencies.\"She told the EU Parliament that after spotting nine officers harassing two Black youths in Brussels the evening before she spoke in Parliament, she walked over to film the incident. She said the \"police officers then approached me, wrenched my phone out of my hands and four of those armed police officers brutally pushed me against the wall,\" and that when she told the officers she was an MEP they didn't believe her. \u200bRead MoreThe alleged incident is now under investigation by the Brussels Public Prosecutor's Office, following requests from both Herzberger-Fofana and Brussels-Noord police. A spokesperson for Brussel-Noord Police said of the incident that nothing other than \"normal procedure\" was followed.During that same debate, Ursula Von der Leyen, President of the Commission, said: \"People protesting on our streets, in our countries, across the Atlantic and around the world are raising their voices -- eager to be heard. It is time we did more than listen. It is time we talked about racism -- openly and honestly.Four years after Brexit, support for the EU surges in BritainShe went on to identify a problem that has long dogged EU institutions: a stark lack of racial diversity. \"Let us look around here ... diversity is not represented, and I will be the first to admit things are not better in the College of Commissioners.\"Critics might wonder why it took so long for a senior EU figure to address this issue.According to the European Network Against Racism, the 2019 European elections resulted in just 5% of those elected to the parliament being from ethnic minority groups, despite racial and ethnic minorities making up at least 10% of the total EU population. That number is estimated to have dropped to 4% post-Brexit, as the UK had a comparatively high number of MEPs from racial and ethnic minorities.JUST WATCHEDJihadis have used this messaging app. Now so are White supremacistsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJihadis have used this messaging app. Now so are White supremacists 03:35So, why does the EU have such a blind spot on diversity? Samira Rafaela, a Dutch MEP, says that a \"lack of representation and a lack of sharing power\" at the top levels of EU politics has led to a \"systematic exclusion.\" \"I draw a direct line between that (lack of) responsibility and the poor representation of Europe's diversity in its political institution,\" she adds.Alice Bah Kunke, a Swedish MEP, agrees that a limited desire to share power leads to exclusion. \"If you have been in politics for 30 years, admitting that you need to look way beyond your normal pool and include people who have very different life experiences to you is difficult.\"But if you stick to this way of doing things, you create an increasingly-elite, exclusive group at the top of the pile.\"This view exists across the political spectrum. Syed Kamall, who pre-Brexit was co-chair of the European Reformists and Conservatives, says there is \"complacency\" in Brussels that \"by having 27 different (mostly white) countries, the EU by definition is diverse.\" But nothing could be further from the truth.Elite groups entrenched in powerWhile it has less hard power than other EU institutions, representation in the parliament is seen as especially important. \"We are the only EU institution directly elected from EU citizens and should represent them appropriately,\" says Monica Semedo, a Luxembourgian MEP. However, she goes on to point out that arguably the EU's most powerful body, the Commission, has an even worse problem.\"Looking at the College of Commissioners there is no ethnic diversity, this is also the case for their teams. Did no black people apply? What is the percentage of success for applicants from minority backgrounds? These questions should make us look carefully at the application and selection processes.\"This is where the real-world impact starts to become more acute. \"The shape an EU policy has, the moment it comes out of the EU institutions, determines the ripple effects it will have when policy comes into effect, says Rafaela. \"The less diversity there is in this phase of shaping policy, the less inclusive a policy will be.\"Kunke says that who ends up in key roles ultimately comes down to what the EU decides its priorities are -- and what sort of life experiences best meet these challenges. \"It could be your background as an economist, or it could be that you have experienced fleeing a war-torn country and lived as a refugee. For me it's obvious that both of these are competences that would be worth having in European politics right now.\"JUST WATCHEDBLM movement awakens uncomfortable conversations in the UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBLM movement awakens uncomfortable conversations in the UK 07:11Semedo adds that \"people touched by specific problems such as discrimination, exclusion, marginalisation, will need specific measures to overcome the unfairness ... It is not possible to meaningfully legislate without involving people who are directly affected.\"Even talking about this stuff has proved difficult for some. \"Having the conversation is hard, but getting someone to have the conversation at all is equally hard,\" says Rafaela. \"Regardless of my personal experience as a young MEP of color, I am struck by the evasiveness of some.\"Kamall describes a time when he pointed out to his colleagues that if they wanted a stark view at EU diversity, then \"look at the faces of the cleaners leaving the building early in the morning and contrast that with the white MEPs and officials entering.\" He says that the then-Green leader \"told me that I had missed the point and that the cleaners were women,\" and that another official emailed to congratulate him, \"but corrected me by explaining that it was not only cleaners but also security guards who increased the racial diversity of the EU institutions.\"White supremacists openly organize racist violence on Telegram, report findsIf having this conversation is hard, change is going to be harder -- and will require brave leadership. Kunke says that even those who claim to want this change \"are just afraid and not brave enough to take risks that could cause themselves to lose power.\"The risk is that if any drive to be more representative fails, then that elite group she described will become more entrenched and more exclusive. And that, as Kunke points out, has ramifications for all EU citizens: \"Do you really want people afraid to make hard decisions at the top of European politics?\"",

Iago Aspas' free kick in the 88th minute earned Celta a 2-2 draw after Suarez had twice given Barcelona the lead with assists from his pal Lionel Messi on both occasions. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe result means Barcelona moved ahead of Real Madrid by a point atop the standings but Los Blancos have played one fewer game and hold the advantage if the teams finish tied on points by virtue of having a better head-to-head record. \"We've got little margin for error now and in theory, we have to win all our games and hope our rival slips up,\" Barcelona manager Quique Setien was quoted as saying by Marca. \"We'll try to keep picking up maximum points.\"Barcelona's struggles at Vigo continued, having won only once in the league there since 2015. Read MoreVigo might have been 16th but had only conceded once in its previous seven games. While Barcelona was able to breach Celta Vigo's defense, the away side itself couldn't defend. Suarez gave Barcelona a 20th minute lead, catching Vigo off guard. Messi, taking a free kick just outside the penalty box, passed to Suarez instead of shooting on goal himself and the Uruguyan made no mistake for his first goal since returning from knee surgery. Luis Suarez scored both Barcelona goals at Celta Vigo but it would turn out to be a disappointing day for Bar\u00e7a. But early in the second half, Vigo leveled on the counter. With the Barcelona defense out of position in the 50th minute, Vigo went forward on a 2-on-1 break. Fyodor Smolov ended the move with a simple finish. Suarez's clinical finish inside the box in the 67th minute restored Barcelona's advantage before Aspas' low free kick around the wall completely caught out Barcelona keeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen. \"We shouldn't have got into that situation because we were much the better team in the first half,\" said Setien. \"We had to have gone in at the break with a more comfortable scoreline.\"Barcelona now hope that hometown rival Espanyol can do them a favor Sunday when it hosts Real Madrid. But Espanyol sits last in the standings.Bundesliga finishes Meanwhile, on the final day of the Bundesliga in Germany, Bayern Munich -- which clinched the title earlier this month -- got to hoist the league trophy for the eighth straight time. \ud83d\udcc8 82 points \u26bd 100 goals Congratulations, @FCBayernEN \ud83c\udfc6 pic.twitter.com/kTMQfaRrUd\u2014 Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) June 27, 2020 Like at Vigo, there were no fans as games were played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. There were no changes to the four Champions League places, though Borussia Dortmund suffered its worst home loss since 2009 after a 4-0 defeat to Hoffenheim. At the bottom of the standings, Werder Bremen avoided relegation, by beating FC Cologne 6-1, at the expense of Fortuna Dusseldorf, who lost 3-0 to Union Berlin. Bremen will now play in the relegation playoff while Dusseldorf will drop to Bundesliga 2 next season. In England, Manchester United became the first side to reach the FA Cup semifinals by beating Norwich 2-1 in extra time. The three other quarterfinals take place Sunday.",

Instead, the top-ranked Serb is involved in a damage limitation exercise after his exhibition tour in the Balkans, intended to be an uplifting moment during the sport's hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic, was cancelled when Djokovic, his wife Jelena, three other players, three coaches and one player's pregnant wife tested positive for the virus. Unlike other exhibition events during the pandemic, there was limited social distancing on the Adria Tour, which was played to crowded stadiums, with players hugging and high-fiving each other, playing basketball and dancing together. \"He hasn't had a good lockdown,\" British sports marketing expert Tim Crow put it bluntly in a phone interview with CNN Sport.'Extremely happy'Read MoreWhen Djokovic announced in May he would host the Adria Tour, it seemed like tennis was slowly emerging from the shutdown, which had led to the first cancellation of Wimbledon since World War II.The Adria Tour, which was scheduled to be played in four cities from June 13 through July 5, had attracted three-time grand slam finalist Dominic Thiem of Austria, world No. 7 Alexander Zverev of Germany and three-time major semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, among others. Djokovic's 24-year-old brother, Djordje, was named tournament director.Speaking at a launch press conference on May 27, Djokovic said he was \"extremely happy\" to announce the series, organized by him and his family. He stressed \"absolutely all income\" from it would be going to humanitarian organizations, before proudly announcing that all the players would be playing for free.He also said the tour would \"follow to and adhere to\" the local regulations and rules. Borna Coric, Grigor Dimitrov, Novak Djokovic  and Alexander Zverev (left to right) pose for a group shot ahead of an exhibition basketball match in Zadar, Croatia. READ: Djokovic tests positive for coronavirusBelgrade partyWhen Djokovic played his first match against fellow Serb Viktor Troicki on the afternoon of Saturday June 13 in Belgrade, some 4,000 spectators had filled the stadium close to the Danube river to capacity, with few fans wearing masks. The players, good friends, hugged after Djokovic won in straight sets.They also shook hands with the umpire, while ball kids handed them their towels. They took selfies with fans afterwards, and signed autographs.Serbia and Croatia, neither of which experienced major virus outbreaks, had recently lifted many lockdown measures. But the Serbian government was still asking people to remain one meter apart. The lack of social distancing left many stunned.\"It is as if Coronavirus has passed?\" wrote former British No. 1 Greg Rusedski on Twitter two days later. \"How was this managed and why no concern for public social distancing and face masks. I know the figures in Serbia but why are they able to do this?\"The seemingly carefree nature of the event, which came a few days after a 20,000-strong crowd attended a soccer match in Belgrade, also surprised Crow, a former chief executive of London-based sports marketing agency Synergy.\"It was a screw-up,\" he said. \"As soon as you turned the TV on, you think, 'Hang on a second, what's going on here?' And unfortunately, we all know what happened.\"Also during that weekend, players including Djokovic, Thiem, Zverev and Dimitrov were filmed dancing in a packed Belgrade nightclub.Behind closed doorsThe limited social distancing at the Adria Tour was in sharp contrast to other exhibition events during the pandemic in the US, Germany, Britain and France, which were all held behind closed doors.When Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams' long-time coach, wanted to host an event at his academy in the south of France during the lockdown, he reached out to the government. It sent him a long list of protocols, which he has implemented in his Ultimate Tennis Showdown series. \"I wanted to make sure to do it in a way where no one is at risk,\" Mouratoglou told CNN Sport in a phone interview on Friday.  These include all players being tested the day before each weekend's matches, no fans, no handshakes or ball-sharing between players, ball kids wearing gloves and masks and ample distance between every seat in the players' box.   Speaking at the ceremonial opening of the Adria Tour the day before his match against Troicki, Djokovic defended the limited social distancing of the crowd.He emphasized Serbia had \"better numbers\" compared with other countries. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, Serbia has had 13,372 confirmed cases, including 264 deaths. Neighboring Croatia had registered 2,483 cases, including 107 deaths. \"You can also criticize us and say this is maybe dangerous but it's not up to me to make calls about what is right and wrong for health,\" Djokovic added. \"We are doing what the Serbian government is telling us.\"Spectators watching matches at the Adria Tour in Zahar, Croatia on Sunday June 21, 2020. Later that day, tennis player Grigor Dimitrov said he had tested positive for Covid-19, leading to the cancellation of the entire Adria Tour.Dimitrov's bombshellThe next leg of the Adria Tour on June 20-21 once again attracted thousands of spectators, including Croatia Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, who briefly met Djokovic. Because Croatia had eased its lockdown measures before the event, players and fans didn't have to stick to social distancing rules.    Then came the bombshell announcement by Dimitrov on Sunday June 21 that he had tested positive for coronavirus. The organizers swiftly canceled the entire series, while most of the other players were tested the same night. Then, on Monday, Croatia's Borna Coric confirmed he too had tested positive, while Zverev, former US Open winner Marin Cilic of Croatia and Russia's Andrey Rublev all tested negative but promised to self-isolate for 14 days as a precaution.Spectators watch a tennis match during an exhibition tournament in Zadar, Croatia, Sunday, June 21, 2020.Troicki revealed he had tested positive soon after and then, on Tuesday, Djokovic confirmed that he, too, and his wife, Jelena, had done the same. Troicki's pregnant wife, Djokovic's fitness coach and Dimitrov's coach were also positive. Then on Friday, Djokovic's co-coach, Wimbledon winner Goran Ivanisevic, revealed he also tested positive.

Dimitrov's agent didn't immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment, but he was widely quoted as telling other media that \"Grigor landed directly in Belgrade after three months of complete isolation.

In April, he raised eyebrows for saying he was against the idea of having to be vaccinated for Covid-19 as a possible prerequisite to play on Tour again. And in May, he suggested during an Instagram Live that polluted water could be cleaned with positivity.Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"He's always been an unconventional thinker,\" said Crow. \"That's part of his makeup.\"But Crow, who has worked with some of the world's biggest companies, doesn't think the collapse of the Adria Tour has damaged Djokovic's personal brand.\"It's not ideal but I think it's just a blip,\" said Crow. \"He did it with the best intentions and he realizes he has screwed up. And everyone screws up, every once in a while.\"Djokovic's representative hadn't responded to CNN's request for comment at the time of publication.Djokovic made $33 million in the past year from corporate deals with seven sponsors, including racket manufacturer Head and French car maker Peugeot, according to Forbes. READ: Novak Djokovic's folly is a lesson to the worldIf it hadn't been for the virus, he may have been well on his way to tying or even surpassing both Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer as the most successful male player of all time. When the sport shut down in March, Djokovic had won five of the last seven majors, taking his total tally to 17. That's just two shy of Nadal and three of Federer, who is out all season with a knee injury.     But instead of chasing his sixth Wimbledon title in the coming fortnight, Djokovic will spend most of it self-isolating with his family.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A third of British people have enjoyed coronavirus lockdown, according to a massive study that tracked the emotions of more than 70,000 people in the last 14 weeks.One in three respondents told researchers at University College London (UCL) that, on balance, they had enjoyed the period of restrictions.But the survey highlighted the social inequalities that impacted people's experience during the lockdown, with those who earned more and those who did not have underlying mental health conditions more likely to enjoy it.Adults aged between 30 and 59, those who lived with others and those who have children in their household were also among the groups most likely to have a more positive experience.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveils big lockdown relaxation, signaling end to 'national hibernation'People in Scotland and Wales enjoyed the period less than those in England, and there were no notable differences across ethnic groups.Read MoreThe British government imposed an unprecedented lockdown on March 23, shutting businesses and telling people they could only leave home for a small number of essential purposes.The restrictions have since been eased in parts of the country and small outdoor group gatherings are now allowed, while further rules will be eased from July 4 in England.Respondents were also asked how much they thought they would miss lockdown. Results showed that 26% felt they would miss lockdown more than not miss it, while 61% felt they would not miss it overall, and 13% were mixed in their feelings.Meanwhile, 40% of adults reported gaining weight across lockdown, 17% reported drinking more than normal and a third said they had smoked more than usual.The findings suggest that a large number of those who do enjoy lockdown have higher household incomes and live with others. This means they may have been \"less affected by the economic and social restrictions,\" lead author Daisy Fancourt said in a statement.Major incident declared after thousands flock to UK beaches in sweltering heatMeanwhile, those who have a lower income, live in overcrowded accommodation or feel more isolated by living alone may not be enjoying lockdown or have mixed feelings about it.Public support for the lockdown was high initially, but a number of political controversies have dented approval in the government's moves. Most notably, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's refusal to sack a chief aide who breached self-isolation protocol led to anger from the British public.The UCL study has found declining rates of people saying they were complying with the lockdown, though that slump has stabilized in the past week.\"Given that low earners have been most at risk of the negative social and economic consequences of the pandemic it is unsurprising that they have been less likely to enjoy lockdown than those on higher incomes,\" said Cheryl Lloyd, education program head at the Nuffield Foundation, which was involved in the research.\"It is essential the policy response takes steps to reduce inequalities and minimise the longer-term scarring effects of the pandemic on low earners,\" she added in a statement.",

But UK authorities are concerned that such activities could be lethal during a pandemic.The British government has pleaded with the public to continue observing social distancing guidelines after thousands packed England's beaches on Thursday and thousands more celebrated Liverpool's first championship in 30 years outside the club's Anfield stadium.Officials in southern England declared a \"major incident\" Thursday after crowds flocked to beaches in Bournemouth and Sandbanks, Dorset on the hottest day of 2020 so far.Officials in southern England declared a \"major incident\" over the beach crowds.The area was overrun with cars and sunbathers, leading to gridlock and the local council handed out 558 parking enforcement fines -- a daily record.Garbage crews also suffered abuse and intimidation as they tried to remove mountains of waste from the seafront and there were a number of incidents involving excessive alcohol and fighting.Read More\"We want people to enjoy outside spaces and we want them to enjoy leisure facilities such as the beach but we also don't want to see case numbers go up again, so we are asking people to obey social distancing guidelines,\" a Downing Street spokesperson said Friday.The UK government will consider closing the beaches if there is a \"spike in infections,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned in an interview with British Talk Radio on Thursday evening.People on the beach in Southend, Essex, on June 26.\"If we see a spike in the number of cases then we will take action,\" the cabinet minister said.Hancock asked the public to \"keep following the social distancing [advice],\" which remains in place \"for a reason.\" \"The virus doesn't respect the fact that it's a hot summer's day, the virus spreads from social contact,\" he said. Visitors enjoy the summer heatwave at the beach on Thursday in Bournemouth, on England's south coast.\"That's why we've still got social distancing in place\" he added.Hancock urged English people not to throw \"away all that good work\" but added he was reluctant to close beaches as \"people have had a pretty tough lockdown.\"Britain is in the process of easing its lockdown restrictions, which have been in place since March.Groups of up to six people can now meet outside in England.

The crowd was dispersed at about 2 a.m. local time. There was another \"unlicensed music event\" at Streatham Common in South London on Thursday, which Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick described as \"quite a large gathering.\"On Wednesday, 22 officers were injured as they tried to clear an illegal street party in Brixton, south London.More than 20 police officers injured after clashes at illegal street party in LondonDick said nearly 140 officers had been injured in the last two weeks, as they responded to disturbances at street parties and during flare-ups of violence at far-right rallies and the Black Lives Matter protests in London.\"It's hot -- some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, some people are plain violent. We will be prepared this weekend, we have officers all over London working hard to keep the peace and to protect our public from violence and disorder,\" Dick said on Friday.\"These events are unlawful, there shouldn't be happening,\" Dick said of the parties. \"We have a duty to close them down and disperse them. The local communities hate them, incredibly antisocial behavior, very noisy, during a pandemic, sometimes violence, and for our officers who are simply doing their duty, to be attacked in that manner is utterly unacceptable.\"Police patrol near Bournemouth beach on June 26.The police commissioner said that she was on the streets of London on Thursday night, when the police got a call saying there was a man with a machete at one of the illegal gatherings. \"I think you can see immediately that a beach is a completely different scenario from a street in London, where you have hundreds of residents ringing up, terrified by what they are seeing and saying please come police and break this up now because we know there's going to be violence,\" Dick said.England's beaches and unlicensed parties weren't the only reason for Thursday's crowds.Anfield crowds cause concernThousands of Liverpool fans gathered outside the club's Anfield stadium, after Chelsea's 2-1 win over Manchester City on Thursday handed the Merseyside club its first league title since 1990.Supporters set off flares and fireworks, singing all the while, resulting in Merseyside Police closing off roads around the stadium at approximately 11 p.m. UK time, and advising motorists to \"avoid the area.\"And although Assistant Chief Constable Rob Carden thanked the \"overwhelming majority of fans\" for recognizing that \"now is not the time to gather together to celebrate,\" he urged fans to avoid congregating and celebrate in their \"social bubble.\"Liverpool fans celebrate at Anfield Stadium after wining the Premier League title.\"Unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the lockdown period, not everyone adhered to the regulations in place.

Notably from Lewis Hamilton, a six-time world champion and the first and only Black driver to compete in F1, who has been a powerful voice following Floyd's death in Minneapolis last month. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresHamilton has joined protests, set up The Hamilton Commission to increase diversity in motorsport and called out F1's \"biggest stars\" for \"staying silent ... in the midst of injustice.\"For his part, Ecclestone, who was replaced as chief executive of Formula One in 2017 after nearly four decades in charge, praised how Hamilton has spoken out for equality.

I think that's the same for everybody. People ought to think a little bit and think: 'Well, what the hell. Somebody's not the same as White people and Black people should think the same about White people.' \"In lots of cases, Black people are more racist than what White people are.\"CNN challenged Ecclestone over the assertion and he was unable to provide any concrete evidence for the baseless claim beyond saying that he had \"noticed\" it over the years.The 89-year-old continued by saying that changing attitudes towards race won't come \"easily,\" scorning the dismantling of statues of slave trade figures -- a move Hamilton backed when the statue of Edward Colston was torn down in the English city of Bristol. \"I think they need to start being taught at school,\" said Ecclestone. \"So they grow up not having to think about these things. I think it's completely stupid taking all these statues down. They should've left them there. Take the kids from school to look and say why they're there and what the people did and how wrong it was what they did.\"Later on Friday, F1 issued a statement on its website saying it \"completely disagreed with Bernie Ecclestone's comments that have no place in Formula 1 or society.\"Mr Ecclestone has played no role in Formula 1 since he left our organisation in 2017, his title Chairman Emeritus, being honorific, expired in January 2020.\"Bernie Ecclestone was in charge of F1 for nearly 40 years.

The season preceding Liberty Media's $8 billion takeover in 2017 drew 400 million unique TV viewers across 200 territories. The 2016 championship saw 21 races in 21 countries and five continents. In April, billionaire Ecclestone and wife Fabiana Flosi, 44, announced they were expecting a baby. Ecclestone's fourth child will be born this summer and when the announcement was made, he said he saw no difference \"between being 89 and 29.\"The Briton is no stranger to controversy. In 2009 he praised Adolf Hitler for being \"able to get things done\" -- comments he later apologized for -- while he has also backed Vladimir Putin's controversial policy towards homosexuals and said that women should dress in white \"like all other domestic appliances.\" READ: Lewis Hamilton attends Black Lives Matter protest, organizes commission to increase diversity in motorsport'Nobody's done anything'Reigning world champion Hamilton recently referred to F1 as a \"white dominated sport,\" while the governing body has just launched the #WeRaceAsOne initiative which seeks to fight the challenges of Covid-19 and condemn racism and inequality.

        "content": "London (CNN)A London judge has handed down a sentence of at least 15 years in prison to a teenager who threw a young French boy from a viewing platform at the Tate Modern art gallery last summer, telling him \"you may never be released.\"The boy, a tourist who was 6 at the time, was hospitalized with \"catastrophic injuries\" following the incident on August 4, which took place on the 10th floor of the museum.Jonty Bravery, of West London, admitted one count of attempted murder at London's Old Bailey court in December, saying he threw the child from a balcony of the Thames-side tourist attraction in August with the intention of killing him so he could be on the news. The boy survived but suffered life-changing injuries as a result of falling five floors from a 10th-floor viewing platform, including a bleed to his brain and a number of fractured bones. In a statement read out on Friday, the boy's parents said he is still in a wheelchair, with \"many years of physical therapy ahead of him.\"Addressing 18-year-old Bravery on Friday, the judgment from Justice Maura McGowan read : \"I cannot emphasise too clearly that this is not a 15-year sentence. The sentence is detention for life. The minimum term is 15 years. Your release cannot be considered before then, you may never be released.\"Read MoreEmergency crews attended the scene at the Tate Modern art gallery following the incident on August 4, 2019.\"You had intended to kill someone that day,\" the judgment added. \"The injuries you caused are horrific. That little boy has suffered permanent and life-changing injuries.\"In the judgment, McGowan noted that a clinician said Bravery had an autism spectrum disorder and a personality disorder, which were \"overlapping,\" but, she said: \"Those conditions alone do not explain your offending and your general behavior.She noted that Bravery searched the internet on the day and day before the attack \"for information about killing people and what effect autism would have on sentencing.\" \"You had also carried out similar searches over many months before. You investigated different methods of murder,\" McGowan said.Bravery, aged 17 at the time, was caught and held by museum patrons who witnessed the incident until police arrived.\"The act committed by this individual against our son is unspeakable. Words cannot express the horror, and the fear that his actions have brought upon us and our son, who is now wondering why he's in hospital. How can one explain to a child that someone deliberately tried to kill him?\" the boy's parents said in a statement read out by Melanie Pressley, Detective Inspector with the Serious Crime Command of Metropolitan Police, outside the Old Bailey.In an initial hearing in August last year, a court heard that the child was visiting the modern art museum with his family on August 4 when he was approached by a stranger, who picked him up and threw him off the viewing platform.At the hearing it emerged that the child's life was probably saved by the slant of the fifth-floor roof on which he landed.

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool has had to wait longer than anyone could have predicted, but the club can once again call itself the best in England. There have been years in the wilderness, a few near-misses and, just when Jurgen Klopp and his men were six points from securing the club's first league title in 30 years, a global pandemic brought this season's procession to a halt. Changing doubters to believers. How Jurgen Klopp turned Liverpool into title winnersBut the return of football in England earlier this month after a 100-day absence revived a title bid which was only put in doubt when the season was put on pause. After Liverpool's impressive 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Wednesday, Manchester City needed to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday to delay the coronation. But the defending champion's failure to claim three points -- City was beaten 2-1 in London -- ended the wait. Pep Guardiola's team must now pass on the crown. Liverpool, a team which had previously won 18 league titles but none since 1990, has now won the English Premier League for the first time, taking it to within one title of equaling Manchester United's record of 20 first division titles. Read MoreSpeaking to Sky Sports, Klopp described winning the title as \"absolutely incredible.\" \"I have no words. It's unbelievable. Much more than I ever thought would be possible,\" he said. \"Becoming champions with this club is absolutely incredible. It is an incredible achievement of my players ... and a pure joy for me to coach them.\"Fans celebrate outside Anfield.Though lockdown restrictions are easing in England, Liverpool fans will not be able to celebrate as they had envisioned a few months ago. Who knows when it will be safe to hold a parade through the city?A number of supporters gathered outside Anfield to rejoice in their team's historic achievement, while the squad itself were together to enjoy the moment the final whistle blew in Stanford Bridge. But the more subdued celebrations do not mask the enormity of the feat. What Klopp and his team have achieved is remarkable. Defeated just once, Liverpool has been the dominant team of the season. The Merseysiders lead second-place City by 23 points and, by the end of the campaign, could amass a record points total of 107. No team has won the title with seven games to spare.Liverpool fans celebrate their team winning the Premier League title outside Anfield. When Klopp joined the club in October 2015, Liverpool was 10th in the table, struggling to score goals and had collected 12 points from eight games. There were wealthier teams, better teams, in the EPL. Thoughts of winning another league title seemed fanciful. \"We have to change from doubters to believers,\" said Klopp in his first interview as Liverpool boss. It was a statement which raised eyebrows, but one which also energized the club's enormous fanbase. Few could have imagined, however, the progress the club would make under the charismatic German. Fans outside Anfield, celebrating Liverpool's historic win. There have been expensive signings; record fees for a goalkeeper and a defender, but even before those purchases were made, Klopp's tactics had resulted in progress. Now, no team in the country plays with such intensity and energy. It has the best defense in the league, a hypnotic forward triumvirate and a tireless midfield.In every season but his first, the manager has steered his team into the Champions League, reaching the final twice, and every player under his tutelage has improved, from academy graduates such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, to more surprising signings like Mo Salah and Andy Robertson. There have been few flops. And, finally, after three failures in cup finals, Liverpool won its first silverware under Klopp last season, when the team beat Tottenham in the Champions League final. It was a victory which strengthened the fans' faith in the team, easing concerns that this was a squad of nearly-men, as Liverpool had also that season narrowly missed out on the title by a point, despite accumulating a club record total of 97. Since that summer night in Madrid, the team has gone on to win the Club World Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and now the most coveted trophy of all. That Liverpool would bounce back from last season's agony to win the title the following season in such ruthless fashion is testimony to the team Klopp has built. But, as the man himself once said, the players he has assembled are \"mentality monsters.\" Klopp has earned the right to be regarded among the finest managers in this storied club's history. It is not without reason that many liken him to Bill Shankly, the former manager who rebuilt the club in the 1960s and laid the foundations for what became a footballing dynasty in the following two decades.\"He's been fantastic and epitomizes everything the club stands for,\" Kenny Dalglish, the last manager to guide Liverpool to the title, told BT Sport after a Christian Pulisic strike and a Willian penalty had secured victory for Chelsea. \"It's not just a one-off because last year they came within a point. Onwards and upwards and, I think, we've a lot more happy days to look forward to as long as Jurgen is there.\"Liverpool is a club which has enjoyed much success, but nothing in its glorious past quite compares to the exceptional season this outstanding team has produced.",

        "content": "London (CNN)A wombat-like creature, the size of a black bear and weighing 330 pounds, roamed the earth some 25 million years ago, scientists have discovered. A team led by researchers from the University of Salford in the UK discovered the new family of marsupial after studying the partial skull and most of a skeleton that had been collected from Lake Pinpa, in northeastern South Australia, on an expedition during the 1970s. 'Crazy beast' fossil discovery shows the evolutionary weirdness of early mammalsResearchers named the animal \"Mukupirna,\" meaning \"big bones\" in Dieri and Malyangapa, the indigenous languages spoken in the region of South Australia where the fossil was first discovered. In a paper published in Scientific Reports on Thursday, researchers confirmed that the mammal belonged to a new family of marsupials -- mammals characterized by premature birth and the continued development of the newborn while latched to the nipples on the mother's lower belly.From studying the creature's fossilized teeth, bones and cranium, experts concluded that the animal, which would have weighed up to 330 pounds, would have engaged in \"scratch-digging\" but was unlikely to have burrowed. Read MoreModern-day wombats are much smaller. \"It is surprisingly large, particularity for that time period,\" lead author Robin Beck, from the University of Salford, told CNN. \"It was one of the largest animals in Australia at that time.\"Beck said that while the creatures most closely resemble wombats, they were about five times the size. Scientists studied how body size has evolved in vombatiforms -- the group that includes Mukupirna, wombats, koalas and their fossil relatives -- and found that body weights of 220 pounds or more evolved at least six times over the past 25 million years. The largest known vombatifom, named \"Diprotodon,\" weighed more than 2 tonnes and survived until approximately 50,000 years ago.This tiny lion with teeth like bolt-cutters once roamed AustraliaSpeaking about Mukupirna, Beck said: \"This fossil didn't have teeth that grew throughout its life, so it probably wasn't feeding on grass,\"  adding that researchers aren't certain when the animal became extinct. \"About 23 million years ago, the environment changed to become more like a rainforest in Australia, and so there were environmental changes that possibly may have driven it extinct,\" he suggested.\"Mukupirna reveals a fascinating mix of characteristics and provides evidence of a close link between wombats and an extinct group of marsupials called wynyardiids,\" report co-author Pip Brewer, of London's Natural History Museum, added in a statement. \"It suggests that adaptations for digging for food may have existed in the very earliest members of the wombat family and likely led to their eventual survival to the present day. Although suggested previously, it had not been possible to test this, as the oldest fossil wombats discovered are only known from teeth and a few skull fragments,\" Brewer said.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russia on Thursday kicked off early voting in a national referendum on controversial amendments to the country's constitution that could allow President Vladimir Putin stay in power until 2036, amid reports that the process had been marred by election tampering and compulsory voting.  The vote, originally scheduled for April 22, was delayed amid coronavirus concerns. Election officials said early voting would be held to aid social distancing: Russia is still reporting around 7,000 new cases each day, according to official statistics. The voting culminates on July 1, the officially designated day for the plebiscite, which has been declared a national holiday.The constitutional changes, unveiled early this year, will formally seal Putin's long-term hold on the presidency. Putin has been in power for two decades, and under current law, must step down after his term expires in 2024. The amended constitution would effectively re-set the count on his term limits.The referendum on proposed amendments to the Russian constitution began on Thursday.In an interview aired this weekend on state television, Putin hinted strongly he would run again and made clear his view about opening up the presidency to greater political competition.\"We need to get on with work, not look for successors,\" he said.Read MoreUS fighter jets again intercept Russian military aircraft near AlaskaThe proposed amendments sailed through the country's constitutional court and both houses of parliament with little objection. Ella Pamfilova, the head of the country's Central Election Commission, said the changes do not require a referendum to be considered legitimate, but added that Putin insisted that the changes be put to a nationwide vote. The decision to hold the vote was approved by the country's health officials but met with harsh criticism from election committee workers, who signed an open letter titled, \"We are not disposable material,\" in the hope of raising the alarm over the deathly risk that large-scale voting could pose to both voters and organizers.The Central Election Commission said stations will be regularly disinfected and one location would only process up to eight people per hour.Some polling centers appear to have to been creative about social distancing, according to widespread reports on social media. On Thursday, dozens of posts appeared on Russian social media showing voting booths set up in car trunks, makeshift tents or on regular street benches.  Russian independent media outlets have also reported multiple violations at polling stations within the first hours of voting. Pavel Lobkov, a television host with Russia's independent channel TV Rain, posted a video showing how he managed to vote twice -- first with a regular paper ballot and then electronically.The Central Elections Committee said that Lobkov committed an administrative offense by voting twice and deemed his report \"a provocation,\" but added that the commissioners overseeing that voting station will be reprimanded.A man casts his vote at a ballot box in the village of Lugovoye.Golos, an independent non-governmental organization that tracks elections in Russia, has listed more than 700 reports on alleged violations and forced voting in the run-up to the vote, posting screenshots from bosses, school principals and local bureaucrats threatening to fire or reprimand those who refuse to register for voting. Forcing people to vote is illegal under Russian law but is nevertheless a common occurrence, widely reported on in previous elections. Co-chairman of Golos, Grigory Melkonyants, said in an interview with The Moscow Times that his organization \"never had this many complaints from people telling us they are being pressured to vote.\"Aside from resetting the clock on Putin's presidential term count, the set of amendments includes other controversial items such as defining marriage as \"a union of a man and a woman\" and enshrining God in the country's main law, both seen as tools to push Russian towards a more conservative path. Russia kicks off lavish Victory Day parade following coronavirus delayThe proposed change on marriage falls in line with Russia's previous discriminatory policies towards the LGBTQ community, which includes the so-called \"gay propaganda\" law that virtually bans any public discussion of LGBTQ issues.On Thursday, the same day early voting began, the US Embassy in Moscow displayed the Pride Flag, a move that drew criticism from the Kremlin.\"Today, the U.S. Embassy in Russia displays the LGBTI Pride Flag,\" the embassy said in a statement. \"The LGBTI flag was created by American artist and activist Gilbert Baker and was first raised as a symbol of hope and diversity on June 25, 1978, during the Gay Freedom Day parade in San Francisco. June is Pride Month and we celebrate that everyone deserves to live a life free from hatred, prejudice, and persecution.\"The statement quoted US Ambassador John Sullivan as saying, \"LGBTI rights are human rights. And human rights are universal. It's as simple as that.\"Asked in a conference call with reporters to respond to the flag, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \"We cannot see the building of the American embassy from the Kremlin, that's the first thing. But our Ministry of Foreign Affairs can definitely see it, I think the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has paid attention to this. In any case, any manifestations of propaganda of non-traditional sexual minorities and so on in our country are not acceptable by law.\"The US Embassy in Moscow referred CNN to the statement posted online in response to a request for comment.

        "content": "Brussels, Belgium (CNN)Noah, a slight teenager wearing jeans and sneakers, is dwarfed by the bronze statue of Belgium's King Leopold II astride a horse. The statue, set high on a concrete plinth, has stood opposite the Royal Palace in Brussels since 1926.That could change soon. Armed only with history and an online petition, 14-year-old Noah is determined to bring Belgium's controversial \"Builder King\" crashing down.Noah's parents are from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the late 19th century, the country -- then personally owned by Leopold II -- was a place of extraordinary cruelty, where hundreds of thousands of Africans died in slavery. \"I feel belittled, because it is people of my origin and community who were killed,\" explained Noah, the statue of Leopold II towering above him. \"For me when you put a statue of Hitler in Berlin, for me, that is like putting up a statue of Leopold in Brussels.\"As statues linked to slavery and racism began to tumble in the US and Europe, Noah set up an online petition to have Brussels' memorials to Leopold torn down. He called it \"Reparons l'histoire\" (Let's repair history); it has 80,000 signatures and counting. An American policeman killed George Floyd. Now Europe is re-examining its colonial historyRead MoreCNN agreed to Noah's request not to use his last name due to the current tense political climate. Noah says not enough Belgians understand the history of what was ironically called the Congo Free State.\"I hope young people of my age and younger start to take responsibility and talk and make their voices heard,\" he says confidently. Those in authority may now be listening. Last week, Belgium's parliament approved a national inquiry into Belgian colonialism.Els Van Hoof, a Belgian MP who leads the chamber of representative's foreign affairs committee, says the inquiry may tackle the question of what to do with statues of Leopold II, though the exact scope of work has yet to be determined.It will be the first time that Belgium has embarked on such a broad effort to confront its colonial sins. When Leopold took the throne, he was desperate for Belgium to become a colonial power. The Belgian parliament, however, did not share the same goal. So instead, Leopold convinced European powers and the United States to recognize a massive swath of Africa as his own privately-owned colony. It only became a Belgian colony after he was forced to relinquish control. Leopold sent in a private army to force local people to collect ivory and rubber. Those who resisted, or were unable to meet the impossible work quotas imposed on them, faced mutilation, amputation or execution.Amputation was frequently used to punish workers nad their families in the Congo Free State, controlled by King Leopold II of Belgium.Historians estimate that at least half a million people died under Leopold's misrule, but its horrors have received little attention in modern Belgium. Belgium's 'human zoo'Just outside Brussels, in the small, affluent suburb of Tervuren, a burial site is tucked inside the courtyard of the church of St John the Evangelist, just a few steps away from a square lined with quaint cafes and shaded outdoor patios. People shuffle past, rarely stopping to visit, unaware of the history beneath their feet. The seven graves, set beneath an arched stained-glass window, are inscribed only with first names: Kitoukwa, Sambo and M'Peia, among others. The people buried here were brought to Belgium in the final years of the 19th century, to be put on display, only to succumb to pneumonia when the weather turned cold.The graves of seven Congolese people brought to Belgium to be put on display in an \"African village\" in Brussels, which has been described as a \"human zoo.\"\"It was basically like a human zoo,\" explained Guido Gryseels, director of the Royal Museum for Central Africa -- an ornate, palatial building, set in an expansive manicured garden.The \"zoo\" featured more than 250 Congolese people, who were kept in four \"authentic\" African villages.\"They had to do rowing races on the lake and the women had to cook and make all sorts of things like African objects. And basically, Belgians came and looked. It was pure racism,\" said Gryseels. Over the course of a decade, some 60 Congolese children were also brought to Belgium without their parents, to attend school and to be exhibited to the public, according to a historical marker in park near the museum. Twelve of those children died. The profits Leopold made off the backs of slavery in Congo funded a series of grand monuments to cement his legacy, from Brussels' imposing Cinquantenaire Arch, to boulevards like the one that links the capital with Tervuren, to the countless statues erected in his honor, both during his 44-year reign and after his death in 1909. Spoils of colonialism Now, those visual markers are front and center in a national debate about Leopold's legacy, echoing similar soul-searching in Britain and the United States over statues memorializing men involved in the slave trade.Protestors have already set fire to one statue of Leopold II, in Antwerp. Others, In Ghent and Ostend, have been damaged or defaced.A statue of King Leopold II in Brussels was vandalized in protest at his misdeeds in what was once known as the Congo Free State.In the Brussels suburb of Auderghem, protesters took a sledgehammer to a bust of Leopold II, leaving it face down in the dirt and covered in red paint. Auderghem's mayor, Didier Gosuin, a former history teacher, told CNN he is committed to returning the statue to its empty plinth -- with the addition of a plaque detailing the positive and negative impacts of Leopold II's rule. He worries that vandalizing statues will only serve to stoke polarization.\"There are two clans forming now: Those who want to remove the colonial past and another who are attached to their history or who remain convinced that Belgian colonialism was positive,\" Gosuin said, adding: \"We should profit from this moment, to give another vision of history.\"Partygoers wore blackface and colonial garb to an event -- at Belgium's controversial Africa MuseumA competing petition created in response to Noah's calls for Brussels to keep it's statues to Leopold II in place arguing, \"He is not a slave king, he only delegated powers to certain people to manage the colony.\"Belgium's Prince Laurent made similar comments in a recent interview. More than 20,000 people have signed the petition.The contentious Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren is trying to settle those competing interpretations of history by presenting the unvarnished truth, according to its director, Gryseels.The museum was originally built at Leopold's direction to glorify Belgium's role in Africa; it proudly displayed the spoils of colonialism and presented white people in a superior light to Africans. A bust of Leopold, carved from ivory, is still among its exhibits. After a five-year facelift, the museum reopened 18 months ago -- amid controversy. Its displays have been redesigned to better reflect Belgium's troubled past in Africa -- in Congo, Rwanda and Burundi -- and it now includes contemporary works from African artists, in response to its colonial collection.It may need to alter its exhibits again to reflect the current debate -- Gryseels told CNN he has fielded calls from several Belgian cities looking to donate statues of Leopold and other colonial figures they no longer wish to display.Guido Gryseels, director of the Royal Museum for Central Africa, says Belgium is suffering from a history deficit, because the country's colonial past is not taught in schools.\"We haven't really decided yet whether we want to become a memorial or shrine to Leopold II or whether we can convert [the statues] into some sort of work of contemporary art,\" he said. \"We're thinking of making a special showcase with King Leopold II busts and then give a contrasting message at the same time.\"Even that may be a risky endeavor.Statue daubed with paintA prominent outdoor statue on the grounds of the museum perfectly reflects Belgium and the museum's uncertain feelings toward Leopold II and its colonial past. The sculpture, unveiled as recently as 1997, includes African figures missing their feet.Its creator, Tom Frantzen, has said it was never intended as an homage to the king, but that he had to be subtle in his criticism of Leopold, because he had been commissioned to create a tribute to him. Frantzen's partner, Martine Bode, told CNN in an email that he \"had to move heaven and earth to get permission to depict the black warriors with lopped off feet.\" A statue in the grounds of Belgium's Royal Museum for Central Africa, featuring a bust of KIng Leopold II, has been covered in red paint and topped with a traffic cone \"dunce's cap.\"But Gryseels doesn't buy that. The Museum's website said \"it was clear\" the statue was placed to honor Leopold II and that at the time of its creation Frantzen \"hardly\" mentioned the atrocities committed in Congo. Frantzen has proposed changes to make the artwork's meaning more clear. In the meantime, the sculpture has been doused in red paint, and given a dunce's cap for good measure. Gryseels laments what he says is a history deficit in Belgium -- there is no nationwide requirement for Belgian students to learn about colonial history in school. Belgium says sorry for forced removal of mixed-race children during colonial era\"The most important thing for me is that Belgium reintroduces this colonial history in the curriculum of the schools,\" he said. \"Until children are taught about colonialism, they are not going to know.\"Belgium's first black mayor, Pierre Kompany, also believes a better understanding of history will change people's minds. Kompany, who was born in Belgian Congo, arrived in Belgium as a refugee in the 1970s.Sitting in a cafe in Ganshoren, the Brussels suburb where he has served as mayor for the past two years, Kompany, 72, speaks with the intensity of someone who has spent a lifetime in politics -- the conversation interrupted only by his instinctive need to wave, or say hello to nearly every passing constituent. \"If your grandfather was present in places where hands were being cut off, you're not going to start shouting 'My grandfather did that.' You're not going to shout that around, you will stay silent,\" he said.Honoring the unforgivable Noah is keen to stress that the story of Belgium's \"human zoo\" is anything but ancient history, pointing out that the mock-African village was revived for the World Expo in Brussels in 1958. \"That wasn't that long ago,\" he said. \"There were people who were born then who are alive now. It was inhumane.\"\"It was so brutally racist that people were throwing bananas, they were throwing food to them,\" explained Gryseels. \"A number of them quit and refused to work there anymore and went back to Congo.\" The exhibition was shut down after that.Far from ancient historyLast year, a group of UN human rights experts visited several cities in Belgium and found \"clear evidence that racial discrimination is endemic in institutions in Belgium .\" Noah says he too has faced racist taunts and abuse.\"People have told me: 'Go home, it's not your country, you are black, you are not like us.' I am Belgian. I was born here,\" he said. \"They want to make me feel like it isn't my country and it isn't my place here.\" In response to Noah's petition, a spokesperson for Brussels Mayor Philippe Close told CNN he doesn't have the authority to remove statues of Leopold II, which are national monuments. He does, though, support a national conversation on their fate. Britain's imperialist monuments face a bitter reckoning amid Black Lives Matter protests The approaching \"truth and reconciliation\" commission is a historical reckoning that Belgium has put off for generations. perhaps because many Belgians have done humanitarian work in Congo, and African migration to Belgium has only arrived in recent decades, says Van Hoof, the Belgian MP.\"It is not just one story, there is some nuance,\" she said. \"We don't have to cover up the bad things or the good things, and that's what has happened I think.\"Noah, whose petition demands that the statues be removed by June 30 -- the 60th anniversary of Congo's independence -- says his protest will go on, well beyond that date.\"If we remove statues, we are not removing history,\" he said. \"Normally we get history from school, books and from family. It is not statutes that should educate.\"The Leopold II statue opposite the Royal Palace was covered in anti-racist graffiti earlier this month. Local authorities cleaned it, only for another slogan to appear shortly afterwards: \"Stop Cleaning, Start Reflecting.\"Martin Bourke, Oscar Featherstone and Tim Lister contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Kosovan President Hashim Thaci has been indicted for war crimes allegedly committed during the Kosovo conflict in the late 1990s, leading him to cancel a planned trip to the White House this weekend for talks with Serbian leaders.The charges against Thaci were announced Wednesday by a special court at The Hague, in the Netherlands. According to a press statement, the Specialist Prosecutor's Office filed a 10-count indictment on April 24 that accuses Thaci, Kadri Veseli, the former Chairman of the Assembly of Kosovo, and others of \"a range of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, enforced disappearance of persons, persecution, and torture.\" It added that a pre-trial judge was reviewing the indictment \"to decide on whether to confirm the charges.\"Kosovo declared independence from Serbia a decade after the bloody conflict between Serb forces and Kosovar-Albanian rebels began. The war, from 1998 to 1999, led to thousands of deaths and the displacement of nearly 90% of Kosovo's population.Read MoreThaci came to prominence as a leading figure in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) between 1997 and 1999 and played a part in peace negotiations.His transition from a revolutionary into a politician eventually led to him to becoming Prime Minister when independence was declared. He was elected President in February 2016.Wednesday's indictment alleges that Thaci, Veseli and other charged suspects \"are criminally responsible for nearly 100 murders. The crimes alleged in the Indictment involve hundreds of known victims of Kosovo Albanian, Serb, Roma, and other ethnicities and include political opponents,\" the statement said.CNN has reached out to the offices of Thaci and of Veseli, who is president of the Kosovo Democratic Party, for comment.Kosovo's Ambassador to the US Vlora \u00c7itaku said in a tweet that \"When the dust settles & the smoke clears, #KLA will remain the most successful liberation movement in modern history.\"The Kosovo Specialist Chambers (KSC) and Specialist Prosecutor's Office (SPO) was set up to have jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Kosovo conflict between January 1998 and December 2000.Kosovo lawmakers approve army, as tensions with Serbia riseThaci was due to visit the White House for talks with Serbian representatives but canceled his trip following the SPO announcement, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Serbia and Kosovo Peace Negotiations, Richard Grenell, tweeted Wednesday.The United States is among more than 100 countries to recognize Kosovo as an independent, sovereign state, according to the US State Department. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo's independence.\"I respect his decision not to attend the discussions until the legal issues of those allegations are settled,\" Grenell said. Saturday's discussions would be led by Kosovar Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, the US envoy added.However, Hoti -- who took office only three weeks ago -- said Thursday that he could not travel to Washington in light of developments in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.\"Only through dialogue we can solve our disputes with Serbia, resulting on mutual recognition and normalization of relations. My Government does not comment issues related to the Special Chambers. Kosovo will fully respect its international obligations,\" he tweeted.The Kosovo government said in a statement that it \"considers that no one should be considered guilty without a final decision by the Court\" and urged all citizens to remain calm.\"The Government believes that the war of the people of Kosovo and Kosovo Liberation Army was just and for its freedom and should therefore remain as the most important period of the country's history,\" the statement said. Thaci's official website confirmed that his trip to Washington had been canceled because of the indictment but made no comment with regards to the allegations against him. The SPO statement points out that the indictment is only an accusation -- but adds that it is \"the result of a lengthy investigation and reflects the SPO's determination that it can prove all of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\"The SPO also states that it has gone public with the indictment because Thaci and Veseli have allegedly repeatedly attempted to \"obstruct and undermine\" the court's work. The two are \"believed to have carried out a secret campaign to overturn the law creating the Court and otherwise obstruct the work of the Court in an attempt to ensure that they do not face justice. By taking these actions, (Thaci and Veseli) have put their personal interests ahead of the victims of their crimes, the rule of law, and all people of Kosovo,\" the statement said.CNN's Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"Women's football depends on you to survive.\"With tears in her eyes, Marta, arguably the greatest ever women's soccer player, pleaded with not only her country, but the entire world after Brazil's round of 16 loss to France in the 2019 Women's World Cup. \"There's not going to be a Formiga forever, there's not going to be a Marta forever, there's not going to be a Cristiane,\" she added, naming a number of Brazil's more experienced players who are coming to the end of their careers.Marta, the six-time FIFA World Player of the Year, and the most prolific scorer in World Cup finals history -- men's or women's with 17 goals -- has never lifted the World Cup trophy or had a gold medal draped around her neck at the Olympics.When the final whistle blew on their 2-1 loss in extra-time to hosts France, eliminating them from the World Cup, Brazil's players fell to the pitch crying. Marta took note.Read MoreKathellen of Brazil looks dejected following the France defeat.Speaking to CNN Sport  through a translator Marta said, \"I did not plan the speech. I saw my teammates crying. There was a lot of big emotions. I felt the need to share a message that would show them and to show the young athletes the path to follow.\" Looking straight down the camera, Marta continued her speech from the pitch of Stade Oc\u00e9ane. \"We're asking for support; you have to cry at the beginning so you can smile at the end.\"Reflecting on her speech, Marta told CNN Sport: \"Every time that I can, I try to make a difference. I want to show everyone, boys and girls, it doesn't matter the gender, that it is possible. And I do this with love. I have to be a leader on and off the field. My life is moved by this. I take this responsibility with a good heart and dedication. It is a great responsibility to have.\"Amanda Kestelman, a journalist with Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte, has seen the challenges the team faced not just in France, but through generations.\"I think everyone in Brazil got really emotional. We don't use the huge talent of Marta to make the women's game as big in Brazil as much as it should be. I used to call them the force of nature, because they made a lot with not so many resources,\" Kestelman told CNN  Sport. \"They got far with little, but they can't stay forever. We need to look for the future.\"Marta is a six-time FIFA World Player of the Year.Kestleman added: \"The Marta speech was the one everyone saw because it was broadcasting all over the world but talking with those women after the game, they had the same feeling. They were talking to us saying, 'please clubs, federation, don't forget us. Don't remember us just in the Olympics, in the World Cup.\" Financial DisparityMarta, who plays for the Orlando Pride in the NWSL in the United States, knows the women's game in Brazil needs help at a bigger, more national level.\"Men's soccer is still the religion in Brazil. You are born wearing a men's team jersey. When you're born, your father picks this team for you. But now people are starting to support the women's soccer. And, of course, there's also the financial difference.\"The financial difference is no small matter. Brazil lacks a substantial national women's league, instead relying on a tournament style competition, and most women's clubs are supported through their larger, more profitable men's sides. Now with the spread of Covid-19 ravaging the country, the future of the women's game is much more in doubt.\"This pandemic is bringing us a couple of uncertainties, especially financially, especially for the clubs without a men's team to support them, because we're not sure about what the future holds,\" said Marta.13-0: The scoreline that shook the 2019 Women's World CupKestelman agrees that it's becoming a serious financial issue considering Brazilian clubs haven't played a game, men's or women's, since early March due to the pandemic, and there is no end in sight.Despite the concerns, Marta added: \"I do believe that each year the exposure of women's soccer in Brazil has been improving.\"Improvements take time, and money. According to Kestelman the disparity in funding from the Brazilian Football Confederation, or CBF, between the men's and women's teams is huge.A recent report by Globo Esporte found the CBF gave out a line of credit of 3.7 million Brazilian reais (roughly 702,400 US Dollars) to support women's clubs across two divisions during the pandemic. By comparison, almost 100 million Brazilian reais were loaned out to the men's clubs in just the first division alone.\"It's a lack of investment for sure. And that's not just a problem in Brazil; we are talking about a problem in the whole of South America,\" Kestelman noted.\"Argentina got to their first World Cup in over a decade last year. They are trying hard right now in Argentina, Colombia, Chile to make it [the women's game] happen.\"One of those countries, Colombia, is in the running to host the 2023 Women's World Cup and will learn its fate when the winning bid is announced on Thursday.Brazil's player Marta stands facing the Brazilian crowd.Enduring LegacyIf the last image we saw of Marta on the World Cup stage was one imploring the young women of her country to dedicate themselves to advancing the women's game, then that would be a fitting final moment for a global icon of the sport.When asked what she wants her legacy to be, Marta responded: \"I want them to think of me as an athlete that inspired other people, that improved our sport from what it was from the past to what it is now. Not just in Brazil, I mean this for the entire world, because we have the power of changing that.\"\"I don't want them to see me just as Marta, the soccer player, the one that scored most goals in the World Cups, the one that won the best player in the world many times; I want them to see me as an athlete that made improvements in our sport.\"CNN's Amanda Davies contributed to this story",

        "content": "London (CNN)Buckle up for the trial of the century.An electrifying public spat between two of Britain's most prominent footballers' wives is heading for a dramatic courtroom showdown, after Rebekah Vardy sued Coleen Rooney for defamation.Vardy filed legal proceedings against Rooney on June 12, court documents show, months after Rooney posted a lengthy message on social media accusing someone using Vardy's account of leaking stories about her to tabloid newspapers.The alleged subterfuge of one of the UK's leading \"WAGs\" -- a term used to describe the wives and girlfriends of professional footballers -- against another quickly became something of a national obsession.Two footballers' wives are at war, and it's changed Britain foreverIt will come to a head in Vardy vs. Rooney, with the claimant suing Rooney under defamation law.Read MoreRooney's legal team told CNN on Wednesday that their client had attempted to set up a meeting with Vardy in which she would present her evidence directly, before Vardy filed her case.\"It is disappointing that Mrs Vardy has chosen to issue court proceedings. Coleen feels that the time and money involved could be put to better use; her offer to meet face to face still stands,\" a spokesperson for law firm Brabners said. But the firm suggested the case means more details will reach a British public already on tenterhooks. \"Mrs Vardy's decision to issue court proceedings does at least mean that Coleen's evidence can be made public when the time is right,\" the spokesperson said.Vardy's legal team has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment.Vardy is the wife of Leicester City and former England striker Jamie, while Rooney is married to England's all-time leading goalscorer Wayne. Both women are also television personalities. What is WAG-gate?The court case follows a dramatic spat that unfolded in October 2019 following a social media post by Rooney.\"This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it,\" she wrote.Attached to the post was a lengthy and gripping tale, in which Rooney described months of amateur detective work she conducted on Instagram to find out who was leaking stories about her to a British tabloid.\"Over the past five months, I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper,\" Rooney explained. \"And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\"\"I have saved and screenshotted the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them,\" she went on.Then, in a jaw-dropping twist delivered at the end of a tantalizing ten-dot ellipses, Rooney wrote: \"It's ..........Rebekah Vardy's account.\"The allegation went viral and prompted countless column inches in the UK, quickly becoming known as the \"WAG wars\" and \"WAG-gate.\" Rooney's sleuthing also earned her the nickname \"WAGatha Christie.\"  Vardy subsequently denied the allegations and suggested someone else may have used her account.But the fight turned brutal as celebrities and members of the public alike started taking sides. Vardy was asked in an interview by the Daily Mail whether the two women have argued about the incident. \"That would be like arguing with a pigeon,\" she replied. \"You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it's still going to st in your hair.\"It is unclear when the court case will take place, or even whether it will bring an end to the drama.",

        "content": "(CNN)English football seemed to be united. When the Premier League restarted earlier this month, all the players from 20 clubs took a knee and some raised their fists, paying homage to a symbol of the Black power movement. For the first 12 games players also wore shirts with the message \"Black Lives Matter\" on the back of their jerseys instead of their names.Then on Monday a more discordant note was struck -- a plane flew over the Etihad Stadium during Manchester City's game against Burnley trailing a banner displaying the message: \"White Lives Matter Burnley.\"Burnley condemned the banner, issuing a statement during the match to offer its unreserved apology. After the game, Burnley captain Ben Mee said he was \"ashamed and embarrassed.\"According to the the Mayor of Burnley, Wajid Khan, the people responsible for organizing the \"White Lives Matter\" banner are \"missing the point\" of the Black Lives Matter movement.He makes the point that although Burnley \"has come so far\" after the race riots in 2001, a small minority do not realize that the Black Live Matter movement is \"not about a phrase.\"Read MoreManchester City striker Sergio Aguero (left) and Burnley defender James Tarkowski take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\"It's a movement, an understanding, a realization that over the history that Black people have faced and still continue to face challenges of racism, as we saw through the tragic death of George Floyd,\" Khan, who admitted he was \"very disappointed and embarrassed\" when he was told of the banner, told CNN's Phil Black.But not everyone is feeling embarrassment. When CNN traveled to Burnley on Tuesday, one woman interviewed by CNN outside the club's Turf Moor Stadium was trying to stick sheets of paper with the message \"White Lives Matter Too\" to the outside of the ground. The club's social media pages have also been flooded with criticism to the club's response.\"This is a moment to seize the opportunity to look at and reflect on all the institutions across the globe,\" noted Khan, who added that too many are seeing Black Lives Matter as just a phrase.\"And that is their ignorance,\" he said. \"And I think they are missing the point. And it's about time they need to be educated. Just like we've been educating people around homophobia, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism. We've got to look at all the injustices of society and stand up to them and deal with them.\"Following a police investigation, Chief Superintendent Russ Procter said that \"there are no criminal offenses that have been disclosed at this time.\"READ: As Burnley condemns 'White Lives Matter' banner, social media comments suggest some fans still miss the pointBurnley's English defender Ben Mee said he was \"ashamed and embarrassed that a small number of our fans have decided to fly that around the stadium.\"'Unacceptable' In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Burnley CEO Neil Hart said that the motivation behind the banner was to \"incite racial hatred.\"\"Clearly all lives matter: White, Black, wherever you're from. What we are saying, through the campaign, are Black and ethnic minority groups have faced persecution and injustice and inequality for hundreds of years and are still facing that today and that is the reason behind this campaign,\" said Hart. \"We are not saying White lives don't matter.\"We are standing very firm against any kind of discriminatory behavior. And that's what last night was about. Last night was driven by a group of individuals who are linked to a far-right group and last night's motivation was to incite racial hatred, full stop. And that is unacceptable.\"Burnley CEO Neil Hart said that the individuals involved with the banner \"are known to the club.\"Burnley has had a close relationship with far-right politics. In 2009, the British National Party won its first seat on an English county council with a victory in Lancashire in the Padiham and Burnley West ward. Khan has fought both British far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson when he \"[stood in] the north west of England\" and former BNP leader Nicholas Griffin.Khan, who was \"born and bred\" in Burnley, says that he got into politics to fight against the far right in elections in the town and \"expose the ignorance and the politics of hatred and division.\"\"[Racism in Burnley] is not different than anywhere else in any part of the country or the world,\" the 40-year-old Khan said. \"The people that did the banner, they had their way of thinking.\"But that way of thinking has been defeated consistently and persistently through people out there making a positive contribution. And I think the negative politics of division and hatred can only be defeated where enough good men and women come out and show the very best in what's great in the areas.\"And I think the way we've got to tackle this is by being more inclusive, by supporting movements that tackle discrimination and inequality, like the Premier League, the Black Lives Matter movement.\"READ: Raheem Sterling welcomes 'massive step' after players take a knee before Premier League restartKhan says that despite the Burnley's past, it has become a \"very cohesive community.\"Staying on trackBefore the Whites Live Matter banner was flown over the Etihad Stadium, a lot of positive momentum appeared to have been garnered through the Premier League's support for the Black Lives Matter movement.And former Liverpool and England striker Emile Heskey believes the banner was an attempt by \"one silly person\" who wanted to \"make it about themselves.\"\"You're always going to get one person who spoils what's going on and this is a positive movement,\" Heskey told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an Instagram Live chat on Tuesday.\"It's a positive thing that people are sitting down and we're having discussions and we're openly discussing and acknowledging that, yes, we possibly do need changes. That, yes, we probably just skirted over a few things. Yes, let's see where we can actually help and make change.Heskey is pictured playing for England against Italy.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"We're talking about a matter that, yes, people are acknowledging we need to do better and then you get one silly person making it about himself that he must fly a plane over a game.

Putin had originally planned a major celebration, inviting world leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping to join him.But like many public events around the globe, the event was postponed over coronavirus fears. The Kremlin delayed the event after a letter from veterans' organizations voiced concerns about the health risks such an event might pose.Veteran Antonina Farvazova attends the Victory Day military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War II in Moscow.A TOS-1A Buratino multiple rocket launcher moves along Tverskaya Street ahead of the military parade in Red Square.Many foreign leaders chose to stay away from the rescheduled event, but leaders of several former Soviet states were in attendance on Wednesday, including Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been a prominent coronavirus skeptic.A Russian football team lost a key match 10-1 after Covid-19 forced it to field youth teamThe audience this year on Red Square has been significantly reduced, with every two to three seats left empty to separate groups of guests.

A sanitary worker in protective gear sprays disinfectant on seats in Red Square before the parade.Last week, Putin published an article in the US magazine National Interest that highlighted Russia's efforts to claim some moral high ground in the years leading up to the start of World War II. He echoed that sentiment in a speech at the parade, saying: \"We will always remember that it's the Soviet people that defeated Nazi Germany... and it's hard to imagine what would have happened to the world hadn't the Red Army came to its rescue.\"Only \"unity,\" Putin added, can help the world fight threats in the future.The parade is particularly significant for the President this year as it comes ahead of a national vote on controversial changes to Russia's constitution that would effectively reset his presidential term count and could potentially pave the way for him to stay in power until 2036.

While this may sound like something from an action movie, Australian authorities say the drama unfolded in real life over the weekend. The cargo ship, headed for Newcastle, Australia, came to the assistance of the yacht.On Saturday morning, a cargo ship headed for the harbor city of Newcastle, New South Wales, came across a yacht that had encountered difficulties in the water off the coast of Yamba, according to Australian Border Force. The crew attached a tow line to bring the yacht with them to Newcastle, and took the yacht's skipper -- a 31-year-old man -- on board. But as the ship approached its destination later that evening, it was discovered that the tow line carrying the yacht had been snapped, and the yacht -- and the man -- were missing.

        "content": "(CNN)It doesn't take long to understand what type of person Ada Hegerberg is. One of the world's best female footballers certainly likes to be punctual.\"I'm so, so sorry, I really hate being late!\" she says, visibly irked despite being only four minutes behind schedule for the start of this interview. Perhaps unsurprisingly, tardiness isn't in the vocabulary of a striker whose brilliant career has been built on her ability to unerringly be at the right place at the right time on a football pitch.Deadly in front of goal -- she has scored over 300 career goals -- the Norwegian gives nothing less than 100% to the sport she loves.Ada Hegerberg: Why 'shaking things up' is more important than playing at Women's World CupIt's an attitude that's brought her a string of accolades in recent years. She is the first woman to win the Ballon d'Or, the biggest individual prize in world football, and is the all-time leading scorer in the Women's Champions League, a competition she's won a record four successive times with her club Olympique Lyonnais. But in January, just before the world was put on hold, Hegerberg was forced to press pause for the first time in her career after sustaining a season-ending ACL injury during a training session.Read MoreAfter months of rehab amidst a global pandemic, the 24-year-old says she's gained a new perspective. \"I think it's the perfect time and opportunity to lean back and discover other sides of my game, and to explore other arenas where you can gain perspective and learn a lot and to be better prepared when you get back on the pitch,\" she explains.\"My philosophy is that when I get back I really want to be stronger than ever, and for that you need time and you need to know your body, your mind and know when the right time is to get back.\"Hegerberg kisses the UEFA Women's Champions League trophy after Lyon beat Barcelona in Budapest on May 18, 2019.One way she has been gaining perspective is by watching every sports documentary she can. And there's one in particular that has enthralled her -- The Last Dance, a 10-part docuseries which follows Michael Jordan's final, tumultuous season with the Chicago Bulls.\"Oh I'm so glad you asked me about The Last Dance! I just finished the last episode and I didn't want it to end,\" Hegerberg says. \"It's very interesting to see the coach Phil Jackson's philosophy in terms of managing the team. It's a very, very valuable lesson for me as an athlete as well, to see how he coaches a team. Basically, having the best players in a group and knowing how to get the best out of each and every one of them.\"Unbelieva-Bull: 'The Last Dance' brings the Jordan era to life for fansDespite being one of the most celebrated strikers in the world, and with a reputation for being the most competitive player on her team, Hegerberg is reluctant to draw any comparisons between herself and Jordan -- but for one exception.\"What really got me was the episode where he talked about how much it takes to win and how much it took from him to be that winning character,\" she says of the ruthlessly competitive Jordan.\"When he talks about the fact that it's lonely at the top and got emotional at the end of one episode ... It really got me because I really understood what he meant. I invest everything into football every day in order to perform.\"Hegerberg poses with Luka Modric (left), the men's 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, and Kylian Mbappe, the  under-21 Ballon d'Or (Koppa trophy) winner.Hegerberg continues to sacrifice her place on Norway's national team.After taking the conscious decision to step away from the women's team in 2017 over the unfair treatment of her team compared to the men, Hegerberg has been buoyed by the US Women's National team, and particularly Megan Rapinoe, over their fight for equal pay. Earlier this month a federal judge threw out the unequal pay claims by the players, but allowed their allegations of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial. Attorneys for the players were asking to postpone the trial, which currently is scheduled for June 16.\"The US team is filled with great characters,\" says the Norwegian. \"Rapinoe has always had the guts to stand up for the sport and we really need figures like that. \"She's taken a beating for us all at times, standing up for what she believes in, and we need that.\"Being a women's footballer today -- it's impossible to not be standing for equality. That's why we need to be together on this in order to make a change for the future.\"However, the future is looking uncertain for women's football.In England, the remainder of the Women's Super League (WSL) and Championship seasons have been canceled because of the pandemic. In France, elite sport has been put on hold until September, while the women's European Championship has been pushed back to 2022.JUST WATCHEDWomen's Football Is...ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWomen's Football Is... 00:48There are fears the ongoing pandemic could erode the strides women's football made during and following the hugely successful 2019 Women's World Cup.Hegerberg says she's particularly concerned about impact of playing behind closed doors. In Germany, the Frauen-Bundesliga will resume on May 29 with all matches played behind closed doors.\"Our recognition comes from the number of people who attend our games,\" Hegerberg explains. \"That was a really good trend before this crisis. It was one of the main goals, to get people to games, to draw more attention to women's football week in, week out. But being in a situation like this, it stops that good trend. We have to deal with [that] and keep pushing in order not to lose that positive development.\"As Hegerberg readies herself for a return to the sport, whenever that may be, she and her husband are grateful to finally be able to watch live football on TV.Hegerberg's husband is Thomas Rogne, who plays for Polish side Lech Poznan. She was recently able to join him in Poland after isolating in France -- although the return of Germany's Bundesliga meant a special occasion almost passed the pair by.\"It's our one-year wedding anniversary!\" she says.\"We woke up and a family member told us and we were like, 'What?' We were more thinking about watching a game in the Bundesliga, so we had other things on our mind.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Two grand slam titles and a rapid rise to the top of world tennis was a head-spinning ascent for Naomi Osaka.But in this moment of pause, a period of lockdown with no tennis and no expectations, the 22-year-old is looking to confront an opponent from within: her crippling shyness. \"For me, I have a lot of regrets before I go to sleep, and most of the regret is that I don't speak out about what I'm thinking,\" she says, speaking to CNN Sport from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home. The night before this interview, the world No.10 -- who topped the world rankings for the first time in 2019 -- had uncharacteristically posted a series of soul-searching tweets which revealed to the world her inner struggle. \"I'm done being shy. It's really a waste of my time,\" she wrote. \"I could've shared so many ideas by now, I could've had convos with so many different people. All the things I could've learned but no I'm over here actually putting my own limiter on myself.\"Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosI'm done being shy.

'I would like to thank Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9'But one missed opportunity that plays over and over again in her mind has nothing to do with tennis. It involves her biggest idols, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9.During an off-season break in 2019, she met the superstar couple while on holiday on the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos but could barely utter a sentence. \"He started talking to me, but I got really nervous and started giving one word replies so he suddenly said, 'Are you shy?' and I said, 'yeah,' and the convo came to a screeching halt.\"Jay Z and Beyonce are two of the world's most successful music artists. It's a deeply human admission from a global sports star who, it turns out, is just like the rest of us when it comes to feeling star struck. The difference is, she will likely meet them again and, by then, the tennis star knows what she would want to say.\"I want to take the chance to tell people I appreciate them while I can,\" she says.\"I would like to thank Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 for making music that motivates me, because there was a period in my life where I just watched Beyonc\u00e9 performances to get motivated. \"Even right now I'm listening to older Jay-Z songs because I feel like they're really chill.\"READ: Halep's lockdown life: military on the streets, slower pace at home'Now we're talking in full sentences!'For all her inhibitions and self-censoring, Osaka also knows how far she's come. With a half-smile, she recalls a time at the beginning of her career when even entering a tournament locker room was a heart-thumping challenge.\"I was very shy and I wouldn't know what to do or where to put my things,\" she says.Rafael Nadal says 2020 tennis season is 'practically lost' due to coronavirus pandemic\"Even right now, maybe a couple of years ago I would be very, very shy to do this interview and you would only get like two words out of me but now we're getting full sentences!\"This period of reflection has occurred because her tennis career is on hold as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. Ordinarily, she would have been attempting to recapture the form that saw her win the US Open and Australian Open back-to-back. But with no tennis court, hitting partner, or a feasible way of practicing, Osaka has accepted the situation for what it has become: as close as she'll ever get to a 'regular life.'\"For me, it's a bit concerning, but I know that other players are in the same position as me, probably,\" she says.\"It's not like I'll forget how to play tennis and I also don't want to train five hours a day right now because that's how you get burned out and you never know when tournaments will start again.\" Osaka won the US Open in 2018 and the Australian Open iin 2019.But she already knows that when it does -- she will be different.  \"I will have more of a feeling of gratitude because you never know when something like this will happen again and I miss tennis a lot,\" she says. Time is transient, and Osaka is trying to make each day count. \"I feel like I want to take this time to learn something new or to improve because I'm pretty sure I won't have this much free time ever again,\" she says.",

Just looking at all the other sports, I think it's time for tennis to come back.\" READ: Federer will miss the rest of the 2020 season after suffering an injury setbackJUST WATCHEDFrances Tiafoe on racism and protests in the USReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFrances Tiafoe on racism and protests in the US 03:25US Open 2020Although tennis will be back, it promises to look very different. Perhaps the biggest change will be the lack of spectators in the stands, something which Andreescu knows will take some getting used to. Fans played a huge part in her winning her maiden grand slam in 2019, with the majority of the crowd supporting Williams on the night.As it turned out, the partisan reception was all the motivation she needed. \"Playing in front of the crowd just brings the hype into everything. I would say I perform really good under pressure so I felt the crowd gave me a push,\" she said, adding that this year's tournament will feel very different. \"There will definitely be people watching at home so it would be good to keep that in the back of our minds.\"READ: Federer is the highest-paid athlete in the world as only two women make top 100Andreescu is looking forward to defending her US Open title this year. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that \"extraordinary precautions\" would be in place to ensure safety at the tournament, including \"robust testing, additional cleaning, extra locker room space, and dedicated housing and transportation.\"However, ensuring families were able to travel with players throughout the entirety of the tournament was a major factor in players agreeing to the plans, according to WTA President Micky Lawler.\"Coming over would have been a big commitment because you're here for three to four weeks. So being here with just one person was a non-starter for people with families, so it ended up in a better place for those players that expressed concerns,\" Lawler told CNN Sport.The decision to permit more people in a player's entourage appeared to satisfy the needs of star players such as Williams, who has now stated her intention to participate. Her inclusion, along with defending champion Andreescu, was a huge boost to organizers. \"She [Williams] is an iconic athlete beyond tennis. Her voice carries tremendous influence, so to get an endorsement from Serena was very important, it was huge,\" added Lawler, saying the WTA  would continue working closely with its medical partners to ensure players safety.

Initial plans for the tournament had no space for mixed doubles, wheelchair tennis or the junior competition, but it appears the United States Tennis Association (USTA) may reassess the inclusion of wheelchair tennis after heavy criticism. \"This is a really difficult balancing act and the easiest thing would have been to say 'let's just call it quits and forget about 2020',\" she said.\"But that would have come at a massive cost to everyone -- players, tournaments and the whole sport. \"So kudos to the USTA for working this hard to come up with a plan that offers a great opportunity to a lot of people.

Ronaldo gave his side an early lead after converting from the penalty spot before striker Paulo Dybala doubled Juve's lead before halftime. The win takes them four points clear at the top of the table with its closest rival Lazio playing one less match. The two teams meet in Turin on July 20.Juve's win on Monday marked a welcome return of form for a team that's failed to score in normal time in both of its matches since Italian football restarted amid the pandemic. Juventus was beaten by Napoli on penalties in the Coppa Italia final on Wednesday after a goalless draw. In the semifinal second-leg Juve had drawn 0-0 against AC Milan, qualifying for the final on the away goals rule.Read More\"We knew Juventus would be angry,\" said Bologna coach Sinisa Mihajlovic after the game. \"It's almost impossible for them to slip up three games in a row.\"READ: The boy from the town \"where dreams seem unreachable\" who became a global superstarCristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Bologna.Ronaldo, who has scored 26 goals in 35 games for Juve this season across all competitions, hadn't netted in his previous four games.He dispatched his penalty after VAR spotted Matthijs de Ligt had been brought down by Stefano Denswil as a corner was whipped in. Although the visitors have struggled for goals recently, it's firepower is undeniable and Dybala put the game to rest with a thunderous strike. Juventus is yet to tie down Dybala beyond the summer of 2022 with a some of Europe's top clubs interested in signing the striker. \"Obviously I am a player of this club and I am happy to be here. People love me very much and I love the people very much. I have great appreciation for the club and the people who are here, I have a good relationship with my president and surely at some point they will come to chat -- or maybe not, I don't know,\" Dybala recently told CNN Sport.Juventus missed multiple chances to add to its tally in the second half which also saw left-back Danilo sent off in stoppage time.

Group meetings have been banned, and schools, daycare centers, museums, restaurants, pubs, swimming pools, gyms and other public places forced to close or drastically limit the number of people allowed in at any one time. The giant meatpacking company at the heart of Germany's new coronavirus hotspotMeetings between members of different households have been limited to two people at a time. Shops will remain open, but only with strict hygiene measures in place. Read MoreLaschet said the new measures were necessary because 1,553 workers at the Toennies meat processing factory have tested positive for the virus in recent days. The plant has been shut since last week. All of its 7,000 local employees and their families have been ordered into lockdown, even if they have not tested positive for the virus. On Tuesday, those restrictions were broadened to cover the entire district. \"You must stay in quarantine,\" Laschet said during a news conference on Tuesday, adding that police will enforce the lockdown if necessary. He said that while the outbreak has so far been limited to the factory, public health officials don't know how many people could have come into contact with someone who had been infected in the past few days.How Angela Merkel went from lame duck to global leader on coronavirusLocal public health officials are now racing to contain the outbreak through a large-scale test and trace program. Everyone working at the factory has already been tested, according to the district's website. Laschet said 100 mobile testing teams were combing through the district to identify anyone who may have been infected. North-Rhine Westphalia is Germany's most populous state, with almost 18 million inhabitants. In the seven days to Monday, the entire state reported 1,860 new cases of the novel coronavirus. That statistic suggests that while the outbreak has been severe, it has so far been largely confined to the factory and its workers. Laschet said Tuesday that only 24 coronavirus cases have been identified outside the factory so far. The lockdown Guetersloh marks the first time Germany has imposed a new lockdown, after easing many restrictions last month. Germany has so far recorded 192,127 cases and 8,909 deaths related to the novel coronavirus -- rates that are relatively low in compared to other European countries.

It is after the sun has gone down that the double Olympic champion, already regarded as one of the greatest alpine skiers in history despite being just 25 years old, begins to think about her father. The mind whirs and sadness creeps in. The coronavirus pandemic means most of humanity is struggling with being isolated or restricted, but for Shiffrin there's an added hardship. On February 2, her father Jeff died suddenly from an accident while at home in Colorado. He was 65.

Her father would join the media in the finish area, trying to capture the best picture of his daughter crossing the finish line. Another medal in tow, another memory for the family album. On a video call in the front room of her home in Colorado with a sprawling backdrop of the Rockie Mountains in view, Shiffrin said that after the pain of previous months, being home was important.  \"My dad spent a lot of time at this house and [was] part of the reason that I actually ended up buying this house,\" Shiffrin said. \"He had seen it on the market and had come to check it out before I even knew about it.

        ],
        "content": "London (CNN)Most Black people in Britain believe the governing Conservative Party is racist, an exclusive CNN/Savanta ComRes poll has revealed, complicating Prime Minister Boris Johnson's efforts to respond to the demands of anti-racism campaigners.As demonstrations and debates about Britain's colonial legacy sweep the country, 58% of Black Britons said they think Johnson's party is \"institutionally racist.\" A substantial minority of White people, 39%, said they believed the same.The findings highlight a major challenge for Johnson, who has been accused of making racist comments in past newspaper articles, as he battles to retain public confidence in his administration amid the coronavirus pandemic and burgeoning Black Lives Matter protests. Ministers have repeatedly urged people not to attend public protests, citing a ban on large gatherings enacted to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and have also condemned the forced removal of a statue of a slave trader in the southwest of England city of Bristol. Johnson also said through his spokesperson earlier this month that he \"does not agree that this is a racist country,\" leading to allegations that he does not grasp the scale of racism in Britain.     The results of CNN's poll are released on the third national Windrush Day, which was established to commemorate the men and women from the Caribbean who arrived in Britain to help rebuild the country in the years that followed World War II. Read MoreSome members of this Windrush generation -- named after the ship that brought one of the earliest groups of Caribbean migrants to the UK in 1948 -- were wrongly deported from the UK when they could not provide paperwork that proved their right to remain, resulting in a political scandal in 2018. The then Prime Minister, Theresa May, when she was Home Secretary between 2010 and 2016, described the measures as designed to create a \"hostile environment\" for people who were in the UK illegally.In CNN's poll, 55% of Black people said they did not have faith in the UK government to prevent a similar scandal from occurring again, while 38% said they did. The figures were virtually reversed for White Britons -- 55% trusted the government to avoid another scandal, while 39% did not.     A Home Office spokesperson told CNN that the department is \"considering the findings of the Windrush Lessons Learned review because we want to begin a new chapter.\"  Home Secretary Priti Patel is likely to give a formal response to that review before the summer.\"The Home Secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs,\" the Home Office added. \"12,000 people now have documentation proving their statements and we are making more compensation payments week on week.\"The Conservative Party has long battled allegations of racism, which have flared up on several occasions in its postwar history. A deeply anti-immigrant polemic known as the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech by the Conservative MP Enoch Powell in 1968, race riots in the 1980s under the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher, and the more recent Windrush fiasco have all dented the party's image among Black and minority ethnic groups. A spokesperson for the party told CNN: \"We're proud to be a party that champions and supports opportunity for all, of all races, religions and backgrounds. Prejudice and discrimination have no place in the Conservative Party and we will never stand by when it comes to abuse of any kind.\"Tens of thousands of Britons have died from coronavirus. But Boris Johnson is stoking a culture war.Last week, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a commission to examine racial inequalities in the UK. But the reported involvement of a Downing Street aide in setting up the commission has too proved controversial; critics say Munira Mirza is unsuited to the task because she has previously denied that widespread racism exists in the UK, writing in 2017 that she believed institutional racism was \"a myth.\" Downing Street has said the membership of the commission had yet to be decided.Johnson's own views on race and religion have also dogged him. In a newspaper column in 2018, he described Muslim women who wear face veils as resembling \"letterboxes\" and \"bankrobbers.\" In 2002 he called people from the British Commonwealth \"flag-waving piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles.\" Johnson has said the quotes have been taken out of context. Bad news for the Labour Party tooSavanta ComRes surveyed 1,535 British adults for CNN earlier this month about their views towards race relations in the UK. The findings, which laid bare public perceptions towards racism in several aspects of British life, make difficult reading for both of the country's major parties.Around a third of both Black and White respondents said they believed the opposition Labour Party to be institutionally racist. The party has been dogged by frequent allegations of anti-Semitism within its ranks, which peaked during the period under its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Labour's new leader, Keir Starmer, has pledged to stamp out anti-Semitism in the party.Although the poll did not ask specifically about anti-Semitism, the broader findings on racism demonstrates the scale of the challenge Starmer faces. A Labour spokesperson said Starmer had \"set out steps to rebuild trust and confidence in Labour on the issue of racism,\" including \"a number of internal measures aimed at ensuring the party embodies the values it stands for.\"Thousands have protested against racial inequality in the UK throughout June, in a wave of activism prompted by the police killing of George Floyd in the United States on May 25. The demonstrations have sparked a national conversation about Britain's colonial legacy, much of which has centered around the question of whether statues of slave traders should remain standing in British cities.",

        "content": "(CNN)A key Russian Premier League soccer match has come under scrutiny, after a top club was forced to field its youth squad when its entire first team was quarantined for coronavirus.The game between FC Sochi and FC Rostov went ahead despite the latter's squad being hit by six positive coronavirus tests before the match. Those positive tests meant Rostov's entire senior squad had to be quarantined, according to a club statement explaining its 10-1 defeat.Prior to the match at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi, Rostov was challenging for a UEFA Champions League place, while Sochi was embroiled in a relegation battle.Rostov asked Sochi to postpone the match but the team refused, and so it was forced to field a team of young players aged 16-19.The youngsters took an improbable lead in the first minute, when 17-year-old Roman Romanov scored, becoming the youngest scorer in club history. He is also the third-youngest scorer in Russian Premier League history.Read MoreFC Rostov celebrate taking the lead in the first minute of the game. However, by half time Sochi had taken a 4-1 lead, and scored another six goals in the second half.\"The score was most likely upsetting. However, we do want you to stay on the bright side!\" Rostov wrote, pointing out that 17-year-old goalkeeper Denis Popov was named Man of the Match after making a league record 15 saves, including keeping out a penalty.\"We know you would agree our players were fighting for every inch of the pitch -- each and every of them showed incredible character and attitude today!\" Rostov wrote in the message to fans.Even before the game, Sochi had received widespread criticism after making a controversial post on its official Instagram account Friday.Chaos beckons as European soccer season is devastated by coronavirus pandemic\"The entire country will be rooting for schoolboys! We were all schoolboys once. Today, let's just play football. The field is flat. The ball is round. Playing until mama calls home,\" the caption read.\"P.S. @fcrostov this is just a joke for fk's sake, and this is on our conscience.\"Sochi later deleted the post it but came in for more criticism for its refusal to rearrange the game and the subsequent treatment of its young opponents.Russian sports journalist Vasily Utkin said it was a \"real scandal\" that the match went ahead.\"All of Europe is laughing at us,\" he said in a video posted on his personal YouTube channel.Utkin said the fact the match went ahead worked against the interests of the league. Sergey Silkin, ex-coach of FC Dynamo Moscow and a former player, also criticized Sochi.\"What I saw in the Sochi-Rostov match is a joke. The championship needs to be played in combat-ready squads,\" he told state news agency RIA Novosti.\"Yes, the situation is very complicated and extraordinary, but the leaders need to get out of it somehow differently.\"Silkin called on league officials to do more to ensure that similar incidents don't happen again. However, Sochi owner Boris Rotenberg, a childhood friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, defended his club's actions.Potential Premier League return divides fans at top and bottomClubs had agreed not to rearrange matches due to time constraints, and any club in Sochi's position would have played the game, Rotenberg told the TASS news agency, adding that his team had played professionally.\"Their guys are great, they gave a fight, but we couldn't help scoring as many goals as we scored, as professionals play here,\" Rotenberg, who is under US sanctions, told TASS. \"If we were sorry for the young, they would not understand this, because when you fight with a stronger opponent, the more effort he puts in to beat you, the more opportunities you have for progress.\"This was the teams' first match following a break in play due to coronavirus, and there are nine remaining games in the season.The massive defeat means Rostov is now 15 points behind league leader Zenit St Petersburg, in fourth place. The top three teams qualify for a place in the Champions League.Sochi is effectively a feeder team for Zenit, which is Putin's home team. Sports reporter Utkin talked about the long friendship between Putin and Rotenberg in his video, and the connection was also discussed by Soviet-born American sports journalist Slava Malamud, whose Twitter thread about the game and the circumstances surrounding it went viral.Rotenberg's claim that Sochi couldn't have delayed the game was also thrown into doubt by the postponement of FC Krasnodar's game against Dynamo Moscow.Krasnodar and league authorities agreed to postpone the fixture until July 19, after the Dynamo squad entered quarantine following positive coronavirus tests, according to a league statement published Sunday.Russia has been one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic -- ranking behind only the United States and Brazil in Covid-19 case numbers. It has reported more than 590,000 infections and over 8,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. CNN's Nathan Hodge and Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Maria Sharapova announced her retirement, it brought to an end the career of one of the most bankable stars in sporting history, a woman who transcended tennis to become a global sports marketing icon.Max Eisenbud, the man responsible for helping the five-time major singles winner from Russia become the top-paid female athlete for more than a decade, thinks he has found another player with similar potential: Amanda Anisimova.Tall, blonde, of Russian descent and with a rare tennis talent, Anisimova resembles Sharapova in more ways than one. \"Obviously, there are similarities, it's hard to go away from that,\" Eisenbud, the head of IMG Tennis who has overseen the careers of players including Sharapova and Li Na, China's first grand slam singles champion, told CNN Sport \"I am the agent, they're both very attractive, they both have Russian roots, all that kind of stuff. There are those similarities that will always be there. But they are very different personalities.\"Read MoreAmanda Anisimova's agent is Max Eisenbud, who was key to developing Maria Sharapova's profile.READ: Tennis event organized by Novak Djokovic under fireA star is bornBorn in Freehold, New Jersey, to Russian-born parents, Anisimova moved to Miami with her family at the age of three. In 2017, she won the US Open junior title, beating another gifted teenager, fellow American Coco Gauff.At Roland-Garros last year, the then 17-year-old Anisimova dethroned defending champion Simona Halep of Romania to become the first player born in the 2000s to reach a major semifinal. Although she would lose to the eventual champion, Ashleigh Barty of Australia, in the last four, a star was born. Anisimova's run in Paris \"really caught a lot of people's attention,\" said Eisenbud, who extended her agreement with clothing giant Nike in November.In January, Anisimova joined Serena Williams as the only other tennis player to endorse American sports beverage maker Gatorade. She also recently signed a multi-year partnership with Therabody, a Los Angeles-based tech wellness company whose percussive massage therapy device is widely used by elite athletes the world over.  With both Nike and Gatorade looking to boost their female athlete roster, and Sharapova and Williams nearing the end of their careers, the timing of Anisimova's rise couldn't have come at a better time, according to Eisenbud. Although he dismissed media reports in October suggesting the Nike deal was worth $100 million, Eisenbud said it was \"probably one of the biggest clothing deals out there.\"Anisimova reacts to defeating Halep in Paris.READ: The 17-year-old who stunned French Open champion Simona Halep'Brand Maria Sharapova'Sharapova was born in Russia but moved to the US at the age of eight. Ten years later, she became a global star when she beat Williams for the 2004 Wimbledon title.The former world No. 1 quit the sport in February, having earned a total of $325 million in endorsements, prize money and appearances, according to Forbes. That's second only to her long-time adversary Williams, who has made more than $350 million during her career.\"Maria has been very successful,\" Anisimova told CNN Sport in March. \"It's really cool she has her own candy line and she has many exciting things for her now that she is retired, and she can go back to those things,\" said the young American, whose tennis idols growing up were Sharapova and Serena Williams.ROME, ITALY - MAY 16:  Maria Sharapova of Russia in action against Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia during day four of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia 2018 tennis at Foro Italico on May 16, 2018 in Rome, Italy. \"I have my own brands that I have signed with and I am really excited to produce some things,\" said Anisimova, adding she always runs business decisions past her older sister, Maria Egee, a former tennis player who has become a successful Wall Street banker. \"Maybe I'll create my own lines or something I am interested in. But I have my own thing going on,\" she added.Creating \"Brand Maria Sharapova\" isn't a blueprint for marketing future stars such as Anisimova, Eisenbud said.  \"Certainly, I think there is not a cookie cutter; I don't think maybe necessarily what worked for Maria or Li Na will work for Amanda,\" he said.\"When Maria won in 2004, there was no social media, and now there is. That's a big difference ... The brands want different things. It's all about what we're doing on social.\"Social media offers a big opportunity to develop Anisimova's profile, according to Eisenbud.READ: Maria Sharapova's complicated legacySocial mediaAnisimova's presence on social media was one of the reasons Therabody was keen to start working with the 18-year-old. \"She is an up-and-comer, and we want to be able to support her,\" Dr. Jason Wersland, founder and chief wellness officer of Therabody, told CNN Sport. \"She's got a big upside in tennis.

She's got charisma. I really enjoy her perspective.\"\"She is just really down to earth,\" added Eisenbud. \"That personality trait can be attractive to a lot of brands ... but I think in the end, she is going to be a real big winner, and brands want to be associated with that.\"Serena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou has been impressed by Anisimova.TragedyAnisimova's rise up the rankings was halted by tragedy in August, when she withdrew from the US Open shortly before the start of the event following the sudden death of her father and coach, Konstantin.\"It took a little bit of time for me to enjoy the game again,\" said Anisimova, who didn't play again until January. \"But I am now finally getting back into it. I am doing it for myself and also for my dad.\"Although all professional tennis has been suspended since March because of the coronavirus pandemic, the sport is set to resume in August. Anisimova, who played four events before the pandemic struck, took a few weeks off at the start of lockdown before resuming her training. She is scheduled to play an invitational charity event in Charleston, South Carolina, at the end of this month. \"She's pretty tough, and very driven and very professional,\" says Eisenbud of Anisimova.'Real deal'Tennis insiders have no doubt the American teenager is the real deal. \"She has incredible timing and every time she hits the ball, she hurts her opponent,\" Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams' long-time coach, told CNN Sport during last year's French Open.\"She can improve a lot in her movement and I'm sure she will. She is working hard; she has good people around so she'll be very dangerous.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videosAlthough Eisenbud held off on signing big corporate deals until Sharapova had won a major, he didn't do so with Anisimova. Yet he isn't concerned about the extra pressure the endorsements may bring.\"She's got Russian blood, so I am not too worried about that.

Speaking to CNN, the security source named the suspect as Khairi Saadallah. The source said mental health was considered to be a factor in the assault, which contributed to the reasons police took some time to declare it a terrorist incident.Saadallah, who is currently in police custody, is under investigation by the UK's Counter Terrorism Policing unit after a knife attack in Reading's Forbury Gardens on Saturday afternoon that left three dead and several others injured.UK Assistant Commissioner for Counter Terrorism Policing, Neil Basu, said no further suspects are under investigation by the police. Police block the entrance near Forbury Gardens in Reading town center.\"I am deeply saddened by the events of last night.

Eyewitness Lawrence Wort, who was in the park at the time of the attack, told CNN that people were relaxing and enjoying the sun when he heard a man shouting and yelling. The man began to approach people in the park, and started to stab people in the neck and under the arms, and attacked multiple people in this way, Wort said. A CNN team saw counter-terrorism police at an apartment block, who were combing for evidence early into the morning. Police asked some residents to stand outside their work so they could carry out their work. Armed police officers work at a block of flats in Reading after an incident at Forbury Gardens park in the town centre of Reading, England, Saturday.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that he was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the incident, but that he saw \"no reason\" to raise the country's terror alert level. \"I am appalled and disgusted that people should lose their lives in this way and our thoughts are very much with the families and friends of the victims today,\" he said.Johnson said he had spoken to the Chief Constable of Thames Valley police, and \"thanked him and his officers for their bravery in tackling the suspect.\"The police have urged members of the public to avoid the area, confirming that cordons remain in place; they have also called for witnesses to come forward with information.\"We would like to hear from anyone who has video footage. Out of respect for those deceased and injured, along with their loved ones, please do not circulate this footage on social media -- this will be incredibly distressing,\" Chief Constable Campbell said.\"From our enquiries undertaken so far, officers have found nothing to suggest that there were any other people involved in the attack, and presently, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident,\" he said in a statement, adding that detectives were working with security services to ensure there was \"no related outstanding threat to the public.\"Basu also noted that the incident was not at all associated with a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest, which took place earlier in the day and concluded hours before the attack.Salma Abdelaziz reported from Reading, Nada Bashir and Amy Woodyatt wrote in London.

They came to symbolize the seismic demographic changes in Britain that started after World War II and continued into the late 20th century, as hundreds of thousands of people arrived from former British colonies, known as the Commonwealth.What was the scandal about?  File photo of the Empire Windrush ship.The Windrush generation migrants arrived in Britain legally. Until a new immigration law came into force in 1973, Commonwealth citizens and their children had the automatic right to live and work in the UK. Many did so, without any need for additional documentation.  In late 2017, however, a raft of cases were reported in which individuals who had arrived in the UK from Commonwealth countries before 1973, and sometimes their descendants, were struggling to prove their citizenship status under tough new immigration laws billed as a \"hostile environment\" policy.Many don't have the required documentation because they had never been required to have it before. Some said they had been refused medical care, denied housing and deported or threatened with deportation. What was the government's reaction?   In April 2018, Britain's then-Prime Minister, Theresa May, apologized for her government's treatment of some Caribbean immigrants and insisted they were still welcome in the country. A year later, then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced a compensation program for people who had been wrongfully detained or removed from the UK.However, the program was widely criticized after only a small number of claimants received payments. In February 2020, the deadline for applications was extended for a further two years.A CNN/Savanta ComRes poll published Monday reveals continued worries that a scandal like Windrush could happen again in the UK, with 55% of Black respondents saying they do not trust the UK government that something similar would not happen again.      The treatment of the Windrush generation is part of the UK's long history of racial injustice, and CNN also polled attitudes to UK government actions to address it.The poll showed that 64% of Black respondents say the UK hasn't done enough to address historical racial injustice, compared with 35% of White respondents.When was Windrush Day established?From the top, hopeful Jamaican boxers Charles Smith, Ten Ansel, Essi Reid, John Hazel, Boy Solas and manager Mortimer Martin arrive at Tilbury on the Empire Windrush.The inaugural Windrush Day took place on June 22, 2018. The celebration, which is funded through government grants, features community events, exhibitions and publications. It exists to \"pay tribute to the outstanding and ongoing contribution of the Windrush Generation and their descendants,\" the government said.In March, announcing Windrush Day 2020, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick hailed the Windrush generation for the central role they have played in post-war Britain.\"British Caribbean communities have made Britain a better, more prosperous country in so many ways,\" he said.\"From the communities they have built to the public services they have supported and led, and the arts and culture they have enriched, they have made an incredible contribution to their country.\"CNN's Hilary Clarke and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.",

The riots had crossed a line that neither alcohol nor the will to show off on social media could excuse, he said in a statement Sunday, warning  that \"violence against emergency services is not tolerated.\"The unrest began after police officers conducted checks in the city center relating to reports of drug dealing.

        "content": "(CNN)Mass protests are spreading across Belarus as opposition to the reelection campaign of President Alexander Lukashenko grows, local media and human-rights organizations have reported. Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet republic of more than 9 million people since 1994 and is running for the sixth time in an election scheduled for August 9. He has long drawn international criticism for suppressing dissent, and the country's secret police -- still known as the KGB -- often detain and harass opposition activists and independent journalists. Demonstrations on Friday, in which thousands marched on the streets of 10 cities, were prompted by a series of arrests, in what the opposition activists called an attempt to take popular candidates out of the presidential race. Two of Lukashenko's main opponents are currently in KGB and police detention: popular YouTube blogger Sergei Tikhanovskiy, who was detained in late May, and former Belgazprombank chairman Viktor Babaryko, who was arrested on June 18 along with his son and campaign manager, Eduard Babaryko, according to their campaigns. Belarus presidential candidate Viktor Babaryko holds a press conference in Minsk on June 11.Following the news of the latest arrest, activists started forming \"human chains of solidarity,\" some of which stretched from to several kilometers, according to the organizers and local media reports. The independent non-governmental organization Viasna, which monitors protest activity in Belarus, reported Saturday that at least 120 people were detained overnight, including many journalists. Read MoreOn Friday, Lukashenko said the protests are a foreign plot and claimed that the country's law enforcement \"thwarted a Maidan,\" alluding to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that ousted the country's pro-Russian president.\"We managed to take some steps ahead of schedule and quash the large-scale plan to destabilize Belarus,\" Lukashenko said according to state-run news agency BelTA. \"We showed the true faces of the puppets we had here and puppeteers who sit outside Belarus. \"Don't make me choose. If I behave myself in a democratic way, if I show them that I'm so warm and fuzzy, I have a chance to lose the country altogether,\" Lukashenko added. Babaryko is considered to be Lukashenko's main opponent in this presidential election. His campaign says they have collected 425,000 signatures in support of his candidacy, passing the bar of 100,000 signatures. The country does not have reliable independent political polling, but in early June, a meme \"Sasha three percent\" was trending on Belarusian social media, referring to low numbers for Lukashenko in unofficial polls from independent online outlets. Sasha is a nickname for Alexander.'Better to die standing than to live on your knees,' says Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko at ice hockey matchEduard Babaryko's girlfriend said in a Facebook post Thursday he is being questioned in the KGB detention center on tax evasion charges. Lawyers for Viktor Babaryko said they have not been able to visit their client. As of Saturday, the Babarykos have not been released. The arrest was preceded by a series of police raids in Babaryko's offices and apartments of his family members. Head of the Belarusian Committee of State Control Ivan Tertel said that 20 current and former bank executives linked to Babaryko have been arrested on various charges, including tax evasion and embezzlement, and confessed that \"Babaryko is the organizer of a criminal scheme.\" Babaryko denies any wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated.Protesters hold their hands in the air during a rally in Minsk on June 19. Lukashenko has claimed that several candidates running against him in this election have ties to Russia. Several Belarusian outlets called Babaryko \"a Kremlin-linked candidate\" as he ran Belgazprombank, a subsidiary of Russian state-owned energy corporation Gazprom, for the past 20 years. Babaryko himself denied the allegation and asked the media not to call him a pro-Russian candidate. Lukashenko has long cultivated close relations with Russia, which has close economic ties and a customs union with Belarus. \"[Lukashenko] is doing it because of the roadmap on deep integration with Russia... in which Belarus loses its sovereignty, and it prompted a wave of public outrage,\"  Babaryko said in an interview with Russia's independent news outlet RBC. \"So now any hint that something is done to benefit Russia or any other state causes [negative] reaction within Belarusian society.\"The Kremlin has also denied it supports Babaryko and dismissed accusations against Gazprom. President Alexander Lukashenko speaks during a summit on December 20, 2019 in St. Petersburg, Russia.\"The Kremlin does not have candidates in Belarusian elections,\" Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said earlier this week. Putin and Lukashenko exchanged a phone call this week but did not discuss the situation around the Belgazprombank, according to Peskov. Lukashenko is expected to visit Moscow next week to attend a rescheduled Victory Day parade on Red Square.UK and US governments condemned the arrests and urged the Belarusian authorities to respect the right of its citizens for peaceful protest. \"The United States urges the Belarusian government to uphold its international commitments to respect fundamental freedoms by allowing the Belarusian people to freely, peacefully assemble and releasing those detained, including journalists covering tonight's peaceful gathering,\" the US Embassy in Minsk Twitter account said in a tweet.",

But in an empty stadium, the usually fevered atmosphere of the derby was lacking.Also lacking was clear-cut chances for either side, with Liverpool, leaving a not fully fit Mo Salah on the bench, rarely troubling home goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Read MoreJoel Matip should have done better from a Trent Alexander-Arnold free kick in the first half and Liverpool started the second half strongly with Roberto Firmino and Naby Keita combining well to set up a chance.But Everton survived the pressure and came very close to causing an upset in the last few minutes as a clever flick from Dominic Calvert-Lewin was kept out by Alisson with a first-time attempt from Davies striking the woodwork and away.The draw leaves Liverpool unbeaten in the last 22 Merseyside derbies, but still five points from guaranteeing the coveted English Premier League crown.The Liverpool manager said his team didn't create enough chances for the amount of time it possessed the ball.\"Most of the time we were dominant but then they had the biggest chance out of the blue, we were lucky in that moment,\" Klopp said.\"Both teams showed it was a derby, even without a crowd,\" Klopp said.Players and officials take a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement  before the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park. Before the match, both teams took the knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and stood for a minute's silence in honor of those who have died in the Covid-19 pandemic.READ: 30 years of dreaming: Liverpool's long wait for the English titleREAD: Champions League final 2005: 'Something unreal happened'Chelsea boosts Champions League bidEarlier on Sunday, Chelsea cemented its grip on fourth place with a 2-1 win at relegation-threatened Aston Villa.Kortney Hause put Villa ahead against the run of play just before halftime, but after the break it continued to be one-way traffic as Chelsea dominated possession without carving out a string of chances.Manager Frank Lampard sent on US international Christian Pulisic in a bid to spark his attack and it paid almost immediate dividends as he connected with a Cesar Azpilicueta cross to half-volley an equalizer in the 60th minute.The winner came just two minutes later as Olivier Giroud was allowed time to turn in the penalty box and his deflected shot beat Orjan Nyland in the Villa goal.Chelsea's French striker Olivier Giroud scores his team's winning goal as his shot takes a deflection off the boot of the challenging Conor Hourihane to beat Orjan Nyland in the Aston Villa goal. Villa had a late chance to level as Jota pulled his shot wide, but Dean Smith's team was well beaten and remains second bottom in the standings.The victory completed a good week for Chelsea, which has strengthened its squad with the acquisition of RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner, and moved five points clear of Manchester United in fourth spot and only three adrift of third-place Leicester City.Sheffield United faltered in its bid for a Champions League spot, losing 3-0 at Newcastle, who could be under new ownership by a controversial Saudi-backed consortium.Manager Steve Bruce admitted before the match that it had been a \"distraction\" but it did not prevent his side from securing an impressive victory, helped by the second-half dismissal for two yellow cards of visiting defender John Egan.The lively Allan Saint-Maximin scored the opener soon after Egan departed and Matt Ritchie doubled Newcastle lead with a well-hit strike 14 minutes later.SB on Joelinton: \"We're all delighted for him. He probably suffered more in the lockdown, he had no family over and he was stuck in an apartment somewhere. It's been difficult for him but I'm delighted for him because he's a really good pro and he can only get better.\" pic.twitter.com/cn7JkBzp2r\u2014 Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) June 21, 2020 The icing on the cake for Newcastle fans was the third \u2014 a rare goal for Brazilian striker Joelinton, who earlier had missed a cast-iron first-half chance to put his side ahead.It was his first goal in the league since August 25 against Tottenham and only his fourth of the season following his \u00a340 million ($44 million) move from Hoffenheim last year.Despite a draw and a loss since the restart of the campaign, Chris Wilder's United are just two points behind fifth-place Manchester United, which drew 1-1 with Tottenham on Friday.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Next Wednesday marks a major event for Russia: Russian President Vladimir Putin will preside over a rescheduled Victory Day parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. And Moscow is reopening just in time for the festivities. The last set of lockdown restrictions on gyms and restaurants will be lifted Monday, a week earlier than originally planned by the mayor and just in time for the big military parade in Red Square. The festivities are all part of the run-up to another big event for Putin: a nationwide vote on amendments to the country's constitution, scheduled for July 1. It's a return to normality for Russians exhausted by lockdown and economic uncertainty. But coronavirus has left a cloud of uncertainty over the festivities, which were postponed amid pandemic fears. By tradition, World War II veterans occupy the viewing stand next to Putin as thousands of soldiers march across Red Square. But this year, those veterans are quarantined at a health resort outside of Moscow. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin has asked residents to watch the event on TV, saying attendance will be limited.Exclusive: Did Russia pass the coronavirus test? Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov respondsAnd while Moscow is still going ahead with the parade, other cities have curbed their enthusiasm for the celebration amid coronavirus fears. Read MoreOver the past two weeks, at least 25 large cities in Russia refused to hold the parade on June 24, according to a CNN tally based on media reports and statements from local administrations. According to the official list released by the Russian Defense Ministry, only 28 cities will hold the parade, mostly in headquarters of the military districts and \"hero cities\" of special significance to WWII events. In total, 64,000 people are expected to take part in the celebrations, according to the government's official website.Out of these 28 cities, an overwhelming majority is located in regions that are still in stage one out of three of the reopening plan, which means that few restrictions have been lifted and mass gatherings are still banned. Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, said Monday that the Kremlin \"absolutely understands\" the decision made by some governors to limit Victory Day celebrations.\"This is the prerogative of the regional leaders, these are the very special powers that they were given to them against the background of the epidemiological danger,\" Peskov said.Russian servicemen take part in a rehearsal for the Victory Day parade in St. Petersburg on June 20, 2020.Virus spreads across Russia's vastnessWhile the decision whether to cancel the parade has been largely left to regional authorities, the public vote on the constitutional changes that could allow Putin stay in power until 2036 is going ahead across the entire country, despite several regional hotspots.In April and May, Moscow consistently accounted for about a half of all new daily cases, according to federal statistics. Now the regions account for roughly 80% of all new cases in Russia, which in recent days has confirmed between 7,000 and 8,000 cases each day. The Central Election Committee moved to stretch the vote over the span of five days in attempt to limit crowds. According to public guidelines, each station would only be able to process eight people per hour. Moscow and Novgorod have also set up electronic voting systems, and regions are working to engage a large number of volunteers to arrange voting at home.The decision to hold the referendum has been supported by the country's health and wellbeing agency Rospotrebnadzor. But some election committee workers have openly revolted against the plebiscite.Renegade priest occupies Russian convent  \"We will be constantly on site to help thousands people vote. We will be in contact with them both at the polling stations and their homes,\" an open letter signed by election committee workers across Russia reads. \"And if at least one member of the commission gets infected, it is very likely that the entire commission will also be infected.\"The open letter -- titled \"We are not disposable material\" -- has been signed by more than 500 people, and comes amid criticism that the passage of the constitutional amendments is a done deal. Earlier this week, Russian social media exploded with pictures from bookstores that had begun selling freshly printed constitutions that already included the new changes, which sailed through Russia's legislature and supreme court with little debate.

        "content": "(CNN)The records keep tumbling for Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski with a double against Freiburg Saturday seeing him surpass Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's previous best for the most goals scored by a non-German player in a Bundesliga season.The Polish international helped Bayern, already crowned champion for the eighth straight season, to a 3-1 victory in its penultimate match of the league campaign.Bayern Munich's Polish forward Robert Lewandowski celebrates after scoring his team's second goal in the 3-1 win over Freiburg at the Allianz Arena.Lewandowski has grabbed 33 goals in just 30 Bundesliga matches this campaign, both his latest coming in the first half at the Allianz Arena as Bayern secured a 3-1 advantage at the break. There was no further scoring in the second half.Gabon star Aubameyang scored 31 in the 2016/17 season for Borussia Dortmund before he moved to his current club Arsenal in the English Premier League.With just one round of matches remaining, Lewandowski is still short of the remarkable all-time record of 40 by the legendary Bayern Munich and German striker Gerd Mueller in the 1971-72 season.Read MoreREAD: Lewandowski double in Bayern routBut with 48 goals in 41 games in all competitions this season, Lewandowski has plenty of opportunities to improve his overall tally as Bayern is facing Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup final on July 4 before continuing its bid to win the Champions League which resumes in August.Lewandowski is the top scorer in Europe's elite competition this season with 11 goals in six games, his latest against Chelsea in the first leg of the last 16 clash which Bayern won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge back in February.Haaland doubleMeanwhile, the Bundesliga's other most prolific scorers went head-to-head as Timo Werner's RB Leipzig hosted Erling Braut Haaland's Borussia Dortmund.Werner, who is playing his final two matches for Leipzig before joining Chelsea, drew blank but the Norwegian prodigy Haaland scored in either half to help Dortmund to a 2-0 away victory which secures second place in the standings behind Bayern.The 19-year-old Haaland, who has also been linked with a number of Europe's biggest clubs, has scored 13 goals in 14 games since joining Dortmund from RB Salzburg last December.Dortmund's Norwegian forward Erling Braut Haaland shows his delight after bagging the second and decisive goal for Borussia Dortmund at RB Leipzig. Werner stays on 26 for the season in the Bundesliga, second only to Lewandowski.Consolation for Leipzig, which is through to the last eight of the Champions League, was the 2-0 defeat for Bayer Leverkusen at Hertha Berlin.It has left Leverkusen three points adrift of Leipzig in the battle for automatic qualifying spots for next season's Champions League with just one round remaining and a vastly inferior goal difference.Elsewhere, it's looking bleak for Werder Bremen, with a 3-1 defeat at Mainz leaving the northern side second bottom and two points adrift of Fortuna Dusseldorf who are in the relegation playoff spot.Brighton stuns ArsenalMeanwhile in the English Premier League, Aubameyang's Arsenal suffered a second chastening defeat in four days as Neal Maupay scored deep into injury time to give Brighton a 2-1 victory over the Gunners.Nicolas Pepe put Mikel Arteta's faltering side ahead on the 68th minute at the Amex Stadium with a stunning strike, but home defender Lewis Dunk capitalized on suspect Arsenal defending to level seven minutes later.It looked set to end all square until Aaron Connolly cleverly helped the ball on to Maupay, who finished neatly.It sparked an ugly incident as Maupay, who been in an aerial challenge with Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno in a first half clash which saw the German stretchered off in agony, was involved in an altercation with Matteo Guendouzi in a melee of players at the final whistle.Tell us how you really feel, Neal... \ud83d\ude33Brighton matchwinner Neal Maupay has said Arsenal 'got what they deserved' after 'talking a lot', but said he never meant to hurt goalkeeper Bernd Leno. \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) June 20, 2020 Maupay said after the match that he had not intended to hurt Leno, but had little sympathy for the rest of his teammates, claiming they \"got what they deserved\" for not showing more humility after the opening goal by Pepe.Arsenal, which still had hopes of European qualification, lost 3-0 to Manchester City last Wednesday after having defender David Luiz  sent off, and the latest defeat has left the north London giants in ninth place.Earlier, relegation battlers Watford scored a last-gasp equalizer to deny third-placed Leicester City victory in a 1-1 draw at the Vicarage Road.England full-back Ben Chilwell looked to have given the visitor victory with a stunning left-footed strike on 89 minutes, but Craig Dawson salvaged a precious point for the Hornets with an acrobatic overhead kick goal just a minute later.",

        "content": "(CNN)The climate crisis threatens the very future of major sports and sporting events around the world, while the global sports industry is failing to address its own emissions, a new report has found. In the future, almost all sports, including tennis, rugby, athletics, cricket, football and winter sports will suffer the impact of a warming world, facing heatwaves, floods, fires and rising sea levels, the study released Saturday by the Rapid Transition Alliance found.Almost a quarter of English league football grounds can expect flooding of their stadiums each year by 2050, while one in three British Open golf courses will be threatened by rising sea levels, the study said. Meanwhile the Winter Olympics, along with other winter sports, will become increasingly difficult to host because of rising temperatures, the report warned.The area around the International Stadium Yokohama is deserted as Typhoon Hagibis approaches on October 12, 2019 in Yokohama, Japan.Heatwaves and heat stroke will threaten the health of both players and fans, extreme weather events and sea level rise caused by climate change will flood stadiums and playing fields, and sea level rise will threaten golf courses, the report warned. Climate change is threatening winter sports' very existenceRead MoreExtreme weather events, which are linked to rising temperatures, have already affected major sports events around the world: Typhoon Hagibis wreaked havoc in Japan and at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, while in Australia, smoke from bushfires ravaging the country disrupted the Australian Tennis Open earlier this year. The study, released Saturday, found that sports leaders were largely failing to address the crisis, or their part in creating it. The report authors warned that global sport's carbon emissions are equivalent to that of a country the size of Angola by lower estimates, and Spain at upper estimates. The horizon is covered with thick smoke haze in Melbourne on January 15, ahead of the Australian Open tennis tournament. But in spite of this, there has been a \"woefully inadequate\" response from the sporting industry the report authors said, noting that only a \"tiny fraction\" of the world's leagues, federations, tournaments, clubs and sporting bodies had made carbon targets, outlined their environmental commitments or signed up to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework.Meanwhile, petrochemical companies, airlines and vehicle manufactures still maintained a presence as key advertisers and sponsors of sport, the study said. \"Sport provides some of society's most influential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow,\" Andrew Simms, coordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said in a statement. \"A first step would be to bring an end to sponsorship from fossil fuel companies and products promoting fossil fuel intensive lifestyles. At the moment sport is part of the problem, but it can become part of the solution,\" he said. Coaches fear youth sports may not get through coronavirus shutdownsReport author David Goldblatt said that while widespread changes need to be made on a global scale to address the climate crisis, the sporting industry could spark a sea change if it committed to addressing climate change. \"Sport may be just big enough to register, in terms of carbon emissions, as a small nation state, or a single mega city, but its own efforts are just a fraction of a percentage point of the world total. Yet few human practices offer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport.\"Making a carbon zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics,\" he said. Scientists have repeatedly warned that urgent steps must be taken to stave off the worst effects of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in a landmark report that we only have until 2030 to drastically reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and prevent the planet from reaching the crucial threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",

        "content": "Brisbane, Australia (CNN)Every day, the men unfurl large pleas for help over the balcony railings of their hotel room and stand in silence as traffic roars along the main road of the Australian city they're trapped in.Their signs are mostly made from bin bags stuck together with tape, and secured to the railing with shoelaces.  \"Where is justice?\" one reads. These men are not hotel guests, but refugees and asylum seekers who have been in Australian immigration custody for seven years. Many arrived in Australian waters in 2013, after the government introduced offshore immigration processing. They were detained on the remote islands of Manus in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and on Nauru in the Pacific, in conditions once described by the United Nations as \"harsh\" and \"inadequate.\" In 2016, Amnesty International called Nauru an \"open-air prison.\"     All are suffering the effects of prolonged, indefinite detention and were brought to Australia last year for urgent medical treatment. Read MoreBut some say the conditions in the Brisbane hotel are worse than PNG or Nauru.\"You're in prison in here. In PNG, you have a little bit of freedom. You can move around. There is no ABF (Australian Border Force), no security guards around you,\" said Farhad Rahmati, an Iranian refugee who was transferred to Australia from PNG last July.For months, the 120 or so men inside the hotel kept quiet about their plight. However that changed in March, when the number of coronavirus cases in Brisbane started rising. Fearing the virus would enter the hotel via the guards who come and go, they crafted signs large enough to be seen from the street. As people noticed their pleas, weekly demonstrations began outside the hotel. These demonstrations have now escalated into a blockade by human rights activists who are demanding the men be freed.The standoff between cellphone-armed protesters and security guards has cast unwanted attention on an Australian immigration policy that has long been, by definition, focused offshore.Now it's playing out in the heart of one of Australia's largest cities in a 4.5-star hotel that only a few months ago was still accepting paying guests.Protesters staged weekly protests that escalated into an occupation when security guards tried to remove a detainee. Offshore detentionIn 2018, it was reported that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had a model migrant boat on his desk bearing the words: \"I stopped these.\" Before taking high office, Morrison helped strengthen the country's border protection policies, which mandate that people arriving by boat will be processed offshore -- and even if they are found to be refugees, they will never be settled in Australia. The government says this policy removes demand for people smugglers and prevents deaths at sea. Boat arrivals peaked in 2012, when more than 17,000 passengers arrived from Iran, Afghanistan, Myanmar and other troubled nations, via hubs such as Indonesia and Malaysia.Few boats arrive now, but human rights advocates say the policy has created a cohort of prisoners confined to islands offshore. As the detainees' mental health deteriorated, advocates pushed for a law to allow doctors to decide if they should be brought to Australia for medical treatment. The medevac bill was passed in March 2019, opening the door for transfers, but the government abruptly closed it again after winning an election that May, citing national security concerns.  UN urges Australia to stop spate of migrant suicide attempts Before that happened, almost 200 men had been brought to Australia under the medevac law, including some who were suicidal. Others had brain injuries, undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding, heart conditions and broken bones that needed surgery.For months, many of those detainees lived in one of the Brisbane hotel's three buildings, confined to the upper floors -- and beyond the view of paying guests. Before the coronavirus outbreak, they were allowed visits from pre-approved guests. Now, they're only allowed out for medical appointments, escorted by guards.In March, due to the pandemic, more space was needed for social distancing in Brisbane Immigration Transit Accommodation (BITA), the main immigration detention center on the city's outskirts. About 40 more detainees were moved to the hotel -- and their rooms opened onto a balcony with a view of the street. Saif Ali Saif peers out from his hotel room balcony where he has hung images of his three-year-old son.Watching the world go by Somali father-of-one Saif Ali Saif stands on his balcony each day, with his own sign scribbled in pen on an old T-shirt. It says: \"I want (to) hug my son.\" His wife Sabah Siyad lives in community detention 29 kilometers (18 miles away) with their three-year-old son, Sammi. She gets a small government allowance each week and is not allowed to work or study. The family hasn't held each other since March, when visits stopped due to the coronavirus. Saif worries Sammi will forget him. Saif Ali Saif was able to receive visits from Sabah Siyad and their son Sammi before the coronavirus pandemic.Saif escaped war while working as a driver in Yemen; Siyad ran from bombing in Somalia. She lifts her sleeve to show shrapnel scars as proof. The refugees met and married in Nauru in 2016 and Sammi was born on Valentine's Day the following year. Their baby was a few months old when it became apparent that his breathing difficulties required specialist care. Officials approved the baby's transfer to Australia with his mother but not Saif. \"I was really scared my son would die there,\" he said, so he let them go. Saif was told last June he was being transferred to Australia and has now spent a year in detention. He says he doesn't know why he was transferred. The family has been separated for three years. \"Sammi wants his father,\" Siyad said.Iranian refugee Farhad Rahmati was transferred to Australia for treatment for a heart condition.From his balcony, Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, can see a pub, a car wash, restaurants and a McDonald's on the next block.\"I see everything, but I have no chance to touch it,\" he said. \"I see people walking their dogs. I love dogs. I'd love to have a chance to, you know, to walk my dogs. But look at my situation. I'm not even close to that.\"Rahmati worked as a civil engineer before fleeing Iran in 2013. He doesn't want to talk about why he left.While Rahmati and Saif stand on the balcony with signs, many detainees don't. They stay in their rooms, worried that protesting will affect their chances of ever being freed.A detainee holds a sign  to the window of his Kangaroo Point hotel room: \"Thank you.\"Strange events on the corner Even before the signs went up, neighbors noticed something strange going on at the hotel on the corner: cars with blackened windows, guards with earpieces, trucks coming and going on a regular basis. No one told them what was going on at the hotel, which has been there for over a decade.  Central Apartment Group (CAG) took over the hotel's operation in 2018 and changed its name to Kangaroo Point Central Hotel and Apartments. It's one of 18 hotels on the company's website, advertised as family-friendly accommodation \"ideal for business and leisure travellers.\" When contacted by CNN, the group's CEO Sid Knell said he would not comment about events at Kangaroo Point. \"You can ask me about self-drive holidays,\" he said. Nearby residents, however, have railed against the appearance of a prison on their street. \"How could they start a prison and not tell people?\" asked Annette Hogan. The residents CNN spoke to said they didn't have a problem with the refugees, but the walls and guards had changed the tone of the neighborhood. Opinions differed on the local Facebook page: \"Send them back,\" one post said.Hannah and Anand Parameswaran have a direct view of the hotel grounds for their kitchen window. From there, they can see the small pool where guests used to swim. The detainees aren't allowed to use it. \"I feel a little bit guilty coming and going,\" said Hannah Parameswaran. Anand agrees: \"I feel really guilty because it's our money being used to do this to them.\" Temporary fences have been erected around the hotel, but the neighbors can see into the hotel grounds from their kitchen.The Refugee Council of Australia estimates it costs the government 346,000 Australian dollars ($236,000) each year to hold someone in detention in Australia. That is on top of the AU$7 billion ($4.8 billion) the government spent on offshore processing from 2012, according to the Australian National Audit Office.Carmelo Nucifora, who runs Spizzico, the Italian restaurant on the hotel premises, says he wasn't consulted about plans for a prison on the site. As more fences went up, blocking off most of the restaurant's parking area, he said he sought a meeting with Australian Border Force officials. \"I went and pleaded to one of the officers. It's embarrassing, but I cried in front of them, pleading for some attention, for mercy,\" he said. Like other restaurants in the city, he was forced to limit his business to takeaway only during the coronavirus lockdown. Takings plunged from around AU$14,000 a week to AU$2,000.Now, even as coronavirus restrictions ease to allow more diners, his restaurant is surrounded by protesters.Protesters camped in tents outside the hotel until police cleared the sidewalk. Then they moved across the street.The protests \"Seven years too long. Free the refugees,\" chant protesters through a tannoy outside the hotel. Last Thursday, their weekly protest turned into a 24-hour occupation when word spread that Border Force officials had arrived to transfer Rahmati, the Iranian refugee, to BITA. Cellphone footage shot by another detainee, and seen by CNN, shows Rahmati being led to a van by security guards, where they are ambushed by protesters, who stand on the roof and glue their hands to the van. Rahmati is hurried back inside the hotel and returned to his room. Protesters don't want any of the men to be transferred deeper into Australia's immigration detention system. They're demanding the men be released into the community by Christmas.But on Friday morning, the guards came back for Rahmati.An Emergency Response Team burst into his room, ordered him to lie face down on his bed, cuffed him, flipped him over and took him to a waiting car, Rahmati said via cellphone from the high-security compound in BITA, where he was taken. Rahmati is in Australia receiving treatment for a heart condition.Matt Sheppard, from rights group Refugee Solidarity Meanjin, says too few protesters were positioned outside a gate to stop the car that took Rahmati away. After that, protesters blockaded the exits and agreed only to clear them if they were able to search vehicles coming and going, to make sure no more refugees would be transferred.Sheppard says he believes Rahmati was taken from the hotel because he spoke to the media. \"He's just a really charismatic person that provides a lot of support for the men inside as well. So, I think it was a calculated move to remove him from the community and break up that cohesion,\" he said.In a statement, Australian Border Force Commissioner Michael Outram denied detainees were being \"punished\" or moved for speaking to advocates or the media. \"Detainees are routinely moved for a range of reasons, including health, welfare or to ensure the safety of other detainees, staff and the public,\" he said.        The day after Rahmati's removal, hundreds gathered in the street to call for the occupants' release. Saif, the Somali refugee, spoke from the balcony, his phone call amplified on speakers to the crowd. \"Let me hug my son,\" he said. One by one, the crowd started chanting, \"Let him hug his son, let him hug his son.\" They cleared a path to the hotel entrance so Siyad could push Sammi towards him in his pram. She got as far as the gate before the request was denied.They don't know when they'll next be able to meet.        Protesters chanted for guards to allow refugee Saif Ali Saif to hug his son. (Credit: Abdullah Moradi)A spokeswoman for acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge told CNN that \"it was made very clear to those who were transferred under the medevac provisions that they would be placed into immigration detention.\"   David Manne, the executive director of Refugee Legal, said the law also allows the minister to release them.\"There are powers at the disposal of the government and the minister personally to release these men from detention. It's incumbent upon the federal government to explain why it's not using those legal powers to release these men from prolonged and indefinite detention,\" he said.As a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Australia is obliged to provide a safe place of refuge for people fleeing persecution, or to resettle them elsewhere.  When the quest for freedom goes horribly wrong ABF Commissioner Outram said in his statement that the men are \"encouraged to finalize their medical treatment so they can continue on their resettlement pathway to the United States, return to Nauru or PNG or return to their home country.\"Manne said that despite many of their illnesses being severe or critical, there was \"significant information to cast doubt upon whether they are receiving or have received the medical treatment required.\"\"It is abundantly clear that the prolonged, indefinite detention of these men, who were critically ill and brought to Australia for treatment, is almost certainly compounding the severity of their medical conditions,\" he said.The immigration minister's spokeswoman said the men had access to medical professionals and specialists, and any claims to the contrary were incorrect.Former immigration officer Rebecca Lim, from the Brisbane On-Arrival Refugee and Asylum Seeker Response Group, said volunteers were ready and waiting to help support the men in the Australian community -- when, and if, they are freed. \"If the minister is not making the decision to release the men into community detention because it is not in the public interest, then he needs to explain what that means,\" she said. \"Indefinite detention is wrong.\"",

In her native Sweden, she said, \"you don't get tested unless you are in need of medical help.\"Despite having had what she said were mild symptoms, Thunberg posted about her experience on social media to raise awareness about the virus.At a CNN Coronavirus Town Hall last month, Thunberg said the pandemic had forced people \"to realize that we are actually depending on science and that we need to listen to scientists and experts.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)After three months of confinement, the footage seemed otherworldly: bucket hats, balloons, a heavy techno beat, and a few thousand young people crammed into a small clearing in the woods.But the signage by the DJ deck gave a cheeky nod to the new world in which the party was being thrown. This was a \"quarantine rave,\" it read; one of several taking place each weekend around the United Kingdom, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.The event, which occurred near Manchester in the north of England last Saturday, has caught the eye of Britain's news media in recent days after police reported that several thousand attended. Three stabbings, a rape and an overdose death were also reported between that rave and another nearby, police said, and officials are investigating footage of attendees wielding weapons.Across the country, authorities are struggling to keep up with hastily organized, dangerous parties being held on short notice in quiet nature spots. \"We can't say for certain that we can prevent all such events from taking place,\" Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham admitted in a statement on Friday. \"(But) there is no question of us turning a blind eye or adopting a permissive approach.\"The parties are alarming health officials too, with the reproductive rate of the virus in the UK hovering just below one and the country only tentatively easing its lockdown restrictions in the hope of returning to normality. Large gatherings are still banned in Britain, and there is little hope of social distancing at these events.Read MoreThey're also condemned by the established members of Britain's illegal rave scene -- even if their existence isn't a complete surprise. \"This is a result of the situation that we're in right now,\" says DJ Mandi Gordon, who played illegal raves until the pandemic struck, under the stage name Mandidextrous. \"People are frustrated, people want to be able to get out right now.\"A combination of strict licensing laws, the closure of clubs and the high cost of living in British cities had already led to a boom in underground raves, industry insiders say. But so prevalent are reports of the new pop-up events that much of the UK media is now predicting a re-run of the Second Summer of Love -- the short-lived explosion of colorful, MDMA-fueled illegal raves that rippled through Britain in 1988 and 1989.For those two years, ravers would play cat and mouse with police as they ducked from woodland to field to abandoned warehouse, blasting acid house from their stereos before returning to the monotony of the working week. How will we party post-pandemic?\"Everybody in society just had this pressure on them, which you didn't even notice until you stood in a field and took your first E [ecstasy] and realized, 'Oh my god, I've been living like an idiot,'\" recalls Gavin Watson, a skinhead-turned-raver whose photographs and books from the time helped immortalize the Second Summer of Love -- named in homage to the first psychedelic celebration of \"flower power\" in 1967.\"That was it. This is what my life's going to be like,\" he remembers thinking at his first event in 1988. \"Everything was built around the rave for two years.\" Is a repeat really possible? Much of modern Britain chimes with that period -- financial toil, unemployment, the closure of clubs and a decade of Conservative rule -- but much is different, too, and the grandees of that long summer are skeptical it can ever truly be repeated. Still, they agree with today's DJs, party-goers and disapproving authorities that a fresh wave of rave is around the corner -- and the pandemic is only likely to make it louder. \"I've had the busiest year that I've had, and that's all been destroyed by the Covid-19 situation,\" says Gordon. \"Things will get lifted and there is going to be a big resurgence of rave. It's on the cards, 100%.\"History doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes,\" adds Watson. \"Something's happening, similar to what there was 30 years ago. I can't put my finger on it.\"'A strange new cult'Sunil Pawar was 15 when he went to his first illegal rave, just as the culture was bubbling in late 1980s Britain. \"I was controlling the laser gun up in a massive abandoned warehouse in East London,\" he recalls. \"The DJ cut the music and dropped 'Everybody loves the Sunshine' by Roy Ayers, and the place went wild. Next thing I knew, I was outside in the cold being bundled into the back of a car, covered in blood.\"I'd fallen from the lighting scaffold a few flights up and must have blacked out. I couldn't go to casualty because they would ask too many questions, so the promoters took me home and dumped me in the house,\" he laughs.Pawar's brutal introduction to rave culture didn't dampen his enthusiasm, and he wasn't alone. Ravers arrive at a free party during the Second Summer of Love.Every weekend thousands of partiers of all classes and backgrounds would fly under the radar of local authorities, gathering at service stations off British motorways to hear the details of that night's party. Some would be told about the events on pirate radio stations; others would pick up cryptic fliers in record stores or bars.\"It really did seem like a strange religious cult, a frenzy, that had taken over the younger generation -- everything about it felt new and deranging, from the acid house and techno music to the clothes to the crazed dancing,\" says music writer Simon Reynolds, who compiled a history of the period in 1999 named \"Generation Ecstasy.\"\"The whole yuppie scene was destroyed,\" adds Watson. \"Being a skinhead I was always a rebel, but rave turned everyone into that ... people left their BMWs on the side of the motorway. Ex-football hooligans teamed up with lords.\"People would just find warehouses or a plot of land and call it on,\" remembers Bryan Gee, who frequented plenty and now promotes legal club nights and DJs at illegal raves in Britain. \"At 2, 3 in the morning we're all on the motorway, waiting for the next pager to tell you what junction off the M1 to take.\"You'd look at someone at the petrol station and you could tell just by the clothes they're wearing that they were going to the same place as you,\" he says. \"You'd hear rumors that the police have found it -- sometimes the police did find it, and it would get busted before it happens.\"Then at 4 or 5 o'clock, you finally end up at some farm in the West Country.\"Today's illegal ravers aren't sent on the same wild goose chases -- but the events are just as secretive, organized under the cover of private WhatsApp and Snapchat groups, with locations revealed just as the party begins.The dancefloor at Manchester's legendary Hacienda club, which was important in the growth of acid house and rave culture, in 1989.And the events are ticking up in popularity in a way established DJs haven't seen for three decades.\"It can be crazy. Three, four, five thousand people,\" says Gordon of the underground events she plays. \"There's a really big network of sound system crews in the UK -- every weekend there's probably 20 or more parties up and down the country.\"Authorities have fresh concerns about the new wave, much of them revolved around the changing nature of drug use. \"The drugs are very different,\" notes music journalist Chal Ravens.And the safety concerns that surrounded the first period of rave have hardly dissipated. \"I went to an illegal rave about a year ago and it was just so dangerous,\" says Gee. \"I was in this old warehouse, high floors, it was just a complete drop out the windows.\" But the release of the underground scene continues to draw many back. \"There's the sense of freedom from the rules and regulations of being in a club environment,\" says Gordon. \"The sensible side of me made me think, this is not safe,\" adds Gee of his most recent visit. \"But the kid inside me loved it.\"Raving in a pandemicDespite a devastating pandemic, the parties haven't stopped entirely. \"Even during lockdown I've heard stories of a lot of illegal raves going on. I don't think the pandemic can even really grind it completely to a halt,\" says Gordon.But the lockdown raves aren't being run by established promoters, which have totally halted throwing events as the pandemic hit the UK and forced the closure of all places for people to gather in groups. And the raves are causing concern among authorities, both in terms of safety and public health. \"In an unlicensed event like the ones we saw last weekend, on some occasions, emergency services workers struggled to get to people who were in need because of the sheer number of people who were in attendance and the non-existent planning around crowd management and safety,\" said  Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Nick Bailey.One group, organizing an illegal rave in Sheffield this weekend, started dropping clues to its followers on Snapchat on Thursday. \"Hope everyone's still ready for a mad weekend,\" they wrote in an update seen by CNN, before advertising a \"Lockdown Rave\" on Saturday for which a location will be revealed on the day.As the plans picked up coverage in local media, the group gleefully shared screenshots of news articles and police warnings, reassuring followers: \"This is 100% still on.\" Meanwhile, several new police warnings were issued about similar events. Authorities in Manchester even publicized body-cam footage from their response to raves last week, in an effort to deter partygoers.\"What is new here is the nature of the pent-up energy that is being released,\" says Reynolds. \"It must have something to do with the lockdown -- people desperate for the feeling of being in large social gatherings.\"To be young at this point in time, it must feel like a pause button has been pressed down hard on your life,\" he adds. \"So the counter-reaction is this explosion of recklessness.\" The pandemic not only caused the shuttering of clubs and bars, but also wiped out the entire summer calendar of festivals and music concerts, which are such a staple of British youth culture. These events have little in common with the raves seen in the late 80s, note those who attended the first time around, and are shunned by promoters for their shoddy organization and public health implications.\"I want to go back to a rave as soon as possible, it's what I love, it's how I earn my living,\" says Gee. \"But it's a very dangerous time to be doing that.\"But they're attracting daily attention in the pages of British newspapers nonetheless -- and some worry they could tarnish the entire industry. \"It's a bad look on the rave scene,\" says Gordon.'Party at the end of the world'If the lockdown parties prove anything, it's that nothing can stamp out rave in Britain -- and with or without the pandemic, today's societal conditions may be driving it.\"We're going to come straight into a recession now, and there is no youth culture without a recession,\" says Watson. \"Skinheads, punks, bikers, they've never come out of prosperous times. So that's why I think, with the lockdown and the need to get out there ... let's see how this manifests itself. Because I know something's going on.\"Like many, Gordon pins the resurgence of rave on \"the complete and utter gentrification\" of British cities, which is seeing traditional pubs and clubs close at a rapid rate. The number of nightclubs in Britain fell by a fifth in 2018 alone, according to the International Music Summit's annual industry report. What does music look like?\"There just aren't really clubs in the middle of town that you would go to anymore,\" adds Ravens. \"There are lots of boxes to tick to run a night, and it costs money. I don't know anybody who is a club promoter who is making huge margins ... (but) if you can avoid paying for the building, you might stand a chance.\"\"It leaves the youth nowhere else to turn but to go back to the warehouses, barns and fields and party,\" says Gordon.Raves of the 1980s are also frequently remembered alongside the last years of Margaret Thatcher's rule, and the outpouring of youth rebellion it spurred. Those undertones are reverberating again through the UK's free parties.\"I speak to 20, 30 year olds (today), it's the same really,\" says Pawar, who has recently curated an art show displaying images and stories of the Second Summer of Love. \"You're disenfranchised, you haven't got a voice.\"I was pretty horrified by those raves in Manchester,\" Ravens says.  \"But if you're 18 now there's the feeling that there's no future ... it's not a very promising outlook for kids that age, and I'm not at all surprised that there might be a 'party at the end of the world' attitude.\"The UK government's much-criticized pandemic response may too have added fuel to the fire. \"It does very much seem like one rule for one, and one for the other, and I think people have had enough,\" says Gordon, referring to the Dominic Cummings scandal as she predicts a post-Covid resurgence of rave. A third Summer of Love?While politics was never their primary motivator, many older ravers remember the ferociousness with which the media and John Major's government targeted raves in the early 1990s. \"When the press got hold of it, they got a very negative aspect. It was all about the drugs,\" remembers Pawar. That concern culminated in a week-long free party at Castlemorton Common in central England in 1992, which sparked front-page coverage and a final legislative nail in rave's coffin.\"New age travelers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorized army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system,\" the frightened local Conservative MP recounted in the House of Commons after that event. \"However, they failed to bring latrines,\" he said. An aerial view of the massive illegal gathering at Castlemorton in 1992, which marked a major turning point for British rave.\"They just took over someone's land, and when they got hungry they started to cook the farmer's sheep,\" remembers Gee, who attended the party. \"I remember going there, then coming back to London, and going back for another day. You couldn't have that now.\"Responding to the outcry, Major passed a public order act that outlawed unlicensed raving and cracked down on music \"characterized by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.\"\"It is time for Beethoven to roll over if that is to be the definition of 'music,'\" was Lord Fraser of Carmyllie's withering judgment on acid house, as the bill passed Parliament's upper house and became law.\"No MP could ever side with the ravers,\" says Reynolds. \"Anything to do with drugs or large gatherings that disrupts the peace and quiet of high property value areas ... is something that normal middle England-type voters would very strongly oppose.\"Rave was never quite the same again. \"It came and went so fast,\" recalls Watson. \"It really felt fortunate to be a part of that revolution ... for a small window there, there was utter freedom.\"But desire for rave in Britain remains strong -- and those who have been waiting to rejoin the scene feel their time is coming again. \"The rave scene is really important,\" says Gordon. \"If we don't have this escape, I think there'll be a lot of hostility.\"\"There's loads of sound systems I know that are itching to go out, and they've been biding their time and waiting till that happens,\" she adds. \"I think it's getting close.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain is in the middle of a coronavirus disaster. It has one of the highest fatality rates in the world, with at least 52,000 Britons dead from the disease. The UK government's usual cheerleaders in the right-wing media are eviscerating it on a near-daily basis. But critics say that instead of tackling the crisis head-on -- perhaps with a reshuffle of his ministerial team; a shakeup of government policy; or the announcement of an inquiry -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson has engaged in a tactic of an altogether more Trumpian style. He has launched a culture war. The lead story in Britain's heavyweight Sunday Times newspaper last weekend was a leak of a plan to block measures that would have made it easier for trans people to change the gender on their birth certificate.As protests inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement swept across the UK, the Prime Minister condemned the violent removal of a statue of a slave owner, and portrayed the daubing of graffiti on a memorial to Winston Churchill an effort to \"photoshop the entire cultural landscape.\" An American policeman killed George Floyd. Now Europe is re-examining its colonial historyAnd while his government struggles in the face of the onslaught of Covid-19, Johnson announced the merger of two big government departments -- the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which oversees the UK government's foreign policy, and the Department for International Development (DFID), which runs aid policy. The purpose: To fulfil a policy aim favored by the conservative right that foreign aid should be tied to the UK national interest. Read MoreJohnson's government is sitting on a thumping 80-seat majority. It could do anything it wants. Yet experts say the Prime Minister -- a former journalist who is an instinctive campaigner -- appears to be indulging in what amounts to a re-election effort four years before the date of the next poll. The mystery is -- why? \"His reflex is to go back to newspaper commentary and to write columns on statues, to seed stories in the press about trans issues, because that's a way of mobilizing his own base and to throw a hornet's nest at his opponents,\" Robert Saunders, a British political history expert at Queen Mary University of London, told CNN.That base is considerably larger than it used to be, and includes many voters in areas that were formerly strongholds of the opposition Labour Party, like the former industrial towns of the English Midlands, Wales and northwest England. Many of those voters were drawn to Johnson by his straightforward electoral promise to \"get Brexit done.\"Johnson made a slew of announcements this week. That promise was fulfilled when Britain officially left the European Union at the end of March, and the debate switched from an ideological \"in or out\" battle to the practicalities of trade and fishing rights. With Brexit largely resolved in the minds of the electorate, the Conservatives might be seeking a new way to \"reinforce the impression that the Labour Party only stands for liberal, educated young people, and does not really have a sense of what is going on in middle England,\" said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.By stoking the divisions that emerged from Brexit, the Prime Minister's team \"are hoping to keep the flame of polarization alive by generating other issues that are likely to trigger the same adversarial feelings,\" he added.The polemicistInflaming the opinion of social conservatives is a skill set Johnson nurtured as a journalist. In the 90s, as the Daily Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, he made a name for himself with bombastic articles that portrayed the EU as a regulatory nightmare, according to British journalist Tom Baldwin in his book \"Ctrl Alt. Delete.\" From misleading stories about attempts to ban bendy bananas and introduce smaller condoms, Johnson's coverage, along with that of other rightwing newspapers, contributed to a growing euroskeptic British media environment.His stint as the pro-immigrant London mayor, between 2008-2016, made him a household name, but he downplayed that social liberalism as he took aim for 10 Downing Street. By the time the 2016 Brexit referendum came around, critics say Johnson's jingoism was on steroids. The former London mayor, by now a Conservative MP, energetically spearheaded a cynically populist and xenophobic leave campaign.  Johnson was a key figurehead in the Vote Leave campaign.Targets included the EU, Europeans living in the UK, and even US President Barack Obama -- at whom Johnson lashed out for opposing Britain's exit from the EU. In a column in the Sun newspaper, Johnson suggested that Obama removed a bust of wartime leader Winston Churchill from the Oval Office because of \"the part-Kenyan President's ancestral dislike of the British empire.\" Johnson's dog-whistling added to the straightforward narrative of an island nation under siege, an effective distraction from more prosaic concerns like access to the single market. \"A culture war is fundamentally about distraction,\" Saunders added. \"You're trying to distract your opponent from issues that you don't want to talk about and move them onto issues that you do.\"Pejorative language Johnson's campaign, of course, worked. Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU in June 2016. After being voted in last July as new Conservative leader and Prime Minister. His administration, accused of being stacked with yes-men, has however struggled to shake off its campaigning mindset.  Culture war issues are not just an instrumental technique \"to shore up the base and expand it,\" Bale added. \"Some people around Johnson literally believe this stuff and do think traditional British values are under threat from a 'cancel culture,' which they think is inimical to the traditions of this country.\"Johnson's rhetoric has come back to haunt him as Black Lives Matter protests in the UK have turned into a fuller discussion on racial injustice and structural racism in Britain. The Conservative party was in their crosshairs, with critics pointing out Johnson's habit of using racist language in his past columns, including his 2002 description of \"flag-waving piccaninnies,\" an offensive term used to describe black children. Johnson apologized for the comments in 2008. In 2018, he compared burqas to \"letterboxes,\" and the Muslim women who wore them as \"bank robbers.\"A statue of Winston Churchill outside Parliament was daubed with the words, \"was a racist,\" during a protest in June. The Prime Minister has struggled to address the concerns of protesters, flip-flopping between empathy and denial, while refusing to condemn US President Donald Trump for his response to the US protests. After stating \"Black Lives Matter\" in a statement published in the afro-Caribbean newspaper the Voice, Johnson issued a series of tweets against the removal of statues, saying protests had been hijacked by extremists after a statue of Churchill, of whom Johnson wrote a widely panned biography, was defaced with the words \"was a racist.\" He continued to equate the anti-racism protesters with violence, and declaim the sanctity of the now boarded-up Churchill statue, in a Telegraph column on Sunday. He reserved one paragraph to condemn the \"patently racist\" far-right groups, who clashed with police officers last Saturday as they targeted Black Lives Matter demonstrations.'The UK is just as bad as America'Johnson announced the launch of a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, which will also examine why white working-class boys fell behind in school. Downing Street policy chief Munira Mirza has reportedly been tasked with helping to set up it up.But in the last five years, there have been at least four reviews into structural racism in the UK -- which have included around 200 recommendations addressing deaths in custody, the criminal justice system, and the Windrush scandal. There's no need for another inquiry, say campaigners, especially one in which a leading role is played by Mirza, who wrote in a 2017 Spectator article that an \"anti-racism lobby\" was peddling a \"culture of grievance.\"The Prime Minister defended his aide in Parliament on Wednesday, saying he was a huge admirer of Mirza as she is \"brilliant thinker about these issues.\" Instead, critics say, the government would do well to enact the recommendations of those previous reviews. \"Implement them, that's what Boris has to do. And then the Black Lives Matter protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with coronavirus,\" said the author of one of those reports, opposition Labour MP David Lammy, who used a Financial Times article to accuse Johnson of starting a culture war as a distraction from the government's handling of racial inequality.Johnson said the new commission would learn \"very fast\" what changes needed to be made, according to PA news agency. Far-right groups came into London last weekend to protect mounments and target Black Lives Matter protesters. Encouraging majoritarian fearsAs the last four years have shown, minority groups have been easy targets in populist upheavals. Official statistics from the UK Home Office show that hate crime increased during and immediately after the EU referendum.Times journalist Rachel Sylvester reported in 2019 \"Number 10 has been polling 'culture war' issues, such as transgender rights, to see whether they can be weaponized against Labour in northern working-class constituencies.\"That came to fruition last week after J.K. Rowling published a lengthy blog post that linked her opposition to trans women using single-sex spaces to her past experience of domestic abuse. Later, the Sunday Times said the leaked plan included upcoming rules to stop single-sex female spaces like toilets from being used by \"those with male anatomy.\"Trans activists call J.K. Rowling essay 'devastating'The Minister for Women and Equalities, Liz Truss, told a select committee in April that by the summer she would be putting in place \"the protection of single-sex spaces, which is extremely important.\" While not commenting or disputing the Sunday Times article, a Number 10 spokesperson said it shared the position of the Government Equalities Office led by Truss. \"Johnson is a pound shop Trump, slightly more acceptable and less utterly crass,\" Christine Burns, a trans campaigner and author of \"Trans Britain: Our Journey from the Shadows,\" told CNN. \"Just as Brexit emboldened people to be racist,\" to roll back on transgender rights at such a febrile moment \"is not just emboldening people to be transphobic in their language, but also to use physical force,\" she warned.The axing of the Department for International Development (DFiD) demonstrated Downing Street's preference for ideology over capacity, according to David Hudson, Professor of Politics and Development at the University of Birmingham. \"It is somewhat astonishing that it has happened right now in a middle of a pandemic [when] the government and civil service are massively stretched,\" Hudson told CNN. The merger, criticized by three former Prime Ministers, would lead to less transparency on how aid is spent and risks diluting DFID's poverty alleviation agenda, he said. Johnson defended the move on Tuesday, saying: \"for too long, frankly, UK overseas aid has been treated as some giant cashpoint in the sky that arrives without any reference to UK interests or to the values that the UK.\"Boris Johnson desperately needs his lockdown gamble to pay offJohnson has also refused to countenance an extension to the Brexit transition period despite trade policy experts insisting that that Britain needs more time to negotiate a trade deal, especially in a pandemic. All this is happening as the government is struggling to convince the public that its strategy to handle the coronavirus outbreak has been \"world-beating,\" according to Johnson -- whose pledged track and trace system for June has been beset with problems. The UK's long-delayed attempt to build a homegrown coronavirus tracing app was abandoned on Thursday in favor of joining efforts led by Apple and Google.Will Johnson focus on governing rather than rule via press release as Britain's economy nosedives, the country faces \"appalling levels of unemployment, and probably further waves of the pandemic?\" Saunders asked.There are one of two routes the UK could go, he added. The public's \"patience for these stunts might diminish\" and Johnson focusses on \"talking about jobs, employment, and health policy,\" he said. \"Or the stunts are going to have to become nastier and more divisive to hold the public's attention.\"",

A portrait of Stalin was in his backdrop. \"You have the experience \u2014 you will have to kick us out from the monastery with police and national guard,\" he said. \"I have a casket, I have a cross, I have nails \u2014 I'm awaiting your decision.\"On Wednesday, pilgrims started flocking to the convent, local media reported, with an estimated 200 people attending services there, according to URA.RU outlet, which live-streamed the event.  Read MorePolice also entered the convent, but did not report any violations, according to a statement from the local branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  The new superior, appointed by the diocese to run the convent, has not yet been able to gain entry. In late April, Sergii was banned from preaching by the Orthodox church because of his controversial sermons in which he said coronavirus does not exist, \"cursed\" those who had closed churches due to the outbreak and urged Russians to disobey the patriarch's order not to gather during Orthodox Easter. The cleric was then isolated in a small monastery in Sverdlovsk but resurfaced in May, and stepped up his anti-coronavirus rhetoric in a series of videos posted online.In one of them, he said the authorities wanted to put Russians into a \"Satan's electronic camp,\" referring to tools like electronic passes used to enforce isolation in Russia. He also inferred that the masses will be controlled via \"deadly electronic chips\" and artificial intelligence under the pretext of vaccination.Local Orthodox leadership said his sermons \"do not reflect the views of the Yekaterinburg diocese,\" stripped him of the right to wear a cross and initiated proceedings in an ecclesiastical court to determine his future. Local police also launched an investigation after deeming that his sermons contained false information and instigated hatred.The Sredneuralsk convent covers a large tract of land with its own farm, school and cemetery, said Ilya Shumanov, Deputy director of Transparency International in Russia. He compared it to the Vatican and said it enjoys relative autonomy, which could allow the priest to occupy it indefinitely. Sergii is known for his ultra-conservative views and has made various controversial claims in the past. Last year, he suggested the Antichrist would soon emerge in Russia as a counterpart to President Vladimir Putin, and criticized laws against domestic violence. He also harshly criticized Yekaterinburg Orthodox leadership when it backed out of a project to build a cathedral due to massive backlash from the city's residents.Local media reported he spent time in prison in the 1990's for robbery and murder, a claim his supporters deny. Sergii is also hailed as the leader of the \"tsar worshippers\" sect, after legally changing his name to Nikolai Romanov in honor of the last tsar of Russia Nicolas II, who was murdered along with the royal family outside of Yekaterinburg in 1918.",

        "content": "(CNN)When two-time Olympic gold medal winner Christian Taylor watched the video of George Floyd's death, the first thought that went through his head was: \"That could've been me.\"Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25 after being arrested by a White police officer who forcibly pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. All four former officers involved in Floyd's killing are now facing charges.His death sparked widespread protests across the world in recent weeks.For Taylor, the thought that \"that could've been me\" made the incident even more impactful to the triple-jumper. \"That is the difficult situation because when you think of what he was doing or how he was going about it, then that is not very different to me going to a store,\" the 30-year-old told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an Instagram Live chat.Read More\"It was very scary because that was the first time I could really have this fear of how different are our lives and how quickly something can change or something can be taken away and what am I leaving behind.\"READ: Marcus Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistTaylor competes in the triple jump final during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.'I'm hoping'Floyd's death has resulted in Black Lives Matter protests calling for racial equality and an end to police brutality.Despite similar incidents in the past, Taylor insists he is \"hoping\" that permanent change will finally come from this. \"I want to believe that all those (past incidents) led to this moment and this was the last straw but I am also a realist and there have been catastrophic events that ultimately did not lead to change,\" Taylor explained.\"We are still here in 2020. At what point will it be enough to topple things over?\" Taylor jumps during the 2018 Prefontaine Classic.From LeBron James and Steph Curry to Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho, athletes from all areas of the sporting world have voiced their support for the protests.And instead of putting barriers between people, the unifying goal of equal rights has brought people together, according to Taylor.\"To see that protests are still going on, to see that athletes are still speaking up, to see that it has actually united races,\" the four-time world champion said.\"There is this wall that constantly gets put up between the races but I'm hoping and believing that it's bringing people closer because of just the informing and education standpoint that people just simply did not know. \"I had board members calling me saying: 'Christian, I had no idea this was your reality. But I will now stand up. I will now speak up.'\"And for me, that's been so encouraging because maybe this was someone who would've watched on the news and said: 'well, that's unfortunate' and gone on with their lives but for some reason, this seed has hit good soil. This seed has really started to get some roots and I can really say I'm standing on hope.\"READ: Florida will ban its 'Gator Bait' cheer due to the phrase's racist historyGold medallist Taylor poses on the podium during the medal ceremony for the Men's Triple Jump at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships.'It's irresponsible' As well as dealing with emotions from the death of Floyd, Taylor has also had to come to terms with his US teammate Christian Coleman's provisional suspension over a missed drugs test. On Wednesday, Coleman was provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) following a third missed drugs test.The independent body, which combats doping, announced that the reigning world 100m champion had been issued a charge in relation to a \"whereabouts failure.\"The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) \"whereabouts\" system requires athletes to let anti-doping officials know where they'll be for one hour every day, as well as details of overnight accommodation and training venues.If an athlete fails to do so and commits a \"filing failure\" three times over a 12-month period, they could face punishment. The American sprinter posted a lengthy statement on his Twitter page Tuesday admitting he missed a drug test on December 9, 2019 -- the third missed test in the space of a year -- but alleges he was set up by the anti-doping body, which did not contact him by phone. In a statement to CNN, the AIU said it would not comment on the specifics of an ongoing case but confirmed its officers are instructed not to phone ahead.Coleman is a two-time gold medal winner at the world championships.\"Any advanced notice of testing, in the form of a phone call or otherwise, provides an opportunity for athletes to engage in tampering or evasion or other improper conduct which can limit the efficacy of testing,\" the statement read.To be talking about athletes failing drug tests yet again is both \"disappointing\" and \"frustrating\" for Taylor.\"The significance of being a professional athlete and your professional responsibilities,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to belittle (Christian) but the reality is, as a professional athlete, you have to do certain things.\"It's very difficult to see athletes year after year, month after month, have whereabout filing issues. You can call it laziness but it's irresponsible. As a world record holder, you know that eyes will be on you.\"You're no longer the person down the street. You need to step into your job. You need to step into your role. If I was sitting in front of him, I'd tell him the same thing. 'Dude, grow up and accept whatever you have to deal with now.'\"Coleman said he had been Christmas shopping \"five minutes away\" but had no idea a tester had visited his address, for one of the tests.He also claims the AIU tester wrote an incorrect address on his unsuccessful attempt form, questioning whether the tester even came to the location.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"It doesn't matter if you're doing a charity run. There's no excuse valid for this,\" a frustrated Taylor outlined. \"After one, you should've woken up. After two, it should never happen. You got three strikers.\"So when is that light bulb going to go off? So I'm frustrated because I believe he's got great potential.\"Coleman's representatives did not respond to CNN when offered the right of reply.",

A police spokesman told CNN the man would approach people with terminal or late-stage illnesses.Three of his patients -- aged 14, 16 and 76 -- subsequently died. At least 45 people fell for the man's deception, police said. He was arrested in Athens on Tuesday under a warrant for homicide, fraud, counterfeiting and drug trafficking and was handed over to prosecutors.Read MoreFake doctor suspected of infecting at least 33 people with HIVPolice said they investigated the man for more than a year and discovered he was pretending to be a neurologist, a neurosurgeon and a physiotherapist, as well as a US-educated researcher into pediatric surgery and pediatric oncology at a major medical center in Switzerland.He also pretended to be a member of several well-known Greek families, an executive of the International Committee of the Red Cross, an air force pilot and part of a US investment fund.The man promised to treat people with serious illnesses and gave them \"substances of unknown origin and chemical composition, without medical indications,\" police said. Some of the substances contained cannabis, they added.He would accompany patients to medical facilities for examinations, or coordinate surgeries, and took large sums of money from them. In one case, he received at least \u20ac15,000 ($16,800), as well as more than \u20ac58,000 from the three patients who died, police said.They said the man had three accomplices, adding that they are investigating the possible involvement of more people.They confiscated two airguns, two knives, doctor ID stickers, notes on diet programs, herbs and CDs containing information on patient examinations.Police have appealed to anyone with information on the case to come forward.On Thursday, Giorgos Patoulis, president of the Athens Medical Association, called for closer monitoring of the authenticity of medical diplomas. Suspected fake doctor arrested after four deaths in GermanyThe heinous crime of the ruthless swindler who exploited the pain of patients and endangered human lives, even minors, is outrageous,\" he said.\"The Athens Medical Association services are working intensely to check the diplomas of the members of the Association, despite the fact that some foreign Universities do not co-operate.\"Patoulis called on patients to be vigilant and reject treatments that do not follow science.In November 2019, police in Germany arrested a 48-year-old woman accused of causing four deaths after faking her medical qualifications. She also allegedly caused eight long-term injuries while working as an assistant doctor at a hospital central Germany.And in February 2018, a fake doctor in northern India infected at least 33 people with HIV after allegedly using a tainted needle while treating them.",

        "content": "London (CNN)An investigation has been launched after video footage emerged Friday showing a Black man shouting \"I can't breathe\" while being arrested in Britain last year. Simeon Francis was arrested in July 2019 in the British seaside town of Torquay and later released. He died 10 months later while in police custody after he was arrested again in May 2020.His family provided CNN on Friday with a 19-minute video of last year's arrest, which shows Francis being handled by at least 10 police officers with several of them pinning him to the ground. He is heard shouting \"Get them off me, you racists!\" After around 13 minutes, still yelling, he is lifted by the officers and carried into a police van. Francis also tells officers he \"can't breathe,\" a plea that echoes the one made by George Floyd during his death in the United States in May, and which has become a slogan of demonstrators protesting against police brutality around the world.It is unclear if Francis needed medical attention, why he was being arrested, or what led up to the incident, Desmond Jaddoo, a community activist and representative for the family told CNN. Devon and Cornwall police have not responded to CNN's requests for comment citing an ongoing investigation.Read More3 recordings. 3 cries of 'I can't breathe.' 3 black men dead after interactions with policeThe family believes the video shows police used excessive force during the incident, Jaddoo said.\"This is nothing new in terms of the plight of black people. And clearly these disproportionalities that exist need to be challenged and need to be questioned,\" Jadoo said, \"And most importantly we need answers because a family is in mourning and that must never be forgotten.\"Francis was released after the July arrest, according to the family.   But 10 months later, in the early hours of May 20, Francis was arrested again in Torquay, by Devon and Cornwall police. Later that evening, police say, he was found unresponsive in a cell.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the UK's police watchdog, is investigating the case of Francis' death in police custody. A preliminary post-mortem examination did not identify a cause of death for Francis, the IOPC said in a statement.\"Further tests will be carried out,\" the statement adds. \"We are analyzing a considerable amount of CCTV footage from the custody suite. We are looking at the level of care provided during the period of detention, including the frequency and adequacy of checks carried out.\"The IOPC also confirmed receiving the video footage on Friday. \"We have received a referral after a complaint was made to Devon and Cornwall Police by the family of Simeon Francis relating to an earlier arrest. The referral is currently being assessed,\" the IOPC told CNN.UK police force referred to watchdog after man tased in front of childAt this point, the video of the July 2019 incident does not appear to be related to the circumstances of his death in May 2020.Neither Devon and Cornwall Police nor the IOPC have responded to questions from CNN about why Francis was arrested and detained on either May 20 or in July 2019. They have also not said whether any charges against him were issued. Devon and Cornwall Police cite the IOPC's ongoing investigation as the reason why they cannot comment but say they are fully cooperating with the watchdog.Police say that none of the officers have been disciplined or put on restrictive duty.\"Our thoughts and condolences remain with the family and friends of Mr Francis and we remain committed to a wholly appropriate, independent and thorough investigation into the events surrounding Mr Francis' death,\" reads a June 9 statement issued by Devon and Cornwall police.",

With all due respect, I live in the greatest country in the world but I think it's inappropriate.\"Arena says playing the national anthem at domestic sporting events is \"inappropriate\".Read More'I was in tears'\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" started as a poem, called \"The Defence of Fort McHenry.\" It was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 during the War of 1812. The stanzas recount the Battle of Baltimore, a days-long siege between British and American forces.The poem was set to a tune called \"The Anacreontic Song,\" which was composed in the late 1700s by a man named John Stafford Smith. The song was linked to the Anacreontic Society, which was an amateur musician's and singer's club named after the Greek poet Anacreon.\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" wasn't actually adopted as the official anthem of the US until 1931, though it was already popular and had already been used by several American institutions by then.\"As the national team coach at times with the national anthem I was in tears,\" said Arena, who is the New England Revolution coach, but coached the US national soccer team on two separate occasions.\"Honored to represent the United States at World Cups and international matches. And I think playing the national anthem is clearly appropriate at those levels.\"However, I question why we're playing national anthems at professional sporting events in our country.\"OriginsThe tradition of playing the \"Star Spangled Banner\" at sporting events dates back to 1918, when a live band played the song during the seventh inning of the first game of the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Boston Red Sox. The country was at war, and it had just been announced that baseball players would soon be drafted into the army.READ: How billionaire owners changed European footballIt has been said that the song unified and energized the somber crowd.This game took place in Chicago, but the Red Sox mirrored their opponents in playing the song in the sequential games.Before long, it was played at a number of sporting events and by the end of World War II, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden had ordered that the song would be played at every football game.Playing the national anthem at sporting events has been seen as an opportunity to celebrate the US's freedom and to honor the sacrifices of those who had protected it. KneelingColin Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the national anthem is not the first time there has been controversy surrounding the anthem at sporting events.In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager Arthur Ehlers bemoaned fans he believed were disrespecting the anthem by talking and laughing during the song.JUST WATCHEDTrump says Kaepernick should be given another chance ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump says Kaepernick should be given another chance  00:53Arena said he supports people's right to kneel.\"Today I understand why people are kneeling,\" he said. \"We saw it with the women, we saw it in the NFL and I think if they're respectful, it's appropriate.\"Speaking about his response to the Black Lives Matter movement, Arena added, \"As an American, and a white American, I'm embarrassed by the situation that in 2020 we have this kind of racism in our country.\"It's not an accident that some of these murders are happening.

It should be celebrated in its rightful context.\" But former England cricket captain Michael Vaughan posted a news story about the issues around the song on Instagram with the caption: \"Please tell me if I am wrong ... but this surely can't be right !!??\"READ: 'A slap in the face of history' -- Should a slave-era song be used as chant?Is it right for rugby fans to sing a slave-era song?The song \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.But for the last three decades, the familiar melody has also been the adopted anthem of England's rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays.And therein lies the problem.Cornell Brooks, President of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).In 2017, CNN Sport examined whether it's right that a slave-era song -- one which is believed to be a coded message for those slaves seeking the underground railroad to freedom -- is used to galvanize a national team to sporting glory.Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often White?\"A slap in the face to the history of slavery,\" Cornell William Brooks, then president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Brooks is now Hauser Professor of the Practice of Nonprofit Organizations and Professor of the Practice of Public Leadership and Social Justice at the Harvard Kennedy School.  Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out in 2017, said singing \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" to cheer a rugby team was a matter of \"ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance,' while American academics have called it cultural appropriation.Three years ago, when asked by CNN whether the RFU would be reviewing the use of \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,\" an spokesperson for English rugby's governing body said: \"Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades. It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.\"",

Notably, Olympic medal winners John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the podium at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City during the US national anthem.The gesture has been adopted many times since, and many have raised their fists during the Black Lives Matter protests in the aftermath of Floyd's death.Individual names on the back of players' jerseys were also again replaced with the words 'Black Lives Matter.'READ: Rashford, the gifted Manchester United star who became a remarkable activistManchester United striker Marcus Rashford takes a knee.Players applaud commemorating the victims of the Covid-19.Tottenham's new stadium usually boasts a cacophonous atmosphere, but with no fans allowed in Premier League games for the time being it seemed to take Jose Mourinho's side a while to get used to the empty stands.United started on top as man-of-the-moment Rashford was denied the opening goal by the feet of Hugo Lloris.It was then left to Bergwijn to open the scoring for Tottenham after a wonderful run from the 22-year-old, though United keeper David de Gea arguably was at fault for the goal.Chances were few and far between in the second half as players still looked to be kicking off the rust after a long period away from the action.It was the introduction of Paul Pogba from the substitute bench that gave United the boost it needed and the Frenchman's clever play resulted in his side being rewarded a penalty after Eric Dier's clumsy challenge.Fernandes made no mistake from the penalty spot as he continues his impressive start to his Old Trafford career.The visitors almost had the chance to clinch all three points but VAR rightly overturned another penalty that was awarded to United in the closing stages after Fernandes went down. Those were nervy moments for Dier given he was initially adjudged to have fouled Fernandes.Referee Jonathan Moss takes the ball from Marcus Rashford after wrongly awarding a penalty.Eyes on RashfordAll eyes had been on Rashford before the game after quite a week for the talented forward.Very few have used their platform with such success, utilizing his extra spare time to focus on trying to help in his community.His campaign on school meals saw him dominate the news agenda and ensure some of the poorest families in England would get extra support over the summer holidays.The Manchester-born star has also raised millions in donations alongside food charity FareShare, launched a poetry competition for deaf children and learned sign language.It's work that's caught the eye of Rashford's club boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who praised the talented youngster ahead of Friday's match.\"As his manager it's been fantastic to follow Marcus during the lockdown period,\" he told a virtual news conference Thursday.\"It's not just that he got the prime minister to change his mind but also what he's done over the last few months.\"He's changed the lives of so many kids this summer, which is more important than any game of football he'll probably have ever played, so hopefully he can keep both sides going as well as he's doing now.\"However, the forward failed to make a real impact in the match as United only really got going in the second half.There was a moment in the second half when Pogba's raking pass brilliantly picked out Rashford, but the United forward was unable to capitalize on the chance.In Friday's early game, Southampton brushed aside Norwich 3-0 at Carrow Road to leave the Canaries on the brink of relegation back into the second division.After a shaky start, Saints dominated much of the action and took advantage of some lackluster defending from its hosts.READ: UK government announces U-turn on free meals after Rashford's campaignJUST WATCHEDEnglish Premier League is back: Players make a standReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEnglish Premier League is back: Players make a stand 01:52Huge audiences The Premier League returned Wednesday after a 100-day hiatus and fans have clearly enjoyed their fix of football with broadcaster Sky Sports reporting near-record viewership figures.Manchester City's win over Arsenal attracted a peak audience of 3.4 million, a 94% increase on the season's average.Meanwhile, the opening game of the restart between Aston Villa and Sheffield United brought in a peak of 2.7 million people, a 43% increase on the average.

Players, coaching staff and officials all got down on one knee at the start of both matches on Wednesday as England's top-flight division returned from a 100-day hiatus. The powerful images paid tribute to the 'Black Lives Matter' movement which has grown in prominence since the death of George Floyd. \"I see it as a massive step for the Premier League to allow something like that to happen and it shows we're going in the right direction,\" said Sterling, who scored the opening goal in his side's 3-0 defeat of Arsenal. \"Little by little we're seeing change. It was natural, it was organic. We saw the teams do it in the earlier kick-off and thought it was something we had to do as well.\"Read MoreREAD: English Premier League returns after 100-day hiatus but not everyone is happyPlayers and the referee take a knee ahead of the Premier League match. Pep on racism The Premier League had previously confirmed players would not be punished for taking a knee before or during the games as it stood united against all forms of discrimination. Names on the back of players' jerseys were also replaced with the words 'Black Lives Matter' and a badge supporting the movement will be visible on every shirt for the remainder of the season. It's a message supported by City manager Pep Guardiola who said white people should apologize for the way \"we treated black people in the last 400 years.\"\"I feel ashamed for what we have done for black people around the world, not just America; the problem is everywhere,\" he told a post-match news conference. With soccer leagues resuming amid the pandemic, clubs and their players have been standing in solidarity with Black Lives Matter.Real Madrid's Marcelo took a knee and raised his first during a goal celebration this week whilst Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho revealed a 'Justice for George Floyd' t-shirt after scoring in the Bundesliga.

Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville recently apologized to Sterling for advice he gave the young forward when he was on international duty for England. Sterling had felt targeted at Euro 2016 and had asked then-coach Neville how he should deal with it. \"When I look back on that meeting now and the words I used, I feel like I let you down,\" Neville said in an interview on Sky Sports.\"I feel like my primary thought was about how other players had suffered abuse, whether it be Paul Gascoigne or David Beckham or Wayne Rooney, but I now recognize and feel like that was totally inappropriate. I failed to recognize the personal side.\"Those players were receiving abuse for football errors or football performances. You were receiving targeted abuse that was constant before a ball had been kicked at the tournament. \"I do feel like in that moment, the response that I gave you was inadequate, and I feel sorry for that.\"Sterling, who has since called for black people to be better represented in positions of authority in the game, remembered how he too struggled to understand the abuse he received. \"I came to you out of respect, but at the same time, you don't have the feeling or understanding of what it's like,\" he told Neville in the same Sky Sports interview. \"I was 21 and I think it was only my second tournament, so I didn't even really understand myself what was going on.\"Raheem Sterling scored the opening goal against Arsenal.Meanwhile, the current gesture of solidarity made by Premier League players has been widely supported on social media.Musa Okwonga, co-host of the Stadio podcast, says it isn't just a case of corporate gesturing from the Premier League but a real player-driven movement.\"The Premier League's #BlackLivesMattter campaign is not empty corporate messaging,\" he wrote on Twitter.\"It was driven forward by players, most notably Troy Deeney and Wes Morgan. Deeney is one of the smartest athletes I have ever interviewed on the historical roots of racism. This is player power.\"",

Paulo Dybala made his professional debut for Argentine club Instituto.\"I always wanted to be a football player, I always loved this sport a lot and the truth is -- and I'm sincere -- I never thought that I would get here, to a club as important as Juventus, to play for the national team of my country, to play with the best players in the history of football.\"I really enjoy what I'm experiencing every day, because it's something that is unthinkable for a person who comes from such a small town, where we are six thousand inhabitants, where dreams often seem unreachable.\"Today I am fulfilling almost all of them and surely with time goals are going to continue to arise, dreams, that I hope I can continue to fulfill, but I try to enjoy it as much as for my father as for me, as for all my family too.\"Adolfo was as much a friend to Dybala as he was a father.In 2008, when Dybala was just 14 years old, the whole family had to try and come to terms with Adolfo's sudden death following a short battle with cancer. Unsurprisingly, the loss of his confidant and biggest supporter affected Dybala's development as both a player and a person.While his own mental fortitude eventually allowed him to flourish, Dybala credits the support of his close-knit family for getting him through one of the toughest periods of his life.Paulo Dybala playing for Instituto against River Plate in 2012.\"I can't say what would have happened if he was still here,\" he says. \"Maybe all this would have still happened, maybe not, maybe I would have lived it differently. One never knows why [these things happen], but these are moments in life in which one grows or not -- or many times suffers.\"In my life, luckily, I was able to move forward -- although it was not easy to continue fighting for what I liked [football] -- more than anything to continue doing what made me happy, which is playing football, which is being with a ball, to share time with teammates, friends. That's what football gives me.\"It was a blow, a hard blow for the family, but from then on we started making decisions. I had to start maturing in a certain way a little faster because of the situation I was living and obviously I would have liked to share everything I've lived, everything I have learned and the places I have been, people that I have met with my father.\"But I know somehow he's always with me always. I always feel that when I play, when I am on a pitch, he is close to me and that is what makes me enjoy this beautiful sport even more.\"READ: Paulo Dybala: 'It is not only people of color that should be fighting racism. We all have to'READ: Juventus striker Paulo Dybala still COVID-19 positive after six weeks'La Joya'Though Dybala still keenly felt his father's absence, he would quickly establish himself as the most promising youngster in Instituto's academy.At the age of just 17, he made his professional debut for the club in Argentina's unforgiving second division. Such was his immediate impact, an Argentine journalist labeled him 'La Joya' -- The Jewel -- a nickname that still remains.In only his second match, he broke the 41-year-old record of legendary Argentina striker and World Cup winner Mario Kempes to become Instituto's youngest ever goalscorer.A babyfaced Paulo Dybala celebrates after scoring for Palermo in Serie A in 2012.After just one season, he made the leap to Europe with Italian club Palermo in a deal reportedly worth $14 million. Three successful seasons in Sicily followed -- the third of which was truly his breakout in Europe -- and convinced Juventus to part with upwards of $40 million for Dybala's signature.The last two years have seen the 26-year-old develop from a promising youngster into one of Europe's most exciting talents, with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain both trying to lure him away from Turin last summer.His recent ascent should perhaps come as no surprise; Dybala, after all, is one of very few players to have had the joy of playing alongside both Ronaldo and Messi.Dybala says he has a learned a lot from Ronaldo since the Portuguese star moved to Juventus in 2018, noticing in particular an improvement in his mentality.\"The truth is that you learn a lot because he is a player, in this case, who is a winner and that makes you a winner,\" Dybala says. \"He is a very professional player, needless to say. Everyone knows that already.\"How he has managed to make his career, how he has managed to win his trophies, his accolades, everything he has earned through sacrifice, training. So one always feels admiration and tries to learn from the things he has.Paulo Dybala says he has learned a lot since Ronaldo moved to Juventus.\"I always say that each player has better things than others, so one always tries to pinch off the best that each one has, to learn and grow and from Cristiano there is a lot to learn.\"Since making his Argentina debut in 2015 -- widely thought to be a somewhat belated call-up -- Dybala has shared the international stage with compatriot Lionel Messi.Dybala is arguably better placed than anyone to answer the eternal debate: Messi or Juventus teammate Ronaldo?When asked, Dybala smiles and answers diplomatically.\"I see a big difference, but I try not to compare them,\" Dybala says. \"I think I rather try to enjoy them and I just learn from both of them. They are incredible players, the best in history, that everyone will remember forever and I have the opportunity to speak with both of them, to learn from the two, to share pitch with the two.\"Leo is also an incredible player who plays in such a natural way that many times people think that what he's doing is easy and the truth is that it's impossible how he moves, how jumps past players, how he dribbles past players so easily, the truth is that is incredible.Paulo Dybala and Lionel Messi have been Argentina teammates since 2015.\"Over time, he has been perfecting that way of playing, of working. He is a very professional player, too, which often does not get talked about it, but in training sessions he is amazing. The truth is, well, working with these two monsters is very nice.\"READ: 'Back To Reality' -- European football prepares for age of austerityREAD: Manuel Neuer reveals what it's like to play in football's 'ghost games'Overcoming coronavirusBack in March, when the coronavirus pandemic first began to take an unrelenting grip on Italy and Europe, Dybala was one of the first high-profile sportsmen to test positive for Covid-19.It was at home one evening when he first noticed something was wrong.

The symptoms, in general, I felt at night when I was going to sleep or when I was lying down. \"I always tried to remain calm, to give my family tranquility as well because I didn't want to worry them, since they were far away.\"For almost two months, his fight with the virus was played out in the media amid reports he had tested positive four times, leading many people to assume that he had become reinfected. Dybala says it was difficult reading certain inaccurate stories on his health, in particular when they would cause his family to frantically phone him from Argentina.His girlfriend, Argentine actress and singer Oriana Sabatini, also contracted the coronavirus but Dybala says the couple stayed calm, more for their families' sake than their own.\"I just had to try to reassure my family, since they were already far away,\" he says. \"So both me and my girlfriend tried not to worry.

Their only concern was ensuring all of the club's employees continued to receive their salaries throughout the crisis.Football's returnJuventus' Coppa Italia semifinal against AC Milan on Friday was the first time elite football had been played in the country since authorities postponed the season back in March. While there has been some talk about letting fans back into stadiums, for now all matches will continue to be played behind closed doors. Wednesday's final, which Juventus lost to Napoli on penalties, saw banners in each of the clubs' colors draped over the seats at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.It's been called the \"new normal\" by many, but Dybala says it's something he could never get used to. He finds the completely empty stands particularly hard to accept when, in his eyes, much of Italian society has returned to normal.Paulo Dybala has questioned why some fans aren't allowed back into stadiums.\"It's weird finding yourself playing a game without fans,\" Dybala says. \"But it's also weird that when I go down the street I see bars or restaurants full of people, with people outside, without [distancing] measures -- then it seems strange to me that certain things are enabled and other not. \"Because what is the difference between a disco full of people, to a stadium takes its [distancing] measures so that a certain number of people can go? I know that it's difficult for that to happen, but for many things sometimes people just have to make the decision. \"I spend every day in the city center, going to train or going to certain places, and the truth is that I see many people like that, to some extent they have already forgotten about the coronavirus and it's as though nothing has happened anymore. \"I think that many rules are being violated and the truth is that in football, without people it is sad. Without the public, without our fans, playing football is boring, because I think they are part of the atmosphere of this, which is the most important thing in football.\"Dybala hopes that by the time the Champions League returns -- confirmed by UEFA to be in August -- restrictions on fans will have been eased slightly. After all, Juventus will need all the help it can get to overturn the 1-0 first-leg defeat to Lyon.However, the club's focus is now on securing a ninth consecutive top-flight title. After months of health problems, Dybala is finally fighting fit and ready to lead Juventus through the remaining 12 league matches -- thanks in part to his new \"training partner,\" puppy Kaia.Dybala and Sabatini adopted the Shiba Inu at the start of lockdown but after only four days she, too, developed health problems.\"One day she was bitten by a bug in our garden and we had to take her to the vet,\" Dybala recalls. \"For a day she scared us a little because she wasn't very well, she was vomiting. \"Luckily she's fine now and getting huge. She's very big and we're happy to now see her growing,\" he adds with a proud smile, as though talking about a child.

Previously named as Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, the former Chechen fighter had been on his way to midday prayers.A Russian national was arrested within hours over the killing, setting off a murder mystery that has gripped Germany.While the Kremlin has denied any connection between the murder and the Russian state, the shooting triggered an investigation which also raised uncomfortable questions about the relationship between the two countries.Germany expels two Russian diplomats over murder of ex-Chechen fighter in Berlin Germany's federal prosecutor took over the investigation in December.

        "content": "London (CNN)French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to London on Thursday to mark the anniversary of a historic World War Two speech with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the first major face-to-face meeting between two European leaders since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Due to the social distancing measures in place, Macron, a man known for his firm grip and tactile nature, was unable to shake hands with any of those he met, including the Prime Minister, Prince Charles, or his wife Camilla. This led to scenes of dignitaries bowing at one another from a distance, unusual for such an event as the visit of a foreign leader.  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall greet  Emmanuel Macron at Clarence House.Their official reason for meeting was to mark the 80th anniversary of Charles de Gaulle's broadcast from London to an occupied France during the Second World War. The BBC radio address, known as L'Appel, was a key moment in the French resistance to Nazi occupation.\"The British monarchy became the refuge of the French Republic\" when de Gaulle was exiled from France, and he was treated as \"the legitimate Minister of France, the real ambassador of French values\" by Winston Churchill, Macron said Thursday. Nodding to the impact of de Gaulle's address, Macron said the UK had given France \"its first weapon: a BBC microphone.\"Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Macron at a statue for de Gaulle in London.Read MoreMacron marked the anniversary by awarding the Legion d'Honneur, France's highest order of merit, to the city of London for providing refuge to de Gaulle during the war. Prince Charles accepted the honor in the name of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, and on behalf of London.The French President was not subjected to the UK's 14-day quarantine for people traveling into the country, due to the rules allowing for diplomatic exemption. During a meeting in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street, the two leaders discussed the pandemic and a number of other ongoing situations, a spokeperson for Johnson said.\"On UK-EU negotiations, the Prime Minister welcomed the agreement to intensify talks in July and underlined that the UK does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn,\" the spokeperson said. On Libya, the two leaders \"agreed on the need for a UN-led political process which brings together all parties to end the conflict.\"Johnson and Macron also \"agreed to continue to work closely on other international issues, including the proposed Chinese national security law in Hong Kong which would be a breach of the Joint Declaration, and to bring about a two state solution in the Middle East Peace Process,\" the spokesperson added. French and British jets fly over Paris on Thursday. Following their meeting, Macron and Johnson viewed artifacts from de Gaulle's time in London, including gifts that he gave to Winston Churchill and Lady Churchill to thank them for their support in 1940. The leaders then watched a flyover of French and British planes, hours after British jets flew over Paris to mark the anniversary.",

        "content": "(CNN)British singer Vera Lynn, whose sentimental ballads during World War II provided the soundtrack for the Allied war effort, has died at the age of 103, according to a statement from the Dame Vera Lynn Children's Charity on Thursday.Lynn, who lived in Ditchling, East Sussex, England, died Thursday morning \"surrounded by her close family,\" the statement posted on the charity's website said.Lynn's two most famous songs, \"We'll Meet Again,\" released in 1939 at the start of the war and \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" recorded in 1942, created a patriotic image of a courageous and phlegmatic Britain that resonates with people in the UK even today. She was also the first English singer to make it to number one in the American music charts. Her daughter, Virginia Lewis-Jones, said in the statement: \"My mother first became involved in raising awareness of cerebral palsy in the 50s when there was very little understanding of the condition and children who suffered from motor learning difficulties were often referred to rather pejoratively as 'spastic.'Vera Lynn Skypes with students from her former east London school, Brampton Primary, on her 100th birthday. \"Along with celebrity chums including David Jacobs and Wilfred Pickles, she set out to change people's attitudes towards the disability and help children reach their full potential. There was no one else raising funds to help at that time, so it was groundbreaking work.Read More\"Although my mother was closely associated with other charities, not least those supporting veterans, the Dame Vera Lynn Children's Charity always held a very special place in her heart -- the children loved her as much as she loved them and I'm extremely proud of what it has achieved and the difference it has made to so many families' lives.\"Britain's PA Media news agency also reports her family confirmed her death in a statement. The family said they were \"deeply saddened to announce the passing of one of Britain's best-loved entertainers.\"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to Lynn in a tweet: \"Dame Vera Lynn's charm and magical voice entranced and uplifted our country in some of our darkest hours. Her voice will live on to lift the hearts of generations to come.\"Female code breakers: The hidden figures of the greatest generationCaptain Tom Moore, the 100-year-old war veteran who raised millions for the UK's National Health Service, also paid tribute to Lynn, calling her death \"a real shame\" in a message posted on Twitter. During World War II, Moore fought in Myanmar, then known as Burma, where Lynn visited to perform for the troops.\"I really thought Vera Lynn would live longer she's been speaking so well on TV recently. She had a huge impact on me in Burma and remained important to me throughout my life,\" he said.In 2009, Lynn became the oldest artist to have a number one album in England with \"We'll Meet Again: The Very Best of Vera Lynn.\" Moore recently became the oldest artist to have a number one single in the UK charts with his rendition of \"You''ll Never Walk Alone,\" which was released a week before his 100th birthday.In 2017, Lynn became the oldest artist to have an album in the top ten on the British charts with \"100,\" which was released in honor of her 100th birthday. To celebrate that milestone birthday, her image was projected onto the White Cliffs of Dover on March 20, 2017.Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins, who performed a virtual duet with Lynn for the VE Day anniversary last month, said in a tweet: \"I simply cannot find the words to explain just how much I adored this wonderful lady.\"During her coronavirus address to the nation on April 5, Queen Elizabeth quoted Lynn's famous wartime song, saying the UK should take comfort in the fact \"better days will return, we will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again.\"Forces' sweetheartVera Margaret Welch was born in 1917 to a working class family in East Ham, now a London suburb. She began her career singing in working men's clubs at the age of just seven. She took her grandmother's maiden name -- Lynn -- as a stage name at the age of 11. She left school when she was 14 and was spotted by a booking agent who arranged work for her at parties and events. She later started performing on the radio and released her first solo recording \"Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire\" in 1936.Lynn, pictured in 1964, was the first English artist to hit number one on the US record charts in 1952.In November 1941, Lynn was given her own radio show on the BBC, \"Sincerely Yours, Vera Lynn.\" She later appeared in the film \"We'll Meet Again,\" in which she portrayed a character based on herself.The \"Forces' Sweetheart\" spent the spring and summer of 1944 performing for troops stationed in Egypt, India, and Burma (Myanmar).The Royal British Legion said in a tweet on Thursday that Lynn was an \"unforgettable British icon\" and a \"symbol of hope\" for the armed forces. Roll up for a time machine ride to 1952 LondonOnce the war ended, Lynn toured Europe and continued to broadcast her radio program. When Decca Records released her next hit, \"Auf Wiederseh'n Sweetheart\" in the United States in 1952, Lynn became the first English artist to hit number one on the American record charts.Ill health dogged her later years. She developed emphysema in the latter part of the 1960s and performed less frequently. So rooted is she in the collective English psyche that the rock band Pink Floyd wrote a song about her called \"Vera\" on their seminal 1979 album \"The Wall.\"In 1941, Lynn married a musician named Harry Lewis and the couple had one daughter together, Virginia Penelope Anne Lewis. Lynn's husband passed away in 1998.Lynn received many honors in her lifetime. She was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1969 and was made a Dame in the Queen's 1975 birthday honors because of her contribution to charity. In 2001, the Dame Vera Lynn Children's Charity was created to help children with cerebral palsy and other motor learning impairments.This breaking story has been updated with additional reporting.",

All of  the league's remaining 92 fixtures will be held behind closed doors.However, a recent YouGov survey found that 48% of adults thought the Premier League was returning too soon as the UK emerges tentatively from lockdown. The restart comes at a point when some regions, such as the northwest of England, have been identified as potential hotspots for the virus with infection rates decreasing more slowly.

Liverpool's mayor Joe Anderson had initially opposed the idea but has recently stated his support of games being held in the city. The two rivals have united in encouraging fans to stay at home but lifelong Liverpool supporter and season-ticket holder John Cooper says authorities need not worry. \"People underestimate football supporters in general,\" Cooper told CNN Sport. \"Overall I think people have the impression that supporters are thick but I think you'll see a lot of common sense when the games do start.\" READ: Real Madrid's Marcelo shows support for Black Lives Matter movementLiverpool can win the Premier League on Sunday if results go its way.

However, they don't all agree on whether now is the right time to return and say lessons should be learned from Liverpool's Champions League match against Atletico Madrid which was controversially played on March 9.Professor Tim Spector, from King's College London, has said the region saw a spike in cases after the game was played in front of a packed Anfield stadium, weeks before lockdown was implemented. The UK currently has 298,136 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 41,969 deaths, according to the latest figures.\"I think it's too soon for them to bring football back. They were too late bringing in the lockdown,\" said lifelong Reds fan Terry Maher.\"The Atletico [Madrid] game was the big one. They should never have played the game.

Campbell has been a vocal critic of the way the current British government has handled the pandemic.He points toward the successful return of the German Bundesliga as a reason to be hopeful.\"I think Germany has shown it can be done and talking to people I know in football it seems that the football world is very well catered for in terms of testing and protocols,\" Campbell, who is a Burnley fan, told CNN Sport.\"I think the risk to the general public is negligible and the need to get football back is strong.\"READ: Lionel Messi milestone in first game back for BarcelonaFears are that fans will gather outside stadiums, especially if Liverpool win the league. Financial implications The return of football is not purely in aid of national morale, there is an undeniable financial aspect.A recent report by financial services firm Deloitte says the Premier League could face a loss of over $1 billion, due in part to losses in broadcast deals and matchday revenue.\"Football returning -- in a safe and sensible way -- is clearly important to limiting the financial impact that the pandemic has had,\" said  Dan Jones, head of the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. \"Much remains uncertain, particularly around the timing and scale of the return of fans to stadiums and the impact on commercial and broadcast partners' wider businesses.\"JUST WATCHEDLa Liga returns to action after long breakReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLa Liga returns to action after long break 02:49Safety guidelines Much like the Bundesliga, Premier League teams will have to adhere to strict guidelines that outline who is able to enter the stadium on game day. The stadiums will be split into red, amber and green zones with only 300 people permitted to enter and all encouraged to obey social distancing rules. Only 110 people will be permitted pitchside with everyone having to have returned a negative coronavirus test within the previous five days. Match balls, corner flags and goalposts will be deep cleaned during the game but substitutes and coaching staff will not be required to wear protective masks in the reconfigured technical areas.Teams will also arrive separately at the stadium and enter onto the pitch at staggered times in order to minimize the risk of infection.  Players have been asked not to spit or clean their noses on the pitch and urged not to surround match officials during the game. Due to the congested fixture list from now until the end of the season, games will be stopped for a drinks break midway through each half with each team allowed a maximum of five substitutes -- up from the usual three. Clubs have also been encouraged to not stay in local hotels the night before the game and have instead been asked to fly to matches where possible.

        "content": "(CNN)William Faulkner's famous line, \"the past is never dead. It's not even past,\" is back in vogue. It's not just about debate in the US about removing Confederate statues, or in the UK over monuments to imperialists -- the war over World War II is back in play, too. On Thursday, the US magazine National Interest published an essay by Russian President Vladimir Putin, about the legacy of the war in Europe that ended just over 75 years ago.Putin begins the essay with a personal note: Like millions of citizens of the former Soviet Union, his family's life was touched directly by the war. \"For my parents, the war meant the terrible ordeals of the Siege of Leningrad where my two-year-old brother Vitya died,\" he writes. \"It was the place where my mother miraculously managed to survive. My father, despite being exempt from active duty, volunteered to defend his hometown. He made the same decision as millions of Soviet citizens. He fought at the Nevsky Pyatachok bridgehead and was severely wounded.\"But Putin's reading of wartime history has a very deliberate message for today. Read MoreFirst, there's the timing. Putin had originally planned a major celebration to mark Victory Day on May 9, the day that Russia observes the end of the Second World War in Europe, inviting world leaders to join him for an extravagant parade in Red Square. Victory Day was meant to signal that Russia had reclaimed its place as a historic liberator, after years of harsh sanctions that followed the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014. It also would have followed a carefully scripted domestic political moment for the Kremlin: a national vote on constitutional amendments that would have paved the way for Putin to stay in power until 2036.The coronavirus pandemic put paid those plans. The Kremlin rescheduled the parade, after World War II veterans raised concerns about the health risks of holding an event that would draw massive crowds in Moscow and other cities. The parade is now slated to go ahead next week.Cynics might say that surviving veterans of World War II -- who hold a position of great veneration in Russian society -- provided convenient cover to the Kremlin. But the historical ruminations of Putin point to a larger campaign by Russia to reclaim some moral high ground -- and to justify its recent foreign policy. For starters, there's Putin's description of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, a nonaggression pact between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. A secret annex in the treaty paved the way for a carve-up of Poland, which the Soviet Union invaded from the east just a few weeks after Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The existence of the secret protocol is not in dispute. But in his essay, Putin cast the treaty as a necessary defensive measure, a moral equivalent to the 1938 Munich Agreement between the UK, Germany, France and Italy that ceded Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland to Hitler's Germany. The agreement is now seen as a classic appeasement of an unrelenting expansionist power. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain famously described the Munich Agreement -- which Putin refers to as the \"Munich Betrayal\" -- as \"peace for our time.\" But the agreement failed, and Putin argues that Stalin was left with no other option than to strike its own deal with Germany. \"In these circumstances, the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact with Germany,\" he writes. \"It was practically the last among the European countries to do so.\"That doesn't mean Putin whitewashes the legacy of Stalin, whose mass arrests and purges claimed the lives of millions of Soviet citizens. \"Stalin and his entourage, indeed, deserve many legitimate accusations,\" Putin writes. \"We remember the crimes committed by the regime against its own people and the horror of mass repressions.\"However, he says, the pact was strategically appropriate. \"In other words, there are many things the Soviet leaders can be reproached for, but poor understanding of the nature of external threats is not one of them. They saw how attempts were made to leave the Soviet Union alone to deal with Germany and its allies. Bearing in mind this real threat, they sought to buy precious time needed to strengthen the country's defenses.\"His reading of history is likely to spark outrage in Poland and the Baltic states, which are now members of the European Union as well as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. For all of those countries, Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of separatists set a worrisome precedent: If Russia was willing to \"intervene\" on behalf of ethnic Russians in Crimea by sending its troops, would it do the same in the Baltics? Hitler scrapped his pact with Stalin in 1941, invading Poland and launching a war that cost the Soviet Union more than 25 million military and civilian lives. Western popular culture has at times overlooked that sacrifice, focusing on events such as the Normandy landings in 1944.But Putin's essay elevates the Soviet war in Europe to something higher: A crusade to save the world. And in doing so, he suggests that the darker wartime chapters are above criticism -- and by extension, so is Putin's Russia today.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russia has accused one of its leading Arctic researchers of treason, alleging that he gave sensitive information to China. This is the latest in a string of cases where high-profile Russian scientists have found themselves in a standoff with the security services over suspected foreign contacts.Investigators allege that Valery Mitko, President of Arctic Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, gave a document containing state secrets to Chinese intelligence in early 2018 at China's Dalian Maritime University, where he was a visiting professor, his lawyer Ivan Pavlov told CNN. According to Pavlov, the document in question dealt with hydroacoustics,the study of sound in water commonly applied in underwater navigation, communications and monitoring submarine activity, among other things. Mitko, 78, denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer maintains that all information the scientist brought from Russia to China for his lectures was openly available. The press service of the Federal Security Service did not respond to a request for comment. Mitko was charged with state treason and put under house arrest in February this year but the details of his case have only emerged now, after Pavlov's defense team Komanda29, which specializes in state security and espionage cases, picked it up in order to draw public attention.Read MoreWatchers of Russia-China relations believe the spying allegations against an Arctic researcher could highlight a burgeoning competition between the two countries in the region. Moscow and Beijing have built a strategic partnership in the Arctic amid rising tensions with the West, but Russia has been careful about any military cooperation in that area, said Alexander Gabuev, chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program of the Carnegie Moscow Center.\"China really shows that it has military ambition by the way its intelligence are looking into these things,\" Gabuev said. \"Subs operate in neutral waters and we are probably seeing a new front of Chinese global navy development. And subs that could operate in the Arctic are part of that.\"Several Russian academics have been accused or convicted of passing state secrets to foreign governments in recent years. In 2018, a Moscow court charged Viktor Kudryavtsev, an aerospace engineer, with treason for allegedly sharing a report that contained information about Russian hypersonic weapons with a Belgian institute following a joint research program, state-run agency TASS reported.Kudryavtsev, who is in his late 70s, spent over a year in a detention center but was moved to house arrest due to frail health. His case is still in pre-trial investigation. Two other employees of the same institute where Kudryavtsev worked have since been arrested on state treason charges, according to state-run news agency TASS. Another space researcher, 79-year-old Vladimir Lapygin, was released from prison last week on early parole, following a 2016 conviction for passing on technical details about Russian spacecraft to China, according to TASS.All of the scientists have denied wrongdoing, saying that the information they are accused of sharing was not classified. Pavlov, the lawyer, has suggested that the cases are the products of paranoia within the Russian special services. Court statistics show that the total number of state security-related cases skyrocketed after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, which bred \"militaristic sentiments\" within law enforcement, he says. According to the data published by Russia's Supreme Court, from 2009 to 2013 a total of 25 people were convicted on state treason charges, and in 2014 alone there were 15 convictions. Between 2014 and 2019, 51 people were convicted of state treason.  \"There is a risk group of people who possess some sensitive information or gather such information, and first and foremost these are scientists but could be journalists or civil activists, too,\" the lawyer adds. \"[The special services] monitor who has international ties and foreign contacts, so a little red light blinks once they go abroad... and the mentality of our agents says if a scientist goes abroad, he of course goes there to sell secrets.\"Since China proclaimed itself \"a near-Arctic state,\" it has significantly stepped up efforts to increase its presence there, often with Russia's help and bypassing other coastal states that are allied with the US and NATO. Russia, on the other hand, has made a priority of revamping its regions within the Arctic circle, which were largely abandoned after the collapse of the USSR. In March, President Vladimir Putin unveiled an ambitious Arctic 2035 plan in hopes to bring jobs back into the region, by developing huge energy projects that China heavily invested in, and Russia is looking to export oil and gas as the Northern Sea Route becomes increasingly free of ice.",

Jennifer Garner explains taking her cat for a walk in a stroller The story of the pair's unlikely bond and Bowen's life inspired Bowen's first book, \"A Street Cat Named Bob,\" along with several other sequels -- \"The World According to Bob,\" \"A Gift from Bob\" and \"The Little Book of Bob.\"The books sold eight million copies, according to publisher Hodder & Stoughton, with sales of the novels totaling \u00a38.18 million ($10.3 million). The story also served as the basis for a 2016 film -- starring Bob as himself. Read More\"Bob saved my life. It's as simple as that. He gave me so much more than companionship. With him at my side, I found a direction and purpose that I'd been missing,\" Bowen said in a statement released by Hodder & Stoughton, which confirmed Bob's death at \"at least 14 years.\"\"The success we achieved together through our books and films was miraculous. He's met thousands of people, touched millions of lives. There's never been a cat like him. And never will again,\" he said.

        "content": "(CNN)Members of the ancient Irish elite practiced first-degree incest, archaeologists and geneticists analyzing genetic material from a series of Neolithic tombs have discovered. Researchers found evidence of inbreeding in the genome of a man buried at Newgrange passage tomb, which was built more than 5,000 years ago, a team from Trinity College Dublin said in a press release.This suggests the man belonged to a ruling elite that practiced first-degree incest -- for example, brother-sister unions -- in the same way as the pharaohs in ancient Egypt or Inca god-kings, the researchers said.Newgrange is famous for its solar alignment.\"I'd never seen anything like it,\" said lead author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist from Trinity College.\"We all inherit two copies of the genome, one from our mother and one from our father; well, this individual's copies were extremely similar, a tell-tale sign of close inbreeding. In fact, our analyses allowed us to confirm that his parents were first-degree relatives,\" she said.Read MoreThe full paper was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.The discovery was an \"unexpected finding\" and nobody had any idea about the practice in Neolithic Ireland, paper author Dan Bradley, professor of population genetics at Trinity, told CNN.\"We had no anticipation that it would be the case at Newgrange,\" he said.The man was part of a mysterious Neolithic society that built the Newgrange passage tomb in County Meath, eastern Ireland, which is known for the annual solar alignment that sees the sacred inner chamber illuminated by the winter solstice sunrise.First-degree incest is a near-universal taboo, with the only confirmed social acceptances recorded among elites such as deified royal families, according to the researchers.Newgrange: Ireland's amazing feat of Stone Age engineering The practice is used to distinguish the elite from the rest of the population, reinforcing hierarchy and legitimizing their power.It often combines with rituals and monumental architecture, such as the Newgrange passage tomb.\"The prestige of the burial makes this very likely a socially sanctioned union and speaks of a hierarchy so extreme that the only partners worthy of the elite were family members,\" Bradley said in the press release.The researchers also found genetic links between the man buried at Newgrange and other individuals buried in passage tombs such as Carrowmore and Carrowkeel in the west of the country.\"It seems what we have here is a powerful extended kin-group, who had access to elite burial sites in many regions of the island for at least half a millennium,\" Cassidy added.The findings also link to a local myth that tells of a builder-king who had sex with his sister in order to restart the daily solar cycle, Bradley said.Another unusual discovery from the genome survey was the earliest diagnosed case of Down Syndrome, in a young boy buried 5,500 years ago at Poulnabrone portal tomb, the oldest known burial structure on the island of Ireland.The team said this indicates that being visibly different did not bar people such as this infant from being given prestigious burials.Spike Island: Unraveling the mysteries of 'Ireland's Alcatraz'The researchers also found that the people who built these monumental tombs were early farmers who replaced hunter-gatherers when they migrated to Ireland. However, Bradley said the small population of hunter-gatherers, who numbered just a few thousand, was swamped by the new arrivals, rather than exterminated.Bradley said Trinity team were lucky to be able to sequence the genome of two hunter-gatherers, and found their genome marks them out from hunter-gatherers from Britain and continental Europe.\"They're a bit more differentiated from Britain and the continent than Britain and the continent are from each other,\" he said, which points to a prolonged period of isolation on the island at a time when Ireland was separated from Britain by a sea.",

        "content": "(CNN)Reigning world 100m champion Christian Coleman has been provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) after a third missed drugs test.The independent body, which combats anti-doping, announced on Wednesday that Coleman had been issued a charge in relation to a \"whereabouts failure.\"The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) \"whereabouts\" system requires athletes to let anti-doping officials know where they'll be for one hour every day, as well as details of overnight accommodation and training venues. If an athlete fails to do so and commits a \"filing failure\" three times over a 12-month period, they could face punishment.The American sprinter posted a lengthy statement on his Twitter page Tuesday admitting he missed a drugs test on December 9, 2019 -- the third missed test in the space of a year -- but alleges he was set up by the anti-doping body who failed to contact him by phone, and claims that it was a \"purposeful attempt to get me to miss a test.\" Read MoreColeman said he had been Christmas shopping \"five minutes away\" but had no idea a tester had visited his address, for one of the tests. He also claims the AIU tester wrote an incorrect address on his unsuccessful attempt form, questioning whether the tester even came to the location. \"Don't tell me I 'missed' a test if you sneak up on my door (parked outside the gate and walked through ... there's no record of anyone coming to my place) without my knowledge,\" he wrote.\"And, I've been tested multiple times since, even during quarantine. But, of course, that doesn't matter, and the fact that I have never taken drugs doesn't matter either.\"Coleman's other two failures had occurred on January 16, 2019, and April 26, 2019.READ: The man who 'gained the world but lost his soul'READ: Skateboarder Sky Brown, 11, hospitalized after horrific fallChristian Coleman has hit back after being provisionally suspended. In a statement to CNN, the AIU said it would not comment on the specifics of an ongoing case but confirmed its officers are instructed not to phone ahead. \"Any advanced notice of testing, in the form of a phone call or otherwise, provides an opportunity for athletes to engage in tampering or evasion or other improper conduct which can limit the efficacy of testing,\" the statement read.  The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) also said it would not comment on the specifics of the ongoing case but confirmed it was collaborating with the AIU.\"As in all cases, a person charged with a potential anti-rule violation is presumed innocent unless and until found to have committed a violation through the established process,\" a statement read. CNN has reached out to USA Track and Field (USATF) and Coleman's representatives for comment. The sprint star only narrowly avoided being banned last year after three violations of the \"whereabouts\" rules across 2018 and 2019.  However, his case was dropped due to a technicality over dates, which brought criticism from other athletes. The decision allowed him to compete at the World Athletics Championships in Doha last September.Coleman claimed victory in Doha with the sixth-fastest 100m in history (9.76 seconds). He also added a second gold in the men's 4 x 100m relay. He has continuously denied ever taking drugs and recently spoke to CNN Sport before news of his latest missed test. \"I've definitely been tested a lot of times since the World Championships,\" he said. \"Since the quarantine started I haven't really been tested like that. I think maybe one or two times.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The UK government has reversed its decision to not extend free school meal vouchers throughout the summer holidays following a campaign by Manchester United and England star Marcus Rashford.The scheme was set to finish at the end of current school year in July, but Rashford had pleaded with lawmakers to \"put their rivalries aside\" and make a U-turn as many families continue to struggle with the economic impact of the coronavirus.Following two days of public pressure led by Rashford, Downing Street announced a \"Covid summer food fund\" to help feed children from low-income families during the six-week summer break.The new scheme works out as \u00a315 ($19) per week for each recipient and a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson says it will cost around \u00a3120 million ($152 million).The spokesperson added that the Prime Minister understands the issues families face during the pandemic.Read More\"I don't even know what to say,\" Rashford tweeted following the U-turn. \"Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.\"I don't even know what to say.Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.\u2014 Marcus Rashford (@MarcusRashford) June 16, 2020 In a following post directed at MPs, Rashford added: \"This was never about me or you, this was never about politics, this was a cry out for help from vulnerable parents all over the country and I simply provided a platform for their voices to be heard.\"I stand proud today knowing that we have listened, and we have done what is right. There is still a long way to go but I am thankful to you all that we have given these families just one less thing to worry about tonight.\"The well-being of our children should ALWAYS be a priority.\"'A forgotten generation'Following up on the open letter he published on Monday, Rashford wrote an article in the The Times newspaper on Tuesday asking MPs to \"help us break the cycle of hardship\" of child poverty in the UK.\"Today I focus on a trophy that stands for something much bigger than football,\" wrote the 22-year-old.\"A U-turn on the decision to stop the free food voucher scheme continuing over the summer holidays could help us reach the next round but we still have a very long way to go as a country to eventually lift the trophy. In this case, the trophy is combating child poverty.\"I don't claim to have the education of an MP in parliament, but I do have a social education. I am clued up on the difference a U-turn decision would make on the 1.3 million vulnerable children across the UK who are registered for free school meals because 10 years ago I was one of them.\"I recognize that I have a valuable platform that allows my voice to be heard and I'm asking you to listen to the stories of these vulnerable families.

This included an 81% increase in emergency food parcels being given out across the UK and 122% more parcels going to children.\"The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the depth and extent of inequalities in our society,\" JRF Acting Director Helen Barnard said. \"At a time when over four million children are trapped in poverty across our country, it is a damning indictment that so little progress has been made in improving young people's chances.\"'Snarky'Rashford has helped raise over \u00a320 million ($25 million) in donations alongside food charity FareShare since March, reaching 1,280,000 children.There had been huge public backing for Rashford's appeal, with the hashtag #maketheUturn the No. 1 trend on Twitter in the UK earlier Tuesday.Rashford also called out one UK lawmaker -- Conservative MP Therese Coffey -- who was widely criticized for her \"snarky\" response to the footballer.Replying to a thread in which Rashford highlighted struggling families that may not have access to hot water, electricity and food, Coffey replied: \"Water cannot be disconnected though.\"I'm concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a difference #maketheuturn\u2014 Marcus Rashford (@MarcusRashford) June 16, 2020 Rashford responded: \"I'm concerned this is the only tweet of mine you acknowledged. Please, put rivalries aside for a second, and make a difference #maketheuturn.\"Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds replied to Coffey, saying: \"Imagine having priorities so warped that this snarky comment is your response to @MarcusRashford's powerful campaign. @theresecoffey do the right thing: apologize and vote for free school meals for children in poverty this summer.\"Rashford, who made his Manchester United debut at the age of 18, said his family relied on free meals and food banks when he was a child, and says 200,000 kids from families like his are \"waking up to empty shelves.\"\"Today nine out of 30 children in any given classroom are asking why. Why does their future not matter?\" Rashford wrote. \"This is the devastating reality of child poverty in England in 2020. This is a pandemic that will last generations if we don't change our thinking now.\"We should consider that these pandemics we are living through, Covid-19 and child poverty, will have huge effects on the long-term mental stability of both parents and children, and their reintegration into society. A society which, in their eyes, is failing them.\"My mum would go days without sleeping, worrying about how she would cover the next round of bills, worried that I could get in trouble, mixing with the wrong crowds, if she couldn't keep her eyes on me while working every hour of the day.

I've said it once and I will say it again: this system was not built for families like mine to succeed, no matter how hard we are working.\"'Unacceptable'Former England international Gary Lineker joined the support for Rashford's campaign on Monday, saying it was \"largely unacceptable\" that children in the UK should be going hungry.\"I was really impressed with what Marcus is doing,\" Lineker told BBC Newsnight. \"Obviously when you look at it, though, he's a 22-year-old young footballer, he shouldn't really be the one having to do this, but the fact that he is, is important. It's impressive. \"He's a very fine young man and he's a credit to his sport and his family. He's doing a great job in trying to get the government to U-turn on that decision to stop the vouchers going on during the summer. \"There are a lot of young people, young children in this country that are going hungry and in a country likes ours, a country of quite substantial wealth, that seems to be largely unacceptable.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Red Room, Finland's Manchester United museumReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Red Room, Finland's Manchester United museum 02:56\"It would be quite the breakthrough if the government does the U-turn that he's asked for, I hope they do.

I'm not sure they will, but I just hope they do.\"On Monday, a spokesperson from the UK's Department for Education said in a statement to CNN: \"As schools open more widely, and their kitchens reopen, we expect schools to make food parcels available for collection or delivery for any children that are eligible for free school meals who are not yet able to return to school.\"Where this is not possible, schools can continue to offer vouchers to eligible pupils. Free school meals are ordinarily term time only, and the national voucher scheme will not run during the summer holidays.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Misha was living in a hotel in a leafy suburb of Ireland's capital city under the country's controversial asylum seeker accommodation system when a letter arrived.  She had been waiting months for a decision to be made on her asylum status. But the letter wasn't about that. Misha, and dozens of other asylum seekers at the Dublin hotel were notified that they would be moved to a rural town over 200 miles away, on the west coast of Ireland, due to concerns over Covid-19 spreading through the accommodation, which was also shared by paying guests. She had less than 24 hours to pack her things.When she was transferred to the Skellig Star accommodation center in Cahersiveen, County Kerry, on March 18, she was hopeful it would be safe. But, after arriving and being told to bunk with another asylum seeker she didn't know, she began to fear the worst.\"I was scared for my life,\" said Misha, who asked that her real name not be used for fear it might impact her asylum claim.Read MoreAbout 100 people in total were transferred from a handful of centers, including from one Dublin hotel where a guest from Italy had reportedly contracted the virus.Just days after they arrived, one of the residents started showing symptoms, according to three people CNN talked to. Then the rumors started.\n\n\"I was scared for my life.\"\nMisha\n\nThe Cahersiveen community had been given just as little time to prepare; locals found out only a few days before that the Skellig Star \u2014 rebuilt in 2006 on the promise of drawing tourists with a swimming pool and other leisure facilities \u2014 was being converted into accommodation for asylum seekers.Despite their lack of consultation and concerns over losing business from the only major hotel in town, people in Cahersiveen welcomed the group, bringing them clothes and toys. But when news began swirling that asylum seekers were getting sick, and still shopping in the local stores, people in the small town began to panic. \"Rural Ireland would love to have these people living in the community ... they'd be more than welcome,\" said Jack Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Cahersiveen Community and Business Alliance. \"But, this is not the way to do it, to plunk 100 people into a very congested hotel in the midst of a pandemic.\"The outbreak, which swiftly spread through the hotel, infecting 25 people at its peak, was declared over on May 20 by Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE), but local residents and asylum seekers are continuing to push for the center to be shut down, joining together as a united front in a series of demonstrations. Asylum seekers at the Skellig Star hold a banner protesting the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak on May 7.Under a system known as Direct Provision, overseen by Ireland's Department of Justice and Equality and operated by private businesses on lucrative contracts, asylum seekers are housed in emergency accommodation while they wait to find out if they will be granted refugee status and permission to stay in the country.Calls for reform of the system, introduced initially as an emergency measure by the state in 1999 after a sudden increase in asylum applications, have coincided with sweeping, global protests for racial justice following the killing of George Floyd in the US. Asylum seekers \u2014 many of whom are from African countries \u2014 have condemned Direct Provision for \"institutionalized racism\" on the part of the government, arguing that no one else in the country is treated in the same way as they are.   While their appeal is being assessed, they're provided with free accommodation, food and utilities, and have access to healthcare and education, but they have almost no autonomy and cannot choose where they live. And they are unable to apply for a work permit until at least eight months into their application process \u2014 expected to survive on a weekly allowance of \u20ac38.80 ($43) instead. Commenting on the comparison between Direct Provision and the murder of George Floyd earlier this month, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar conceded that while some Direct Provision accommodation was substandard and needed to change, it \"ultimately is a service offered by the state ... involves people being provided with free accommodation, food, heat, lighting, health care, education, and also some spending money.\"\"It's not the same thing as a man being killed by the police.\"Decisions on asylum cases in Ireland can take years, a fact that has been criticized by the United Nations Refugee Agency, which recently called for the process to be sped up. And rejection rates are high \u2014 around 70%, according to recent figures. Dozens of people have died waiting, according to a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Catholic.Not fit for purposeIreland's Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green Party struck a draft deal to form a new coalition government on Monday, which, if ratified by the members of the three parties, will end months of political stalemate since the country's election in February. It will also inject urgency into reforming the Irish asylum system. One of the key commitments outlined in the agreement is a pledge to end Direct Provision and replace it with an accommodation policy centered on a not-for-profit approach.Liam Thornton, a law lecturer and Direct Provision expert, greeted the decision with cautious optimism. \"After 20-plus years of government denial that anything much was wrong, it's interesting to see,\" he told CNN. \"While we haven't been here before, it is implementation that will be key.\" Thornton tweeted: \"Direct Provision is one of the darkest chapters in the Dept of Justice history. But it takes people to design, administer, implement such awfulness. New mindsets needed ASAP.\"Asylum seekers, human rights campaigners and legal experts such as Thornton say the pandemic has shone a spotlight on structural problems that have long existed in Ireland's asylum system. Against the backdrop of Covid-19, the often crowded, poor conditions have become that much more apparent. \"HSE has been advising us, and everybody, on social distancing, but you cannot social distance where there is no space,\" Misha said.\"We were sharing bedrooms with strangers. We were sharing the dining room. We were sharing the salt shakers. We were sharing the lobby. We were sharing everything. And if you looked at the whole situation, you cannot really say that it was fit for purpose.\"Skellig Star residents, locked inside the center during quarantine, chant \"move us out\" on April 29.Misha says she watched in horror as people started falling sick around her, before being pulled into makeshift isolation rooms. The first suspected case of Covid-19 in the center was reported as early as March 24, the Justice Department has conceded, adding that the person did not test positive. They did not say when the test was conducted.According to asylum seekers and a previous manager, testing of asylum seekers didn't start until weeks later in mid-April. After positive cases were confirmed, all residents at the Skellig Star were ordered to stay inside and quarantine. \"I have verifiable evidence of a written communication from the Skellig Star to the Department of Justice and Equality on 24 March confirming a suspected case of Covid-19. The resident concerned was placed in isolation on 20 March, one day after arrival in Cahersiveen,\" Member of Parliament for Kerry, Norma Foley, said in a special parliamentary committee hearing on the government's Covid-19 response.\"The timeline might not be of importance to either the HSE or the Department of Justice and Equality but it is very important to the residents of the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen. This timeline confirms unequivocally that Covid-19 was transported by bus on 18 March and 19 March to the Skellig Star and the community of Cahersiveen.\"In a statement to CNN regarding the timeline, the Department said it had made an \"honest mistake\" in failing to receive the March 24 communication and that \"there was no attempt by the Department ... to intentionally mislead or conceal the facts\" related to the outbreak.\n\n\"Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community.\"\nJack Fitzpatrick\nAfter her roommate tested positive and was taken away to self-isolate at another center, Misha thought that someone would move her, so that the room could be disinfected. When no one came, she said she raised her concerns with an HSE worker on site, who told her there was no reason to worry.\"It was an embarrassment to my intelligence,\" Misha said. She tested positive 10 days later. Ireland's Justice Department told CNN that an HSE Development Worker was at the hotel to monitor the health of residents and staff throughout the outbreak, and is now providing more general support, including accessing mainstream health services and integrating in the local community.   The Department said it was continuing to work closely with the HSE and Cahersiveen center managers to ensure the wellbeing of all residents and staff, including offering all single residents their own bedrooms and providing enhanced cleaning services. The center also intends to provide self-catering facilities so that residents can cook in their rooms, instead of eating together in a communal dining room. Townbe, the company that operates Skellig and three other Direct Provision centers, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The Justice Department said it was unable to comment on the value of the contract with Townbe until after two years, because of commercial sensitivity.But the conditions detailed by the Justice Department differ dramatically with what was described to CNN by two asylum seekers and one previous manager at the center. Fears of second outbreakWhen Misha and the other asylum seekers arrived at the Skellig Star in mid-March, they said they found a holiday hotel that was not ready for guests, or prepared to cope with the coronavirus. The central heating was broken, the bedrooms \u2014 which were smaller than standard size \u2014 were not deep cleaned, isolation rooms had not been established, personal protective equipment was not made available and staff had not been vetted by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Ireland's national police service.Bulelani Mfaco, an activist who has been living in Direct Provision since 2017, detailed some of these conditions in a report for the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI), laying out recommendations for wide-ranging reforms of the system. Top of his list: Guaranteeing a suitable standard of living that protects the physical and mental health.Skellig Star residents in quarantine wave to locals protesting outside on May 7.\"Cahersiveen demonstrates to us that the model doesn't work,\" Mfaco said. \"Giving vulnerable people to hoteliers, who have no training. No thought was given to the risk of gathering all these people, cramming them into a bus and bringing them to a remote village far from any healthcare services.\"  Jack Fitzpatrick and other locals are fearful that those healthcare services will be overstretched if another outbreak hits.The closest major hospital to Cahersiveen, which has a population of around 1,000, is 40 miles away. There are only two doctors in Cahersiveen, and one ambulance serves the entire remote Iveragh Peninsula, where the town is situated.  \"We were very lucky that nobody died in the hotel, and that we managed to stop the virus going widespread in the community,\" said Fitzpatrick.\"Our biggest fear is a second wave ... We're afraid it will spread like wildfire in the hotel again, but next time it may also go through the community. So we are basically doing our best to try to get them to close it down and move the people to sort accommodation.\"People in the town are demanding the resignation of Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, who they say misled the public over the Covid-19 outbreak at the Skellig Star. \n\n\"We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus.\"\nAzwar Fuard\nFlanagan has apologized to the people of Cahersiveen, but said his department had no knowledge of the infection in the Dublin hotel before transferring asylum seekers from it.In the wake of the outbreak, Flanagan has asked the former Secretary General to undertake a review of the Department's response to Covid-19 in direct provision centers like Cahersiveen. Ciaran Quinlan, of Cahersiveen, told CNN he is seeking an injunction to close the center. He says he wants \"to help these people to get their own front-door accommodation, and to move them out of the unsuitable accommodation that they're in.\"Azwar Fuard, an asylum seeker who has been acting as a spokesman for the 70 residents remaining at the center, is calling on Flanagan to grant the Skellig Star residents amnesty to remain in Ireland.Fuard, originally from Sri Lanka, was moved from the same hotel as Misha in Dublin with his young family just as they were starting to feel settled. Both Fuard and his wife had found work in the capital, made friends, and their three-year-old daughter had started going to pre-school. To be ripped away from yet another life, he said, was like a double trauma.Now he says the family of three is largely confined to a 12ft x 13ft room, with an ensuite bathroom and no cooking or washing facilities.  \"We should be given, at least, the status of permission to remain so we can have our own-door accommodation, cook our own meals and keep ourselves and our families safe from the virus,\" Fuard said.",

        "content": "Milan (CNN)A statue of famed Italian journalist Indro Montanelli in Milan has been painted red and sprayed with the words \"racist\" and \"rapist,\" while a petition has called for its removal. While serving in the army in 1935-1936, during Italy's war in Eritrea, the 26-year-old Montanelli bought and married a 12-year-old girl. During a 1969 interview with Italian journalist and activist Elvira Banotti, Montanelli said he was married to the child because he \"bought\" her, which he said was part of the region's tradition and common among Eritrean soldiers. Cathartic acts of rage, or the rewriting of history? How statues became political lightning rodsWhen Banotti pressed Montanelli on whether he had raped the girl, named Desta, the journalist did not answer the question directly but defended himself by saying that he was married and that the issue of rape was out of the question.Montanelli also wrote about the marriage in a collection of essays published in 2000, titled \"La Stanza di Montanelli.\" Read MoreHe died in 2001.There is now a petition to have the statue removed from the park in the city center.Prosecutor Alberto Nobili, of Milan's prosecutors office, told CNN that his office has opened an investigation into the attack on the statue, with a possible charge of \"fouling.\" The penalty for such a crime ranges from a fine of \u20ac103 to \u20ac1,000 ($115-$1,125) and between three months and a year in prison, Nobili said.Nobili added that the statue is in the process of being cleaned.Montanelli's statue has been targeted before -- on International Women's Day in 2019, it was splashed with pink paint.Milan's mayor, Beppe Sala, said Sunday that although he had seen the video in which Montanelli admitted he had bought the girl, he believed Montanelli was a \"great journalist\" who fought for press freedom, and that the statue should remain where it is.Statue removals show change is coming \u2014 even in the capital of the Confederacy \"Now I invite all of us, I invite our community to reflect on two issues. The first question I ask myself and you is what do we ask of personalities we want to remember with a statue, with a plaque, with the name of a street or a square, or a garden? Do we ask for a spotless life? For a life in which everything was absolutely right? It is possible. However, few would remain to remember,\" he said in a video posted to Facebook. \"And the second question that I ask myself and you is: When we judge our lives, can we say that our own is spotless? And without things that we wouldn't do again?\" he said.\"I put my hands up, my life is not. I made mistakes, I did things I wish I hadn't done, but lives must be judged in their complexity. For all these reasons, I think that the statue must remain there. I am nevertheless available to discuss the issue of racism and Montanelli whenever you want,\" the mayor added.Meanwhile, Alberto Malvolti, president of the Montanelli Bassi Foundation, which conserves Montanelli's legacy, said in a statement on Thursday that the suggestion of removing the statue \"would be an offense to the memory of the most popular and appreciated Italian journalist of the 20th century, as well as representing an insult to the city of Milan.\"",

And that can prevent gender equality.However, women's rights activists say women are still systemically discriminated against in the professional world, job security and advancement are limited, and protections for women facing harassment, abuse and violence are lacking.Swiss government statistics show that women in full-time employment earn on average 11.5% less than men, and a 2019 survey commissioned by Amnesty International revealed that sexual violence is widespread.One in five women surveyed said they had been subjected to sexual violence, according to Amnesty.Women across Switzerland are on strike.

Hutchinson told CNN on Sunday it was the first Black Lives Matter protest he attended, and he helped the white man on Saturday because he didn't want the main reason for the protests to be lost in one moment of violence. Protesters in London and all over the world have taken to the streets calling for police reform after the deaths of black people at the hands of police. These deaths most recently include George Floyd in Minneapolis and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta.  \"My real focus was on avoiding a catastrophe, all of a sudden the narrative changes into 'Black Lives Matters, Youngsters Kill Protesters.' That was the message we were trying to avoid,\" Hutchinson said.Hutchinson told CNN he initially saw the man lying on some stairs in the fetal position surrounded by protesters. Read More A group of men including Patrick Hutchinson (carrying the man) help an injured man away after he was allegedly attacked by some of the crowd of protesters on the Southbank near Waterloo station. At that moment, he said it didn't cross his mind the man may be a counter protester or hold prejudices, but he was trying to get him out safely. \"I have no idea who this man was. All I know is that he was there, up to no good, let's just say,\" Hutchinson told CNN on Monday. \"He wasn't here to support Black Lives Matter.\"More than 100 people were arrested in London protests Saturday after violence broke out as far-right groups targeted BLM protests. CNN has not been able to independently verify what the injured man was doing at the protest before the incident or why he was there. CNN has not yet been able to identify the injured protester.When Hutchinson saw the man, he said he and his friends formed a cordon around him and Hutchinson scooped him up to take him directly to the police. While they were marching, the man could still feel people trying to hit him, Hutchinson said.\"I am carrying him, my friends are protecting myself and the man on my shoulder. He was still receiving blows, you can feel people trying to hit him,\" he said. \"There were people trying to protect him at the same time carried him over to the police and I said here you are. One of them said 'thank you - you did a good thing there.'\"Hutchinson attended the protests Saturday because \"history was in the making,\" he said, and it was a \"no brainer\" to support the cause. He added that he would like to break down the race barriers and for people to realize, \"we are all one race.\"\"I want to see equality for everybody. I am a father, a grandfather and I would love to see my young children, my young grandchildren, my nieces, my nephews have a better world than I have lived in,\" Hutchinson said. \"The world I live in has been better than my grandparents and my parents and hopefully we can continue until we have total equality for everyone.\"Hutchinson said he's glad people look at the image as one of humanity and that people all over the world can learn from it, especially police officers in the US.\"Just because somebody's up to no good, doesn't mean you have to kill them,\" he said.

Mum and I had briefly spoken about getting some ducks after lockdown anyway.\"Part of me thought it would never work, none of the quail eggs developed but after 6 days in the incubator I checked the duck eggs and could see veins and a very tiny wiggly embryo. Then the excitement kicked in.\" Read MoreThe assistant retail manager decided to see if she could hatch eggs while she was furloughed from work because of the coronavirus.\"I spent the whole two days that Beep was hatching glued to my incubator. Thankfully I had friends at the end of the phone to keep me calm. He was a lone chick for two days so I had to make a little sling out of a beanie hat and carry him around until Peep hatched. Meep joined a week later.\"Lello, who also keeps chickens, plans to keep the ducklings in her home in Hertfordshire, north of London, until they are fully feathered, and then move them to live outside with her chickens. She said it was \"a great feeling\" but anyone wanting to do the same should do their research, and ensure they had the right set-up and space to care for ducks -- and a back-up plan. Waitrose said in a statement sent to CNN that it was only on \"rare\" occasions that an egg sold in its supermarkets would be fertilized.Lello, from Hertfordshire in the UK, said part of her never thought her plan would work. The high-end supermarket said that because it was \"notoriously difficult to identify the sex of egg-laying white-feathered ducks,\" males were sometimes left with groups of females and there were also rare instances when a wild duck (female) encounters a farmed drake (male).It said that without incubation, fertilized eggs \"are entirely indistinguishable from normal eggs\" when eaten.Clarence Court said in a statement supplied to CNN that its eggs traveled from farm to packing center to supermarket depot to store, so \"it is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched.\"\"Duck egg production is a very small industry, and the separation of males from females relies wholly upon the skill of very few qualified people.\"Lello said seeing the ducklings hatch was \"a great feeling\" but she urged people to do their research if they were hoping to do the same.Unlike commercial laying hens, for example, laying ducks are all white-feathered and similar size when grown. \"Most drakes can be spotted by a little curl to the tail feathers, although not all of the drakes possess this visual marker.\"Our ducks are kept in small flocks with access to the outdoors every day. In this open-air environment, while it is infrequent, our ducks may attract the attention of wild drakes. So, whilst it is very unusual for males and females to come into contact with one another, it is not impossible.\"",

Messi and Barcelona hadn't played for more than three months amid the coronavirus pandemic, with Spain one of the world's hardest hit countries. When La Liga resumed Thursday, matches were contested behind closed doors, just like in Germany's Bundesliga, which restarted last month.

He was intercepted by security and escorted away.  Arturo Vidal opened the scoring for Barcelona in the second minute after converting Jordi Alba's perfect cross and Messi put through Alba in the 79th.

The other Barcelona goal came from Martin Braithwaite, who was signed as an emergency striker from modest Leganes in February after longterm injuries to Ousmane Dembele and Luis Suarez -- who returned Saturday and assisted on Messi's effort.  Brathwaite latched on to a ball in the box and drilled his shot into the roof of the net in the 37th minute for his first Barcelona goal. \"I've been waiting for this a long time,\" Braithwaite told Barcelona TV. \"It's amazing to score my first goal and most importantly it was really important to start like we did today. \"I've been working a lot in this break and looking forward to playing this game and hopefully get a goal. I'm happy, really happy.\"Barcelona hosts second-last Leganes on Tuesday prior to a seemingly tougher test at third-place Sevilla on Friday. It is bidding for a third straight league title in what has been a turbulent season. \"It's true we have to improve, but I'm really happy with the performance of the team after such a long time,\" said Barcelona manager Quique Setien, who replaced the fired Ernesto Valverde in January. Costa's goal dedication In Sunday's early game, Diego Costa dedicated his goal for Champions League hopeful Atletico Madrid in a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao to Virginia Torrecilla, who plays for Atletico's women's team.The Spanish international underwent surgery last month to remove a benign brain tumor, calling the operation a success. Costa held up her jersey after equalizing in the 39th minute. Diego Costa dedicated his goal for Atletico Madrid to women's player Virginia Torrecilla. Torrecilla later tweeted her thanks.

        "content": "(CNN)More than 100 people were arrested in London on Saturday after violence broke out as far-right groups targeted anti-racism Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations.The offenses as of 9 p.m. included violent disorder, assault on officers, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of class A drugs, and drunken disorder, London's Metropolitan Police said in a tweet.Far-right groups bombarded police with bottles and occasionally scuffled violently with officers as they staged a counter-protest in central London.Police also arrested a 28-year-old man after an individual was photographed on Saturday apparently urinating on a memorial to a police officer killed while defending Parliament from a terrorist attack in 2017.The man was arrested north of London \"on suspicion of outraging public decency,\" police said.Read MoreHundreds of mostly middle-aged white men, many shirtless or clutching beers, gathered in Parliament Square, where video showed a small number of right-wing protesters throwing objects at a line of police, some of whom responded with batons.The groups, some of them chanting \"England\" during clashes, said the counter-protest was intended to \"protect\" statues around Parliament Square, including that of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel described the behavior as \"thoroughly unacceptable thuggery.\"A can of beer is thrown at police officers as activists from far-right linked groups clash with police on Parliament Street as far-right groups gathered to \"protect\" statues in London.\"Any perpetrators of violence or vandalism should expect to face the full force of the law. Violence towards our police officers will not be tolerated. Coronavirus remains a threat to us all. Go home to stop the spread of this virus & save lives,\" she said.In Trafalgar Square, officers formed barriers between BLM and far-right groups, as authorities in the UK capital urged people to stay away from the protests, given the high likelihood of violence.The statue of Churchill was boarded up, as were statues of Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi. One self-declared England fan and soccer hooligan confirmed to CNN last week that there were threats to pull down the Mandela statue.The Mayor of London's office said: \"The statues of Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi are being temporarily covered for their protection. All other statues in Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square remain under review and we will put protection in place should the need arise.\"Police form a barrier in front of activists surrounding the Cenotaph on Whitehall in anticipation of clashes with Black Lives Matter protesters.London's Metropolitan Police imposed a 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) limit on both the Black Lives Matter and right-wing protests in the UK's capital. They also imposed conditions on what route and area the protesters could use, to try to prevent the two groups clashing. Protests planned by Black Lives Matter and associated groups were to follow a planned route from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square while protests by right-wing groups were to stay in Parliament Square and Whitehall, south of a police barrier.In a statement released Friday, Met Police Commander Bas Javid said: \"I absolutely understand why people want to make their voices heard -- there is a really strong depth of feeling out in the communities, but the Government direction is that we remain in a health pandemic and people are asked not to gather in large groups. By doing so, you are putting your own safety, and that of your family or friends at risk. We are asking you not to come to London, and let your voices be heard in other ways.\"CNN has previously reported comments from Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, that her forces had information that people were \"intent on coming to cause violence and confrontation\" at BLM marches across London this weekend.\"We can anticipate that some of them, whatever their political persuasion, are intent, some of them, are intent on having a confrontation with people from the Black Lives Matter movement. So my message is please just stay away this weekend,\" she said.The UK's official Black Lives Matter group distanced itself from the protest that it had planned in central London on Saturday. \"Please, people, our people, if you want to protest this weekend, do it in your ends,\" it tweeted, adding, \"Our priority must be our safety -- please take care of yourselves and each other.\"A woman addresses protesters gathered in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in Hyde Park, central London on Saturday.UK anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate had warned about the possibility of violence from \"football hooligans\" and far-right groups at protests this weekend. \"While the hooligans claim that they are coming to London to \"protect the war memorials\" is also clear from the racist comments of many that they also hope to confront BLM and anti-fascists,\" Hope Not Hate wrote in a statement on Monday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged residents to stay away from protests this weekend amid a \"high\" risk of violence in the city.\"I'd like to make a direct appeal to Londoners to urge you not to take to the streets to protest over the coming few days,\" Khan said in a video posted on social media.\"I stand with the millions of people around the world who are saying loud and clear that Black Lives Matter,\" he said, adding that the majority of protesters are peaceful. \"However, I'm extremely concerned that further protests in central London could not only risk spreading Covid-19, but also lead to disorder, vandalism and violence.\"\"We know that extreme far-right groups, who openly advocate hatred and division, are planning counter protests.\"This means that the risk of disorder is high.\"Khan said the counter-protests were clearly designed to provoke violence, and the best way to respond was to stay home and ignore them.He said more than 60 police officers had already been injured while responding to previous demonstrations, adding that authorities will respond forcefully to those causing violence this time.Thousands of people demonstrate against police brutality and racism in Paris on Saturday, before a march organized by supporters of Adama Traore, who died in the custody of French police in 2016.Meanwhile, thousands of people gathered in central Paris to protest against police brutality -- an issue symbolized in France by the 2016 death in custody of Adama Traor\u00e9, a young black man.Saturday's protests were organized by 17 groups, including the family's \"Truth for Adama\" campaign.Speaking ahead of the start of the march, Adama's sister Assa Traor\u00e9 called for justice.\"Why did my brother die? Why was my brother pinned down?\" she said.  \"My brother died the same way Georges Floyd did.\"\"We will fight that battle with all the French people. If you don't suffer discrimination, good for you, join us in the fight anyway.\"In response, a small number of far-right protesters scaled a nearby building to unfurl banners reading: \"Justice for the victims of anti-white racism.\" While police did not formally ban Saturday's protests, gatherings of more than 10 people are not permitted under France's coronavirus laws.Authorities on Friday urged businesses in Place de la R\u00e9publique and Place de l'Op\u00e9ra to close and to remove anything that could be used as a weapon.A large crowd of protesters also gathered in Perth in Western Australia for a rally in support of the Black Lives Matters movement Saturday.  The rally, organized by First Nations Elders, aims to draw attention to and end violence against Aboriginal people in police custody and to end state sponsored racism.Saturday's rally to support the Black Lives Matter movement in Sydney was made illegal by a court injunction over pandemic public health concerns.Nic Robertson, Mick Krever and Luke Wolagiewicz contributed reporting from London, Carly Walsh from Hong Kong and Eva Tapiero from Paris.",

I don't care if he's my son or not. I'll go away and have a look at that but I'm still disappointed in the result,\" Gatland said.New Zealand lifted nearly all its Covid-19 restrictions earlier this week as no new coronavirus cases were reported for over 20 days straight and with a relatively low death toll of 22 since the pandemic started.The Otago Highlanders team line up before the start of the game at the Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin, the first since Covid-19 restrictions were largely lifted in New Zealand.It paved the way for the return of crowds to stadiums in the rugby-mad country, with the 50,000-capacity Eden Park likely to be full as the Auckland Blues host Wellington Hurricanes in the second match of the weekend Sunday.The main Super Rugby tournament, which involves teams from Australia, South Africa, Argentina and Japan, was halted in mid-March in response to the global pandemic.In the interim, New Zealand's five Super Rugby teams are playing in their own internal Aotearoa, the Maori word for New Zealand, competition, which is being broadcast to a global television audience starved of action with crowd atmosphere.By contrast, major European football leagues are slowly returning to competitive action behind closed doors:  Spain's La Liga the latest this weekend, with the English Premier League resuming next Wednesday, but without a paying fan in sight.Taiwan, which has only reported seven coronavirus deaths, has allowed fans into its baseball stadiums, but only to 50% capacity with social distancing gaps between fans.",

Beneath you are two skis and the only way is down -- at a speed of over 80kmph.Most people would feel fear and foreboding, but for Kelly Gallagher, the feeling is one of freedom.\"When you get a ski to bend and physically feel a jolt of G [gravity] -- it's exceptional.\" A daredevil; a history-maker; and Winter Paralympic champion, the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland is no stranger when it comes to defying the odds and gravity.Kelly Gallagher and guide Charlotte Evans won a historic gold medal in the Super-G at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi'I'm the same as everyone else'Read MoreGallagher has oculocutaneous albinism -- a condition characterized by very fair skin, white or light colored hair and often visual impairment.It's estimated to affect around 1 in 17,000 people in the UK.\"It's like an overexposed picture [...] I find depth perception very difficult. I need a good contrast between colors and shapes to be able to see things,\" she explains.Despite being used to hurtling down mountains at breakneck speed, overcoming challenges and channeling frustrations have been part of Gallagher's DNA since birth.She recalls how at school she would have to sit beside the teacher away from friends to read the whiteboard at a close distance.At university she felt \"anger and annoyance\" at a lack of understanding for her needs. And throughout that time flitting between prescription glasses, contact lenses and sunglasses and applying sunscreen daily to combat exposure from the sun.For Gallagher, though, albinism has also been about empowerment.Encouraged by her parents and fostered by an inherit steely determination to fend off ignorance, she armed herself with the simple mantra: \"I'm the same as everyone else.\" In skiing she discovered an unlikely passion and purpose in the unlikeliest marriage of ways and places.Gallagher made her international debut in New Zealand at the Winter Games in August 2009Inspired by Ski BarbieAlthough as a child she would cycle and roller blade, sport, like snow-capped mountains in her hometown of Bangor, was largely absent.But a hidden sporting inspiration emerged: A skiing Barbie.She fondly recalls receiving the toy from her late father and how the plastic figurine -- unlike cycle Cindy -- couldn't bend her legs.What Barbie lacked in athleticism she made up for in glamor and it was to eventually open up a whole new world.It was not, though, until an unplanned diversion to Andorra when on holiday with her parents, that a 17-year-old Gallagher would first take to the slopes.\"I found it something that really clicked with me [...] The physicality of being able to move and it being such a wide-open space and everyone going in the same direction I think just captured it.\"A need for speed had been ignited. An unlikely dream now a reality. From then there was no looking back.Gallagher made history by becoming Northern Ireland's first Winter Paralympian at the Vancouver Games in 2010, though the defining moment of her career to date would come at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.JUST WATCHEDVisually impaired skier's Sochi missionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVisually impaired skier's Sochi mission 03:00READ: Sochi Paralympics: Two skiers become oneA Golden MomentIn the years between Paralympics, Gallagher had developed an unbreakable partnership with her fully sighted guide, Charlotte Evans -- a former skier herself. She forensically details how years of constant communication, mutual respect and an understanding of one another's ways and means fostered a new-found belief.\"Sometimes when I was at the airport I used to think quite smugly -- 'I'm a better skier than all these people that are queuing up for this flight [...] I'm able to ski faster than a car!\"Despite their first races being \"a disaster,\" they struck gold in the Super-G category.It was the first time since the Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics began that a British skier had achieved such a feat on the slopes.\"It wasn't an exceptional race. I just happened to be the girl that did the fewest mistakes,\" she humbly suggests.Her groundbreaking feat initially \"didn't really feel unusual for me because I was always trying to do unusual things.\"It was only when the she returned home that the magnitude of what had been accomplished began to dawn on her, not least when she was awarded an MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire).Honors such as an MBE are awarded biannually, once at New Year's and then again for the Queen's birthday, and recognize excellence in a spectrum of pursuits, ranging from arts and athletics to science and politics.There was a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and the President of Ireland -- Michael D. Higgins -- at Windsor Castle and trips to Royal Ascot and Wimbledon followed.\"All of those are tainted now because I'm never going to be able to enjoy a sport event unless I'm in the Royal Box! How am I going to enjoy myself?\" she jokes.Gallagher and Evans were awarded MBEs for services to Sport for People with a Visual Impairment at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace in October 2014'I'd rather be a Serena Williams'Since the jubilation of 2014, the path has been a bumpy one -- quite literally.Gallagher teamed up with new guide Gary Smith, a RAF communications technician, in 2016 before suffering a serious injury in a high-speed crash in January 2017.Returning to the slopes filled her with fear but she was proud to confront her demons and appear at her third Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang in 2018. For now, though, Gallagher's pressing engagement is with a recent arrival -- 12-week-old baby daughter Brigid.\"I am convinced she's an angel sent from somewhere else and she has nothing to do with me,\" she smiles.\"She's like having a really drunk persistent friend that you absolutely adore, but they're a total lunatic!'Currently on maternity leave from her job as a statistician for the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Gallagher is using the Covid-19 pandemic to carefully formulate her route back to the slopes.The pandemic has meant the immediate outlook is far from clear, however, the chance to compete at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in 2022 is something she'd relish.Her competitive edge and desire to win still burns as bright as ever.\"I like that (my teammates) know that it's possible (to win) because someone's done it before. I would rather be a Serena Williams and be like -- 'No, I'm still winning!' That would be much better!\"The 35-year-old is hoping past experiences will give her a chance of competing at the 2022 Winter Paralympics in BeijingEquality of Opportunity for allBeyond the competitive landscape, Gallagher is acutely aware that challenges still remain aplenty for greater coverage and recognition of disabled persons in sport and society.\"Day to day life didn't change just because we did so well in the Paralympics. We're still working on fighting for that.\"\"I've been skiing now more than 10 years, and I'm still giving pieces about the actual practicality of skiing, rather than what type of skier I am.\"\"If we could talk about skiing the same amount as pundits talk about football -- Man it would be good fun!\"She challenges all people to view disability through a different lens and ask ourselves: Is it that we -- disabled people -- are disabled or is it the world that disables us in the social rather than the medical model of disability?And it's this question, fueled by her lived experience of albinism, that has ignited a renewed drive for equal opportunity.\"I want to see people included no matter whether or not they have albinism.\"\"When you can have access to education you can stand up for yourself and make those choices for yourself. Having that choice means you can live the life you want for yourself. That's what everyone deserves and needs in their life.\"",

The artifacts, he said, dated back to the third century AD and contained Egyptian hieroglyphic references, representations of the crucifixion and signs of the Basque language, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported.

Read MoreExperts who studied the pieces found inconsistencies such as the absence of syntax, modern spellings of words, and names and phrases inconsistent with the supposed time period, El Pais previously noted.According to the newspaper, experts in philology and ancient history questioned the appearance of Latin words with more modern features, such as the use of the letter J in Jupiter in place of the Latin spelling, \"Iupiter,\" or \"Octavian Augustus\" to refer to Emperor Augustus. At first, Gil and his team defended their controversial findings from the \"great stir\" they were causing.

The soldiers, who had been guarding parts of the closed Polish-Czech border during the coronavirus pandemic, then started turning away Czech citizens who were attempting to visit a church in their own country.The snafu led the Czech embassy in Warsaw to take \"immediate action\" and notify its Polish counterpart, the Czech government told CNN, adding that Poland has still not formally explained why it mistakenly annexed its neighbor.\"Our Polish counterparts unofficially assured us that this incident was merely a misunderstanding caused by the Polish military with no hostile intention, however, we are still expecting a formal statement,\" a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told CNN.Read More\"The Polish soldiers are no longer present and our citizens can again visit the site freely,\" the spokesperson added. \"We are still waiting for the formal Polish statement,\" they repeated when asked how long Polish troops were in the country.In a town of two nations, Belgian bars are shuttered. Dutch pubs will soon be open across the streetPoland's Ministry of Defense also acknowledged the brief occupation on Friday. \"The placement of the border post was a result of misunderstanding, not a deliberate act. It was corrected immediately and the case was resolved -- also by the Czech side,\" it told CNN in a statement.The incident occurred near Pielgrzymow, a small border village in southern Poland that sits opposite a sparsely populated stretch of Czech countryside. A quiet road there serves as the boundary point between the two nations. \"Soldiers of the Polish Army support the Border Guard in protecting the state border after its closure due to the coronavirus pandemic,\" the Polish Defense Ministry explained. \"The operation is led by Armed Forces Operational Command, which is in direct contact with the Border Guard.\" The Polish government did not confirm how long its soldiers were present in the Czech Republic.Borders between European Union countries are often barely visible as citizens enjoy freedom of movement across the bloc.But the coronavirus pandemic has complicated that longstanding arrangement, with nations shutting off entry to foreigners to control the spread of the virus. Poland has blocked people from entering the country since March.Poland was involved in a handful of more serious border conflicts with the former Czechoslovakia during the 20th century. The two countries fought a seven-day war over territory in the Silesia region in 1919, and Poland annexed a region around the city of Bohumin in 1938.",

Rowling on its front page under the headline: \"I slapped JK and I'm not sorry.\"Politicians and charities have expressed outrage at the paper, which featured a doorstep interview with the \"Harry Potter\" author's first husband in which he refused to apologize for slapping her.THE SUN: I slapped JK and I'm not sorry #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/7FRk8n65g2\u2014 Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) June 11, 2020\n\nRowling revealed in an essay on Wednesday that she is a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault.\"Headlines matter,\" UK charity Women's Aid said. \"This morning we have been speaking to The Sun about today's front page and the negative impact it has had, and we will continue to speak to them to reflect survivors' voices.\"Opposition Labour MP Jess Phillips called the headline \"awful,\" and several MPs called on The Sun to issue an apology.Read MoreThe front page article featured quotes from Rowling's former partner, Jorge Arantes, in which he admitted that he abused her but refused to apologize for doing so. A subhead reads \"Sun confronts her first husband.\"CNN has been unable to independently verify The Sun's reporting of its exchange with Arantes.The paper defended its headline on Friday but said \"it was certainly not our intention to 'enable' or 'glorify' domestic abuse.\"\"We were disgusted by the comments of JK Rowling's ex-husband, and branded him 'sick' and 'unrepentant' in our coverage,\" it said in a statement. \"Our intention was to expose a perpetrator's total lack of remorse.\"pic.twitter.com/xkNLDX1dDB\u2014 The Sun (@TheSun) June 12, 2020\n\nCNN has contacted The Sun for further comment.\"What this has done is give national media coverage to a perpetrator of domestic abuse to attempt to justify his actions,\" domestic abuse charity Refuge said.The story was published two days after Rowling wrote in a personal essay about her experience of being in an allegedly abusive relationship. \"I've been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor,\" the author wrote. \"This isn't because I'm ashamed those things happened to me, but because they're traumatic to revisit and remember.\"'Heads should roll,' says MPThe Sun said it interviewed Rowling's first husband Arantes outside his mother's home in Porto, Portugal, in a journalistic practice known as doorstepping.Its story featured a handful of quotes in which Arantes denied abusing Rowling, despite acknowledging that he slapped her, which is a form of physical abuse. \"I slapped Joanne \u2014 but there was not sustained abuse. I'm not sorry for slapping her,\" he is quoted as saying.The story then details the couple's history and Rowling's Wednesday essay. The pair married in 1992 and Rowling left Arantes the following year, she wrote in the essay.The front page \"reflects how violence against women so often gets dismissed 'as a domestic,'\" Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote on Twitter. \"Heads should roll for doing this, not newspaper presses.\"\"This reporting is unacceptable, glorifies domestic violence & disparages the millions of victims of domestic violence,\" Ed Davey, acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, added.Trans activists call J.K. Rowling essay 'devastating'Rowling has been criticized in recent days for her views on transgender issues, which she set out in detail in the same 3,600-word essay.The author wrote that her previous anti-trans comments were connected to her experience as an abuse survivor, which had led her to hold \"concerns around single sex spaces.\"\"I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces,\" Rowling wrote.She received criticism from trans activists and public figures, including cast members of the \"Harry Potter\" movie franchise. \"Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are,\" actress Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the \"Potter\" films, wrote on Twitter hours after the comments, without mentioning Rowling.\"Transgender women are women,\" Daniel Radcliffe, who played Harry, added in a blog post for The Trevor Project, a non-profit organization devoted to suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth. \"Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo (Rowling) or I.\"Gender identity: The difference between gender, sex and other need-to-knowsUK charity Mermaids, which supports transgender children and teenagers, condemned The Sun's front page on Friday. \"As a trans charity, our staff deal with cases of domestic abuse regularly and we hold unquestioning solidarity with all victims of domestic violence,\" the charity said. \"No victim or vulnerable group should be used to sell newspapers.\"The Sun is Britain's most-read paid newspaper, according to the industry's latest circulation figures, selling around 1.2 million copies a day.As with rival titles in the UK's raucous tabloid landscape, its front pages frequently draw controversy.

        "content": "(CNN)Prime Minister Scott Morrison has apologized for saying earlier this week that there was \"no slavery\" in Australia, after his comments provoked outrage and accusations that he was ignoring the country's history of forced labor.Speaking at a news conference in Canberra Friday, Morrison said he was referring specifically to the fact that the first Australian colony of New South Wales was set up without the widespread use of slave labor.\"My comments were not intended to give offense, and if they did, I deeply regret that and apologize for that,\" he said, adding that he was a passionate advocate for the rights of Indigenous Australians.\"I was simply trying to make point that Australia, yes, we have had issues in our history, we have acknowledged them, I have acknowledged them, and we need to address them.\"Morrison originally made the remarks during a radio interview on Thursday, in which he was discussing the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and around the world, and calls to remove statues of British explorer James Cook, whose arrival in Australia paved the way for the first European colony. Read More\"My forefathers and foremothers were on the First and Second Fleets (of convict settlers). It was a pretty brutal place, but there was no slavery in Australia,\" Morrison said in the interview Thursday.Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a news conference in the Main Committee Room at Parliament House on June 12 in Canberra.While Australia was never heavily reliant on slave labor, like the American South, slavery was practiced in the country for decades in the 19th and 20th centuries, in places such as the Queensland sugar plantations.Others have pointed to the practice of \"blackbirding,\" a process by which Pacific Islanders were taken from their homes, sometimes by force, to work in harsh conditions for little or no pay in Australia.Morrison's comments came after thousands of people took to the streets of Australian cities over the past weekend in a show of solidarity with the US Black Lives Matter protests and to call for better treatment of Indigenous Australians.With more protests planned for the coming weeks, Morrison warned the public on Friday against attending upcoming rallies in support of racial equality, saying attendance went against health advice due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"This is not about the issue, this is about people's health and welfare and I would urge Australians to respect that by not attending those events,\" Morrison said. \"I don't believe there should be a double standard. Australians have made great sacrifices to get us where we are today.\" Why US protests have prompted a conversation about race in AustraliaOn Thursday, the New South Wales Supreme Court issued an injunction banning a Sydney march scheduled for Saturday on health grounds and due to lockdown measures.Another protest is scheduled for Sydney on Friday, called \"Stop Black Deaths in Custody: Solidarity with Long Bay Prisoners.\" The organization's event page currently shows more than a thousand people have signaled their intention to attend.There is no injunction against Friday's protest, but social distancing rules in the state cap the number of people allowed to gather outdoors together at 10. The limit is expected to increase to 20 people starting Saturday.",

Often it felt like some people were still living \"in the 1960s,\" says Mckennie.He remembers having conversations with his brother and father as he started to question whether moving with his family was the right decision. McKennie says he also thought about a future in which he may have a child or wife that would leave the house and not come back.\"No white man or woman will ever understand what we have to go through,\" he says. \"Will never understand, especially in America, having to go to a neighborhood and fear for your life or walking around and being judged in places that normally, typically, a black person shouldn't be. \"I'm sure there are people that look at black men and women, see them with a nice car or see them with something nice and they think: 'Oh, that's probably not theirs.'\"They didn't have to go through it, their ancestors didn't have to go through it, their family members didn't have to go through it.

I thought they gave us a lesson to improve our team.\" Read MoreThai television presenter Peerapol \"Champ\" Euariyakul added: \"I think a lot of the players, they were ignited by the situation and they were telling me that it pushed them more, that the next time, even when they have to lose, the margin should be smaller.\" And smaller it was. Thailand were beaten 5-1 by Sweden in their next match, but that singular goal gave the team, and the country, some hope. \"I think it inspired a lot of people that they can make the impossible, possible.\" Euariyakul said. \"I think when they scored that one goal, it's like a win for Thai people.\"Nualphan Lamsam, who was the team's general manager during Thailand's past two World Cup appearances, was seen on television cameras crying after the goal was scored. \"They are tears of joy,\" Lamsam told CNN Sport. \"I am so proud of my team seeing everyone playing with their full capability under the pressure accumulated since the heavy loss from the first match with the United States.\"Winning and losing are not important, what really matters for us the most and what we are most proud of, is the wonderful spirits of Thai football players.\" Thailand's players acknowledge their supporters at the end of the match against Sweden on June 16, 2019.Keys to future successSo what's next for women's football in Thailand? Euariyakul and Sornsai both believe it comes down to the domestic league. Lamsam's family company sponsors the fledgling women's league, and players on the national team are also employed by her company.The league is currently semi-professional, but at a time when equal pay dominates the headlines in women's sport, \"Champ\" says it goes deeper than that in Thailand.\"The key to success is the professional league. If the players don't have the professional league, after the World Cup, they have to go and be a salary person, which they don't want to do.\"They want to play sports full-time. And if our association says we need a professional league, I think we can go and we can compete more competitively.\" Sornsai agrees. She came up playing in various youth and school-based leagues and has been playing with the national team since 2005, earning 115 caps along the way. Germany and US leading the way in crucial period for women's football\"I hope it (Muang Thai Women's League) will become a professional league in the future,\" said Sornsai. \"They have to set up academies for women's football to produce many talented players. Second, they have to set a higher standard in education, competition and organization. Finally, they have to invest more in facilities to improve and have success in the future.\"In this moment, women's football is more popular in Thailand,\"  added Somsai. \"We can use this momentum to create more women players and improve the standard.\"Lamsam believes her efforts over her eights years at the helm were not in vein.\"I want to establish pride and make everyone know about our Thai women's football team,\" she said. \"Although football is the popular sport worldwide, it only referred to men's games in Thailand.\" Euariyakul agrees and thinks women's matches should be played before men's games to help get fans in the stands, and the league itself needs to be more visible. Thailand football fans show their support.\"The most important thing is we should promote, and we should watch more women's games. We just broadcast the World Cup, it's like a bubble. It comes on once in four years and I don't think that's enough. You need a strong belief, like in England, you need to broadcast the game every week.\"As the announcement of the host for the 2023 Women's World Cup draws near, Sornsai, who would be 34 during the tournament, knows that the Thais aren't at the level they need to be yet, but they're getting there. 'We hope we can go to play in the World Cup again and then, of course, close the big gap from the top teams.\" CNN's Amanda Davies contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Protesters have gathered in major cities across Australia demanding justice over minority deaths in police custody in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. About 10,000 people gathered in central Sydney Saturday after a court overturned a previous injunction that ruled any protest there illegal because of social distancing restrictions. Similar demonstrations went ahead in Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide, with protesters waving banners and chanting \"black lives matter.\" The rallies were organized by indigenous rights groups -- among others -- under the banner \"Stop Black Deaths in Custody.\"Jeremy, 27, who didn't reveal his surname, attended the march in Sydney. \"To know that I stand on the shoulders of black, queer people before me who have enabled me to live the life I lead, I had to ask myself if I was going to be the ancestor that people after me needed me to be,\" he told CNN. \"Change needs to happen ... I want to see it at its grass-roots level, see it in the education system, with people in power. What I want to see is that we haven't come this far for everything that's come before us to mean nothing.\" Protesters in Melbourne, Australia.Read MoreA common plightProtesters rallying outside Sydney's Town Hall called for justice for David Dungay, an Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015. His case has drawn parallels with George Floyd's death at the hands of police in the US. Like Floyd, Dungay's family say his last words were, \"I can't breathe.\"Dungay, who was schizophrenic and diabetic, died in Long Bay Prison Hospital after he was overpowered and restrained by at least four prison officers, according to a press release sent to CNN by his family's lawyer, George Newhouse, of the National Justice Project.Dungay's family is calling for criminal charges to be brought against the correctional officers involved in his case. Protesters march in Adelaide, Australia.Australia's indigenous population -- composed of mainland Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders -- makes up 2.4% of the country's 25 million people, yet accounts for more than a quarter of its total prisoner population. \u200bAnalysis from Change the Record, an Aboriginal-led justice coalition, found that there have been 449 indigenous deaths in custody between 1980 and 2011, which represents 24% of all deaths in custody over that period.\"There's so many modern parallels with what's going on in Australia and the United States,\" Sudanese-Australian activist and author Yassmin Abdel-Magied previously told CNN. \u200b\"It's the same institutionalized racism, it's the same black deaths in custody and police getting away with it with impunity.\" Police apologize for arrestThe protests in Australia come after a 17-year-old indigenous boy was injured by a policeman in Sydney on Monday.Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the boy's mother, father and sister -- who asked not to be named by the media -- said the actions of the junior constable, who arrested and later freed their son without charge, were \"dangerous and uncalled for.\" They have called for charges to be brought against the officer. Video taken by an onlooker shows the junior constable kick the boy's legs out from underneath him and pin him to the ground with the help of two other officers. \"Watching this video as a family and seeing the appalling way this adult arrested a compliant child is chilling. The use of excessive force is unnecessary and irresponsible,\" the boy's sister said. The officer has been placed on restricted duties while the case is reviewed by the NSW Police Standards Command. Earlier on Wednesday, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he was \"absolutely\" sorry for the incident. CNN's Tara John, Melissa Bell and Barbara Wojazer contributed.",

        "content": "(CNN)While statues of slave traders, imperialists and US Confederate leaders are being torn down, removed or protested against in the English-speaking world, Belgium has begun removing statues of its one-time King Leopold II.Never heard of him. Who was King Leopold II? One of the most brutal and ambitious of the 19th century European exploiters of Africa, Leopold II was king of Belgium for more than 40 years, from 1865 to 1909. A first cousin of Queen Victoria, he ruled at a time when Europeans were colonizing -- that is, conquering -- other parts of the world. Leopold was responsible for a particularly cruel part of that conquest, during the so-called \"Scramble for Africa.\" What exactly did he do? Read MoreLeopold hired the adventurer Henry Morton Stanley to explore the Congo River basin, signing purported treaties with local leaders along the way. Leopold then used the treaties to stake a claim to an enormous chunk of central Africa -- more or less the territory that is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Belgium then as now had a parliament and government that actually ran the country, and they did not support Leopold's colonial plans, so he declared the \"Congo Free State\" to be his personal possession, not Belgium's, and got other countries including the United States and European powers to recognize him as its \"proprietor.\" What did he get out of that?A huge fortune, for starters, based first on ivory and then on rubber when the automobile and bicycle industries took off. Leopold used a private army to coerce Africans to gather wild rubber from the vines of the rainforests. His army would seize the women and children of villages to force men to collect rubber in ever-increasing quotas. That sounds brutal.It was worse than it sounds. Men were regularly worked to death, while hostages sometimes starved. Naturally, there were rebellions against the \"proprietor,\" who suppressed them with particular cruelty: His troops were ordered to produce the severed hand of a rebel for each bullet they expended. That meant if the troops shot and missed, they would sometimes cut the hand off a living person. Led by white officers, the troops themselves were often Africans, making them complicit in the trauma the colony suffered. Historians estimate that under Leopold's misrule, 10 million people died. Was that kind of behavior acceptable even then?Other colonial empires such as Portugal, France and Germany copied Leopold's methods, but by the end of his life, Leopold was seen as a villain and forced to relinquish control of the so-called Free State. He made Belgium buy it from him a year before his death, and it was renamed the Belgian Congo. It gained independence in 1960 and was first renamed Zaire, then the Democratic Republic of Congo after its long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was toppled in 1997. Leopold II seems largely to have been forgotten given what he did.Leopold's name may not be widely remembered today, but a phrase first used to describe his actions lives on: Crime against humanity.",

        "content": "(CNN)Over the weekend, thousands of people took part in Black Lives Matter marches across Australia. Yet these protesters weren't just marching to voice their anger about the mistreatment of African Americans in the United States -- they want to end entrenched discrimination against Australia's Indigenous population.The numbers back up their conviction that Australia needs to change. While the country's Indigenous population makes up just 3.3% of its 25 million people, they account for more than a quarter of its prisoners. Indigenous Australians are also almost twice as likely to die by suicide, have a life expectancy that is almost nine years lower, and have higher infant mortality rates than non-Indigenous Australians.That's just the tip of the iceberg, too. A study by Australian National University released Tuesday found that 75% of Australians hold a negative view of the nation's original inhabitants. \"This study presents stark evidence of the solid invisible barrier that Indigenous people face in society,\" said report author Siddharth Shirodkar. \"But the data is actually not about Indigenous Australians -- it's about the rest of us.\"In Australia, protesters demand justice over minority deaths in custodyAustralia's Indigenous peopleRead MoreThere are two Indigenous groups -- Aboriginal people who live on mainland Australia, and Torres Strait Islanders, who live on the 274 islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea, in the Torres Strait. Their diversity is reflected by distinct beliefs and regional knowledge of the country's harsh landscape, and more than 250 Indigenous language groups remain today, according to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.Aboriginal Australians are one of the world's oldest known civilizations, and arrived on the continent at least 45,000 years ago. By the time the British Empire began colonizing Australia in 1788, there were an estimated 1 million Aboriginal people living there. Despite that, the white colonizers saw Australia as a \"terra nullius\" -- a legal term meaning \"nobody's land\" -- and subsequently, the British government didn't recognize Indigenous ownership of the land.In the years that followed, huge numbers of Indigenous people died after being exposed to unfamiliar diseases such as influenza, venereal disease, typhoid, tuberculosis, pneumonia, measles and whooping cough. Many others were massacred by British colonizers.Between the 1790s and the 1930s, an estimated 2,000 British colonizers and more than 20,000 indigenous Australians died in violent conflicts, according to the institute.People hold up placards at a Black Lives Matter protest to express solidarity with US protestors in Melbourne on June 6, 2020.It was only in 1962 that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were allowed to vote in federal elections. Last year, Ken Wyatt became the first Aboriginal person to sit in Australia's Cabinet. Between 1910 and 1970, as many as one in three of all Indigenous children were removed from their families and placed in white households or institutions as part of a policy of assimilation. In 2008, then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd apologized to the so-called stolen generation, saying that Parliament \"resolves that the injustices of the past must never, never happen again.\"Aboriginal Australians todayUnlike other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand and Canada, Australia still doesn't have a treaty between its government and its Indigenous people. How Australia is failing its indigenous populationAnd, just as in the US, there are concerns about how Indigenous people are being treated by the police.In 1987, the government launched a Royal Commission into the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody after public concern that the deaths were too common and poorly explained. But analysis from Change the Record, a national Indigenous-led justice coalition, found there have been 449 deaths of Indigenous people in custody between 1980 and 2011 -- representing 24% of all deaths in custody over that period. No police officer has been convicted for a death in custody, national broadcaster ABC reported. The Black Lives Matter protests in the US and around the world have once again brought these issues to the fore.For some protesters, the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in the US drew parallels with David Dungay, an Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015. Like Floyd, Dungay's family say his last words were: \"I can't breathe.\"The weekend protests also came after a 17-year-old Indigenous boy was injured by a policeman in Sydney last week. Video taken by an onlooker shows the junior constable kick the boy's legs out from underneath him and pin him to the ground with the help of two other officers.The officer has been placed on restricted duties while the case is reviewed. Last week New South Wales state Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said he was \"absolutely\" sorry for the incident.Demands for changeWhen asked about Indigenous deaths in custody, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged it was an issue and said the government is working to address it.\"But what I do say is that Australia is not other places,\" he said last week. \"So let's deal with this as Australians and not appropriate what's happening in other countries to our country at this time.\"Advocates say that more change is needed. Dungay's family is calling for criminal charges to be brought against the correctional officers involved in his case.The family of Tanya Day, who died in police custody in 2017 in what a coroner ruled was a preventable death, called the deaths of Indigenous people in custody a \"stain on this country.\"Protesters marching in solidarity with protests in the United States on June 6, 2020 in Adelaide, Australia. \"Our families and communities are being decimated by the racism that infects police,\" the family said in a statement released by Change the Record, which has called on the Australian government to commit to ending Indigenous deaths in custody. \"Aboriginal deaths in custody must end.\"Amnesty International Australia director Sam Klintworth wants an independent and transparent investigation. \"Australia has a shameful record in its treatment of Indigenous people in custody,\" she said. \"To think this is a problem 'over there' and that Australia is free of the kind of racialized violence making international headlines, is to fundamentally misunderstand the issues in our backyard.\"Earlier this month, following the arrest of the Indigenous teenager in Sydney, New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the situation in the US was \"a good wake-up call for all of us.\"\"We have to ensure that we do what we can in our own country to protect all of our citizens,\" she said, according to a report on broadcaster SBS. \"We still have a long way to go in our own country.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A statue of Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell will be removed from a quayside in Dorset, southern England, as the UK continues to reckon with monuments of its imperialist past.The statue, which was installed in 2008, will be removed on Thursday, said local authority Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council in a statement.\"We acknowledge the differing views of the life activities of Baden-Powell and want to create time for all views to be aired, and to minimise the risk of any public disorder or antisocial behaviour that could arise were the statue to remain in situ,\" it said. The Dorset County Scouts group supports the removal, the council added.Baden-Powell became a military hero and then founded the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides.Vikki Slade, BCP council leader, called for discussions on the future of the statue.Read More\"Whilst famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powell's life that are considered less worthy of commemoration,\" she said in a statement.Britain's imperialist monuments face a bitter reckoning amid Black Lives Matter protests Slade also addressed the move in a Facebook post on Wednesday.\"I do not wish to see the statue removed,\" she wrote. \"However we have had police advice that this statue is on a target list for attack and due to its proximity to the water and its delicate and historic nature I was asked to approve its temporary removal.\"The move is part of a wave of actions against monuments glorifying the UK's colonial history. On Sunday, protesters in Bristol tore down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it into a river, and local authorities in east London removed a statue of slave owner Robert Milligan on Tuesday.Who was Baden-Powell?Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell, was born February 22, 1857 in London and died January 8, 1941 in Nyeri, Kenya, according to encyclopedia Britannica.He was revered as a national hero for his actions as a British Army officer in the South African War (1899-1902), and went on to found the Boy Scouts in 1908. Two years later, he co-founded the Girl Guides, a similar organization for girls.Scouts movementThe Scouts is aimed at boys aged between 10 and 14 years old. The organization says scouting \"exists to actively engage and support young people in their personal development, empowering them to make a positive contribution to society.\"Who is Cecil Rhodes and why are UK demonstrators protesting at his statue?Baden-Powell developed an interest in teaching young people when he found out his 1899 military textbook \"Aids to Scouting\" was being used for training boys in woodcraft.He decided to set up a trial camp for boys on Brownsea Island, near Poole, in 1907, and then wrote a book for what he called the Boy Scout movement.Before long there were Scout troops popping up across Britain, and Baden-Powell published a book called \"Scouting for Boys\" in 1908.Two years later Baden-Powell retired from his army position to concentrate on the Scouts, and founded the Girl Guides with his sister Agnes that same year.Why was he controversial?Critics of Baden-Powell say that he held homophobic and racist views, and sympathized with fascists like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.Former Bournemouth East Labour parliamentary candidate Corrie Drew told BBC Breakfast television Thursday: \"A quick look into his history shows that he was very open about his views against homosexuality and that he was a very open supporter of Hitler and of fascism and quite a strong, outspoken racist.\"She said: \"We can't just excuse people's shocking values because they were in the past,\" adding: \"We can commemorate the positive work without commemorating the man.\"King Leopold II statues are being removed in Belgium. Who was he? Drew added that the statue is not historic -- it has only been there for about a decade. \"It's not part of our history in itself,\" she said.However, some local politicians have spoken out in defense of the statue.Robert Syms, MP for Poole, wrote on Twitter: \"For the avoidance of doubt I am opposed to the permanent removal of the statue of Baden-Powell from Poole Quay.\"Conor Burns, MP for nearby Bournemouth West, called on BCP Council to put the statue back.\"The removal of the statue of Lord Baden Powell from Poole is a huge error of judgement,\" he tweeted.On Thursday morning locals in Poole gathered to show their support for the statue.",

Floyd died after a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota used his knee to pin the unarmed black man's neck to the ground for nearly nine minutes.In the lengthy Instagram post, Bergdorf told her 387,000 followers that she sought to highlight \"why allyship is a necessary component of anti-racist work.\"\"White folk -- Please bear in mind that this is what many black activists and trans activists inboxes look like. This is why we need you to be doing the work also. This is why allyship is a necessary component of anti-racist work.\"Bergdorf concluded her message on an optimist note, by quoting author, poet and activist Maya Angelou, writing: \"But still, we rise.\"",

We stand with all who act for positive change.\"pic.twitter.com/q1Ui8N29ai\u2014 NEW YORK KNICKS (@nyknicks) June 9, 2020 However, the Knicks have faced backlash, owing to the length of time it took for a statement to be released publicly and the omission of any reference to Black Lives Matter.Prominent Knicks fan and comedian Desus Nice retweeted the statement with the comment: \"DEFUND THE KNICKS.\"Read MoreSports talk show host Rich Eisen condemned the response as \"a complete and total disgrace.\"The Knicks' tweet issuing the statement has received over a thousand replies, almost all responding negatively. THE MSGC did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.New York Knicks owner James Dolan sent an internal email to employees explaining why the organization had not issued a public statement, before yesterday making a U-turn when there was backlash against this stance.'Turbulent time'Dolan, who supervises day-to-day operations of the Knicks and Rangers, had previously been criticized for an internal email he had sent to MSGC employees on June 1 explaining why the company had not issued a public statement in the aftermath of Floyd's death.In the email, obtained by ESPN, Dolan writes:  \"We know that some of you have asked about whether our company is going to make a public statement about the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\"I want you to know, I realize the importance of this issue. Therefore, I want you to understand our internal position.\"This is a turbulent time in our country. The coronavirus and civil unrest have taken their toll on our way of life.

It was tough, but we've made it.\"That is how La Liga president Javier Tebas describes the return of the top division of Spanish soccer.Spain has recorded a total of over 240,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including over 27,000 deaths, but with new daily cases of the virus now below 50, and after just over three months without football, La Liga resumes Thursday.Following on from the Bundesliga's example, games will be played with fans absent.Since the Bundesliga resumed, home advantage appears to have disappeared. Of the 46 Bundesliga games to have taken place, only 10 have been won by the home team, while 22 have been won by the away side.Read MoreOne twist in the La Liga run-in is that second-place Real Madrid will stage home games at its 6,000-seater Alfredo Di Stefano stadium -- where the club's second team plays -- while renovations continue at the 81,000-seater Santiago Bernabeu stadium.READ: Former Real Madrid star Esteban Granero is using his AI company to help fight coronavirus in SpainReal Madrid will play their remaining home games at the 6,000-seater Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano, where their B-team would usually play.Who will be champions?As the league returns, Barcelona sits at the top of the table with 58 points, two ahead of Real Madrid,  while third-placed Sevilla is nine points adrift of Los Blancos.If the reigning champion can win the league for the third time in a row, it will be Lionel Messi's 11th La Liga title of his career, meaning he would only be one behind the record of 12, currently held by Real Madrid legend Francisco Gento.It is one of the few La Liga records the Argentine has yet to break, and is one that Barcelona fans would undoubtedly love him to steal from their arch rivals in Madrid.Real Madrid players won't let this happen without a fight though -- as midfielder Lucas Vazquez recently told Real Madrid TV that his side would be treating each remaining game as if it were a cup final.If Barcelona win La Liga, Messi will have won 11 Spanish league titles during his career -- one short of Real Madrid legend Francisco Gento.\"That's the starting point for those 11 games that we have left,\" he said. \"Eleven finals, we take them like that, and hopefully from here to the end we can get all the victories and get the league title.\"Of the two teams, Barcelona arguably has a slightly more difficult run-in.Both El Clasico games have already taken place, but Barcelona still has to face 2013-14 La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, who are in a battle themselves to secure one of the four Champions League qualification spots. Diego Simeone's team is sixth in the table.Barca will be strengthened by the return of Luis Suarez though, who had been set to miss the remainder of the season following knee surgery, but has been able to recover in time after the suspension of the league because of the pandemic.READ: From footballer to Netflix superstar: How Jesus Mosquera became one of Spain's top actorsLuis Suarez has been able to recover from knee surgery in time for the resumption of La Liga.Alternative storylinesThe title fight isn't the only La Liga storyline.Thursday's fixture is the Seville derby, between Sevilla and Real Betis.Sevilla hasn't qualified for the Champions League in two seasons, and will be desperate to finish the season strongly.Also vying for one of the remaining qualification spots is Getafe, a team that has never qualified for the Champions League and was playing in the second division just two years ago.Getafe CF are pushing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in the club's history.At the bottom, having finished seventh last season, Espanyol currently prop up the La Liga table with only 20 points from 27 games.Relegation would be a disaster for a club that has played in the top division since 1993.The relegation zone is made up of Leganes on 23 points and Mallorca on 25, with Celta Vigo just one point above. Bottom-placed Espanyol are facing relegation from La Liga for the first time since 1993.The fan experienceWith matches being played behind closed doors, La Liga has come up with a plan to give the fans the most authentic experience possible in the circumstances.\"What we have decided is to give these two options on how the spectator wants to see the game: If they want to see it virtually with sound, or without sound,\" said Tebas.\"We have worked with a Norwegian company that specializes in virtual audience and EA Sports and [video game] FIFA, because when you play FIFA you hear the real stadium atmosphere in each place.\"I think we will see a good virtual reality, but they [the fans] will be able to choose what they want.\"",

The irony of the name was not lost. The six of us had formed as a bunch of friends at university with few expectations and still less musical ability. We had no issue with getting home from our respective jobs at 6 p.m., rehearsing until midnight then getting up at 7 a.m. to do it all again.

Traveling around with your mates in an unreliable van, meeting all sorts of wonderful people, is the best thing in the world and something we're very lucky to be able to do. I'd loved my time in the newsroom -- from the highs of interviewing Pele and Pep Guardiola to a feature about a race horse in a three-piece tweed suit -- but the opportunity to be in a full-time band wasn't going to come knocking again. Having once considered Cambridge's Portland Arms to be the pinnacle of our live aspirations, it's slightly surreal to have played legendary festivals like Glastonbury and headline shows as far afield as Los Angeles. That's not to say it's been a glamorous job switch -- as any touring musician whose diet has consisted chiefly of service station sandwiches for weeks at a time can attest. No longer able to afford London rent, four of us spent the better part of 18 months sharing a room that also doubled up as our rehearsal space. An ill-fated \"commuter belt tour\" memorably culminated in a gig in the small market town of Bishop's Stortford where there were more people on stage than in the audience. Waking up with banging headaches the morning after supporting Two Door Cinema Club at the O2 Arena, we found our van had been broken into in broad daylight and all our equipment stolen. Silverlake, June 2019READ: The death-defying jumps that caught the attention of HollywoodAnd yet it's all worth it.I know a lot of bands get jaded by life on the road, but there's really few things quite like the crackle of anticipation before a show -- whether on a festival main stage to 10,000 people or at your local pub to a few hundred kids. To that end, the journey since packing in the day jobs is probably best illustrated by a series of increasingly ambitious London headlines, from the 800-capacity Scala in September 2018 (where we infamously had less Twitter followers than the venue's capacity but somehow sold it out) to the 2,300-capacity O2 Forum a year later. Such gigs are what it's all about for us -- making the night an event worth booking the next day off work for -- and it's encouraging to note a decent contingent of former colleagues have attended not just the first out of duty but kept coming back.

        "content": "(CNN)Sweden has ended a 34-year investigation into the unsolved murder of the country's then-Prime Minister Olof Palme, saying the chief suspect is dead.Palme was gunned down as he took a late-night walk after visiting a cinema in central Stockholm with his wife, Lisbet, on February 28, 1986. The mystery over the murder of the Social Democratic leader has gripped Sweden for three decades, prompting much speculation over the assassin and their motive, as well as producing multiple conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, investigators have interviewed more than 10,000 people, and 134 possible suspects have confessed to the murder.Sweden's Chief Prosecutor Krister Petersson told a news conference in the country's capital on Wednesday that he believed the lone perpetrator to be a man named Stig Engstr\u00f6m but could do nothing more to prove it. Read More\"As the person is deceased, I cannot bring charges against him and have decided to discontinue the investigation. In my opinion, Stig Engstr\u00f6m is the prime suspect,\" he said. \"My assessment is that, after over 34 years, it is difficult to believe that any further investigation would provide us with any new details and therefore I believe we have come as far as one could expect.\"An April 1986 picture shows Stig Engstrom outside the Skandia offices at Sveav\u00e4gen in Stockholm.Suspicion focuses on one man, whom investigators \"cannot get around,\" he said. Engstr\u00f6m, also known as \"Skandia man\" after the insurance company where he worked, died in 2000.\"To a large extent, we have been at the mercy of the police investigative work that was performed closer to the time of the crime,\" said Petersson.\"All in all, there are a number of circumstances that point to Engstr\u00f6m. Had the current Palme investigation group been in charge 34 years ago, Engstr\u00f6m would have been remanded in custody had he been unable to provide satisfactory explanations for his movements and actions. My assessment is that there would have been sufficient evidence to have him detained in custody.\"A photo from February 28, 1986, shows the place where Olof Palme was killed in central Stockholm.False confessions, conspiracy theoriesSpeaking alongside Petterson, Hans Melander, head of the investigation, outlined the scale of the inquiry.\"It is by far Sweden's largest criminal investigation and is sometimes compared with the murder of JFK and [the] Lockerbie bombing. It has been ongoing since 1986 and contains 22,430 different points of interest,\" he said. \"Ninety-thousand people are included in the preliminary investigation, of which 40,000 are named. More than 10,000 people have been interviewed, many of them several times. More than 4,000 vehicles were investigated. And 134 people have confessed to committing the murder, including 29 directly to the police.\"Analysis of the two bullets found at the scene -- one of which killed the Prime Minister, while the other injured his wife -- was carried out by laboratories in Sweden and Germany as well as by the FBI in the United States, he said.But few traces were left on the .357 Magnum caliber metal-piercing bullets and it would be impossible now, given the passage of time, to match them to a specific weapon, Melander said.People lay roses on the grave of Olof Palme, on February 28, 2016 just a few blocks away from the place where he was shot and killed in the center of Stockholm.Conspiracy theories abounded after the death of Palme, who was a prominent left-wing figure on the global scene.One involved the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, said Melander, as that group had committed a couple of murders in Sweden at the time. About 20 people were taken in for questioning but they were released due to a lack of evidence.Others speculated that South Africa's apartheid regime may have played a role, motivated by Palme's opposition to apartheid and support for the African National Congress. This was \"quite an interesting lead due to quite specific motives,\" said Melander, but unfortunately there was \"no specific information\" to take inquiries forward.\"We have spent a lot of time trying to map other groups, persons and events in the time prior to the assassination trying to find traces of a conspiracy ... but we haven't been able to find any support for the conspiracy theory,\" Petersson said.Nonetheless, he added, \"it couldn't be rejected completely that he [Engstr\u00f6m] was part of a larger conspiracy.\"Engstr\u00f6m emerged as the main suspect in 2017 after the investigating team, which had recruited new members, reviewed all the evidence and found discrepancies between his statements and those of other witnesses, said Melander. The 52-year-old wasn't a focal point of the investigation at the time, Petersson said, but a closer look at his background revealed that he was used to weapons, having served in the military, and belonged to a shooting club.He was also considered by those in his circle to be \"very critical of the Prime Minister\" and his policies, Petersson said.Engstr\u00f6m told investigators he had been working late at his office in Sveav\u00e4gen, the street where the assassination occurred, on the evening in question. But what he wore fitted the description of the killer given by some witnesses and his version of events did not quite stack up.\"How he acted was how we believe the murderer would have acted,\" Petersson said.Conviction thrown outAt the time of the killing, many newspapers criticized authorities for bungling the investigation by not setting up roadblocks immediately and slowly cordoning off the scene. Two cabinet ministers, the national police force chief and the head of the national police intelligence agency were all forced to step down as the probe developed.A file image shows Christer Pettersson after he was acquitted on appeal in 1989 of Palme's murder.Convicted murderer, petty thief and drug addict Christer Pettersson -- no relation to the chief prosecutor -- was initially convicted of Palme's murder in 1988, in part due to testimony from the Prime Minister's wife, who witnessed the killing.Pettersson was serving a life sentence for Palme's death when his conviction was thrown out in an appeals court in 1989 due to insufficient evidence. He died in 2004. The discovery of a handgun in a central Stockholm lake in 2006 brought hopes of new developments in the inquiry but the case remained unsolved. Krister Petersson, who is one of Sweden's most distinguished prosecutors, specializing in organized crime, was brought in to oversee the investigation in 2016. He has been involved in a number of high-profile cases during his career including the 2003 murder of Anna Lindh, the then-foreign minister. CNN's Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Juventus star Paulo Dybala has warned football's authorities that the sport is at a tipping point, with players ready \"to take action\" in support of teammates who are racially abused.In April of last year, then Juventus striker Moise Kean was subjected to monkey chants from a section of Cagliari fans during a Serie A match. In the face of racist vitriol, the youngster scored and defiantly held his arms aloft in front of the home supporters. Cagliari wasn't punished for the incident.Argentine international Dybala, who is currently in training as Juventus prepares to restart the Italian football season in Friday's Coppa Italia match against AC Milan, recalls the impact it had on Kean and believes the country's football authorities must deliver tougher sanctions in a league that has been plagued by incidents of racist abuse.\"It really wasn't easy for him and I've experienced various situations of racism with other Juventus teammates in other stadiums,\" Dybala told CNN in an exclusive interview. \"Many Italian stadiums have certain racism against some players -- it has also happened to Mario Balotelli, it has also happened to (Miralem) Pjanic in a match against Brescia and I think that Italian punishments should be tougher.\"If not, then it will be us players who will have to take measures into our own hands so that this does not continue to happen, because we are talking about one of the biggest championships in the world, where millions of people are watching and if they see that there is racism and no action is taken, people get emboldened and continue doing it.Read MoreREAD: Joshua Kimmich says white players should stand in solidarity with their black teammatesREAD: Premier League players urged to take a knee in protest at George Floyd's deathMoise Kean celebrates after scoring against Cagliari.\"People who have to take action need to take it, or surely in a short time it will be players who will directly take action. As has happened many times in the past, many players are deciding to leave the pitch or not play and it seems to me a perfect decision because it is something that should not happen in a country.\"If society, in this case the Italian Federation, does not decide to do anything, the players should be the ones to act. Or, as the referees have done many times in the past, stop the match so that these people don't continue committing that crime.\"The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.Player protestsOn May 25, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in Minneapolis after being arrested by a white police officer who forcibly pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. His death has sparked widespread protests across the world.Since Floyd's death, several Bundesliga players and teams have joined those protests on the pitch, led by the quartet of Jadon Sancho, Achraf Hakimi, Weston McKennie and Marcus Thuram.Dybala believes that his black teammates should never think that they have to fight the racists alone.\"Sometimes it is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who suffers racism when you don't really ever suffer it, because you don't feel it,\" Dybala says. \"But you know what is going on because of having a teammate who suffers racism not only because of their skin color, but because of the country they're from that people discriminate against or that see as something bad.\"It is also not only because of the skin color, but people are discriminated against because of everything. I've seen Asian players who were with me in the youth team and these things are sad.Jadon Sancho was one of several Bundesliga players to protest George Floyd's death.\"Luckily, my family educated me differently and I can respect people for what they are, for their way of thinking and not because of how they are dressed, what country they are from or the color of their skin.\"I think everyone should grow up like that, but obviously it's not the case. Here, it is not the case that only people of color that should be fighting racism. Here we all have to be united as a society, as a world to do it.\"Following the racist abuse suffered by Kean against Cagliari, then Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri and defender Leonardo Bonucci were widely condemned for their comments on the incident.Bonucci said Kean had to take \"50-50 of the blame,\" while Allegri criticized the youngster for his celebration after scoring. The defender subsequently backtracked on his comments, saying he was \"misunderstood\" and \"too hasty\" and while Dybala acknowledges those comments were wrong, he believes they are not truly representative of the pair.\"At that time, they were not the right words for what was happening,\" Dybala says. \"You have to be very cautious when talking about certain things and delivering the right message that you want to say, because often the words are not taken as one really wants to say.\"Of course both the player and coach can learn from certain things, because I know them so well and I know that they don't have racist thoughts. Perhaps at the time they did not use the words they wanted to say. So, I repeat, I think that [fighting racism] is something that we have to do, so that does not happen on a football field.\"Juventus futureNicknamed 'La Joya' -- 'The Jewel' -- ever since his professional debut for Argentine side Instituto, Dybala has become one of Europe's most sought after players.Dybala humbly insists that he never expected to reach the heights of a club like Juventus, or have the opportunity to represent Argentina on the international stage.The duo of Paulo Dybala and Cristiano Ronaldo make up Juventus' star front line.The 26-year-old was born in Laguna Larga, a small town of just 6,000 people \"where dreams often seem unreachable,\" he says.Now, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Dybala is one of Juventus' most treasured possessions. Given how important he is to Maurizio Sarri's team, it seems absurd to think that this time last year he almost left the club.\"It was more or less last year at this point when Juventus didn't want to count on me, didn't want me to continue playing here,\" Dybala recalls. \"That's when I was contacted and there were some clubs that were interested in me. Among those were Manchester United and Tottenham. I think for a long time there were conversations, then Paris Saint-Germain also appeared.\"I did not speak directly to any of them, but there were conversations with the clubs. However, my intention at the time was to stay. I hadn't had a good year or a positive last six months, so I didn't want to leave with that image because I think I had given the club a lot of nice moments and it wasn't fair that I went like this.\"So I also communicated that my intention was to stay, work to grow and give my best here. Obviously it was not easy because Juventus' intentions were different, but after the market closed, there was no more time and with the arrival of Sarri I grew a lot. The team started playing football much better and that made me stay and I've had a great year until today.\"Given some of Europe's biggest clubs were scrambling for his signature, it comes as some surprise that Juventus are yet to tie down their star man beyond the summer of 2022.Dybala is clear-headed and only sees his future in Turin, but admits it's a decision that will need to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.Paulo Dybala performs his trademark goalscoring celebration.\"For now there is nothing, really,\" Dybala admits. \"I have a year-and-a-half left on my contract, which is not much, and I understand that with all this that has happened [coronavirus] it isn't easy for the club, but other players have also renewed -- so we are here waiting.\"Obviously I am a player of this club and I am happy to be here. People love me very much and I love the people very much. I have great appreciation for the club and the people who are here, I have a good relationship with my president and surely at some point they will come to chat -- or maybe not, I don't know,\" he laughs.\"At some point maybe there may be some possible renewal, but it depends on Juventus.\"Dybala is one of very few players to have had the joy of playing alongside both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, by some distance the two greatest players on their generation.While away on international duty with Argentina, the pair rarely speak about football but Dybala admits playing alongside his international teammate at club level is an attractive proposition.\"The truth is that Barcelona is huge team worldwide and with Messi there even bigger,\" he says. \"It would be very nice, but Juventus is also an incredible club, very big, full of history, where there are currently great players.\"There's enough quality here to make two teams to and the chance to play with [Gianluigi] Buffon and Cristiano Ronaldo, who make the club even bigger.\"",

Who was he?Read MoreCecil Rhodes was one of the leading figures in British imperialism at the end of the 19th Century, pushing the empire to seize control over vast areas of southern Africa, first as a businessman and later as prime minister of Cape Colony in what is now South Africa.Why did he do that?Rhodes had both financial and political reasons. He co-founded the De Beers diamond company, which sought to control ever greater territory for its diamond mining. In Rhodes' lifetime, the company controlled about 90% of the world's diamond mines.But he also held a deep-seated belief that the British should run things because they were simply better than other people. As he famously put it: \"You are an Englishman, and have subsequently drawn the greatest prize in the lottery of life.\" (The quote is often summarized as \"to be born an Englishman is to win first prize in the lottery of life.\")What territory are we talking about here?Two colonies that were named after him -- Northern and Southern Rhodesia. They're now the countries of Zimbabwe and Zambia.Why is there a statue of him at Oxford University?Born in England, Rhodes attended Oriel College, Oxford, and left money to the college in his will. There also used to be a statue of him in Cape Town, South Africa, but it was torn down in 2015 because of Rhodes' association with white rule. The South African #RhodesMustFall movement inspired similar protests at Oxford, but the statue there remains.Did Rhodes do anything good?He established the Rhodes Scholarships in his will to enable young people from around the world to study at Oxford. Famous Rhodes scholars include former President Bill Clinton, former UN Ambassador Susan Rice, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, TV host Rachel Maddow and singer/actor Kris Kristofferson.",

National Action became the first far-right group to be banned under Britain's terror laws in December 2016. It is a criminal offense in the UK to be a member of the organization, which has been described by the country's Home Office as \"virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic.\"Angela Merkel lambasts her party's cooperation with far-right AfDAccording to police, the four became members of the neo-Nazi group and met regularly to share their extreme ideology and attend demonstrations. When the organization was banned, police noted that the group held secret meetings to discuss their ambitions for a race war, recruited young people to the group and shared \"intensely shocking\" images mocking the Holocaust and glorifying Hitler.Read MoreAt sentencing on Tuesday, Cutter and Jones were jailed for three years and five and a half years respectively, while Jack received a four and a half year sentence, and Scothern 18 months, police said. Another man, Daniel Ward, 29, pleaded guilty at a previous court hearing and was jailed for three years last July.Garry Jack, Connor Scothern and Daniel Ward, members of the banned extreme right-wing neo-Nazi group National Action. Cutter, who entered the \"Miss Hitler\" beauty competition as Miss Buchenwald -- a reference to the Nazi death camp -- denied being a member of the group, despite attending rallies where banners reading \"Hitler was right\" were raised, PA news agency reported.Judge Paul Farrer QC told Cutter that while she did not hold an organizational or leadership role in the group, she was a \"trusted confidante\" of one the group's leaders, as well as being in a \"committed relationship\" with Jones, PA reported.Farrer noted that Jones had \"a significant role in the continuation of the organization\" after the ban.Facebook was flooded with far-right content ahead of the EU election, campaigners sayThe court heard that all four had denied membership of National Action, but had attended a post-ban meeting of senior leaders and members in 2017, according to PA. In a statement, Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said that authorities have seen a \"significant increase\" of right-wing referrals to the Prevent counter-terrorism program.\"Terrorists and extremists use this kind of ideology to create discord, distrust and fear among our communities and we strive to counter this. I would encourage people to report hate crime to us and it will be taken seriously,\" he said in a statement.  Ahead of sentencing, director of public prosecutions Max Hill QC described National Action members as \"diehards\" who \"hark back to the days of not just anti-Semitism, but the Holocaust, the Third Reich in Germany,\" PA reported.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Thousands of demonstrators gathered in London on Saturday, in a largely peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd and systemic racism in the United States and around the world.Activists braved bad weather to fill Parliament Square in the British capital during the day, but more heated scenes unfolded in the evening when a small number of protesters clashed with police outside Downing Street, the official residence of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.In one incident, video posted online showed a police horse suddenly bolting, causing its officer to crash into a street light and fall to the ground. The loose horse then caused panic as it ran through groups of protesters, before making its way back to police stables. The officer is receiving hospital treatment but her injuries are not life-threatening, London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Earlier in the day, sizable crowds defied calls from the government and police that people should stay home to limit the spread of Covid-19.Read MoreA mounted police officer lays on the road after her horse bolted.They joined together to chant Floyd's name and \"Black Lives Matter,\" at one point all taking a knee in unison outside Parliament.  \"I feel that what happened in the US was just a spark, that sparked everywhere ... I do think George Floyd's death sparked it across the world and I think it's amazing,\" one protester told CNN. \"It's a worldwide issue, no matter where you are. It's an issue everywhere, we all need to rise up,\" another added.The rally follows similar demonstrations in the city in recent days. Last weekend protesters flocked to Trafalgar Square, and on Wednesday actor John Boyega gave an impassioned speech at an event in Hyde Park.And it comes despite warnings from politicians that mass gatherings should not take place while the country is in lockdown. \"I completely understand people's desire to express their views and to have that right to protest, but the fact of the matter is, we are in a health pandemic across the United Kingdom,\" UK Home Secretary Priti Patel said Saturday during an interview with Sky News.Protesters outside Parliament in London on Saturday.\"I would say to those that want to protest, please don't,\" she added. While little social distancing has been observed at the demonstration, people were seen handing out free masks and gloves to protect protesters from spreading the virus.Officers were not wearing protective riot equipment during the daytime rally, but as the protests wound down in the evening scenes turned more tense and officers with protective equipment were deployed.Police said a total of 14 arrests were made and 10 officers received injuries, but noted that the majority of protesters had acted peacefully.\"We understand peoples' passion to come and let their voice be heard, they protested largely without incident,\" Superintendent Jo Edwards, the spokesperson for policing the demonstration, said in a statement.\"Our officers have been professional and very restrained but there was a smaller group intent on violence towards police officers.\"An investigation is being carried out regarding the horse incident, the statement added. Videos appeared to show that the horse suddenly bolted from a police line. \"To the thousands of Londoners who protested peacefully today: I stand with you -- and I share your anger and your pain,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Saturday evening. \"To the tiny minority who were violent -- you endangered a safe and peaceful protest and let down this important cause.\"Crowds gather in FranceIn France, similar protests took place on Saturday. Protesters in Paris carried signs reading \"Justice for George Floyd\" and \"Racism is also a pandemic,\" and chanted \"being born black is not a crime\" as they formed crowds outside the US Embassy.Demonstrators gather on the Champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower during a demonstration in Paris Saturday.Several thousand demonstrators gathered on the Champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower. French authorities had banned such rallies, citing health measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The US Embassy was barricaded Saturday morning to prevent public access. But demonstrators still gathered Saturday in Paris and in other cities, including Lille, Marseille, and Nice. French TV stations showed police firing tear gas and clashing with protesters in Lille.On Tuesday, a demonstration banned by the police prefect brought together at least 20,000 people in Paris in support of the family of Adama Traor\u00e9,  black man who died in 2016 under Paris police custody.

The Norweigan, who played for the club for 11 seasons, took over from Jose Mourinho as caretaker manager in December 2018, winning 14 of his first 19 games in charge, and signing a contract to take over on a permanent basis in March 2019. \"I think he's done a tremendous job.\"@Pschmeichel1 tells @AmandaDCNN that his former Manchester United teammate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has 'far exceeded' his expectations as manager of the club. \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/pFa2r88QrW pic.twitter.com/T2UGjDsHyK\u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) June 9, 2020 He has since endured an up-and-down time at the helm, with inconsistent results in the Premier League leaving United fifth in the table while also qualifying for the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League before the season was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. But while others might criticize Solskjaer for not immediately leading the club back to the heights it reached under Sir Alex Ferguson, Schmeichel thinks he is making the most of the resources at his disposal. \"I think he's done a tremendous job. I think he's far exceeded my expectations on what could be done in a relatively short period of time, it has to be said,\" Schmeichel told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies in an Instagram Live chat.

They're different in their approach, their different in the players they like. So he's not really had an opportunity to build what he wants but he has.

The Brazilian international had become a figure of derision following a string of underwhelming performances having arrived from Shakhtar Donetsk for a reported fee of $59.8m (\u00a347m) in 2018.But his development under Solskjaer is evidence of the positive impact the manager has had. \"Fred has been, for me, absolutely instrumental in how well the club has done this season,\" Schmeichel said. \"He was always perfect for the club but he's now been given playing time and the more time he's been given, the more confidence he's gained and for me, he's been one of the great stories this season at Manchester United. \"Of course it's down to Fred but it's down to Ole for giving him that confidence. I like that. I like the way he's kind of introduced players that were already there but are now in the first team and are now playing well. \"He's also brought all these values in. The players now know them. If you don't share our values, there's no place for you here. So you have to live up to his values. And he's bringing in his own culture and you can see it and it's there and it's brilliant.\"READ: As he fights racial injustice, Raheem Sterling says he's 'not thinking about his job'Solskjaer consults Fred after the Premier League match against Manchester City.Schmeichel and Solskjaer were United teammates for three seasons between 1996 and 1999 and are both seen as legends of the club. Between the two, they won a combined 11 Premier League titles and played vital roles in the historic 1999 treble-winning season, which culminated in the iconic Champions League victory in Barcelona. For Manchester United to reach the heights achieved under Ferguson, reaching the Champions League would be a \"massive leap,\" according to Schmeichel. \"Getting into the Champions League, that is a massive leap towards (winning the Premier League in the future),\" the former Denmark goalkeeper said. \"Not getting into the Champions League is not a disaster because it's another year of development and I don't think there's anything wrong in taking one step back to take two steps forward. \"But if we could manage to get into the Champions League, that would mean that the up-and-coming transfer windows will have a different feel to it because the best players in the world want to compete in the Champions League.\"",

Researchers led by the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Population Health warned that although transmission of the virus to infants was uncommon and most women had \"good outcomes,\" the high proportion of infected women from black or minority backgrounds \"needs urgent investigation and explanation.\"A separate government review by Public Health England found last week that members from the UK's ethnic minority communities are up to 50% more likely to die with coronavirus than their white British peers. The latest study is based on data from the UK's Obstetric Surveillance System, a national system established to study a range of rare disorders of pregnancy. Why black Americans are at higher risk for coronavirusThe researchers said that of 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 between March 1 and April 14, more than half were from minority groups, including 25% who were Asian and 22% who were black. Read MoreMost of the women were in their late second or third trimester, 70% were overweight or obese, 40% were aged 35 or over, and a third had pre-existing conditions, the researchers said. The study noted that while published evidence on the rate, transmission and effect of coronavirus infection in pregnancy is limited, some evidence had suggested that pregnant women and their babies are at greater risk of severe illness and death.However, an April study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecolocy found that the majority of pregnant women who are diagnosed with coronavirus don't experience more severe illness than the general population.  The coronavirus pandemic is hitting black and brown Americans especially hard on all frontsTwelve babies born to mothers in the study tested positive for coronavirus, six of them within the first 12 hours of their lives.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned that being black or from a ethnic minority background was a \"major\" Covid-19 risk factor. In an address to parliament last week, Hancock said there was \"much more work to do to understand the key drivers of these disparities, the relationships between the different risk factors and what we can do to close the gap.\"Public Health England's analysis found that the link between ethnicity and health was \"complex and likely to be the result of a combination of factors.\"\"Firstly, people of BAME [black and minority ethnic] communities are likely to be at increased risk of acquiring the infection,\" the government review said, noting that minorities are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas, and have jobs that expose them to higher risk.\"People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences,\" it added.The groups are \"also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection,\" the agency's report found.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet also warned that Covid-19 had exposed inequalities within society and was having a disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities, including people of African descent.CNN's Zamira Rahim contributed to this report.",

FIFPRO, the global players' union, also that month warned that women's football was faced with an \"existential threat\" if the game was not protected.Read MoreBut Young's story has a happier ending. Four weeks after the initial decision, AFC Fylde reversed course and next season, whenever that may be, the women's team will continue to play in the National League Northern Premier Division.\"A lot has changed,\" explains Young who, as part of the restructure, will become joint-manager, alongside Kim Turner.\"The club is picking up the basic finances, in terms of league fees, training facilities, but there's no funding for expenses. We're trying to do some fundraising; we're looking for sponsorships and we're hoping we can make up that money elsewhere.\"There is a light at the end of the tunnel. The backlash at what happened to us, and we're at tier three, has been an eye opener. This game has come on so much in the past 10 years.\"Twelve months ago, France hosted a Women's World Cup which propelled women's football into the sporting mainstream. Beamed around the world, the competition broke viewing figures and dominated news bulletins, transforming the likes of US Women's National Team stars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan into household names far beyond their home country.But has the momentum gained during France 2019, when the USWNT swaggered to a record fourth world title, been lost? With its leagues less established and sponsorship and broadcasting deals generally lower than in the men's game, how much will women's football suffer?Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosRapinoe celebrates scoring her team's first goal during the 2019 Women's World Cup quarter-final against France.Uncertainty is not new to women's football and neither is inequity. It is those most at peril who are always most exposed. And France 2019 was never perfect.Not only did the tournament starkly highlight how women's football was at a different stage of development from country to country, it also brought focus on the differences between the men's and women's tournaments, from the marketing of the two showpiece events to prize money.Megan Rapinoe: USWNT captain, World Cup winner and campaigner for social justice And in the moments after the final ended in Lyon there were boos for Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president, at the Olympic Stadium and chants of \"equal pay\" in support of the USWNT players' fight for pay equity. That battle is still ongoing. Women's footballers around the globe would have still been battling on numerous fronts even had a pandemic not brought societies to a standstill.As each country's experience of Covid-19 has differed, so too has the response and the speed at which a return to some semblance of normalcy is attempted. It is, after all, at first a public health issue.In the same week as England's Football Association ended the season for its top two women's leagues, Germany's Frauen Bundesliga restarted behind closed doors.It is not that Germany's leagues have not been financially hit by Covid-19. Last month Kicker magazine reported 13 of the 36 top clubs faced insolvency.But, crucially, four of the country's leading clubs -- Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Bayer Leverkusen -- have contributed heavily to a solidarity fund for teams in the men's third division and the Frauen Bundesliga, which covers the cost of coronavirus testing.Fritz Keller, President of the German Football Association (DFB), said by resuming the season the Frauen Bundesliga was \"taking on a pioneering role in international women's football.\"Barrett (front, r) tries to battle off Wolfsburg's Joelle Wedemeyer (l).Amber Barrett and Lara Dickenmann were part of the first match of the league's resumption after a two-month shutdown as their respective teams, FC Koln and Wolfsburg, played behind closed doors at the AOK Stadion on May 29.Both talk of their angst at returning and of how the clubs' management of their health and well-being eased initial concerns.\"This [the resumption of the Frauen Bundesliga] is going to do huge things for women's football in Germany, but it's also going to do huge things for women's football in general,\" Barrett tells CNN Sport.\"It just shows there's an intent there. If we want women's football to be taken seriously, we need to take it seriously.\"Players have been regularly tested and were gradually reintroduced to contact training. \"We weren't allowed to touch any of the equipment; everything was sterilized,\" says Barrett of FC Koln's first 10 days of training while socially distancing.There were oddities, Barrett admits, as the team was split into four dressing rooms on matchday, substitutes had to socially distance and no embracing was allowed during goal celebrations in a match which three-time defending champion Wolfsburg won 4-0.FC Koln's Eunice Beckmann (r) evades Wolfsburg's Anna Bl\u00e4sse.Disconcerted by how the players' voices were amplified by the absence of fans, Dickenmann watched the game unfold from the substitutes' bench. The return of the league is a positive for her and her teammates, the Swiss says, but there are concerns for teams which aren't as well funded as the league's top two teams, Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich.Women's World Cup: As champions for equality, USWNT to be admired in its fight for lasting change\"The gap between the best teams and the last-place teams has got even bigger and we have a lot of games,\" Dickenmann explains. Thirty-eight matches will be played in the Frauen Bundesliga in four weeks, with the season ending on June 28.\"We have a big squad, but other teams don't have that luxury and, for them, it's going to be hard to get through these weeks without injuries.\"Though Germany has showed what is possible, some players are concerned about the prospect of playing behind closed doors. \"Our recognition comes from the number of people who attend our games,\" Ada Hegerberg, who plays in France's Division 1 F\u00e9minine, which has been canceled for this season, told CNN's Christina Macfarlane last month.Charlie Dobres is the marketing director of Lewes FC, a fan-owned English club which says it is the first and only gender equal club in the world. Planning for football's resumption in England is ongoing, he says, and the club is working on the presumption that Lewes' men's and women's teams will be playing behind closed doors when the next season starts.Playing in the Championship, the second tier of English women's football, with no lucrative broadcasting deal to boost the coffers, Lewes FC Women needs matchday revenue.Over the last two seasons, attendances for women's games at Lewes had quadrupled to an average of around 600 a match.But though Dobres admits he's extremely worried about the future of the women's game, he also regards this crisis as an opportunity and has called for next season's matches in English football's top two women's divisions to be broadcast live on television. The Frauen Bundesliga, for example, is being broadcast free-to-air in the UK and is also being shown in Scandinavia and Mexico.\"Instead of Covid-19 being an extinction-level event, it could actually be an incredible gateway into a whole new step change to women's football,\" he tells CNN Sport.\"If you have those venues in place, and the broadcasting structure in place, and there's no crowds, then the argument says simply if you're going to show a men's match in X,Y or Z venue at three o'clock and use exactly the same infrastructure, protocols and the same everything, crucially with the same available audience, then play women's matches as well on the same day.\"This opens the door for bigger broadcasting deals for women's football going forward and the other crucial factor [is], since there's no live sport you can attend, you have a captive audience at home.\"JUST WATCHEDTime Out: Ada Hegerberg on Megan Rapinoe and equality in women's footballReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTime Out: Ada Hegerberg on Megan Rapinoe and equality in women's football 03:28Project Restart, a term coined to describe the return of the behemoth that is the English Football League, has dominated to such an extent in England that little airspace has been given to when or how the next season will start for the leagues whose current campaigns have been ended.\"Our sense is that given all the massive publicity and the backing of the Premier League, we're not hearing yet in those discussions exactly the same urgency to also start top women's football and that's interesting. It's depressing and interesting, and also incredibly easy to change,\" says Dobres.\"All of this is a choice and it's really a choice of the people who hold the power. That isn't us; they aren't clubs or individual players. They are the authorities, be that FIFA, the FA, government, etc., and, to some extent, the choice is also held by the big commercial players in the football space, the broadcasters for example. We want to influence that decision.\"We're really afraid it might not happen. There's definitely a world, if you go by past behaviors, the most likely outcome is that women's football will be diminished by this crisis and women's football will be set back.\"The next few months are a test of vision. They're a test of how big their vision is. If you believe that football should have absolute equity and that's your starting point, then all your actions and decisions flow from that.\"Following the 2019 World Cup, FIFA promised to double its investment into women's football over the next four years to $1 billion and earlier this year it said it had distributed nearly $8.5 million in solidarity funding to both professional and grassroots clubs for players that played at last year's World Cup. in a statement to CNN, Sarai Bareman, FIFA's Chief Women's Football Officer, said the governing body had \"undertaken an extensive process of stakeholder consultation to gather information on the impacts the virus has had at all levels of the women's game.\"She added: \"As football gradually returns to play, we must work collectively with our members and all football stakeholders to ensure that the momentum for the women's game is not lost.\"Collectively, we have the ability to ensure that the level of growth and momentum is maintained, and even increased, as football clubs in many countries begin to reopen their playing fields once again to players and staff.\"Barcelona forward Toni Duggan (R) celebrates during the Spanish league football match against Atletico.Spain is the other major European powerhouse to call time on its top women's league this season. For La Liga Iberdrola, this was the first season it had sold its TV rights.Speaking on a Soccerex webinar in May, days before the La Liga Iberdrola season was cut short, Pedro Malabia, Director of Women's Football for La Liga, said: \"Our clubs, if the season finished as it is, we would lose in TV rights alone nearly \u20ac600,000 ($671,949), plus all the commercial, plus other incomes.\"That is a lot of money for women's teams to lose. But, just as the La Liga Iberdrola has studied the National Women's Soccer League in the US for strategies on how to build its brand -- and successfully so as a world record attendance of 60,739 was recorded for a women's club match last year as Atletico Madrid hosted Barcelona -- so, too, it and other leagues could learn from the NWSL on how to adapt in the current climate.US women's national soccer team players ask for appeal and trial delay after judge dismisses equal pay claimsLast month the NWSL announced that a 25-game tournament, the 2020 NWSL Challenge Cup, would be played in Utah from June 27, which will make it the first US sports league to return to action. \"It was really important to find a way to continue that momentum,\" NSWL Commissioner Lisa Baird told reporters, referring to the momentum built by the USWNT's triumph in France, and speaking before reports emerged that Rapinoe would not be taking part. \"We have an exciting format and [having] the best players on the planet in our league gives us a chance to play off that momentum, maybe not in the way we thought we would, but in a good way.\"Tournament costs are covered through sponsorship and TV deals -- CBS All Access will show the games, which will also be made available worldwide via Twitch. Dell Loy Hansen, owner of Utah Royals FC, will provide accommodation and training facilities for the league's nine teamsLynsey Douglas, the Global Lead for Women's Sport at sports industry analysts Nielsen Sports, believes the next few weeks are crucial for women's sport.\"We're seeing so much flexibility and innovation that we've never seen in sports ... that's a massive opportunity for women's sport, to be on the same page, on the same table when all this replanning and different ideas are coming up,\" she tells CNN Sport.\"The last few weeks has shown that women's sport is being really challenged and there's a danger that that opportunity is potentially going to be missed. It's important the next few weeks, the major governing bodies, the major leagues, clubs, to look at women's sport and where it fits in all of this.\"It should be an opportunity for women's sport to come out better, come out on some more equal footing, but now the reality is there's a massive challenge that women's sport might go backwards, might be left out from the table.\"It's a major inflection point as to what's going to come out of this and where do we stand in women's sport.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II has likened the British public's response to the coronavirus pandemic with the efforts of its soldiers during World War II, in a televised speech delivered exactly 75 years after her father marked the end of fighting in Europe.Speaking on the 75th anniversary of VE Day, the Queen remembered her own experiences of the end of fighting on the continent and praised the \"strength and courage\" of British and Allied troops who brought about Germany's surrender on May 8, 1945.\"Never give up, never despair -- that was the message of VE Day,\" the monarch said. \"I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\"Acknowledging the impact on modern British life of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced this year's public commemorations to be canceled, she also drew parallels between the UK's wartime generation and their modern compatriots.Related coverageHow is VE Day being celebrated this year?Last Nazi message decoded by Britain revealedIn photos: Muted celebrations around the world\"Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps,\" she said at the conclusion of her speech. \"But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.Read More\"When I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognize and admire,\" the Queen added.The monarch's message was broadcast 75 years to the minute after her father, King George VI, gave a radio address to the country in which he praised a \"great deliverance\" and announced that \"Germany, the enemy who drove all Europe into war, has been finally overcome.\"On 8 May 1945, Prime Minister Winston Churchill also announced to the British nation that the Germans had \"signed the act of unconditional surrender.\" Churchill concluded his speech by saying: \"Advance Britannia, long live the cause of freedom, God save the King.\" On this day -- VE Day -- Buckingham Palace was a focal point of the celebrations.\"At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,\" the Queen said on Friday, thanking the UK, the Commonwealth and other Allied nations for their efforts. \"But we kept faith that the cause was right -- and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.\"The speech marked the second time the 94-year-old monarch has addressed the country since the coronavirus outbreak began -- usually a rare occurrence saved only for her annual Christmas Day message.A VE Day tribute is displayed in London's deserted Piccadilly Circus on Friday.It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to announce the country's plan to tentatively emerge from its lockdown in a separate televised speech on Sunday. Those restrictions, more draconian than any curbs on British life seen since World War II, have left VE Day celebrations around the world significantly muted and forced planned public gatherings in London and other cities to be scrapped.The Queen recalled far more jubilant scenes 75 years ago. \"The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound,\" she said.Elizabeth, then a 19-year-old monarch in waiting, celebrated with her family and Churchill at Buckingham Palace before slipping out with her sister, Princess Margaret, to join celebrating crowds in London in 1945. \"I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief,\" she recalled of the day in a 1985 clip re-shared by the royal family earlier on Friday. \"After crossing Green Park, we stood outside and shouted, 'We want The King!' and we were successful in seeing my parents on the balcony ... I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life.\"Earlier on Friday, much of the country observed two minutes of silence, and Johnson tweeted that the nation's gratitude to those who fought in the war will be \"eternal.\" The Red Arrows display team conducted a flyover in London.'I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.'The Queen was 19 years old on VE Day.

Conflict continued in Asia and the Pacific until the Japanese surrender on August 15. \"The wartime generation knew that the best way to honor those who did not come back from the war, was to ensure that it didn't happen again,\" the Queen said in her Friday speech. \"The greatest tribute to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all.\"CNN's Hilary McGann contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Working two jobs is a lot for anyone to take on, let alone an elite athlete on a mission to make her first Olympic Games. That's been the reality for British shot putter Sophie McKinna who has been balancing her dream of Olympic glory with work as both a custody officer and gym instructor for years. Her work with the local constabulary makes up the majority of her income and serves as a perfect distraction from her sporting career, even if things get occasionally heated. \"We're like the bouncers. If people start kicking off, we deal with that so it's an interesting job,\" she told CNN Sport. \"It gets the blood pumping sometimes when you have someone difficult.\" Read MoreREAD: The 'Lost Games' -- When the Olympics are stopped by extraordinary world eventsSophie McKinna rejected funding in order to keep her routine. Rejecting fundingThe nature of the job requires McKinna to keep her calm during some testing situations but it's a challenge she's enjoyed as her throws keep getting bigger. \"You walk in and every day is different,\" she said. \"You don't know what you're going to get.\"I really enjoy my work and it gives me that headspace away from athletics.\"The recent lockdown has only underlined how important such a distraction is to McKinna, who has temporarily stepped away from her role to keep herself safe from the virus. She's been able to continue training in her garden but is struggling with living, sleeping and practicing in the same place. It's for this reason that McKinna opted to reject funding from British Athletics earlier this year, a move that saw her turn down \u00a315,000 a year and the chance to turn fully professional.What seems like a strange decision made perfect sense to McKinna who was determined that nothing would upset her preparation ahead of an Olympic year. \"If I became a professional athlete, my brain would turn to mush because I'd be too close to it,\" she said. \"I've learned that in isolation because I'm right on top of where I'm training [...] so you don't get that little spark or buzz that I usually get.\"If I became a professional athlete, that would be my reality every day and I don't think I'd cope particularly well with it.\" READ: 'My emotions are usually outside my body and that's not what you usually connect to a chess player'McKinna started her youth career off as a sprinter. 'Painful' postponement McKinna had all but guaranteed her seat on the plane to Tokyo 2020 this summer before the spectacle was postponed amid the coronavirus crisis.She had already thrown the required qualifying distance at the Doha World Championships in 2019 and just needed to finish in the top two at the British championships -- something well within her capabilities. Admitting her initial reaction to the postponement was one of disappointment, the 25-year-old was quick to put things into perspective. \"It was painful and the instant reaction is to think there has to be some way for it to go ahead,\" said McKinna, who worked tirelessly for 12 years to get into her enviable position.\"Sport is hugely important in my life but people losing their lives, losing their loved ones, is so much more important than me throwing a ball as far as I can.\"McKinna was excited to represent her country before organizers postponed Tokyo 2020. 'Typical teenager'Although sport was seemingly her destiny -- her grandad was a professional footballer and manager of Norwich City -- shot put wasn't her initial calling. Instead it was the more glamorous appeal of sprinting that caught her attention first, and her talent was clear to see at a local level. Despite a host of county medals, she knew she'd never break into the world's elite as a sprinter. It was, in fact, her mother who persuaded her reluctant 13-year-old daughter to have a go at throwing.\"As a typical teenager I said 'No, I'm not doing that, it's not cool, no chance.' I obviously ended up doing it because she had paid for it and I'd get in trouble if I didn't,\" she recalls. JUST WATCHEDIn lockdown, Olympic champion Missy Franklin has leaned into therapy lessonsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIn lockdown, Olympic champion Missy Franklin has leaned into therapy lessons 01:13Virtual competition Within eight weeks of that first session, McKinna finished second in her age group at the national championships and quickly recognized her own her potential. She hasn't looked back since. Last year saw her throw a lifetime best at the World Championships in Doha, a moment met with pure ecstasy and a celebratory run across the track. It was that throw that all but confirmed her place in Tokyo, an experience that will now have to wait until next year.In the meantime, McKinna has had to make do with virtual competitions over video calls. READ: Skateboarder Sky Brown, 11, hospitalized after horrific fallShe and a number of other British athletes have so far competed in two virtual competitions where amateurs from around the world are encouraged to video themselves throwing whatever they have at their disposal. The initiative has also been raising money for the British NHS as it continues to fight the pandemic. \"It's something close to my heart and it's something I want to get involved in,\" said McKinna, whose sister works in a hospital.\"It's also about putting throwing into the forefront. You don't normally get to see shot put on the television; it's normally the running events, so it's nice to be the sole event. \"It's really nice to see. People were drawing chalk circles on the floor and just giving it a go.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The architect of Sweden's coronavirus response has defended the country's controversial decision not to go into lockdown, while admitting \"improvements\" could be made with the benefit of hindsight.As the coronavirus pandemic swept across the world and governments scrambled to enact emergency lockdown measures, Sweden was labeled an outlier for its seemingly relaxed approach that imposed only light restrictions on daily life. Its measures were markedly different from its Nordic neighbors, keeping most schools, restaurants, salons and bars open. It did, however, ask people to refrain from making long journeys, placing an emphasis on personal responsibility. Sweden's Covid-19 death toll now stands at 4,542, while Denmark's is 580 and Norway's is 237, according to Johns Hopkins University. \"There are things that we could have done better but in general I think that Sweden has chosen the right way,\" Sweden's chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said Wednesday, in an interview with Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter.Much of the criticism around Sweden's response has focused on the high death rates in care homes. Tegnell admitted the country's Public Health Agency \"didn't know that there would be such a big potential for the disease to spread in elderly care homes, with so many deaths.\"Read More\"We knew that group was very fragile and that we would get a lot of deaths if they got infected. But we didn't know that the disease would enter so easily and for the spread to be so big,\" he said.Tegnell said the country's main strategy of social distancing still \"worked well\" and he \"can't see that we should have done it in a completely different way.\"Sweden's top epidemiologist Anders Tegnell defended the country's decision not to impose a strict lockdown In a news conference later on Wednesday, he reiterated: \"We still think that our strategy is good. But there are always improvements that can be made, especially when looking back in time.\"He was responding to reports on comments he made in an earlier interview with Swedish radio, which were widely interpreted as an admission of a failure. \"If we were to encounter the same disease, given exactly what we know about it today, I think we would reach a conclusion to act somewhere in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world did,\" Tegnell said in that interview. Asked if too many people have died too early, he replied: \"Yes, absolutely. That is what we will have to think about in the future, if there had been any way to prevent that,\" he explained. Inquiry into strategyThe Swedish government has announced it will launch an inquiry into the country's coronavirus strategy and the measures taken, with details of what form it will take expected before summer.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven told the country's Aftonbladet newspaper: \"I am in charge of the government, and that is why we have used the strategy that we have applied all along.\"Unlike in other European capitals, which went into strict lockdown, many bars remained open in Stochkhom He said parts of Sweden's strategy to limit the virus were correct, for example, because the healthcare system was not overwhelmed but \"at the same time, we must admit that the part about the spread of the disease within the elderly care, that has not worked, that is obvious, we have too many older people who have died.\"Last month a CNN report found people dying in care homes accounted for around half the country's total death toll, with many grieving families saying their loved ones never received any medical treatment.   Leli Sedghi said her 92-year-old father died in a Swedish care home without ever seeing a doctor after falling ill with Covid-19. \"It's haunting me,\" Sedghi said. Asked if he thinks this is happening, Tegnell told CNN at the time it was a \"very difficult question to answer.\"\"You have to remember these people are very old and extremely ill and normally you don't move these kinds of people from their homes to hospital care,\" he added.On May 15, L\u00f6fven rejected the \"narrative\" that \"Sweden is doing so totally different than other countries,\" saying \"that's not the case.\"\"Life is not carrying on as normal in Sweden. Many people are staying at home which has had a positive effect on limiting the spread of the virus,\" he said during a news conference.\"Of course we are painfully aware that too many people have lost their lives due to Covid-19. Just like several other countries we did not manage to protect the most vulnerable people, the most elderly, despite our best intentions.\" Photos: Here are the areas that are starting to reopenPeople wearing face masks hug at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art as it reopens to members on August 27.Hide Caption 1 of 110 Photos: Here are the areas that are starting to reopenA child is photographed in front of a Donald Trump wax figure at Madame Tussauds New York on August 27.

The figure was roughly similar to other countries that have data and well below what is needed to create \"herd immunity\" in a population.Sweden's strategy was criticized by researchers in the country early on, who said that attempting to create herd immunity had low support. But the authorities denied that achieving herd immunity was their goal.Herd immunity is reached when the majority of a given population -- 70 to 90% -- becomes immune to an infectious disease, either because they have become infected and recovered, or through vaccination. When that happens, the disease is less likely to spread to people who aren't immune, because there just aren't enough infectious carriers to reach them.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Dutch Prime Minister has said his views on the national tradition of dressing in blackface to portray the character of \"Zwarte Piet,\" or Black Pete, have undergone \"major changes\" -- but he won't go as far as banning it. Mark Rutte made the comments in parliament on Thursday, as anti-racism protestors across the Netherlands took to the streets in reaction to the death of George Floyd. The protests were organized in part by a group called \"Black Pete is Racism.\"This country with a colonial history has a blackface problemThe Dutch tradition of \"Black Pete\" typically sees a white person wearing full blackface, an Afro wig, red lipstick and earrings, and is often part of the Netherlands' St. Nicholas festivities in December. Popularized in a 19th-century children's book, the character still features in street carnivals and on Dutch television. But the character has increasingly come under criticism in recent years for perpetuating racist tropes. \"I myself have also experienced major changes about Black Pete,\" Rutte said during a late-night parliamentary debate. \"I also belonged to that group that said, 'Black Pete is simply black.'\" Read MorePeople dressed as Black Pete arrive by boat during the traditional St. Nicholas parade on November 16, 2019 in The Hague, Netherlands. Rutte said his views had been influenced by speaking with people with \"a darker skin color\" and young children who told him, \"'I feel incredibly discriminated against because Pete is black.'\"Still, he said, the government should not impose a ban on Black Pete, and he expressed sympathy for those who do not want to let go of \"that symbol.\"'They died in the exact same way'The politician said he believed the practice \"is changing over time, under pressure from the societal debate\" and his expectation was that in a number of years \"you will hardly see any more Black Petes.\"\"There are also people who say, 'I do not want -- while I am totally not discriminatory or racist -- to be forced to let go of that symbol, which I have never seen as a discriminatory symbol.' That makes this discussion so nuanced, and so complicated,\" he said. The Netherlands is one of several European countries grappling with a longstanding tradition of blackface. Anti-racism campaigners in neighboring Belgium have also called for an end to the tradition of blackface during festivals and carnivals.",

The individual attended the ritual organized by Vidal and the two other people, the Guardia Civil said.Police said the incident took place in July 2019 in the town of Enguera, near Valencia, in eastern Spain.

The law enforcement agency said the practice posed a serious health risk, but the dangers were masked by \"what looked like an inoffensive ancestral ritual.\"However, Salvador denied that his client took part in regular rituals.

Read MoreBut in a move led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, Leader of the House of Commons and a traditionalist Conservative MP, the government used its parliamentary majority to end that arrangement earlier this week.MPs were forced to return to Westminster if they wanted to debate and vote on legislation. But House of Commons authorities insisted that social distancing rules be maintained, meaning lawmakers had to join a huge line in order to vote in the traditional manner of passing through booths as tellers tick off their names.Images shared by MPs on social media show the chaos that ensued. Opposition Labour MP Ben Bradshaw shared photos of lawmakers crammed onto an escalator who \"crashed into the back of the voting queue and could neither go forward or back.\" He added: \"Rees-Mogg passed during this crush and I told him he was a disgrace.\"Labour MP Ben Bradshaw described scenes of a \"logjam\" when MPs returned to Parliament Tuesday.  A House of Commons Procedure Committee report published on May 30 warned the government's decision to recall the House of Commons to Westminster with a socially-distanced system had \"significant deficiencies.\" The committee's report said it has \"serious concerns about how it would work in practice\" and proposed that \"remote voting should continue for a time-limited period, with members who want to be able to vote in person having their votes recorded in the chamber.\"However, in an article for the Politics Home website on Monday, Rees-Mogg wrote: \"What is going to change is the quality of scrutiny. The virtual Parliament brought us through the peak of the pandemic but it is no longer necessary to make the compromises it demanded. We can do so much better.\"On Tuesday, following the first sitting after the virtual arrangements were dropped, he tweeted: \"Today has shown how much more effective a proper Parliament as opposed to an imitation one is at holding the government to account.\" But despite Sharma's negative coronavirus test, the anxiety caused by his appearance on Wednesday may cast doubt on the wisdom of forcing lawmakers into a confined space.Lawmakers returned to the House of Commons to vote on Tuesday.Before Sharma's test result was announced, Liberal Democrat MP Daisy Cooper said on Twitter that Rees-Mogg should resign as Leader of the House for \"bringing [it] into disrepute, and needlessly putting lives at risk\". She urged the Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to return parliament to virtual proceedings only with immediate effect.Labour MP John McDonnell said on Twitter: \"I wish Alok Sharma a speedy recovery but this confirms that lives of both staff and MPs are being put at risk in Parliament. It was an irresponsible decision by Rees Mogg and Johnson to force open Parliament. It must now revert to lockdown and online operation.\"This story has been updated to correct the date the House of Commons Procedure Committee report was published.",

An environmental group has described the damage as \"catastrophic,\" and the concentration of contaminants in nearby waters has already exceeded permissible levels  tens of thousands of times over, according to Russian environmental agency Rosprirodnadzor. The power station's employees originally tried to contain the spill on their own and did not report the incident to emergency services for two days, head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations Evgeny Zinichev said during a Wednesday meeting chaired by Putin and shown on national television. Members of the Marine Rescue Service work near the spill on Wednesday.\"So what, we are going to learn about emergencies from social media now? Are you okay over there?\" Putin said, chiding Krasnoyarsk governor, Alexander Uss and managers of the Norilsk-Taimyr Energy Company, which operates the station, for a delayed response after local authorities learned about the spill from social media.  The Investigative Committee, Russia's top law enforcement body, said Tuesday a criminal probe had been launched into 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilling into a Norilsk river following \"unexplained decompression\" of a storage tank. Read MoreThawing permafrost?Nornickel, the energy company's parent, said the foundation of the storage tank possibly sank due to thawing permafrost, highlighting the dangers increasingly warming temperatures pose to Arctic infrastructure and ecosystems, according to Russian state news agency TASS. \"Right now we can assume... that due to abnormally mild summer temperatures recorded in the past years, permafrost could have melted and the pillars under the platform could have sank,\" said Nornickel chief operating officer, Sergey Dyachenko, according to the TASS news agency. Antarctic ice sheets capable of much faster melting than we thought  Northern Asia, especially above the Arctic Circle in Siberia, has seen the most above-normal temperatures on the planet so far in 2020. Through the first four months of the year, the region has seen temperatures more than 4 degrees Celsius above normal on average.  The Arctic region is warming, on average, twice as fast as the rest of the planet, as a consequence of global warming, scientists say.  Crimson Tide: Residents stunned as Russian river turns redThe local authorities said the spill might take weeks to start a clean up as the region lacks expertise in utilizing such amounts of fuel, the river is not navigable and there are no roads surrounding it. Additional groups of experts are being deployed from other regions following the state of emergency.  \"The incident led to catastrophic consequences and we will be seeing the repercussions for years to come,\" Sergey Verkhovets, coordinator of Arctic projects of Russia's WWF branch, said in a statement. \"We are talking about dead fish, polluted plumage of birds, and poisoned animals.\"Norilsk has been historically among one of the world's most polluted cities.

        "content": "London  (CNN)Missing British girl Madeleine McCann is assumed dead by the German prosecutors who are investigating a new suspect for \"possible murder\" in connection to her case.McCann was just three years old when she vanished from a holiday apartment in the resort of Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3 in 2007, sparking an international hunt. She has never been found, and no one has ever been charged over her disappearance.On Thursday, the spokesman for the State Prosecutor's Office of Braunschweig, in the state of Lower-Saxony, told CNN his office assumes McCann is dead. Spokesman Hans Christian Wolters said they would not elaborate what evidence they have to support this as it is an ongoing investigation. The development came after police in Britain and Germany on Wednesday identified a new suspect as a 43-year-old German man.He was named in German media as \"Christian B.\" The suspect's full name is not being reported in accordance with German privacy laws.Read MoreCNN has independently confirmed his identity with a source close to the investigation.UK authorities described the development as a \"significant new line of enquiry\", while German authorities revealed the suspect has previously been convicted for sexually abusing children. The Braunschweig Prosecutor's office said in a statement Wednesday that the suspect is currently serving a \"long\" jail sentence \"for an unrelated matter.\" He is now being investigated for \"possible murder\" in connection with McCann, the office said.Wolters told CNN that if the investigation were to lead to charges and to a trial, the suspect would be tried in Germany, as murder is a criminal offense in Germany, as it is in Portugal, independent of where the crime was carried out.McCann's parents believe the police announcement of a new suspect is potentially a \"very significant\" development in the case. The family's spokesperson, Clarence Mitchell, said Thursday that the British and German police appeal was \"the first time in more than 13 years that I can recall [police] focusing on one individual\".\"Kate and Gerry do feel it's potentially very significant,\" Mitchell told BBC radio. \"This is another important chapter in the search for their daughter,\" he added.Kate and Gerry McCann hold an age-progressed police image of Madeleine during a news conference in London on the 5th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2012.In Germany's crime solving show \"Aktenzeichen XY Unsolved\" on public broadcaster ZDF Wednesday night, Christian Hoppe of Germany's Federal Criminal Investigations Office said no body has been found but \"the investigation of the Federal Criminal Investigations Office instead led to the assumption that McCann has become the victim of a killing.\"In a statement sent to CNN on Wednesday, the missing girl's parents thanked the \"police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine.\"\"All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.\"Mitchell, in his interview with the BBC's Radio 4, underlined that although the German police are classifying it as a murder investigation, the British police are still treating it as a missing persons case. \"A British national is still missing and the British police have been at pains to say there is no evidence at all that she has come to harm, is dead, or indeed alive so they are literally keeping an open mind on it,\" he explained.The suspect had lived in Portugal's Algarve region from 1995 to 2007, and also resided in a house in Praia de Luz, the resort town from which McCann disappeared, according to the Braunschweig prosecutor's office.Police say the suspect had access to this campervan and it was used in and around the area of Praia da Luz.London's Metropolitan Police on Wednesday also revealed details of two cars linked to the suspect around the time of the disappearance, and called on the public to step forward with any information about them.\"The first vehicle is a distinctive VW T3 Westfalia campervan. It is an early 1980s model, with two tone markings, a white upper body and a yellow skirting. It had a Portuguese registration plate,\" the UK statement said.\"The suspect had access to this van from at least April 2007 until sometime after May 2007. It was used in and around the area of Praia da Luz.\"\"The second vehicle is a 1993 British Jaguar, model XJR 6, with a German number plate and registered in Germany,\" the statement added. \"This car is believed to have been in the Praia da Luz and surrounding areas in 2006 and 2007. The car was originally registered in the suspect's name. On 4 May 2007, the day after Madeleine's disappearance, the car was re-registered to someone else in Germany.\"Asked whether this might be another instance of an apparent breakthrough that comes to nothing, Mitchell accepted there had been \"countless citings, tip offs, rumours, assumptions\" that \"have all sadly come to nothing\". \"But as I say, in my memory of being involved in the case, the police have never been quite so specific about an individual as they have been in this appeal,\" he continued. Police say this Jaguar car was originally registered in the suspect's name but the day after Madeleine's disappearance, the car was re-registered to someone else in Germany.\nKate and Gerry McCann are not doing interviews as they want the focus to remain on the police's request for information around the phone numbers and cars used by this new suspect, Mitchell added. The Metropolitan Police began reviewing McCann's disappearance in 2011, in an large-scale investigation known as Operation Grange that has cost at least \u00a311.75m ($14.7) as of June 2019.\"Following the ten-year anniversary, the Met received information about a German man who was known to have been in and around Praia da Luz. We have been working with colleagues in Germany and Portugal and this man is a suspect in Madeleine's disappearance,\" Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell said in a statement Wednesday.UK authorities are offering a \u00a320,000 (about $25,000) reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible.CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Berlin, Mia Alberti in Lisbon, Zamira Rahim, Max Ramsay, Milena Veselinovic and Isa Soares in London contributed to this report.",

Instead, those words have become divisive and hurtful and have misled people into believing that somehow I am an enemy. This could not be further from the truth, and is not an accurate reflection of my heart or my character,\" said Brees.In 2017, Brees and his Saints teammates knelt before the national anthem before a game against the Miami Dolphins in London in protest at US President Donald Trump's comments on the NFL and its players.

Four were arrested after the ruling, leaving one at large.On Thursday a judge at Spain's Cordoba Criminal court handed the four men additional prison sentences, after the group was convicted of sexually abusing a young woman in the southern city of Cordoba in May 2016. US warns citizens of sexual assault in SpainThe victim fell unconscious for \"unknown reasons\" before the abuse, according to the court's written judgment.The four men then \"began to touch the victim's chest both inside and outside her clothing\" and one of them \"even kissed her on the mouth,\" the document added. Read More\"While they were carrying out the touching, one of the accused made the (video) recording of said acts, with the prior acceptance of all others,\" the court said.The four men were also given a joint fine of 13,150 euros ($14,775).One of the men was sentenced to an additional four years and six months in prison, while the other three will serve an additional two years and 10 months each. The group was also found guilty of privacy abuse, as well as sexual abuse.The court gave the harsher sentence to the man who \"disseminated the recorded images through two WhatsApp groups of which both the investigated and third parties were part,\" according to the judgment.A reality TV contestant had to watch her own alleged assault. Now Spain wants answersThe Pamplona assault occurred just weeks after the Cordoba one, in July 2016 at the city's annual running of the bulls event.That case shocked Spain and prompted widespread outrage, after the men were initially convicted of sexual abuse but cleared of gang rape charges in December 2018.The original ruling was made on the grounds that Spanish law requires evidence of physical violence or intimidation to prove a rape charge, a stipulation that has since been brought into question.The country's Supreme Court later reversed the decision and upgraded the group's convictions.Laura P\u00e9rez Maestro reported from Madrid, Zamira Rahim wrote in London.",

She's just watched the first two hours of Lance Armstrong sharing what the disgraced cyclist calls \"his truth\" in ESPN's recent 30-for-30 documentary. She isn't buying it. \"If a man gains the world but loses his soul, is that OK? You cannot believe everything that he says,\" the wife of Armstrong's former US Postal Service teammate, Frankie Andreu, tells CNN Sport's Christina Macfarlane.In 2005 the couple helped expose Armstrong's doping offenses by testifying the seven-time Tour de France winner admitted to using banned substances while he was receiving cancer treatment in hospital.\"I don't think to this day he realizes the damage he's done to people; I don't think he cares,\" added Betsy Andreu. \"I think he missed the adulation and the fawning of the public and the media and he wanted to get back in their good graces.\"In 2017, a judge ruled that Andreu would be permitted to testify against Armstrong as part of the federal government's $100 million civil fraud lawsuit against the cyclist on behalf of the US Postal Service.Read MoreUltimately Armstrong agreed to pay the US government $5 million for using performance-enhancing drugs while the US Postal Service was paying millions to sponsor his team.Lance Armstrong of the United States rides in the peloton during the rolling start on Day 3 of La Ruta de Los Conquistadores on November 3, 2018 in Limon, Costa Rica.READ: The death-defying jumps that caught the attention of HollywoodFall from graceAndreu was one of a handful of former whistleblowers to take part in the two-part documentary -- directed by Marina Zenovich -- which recounts one of the biggest doping scandals in the sport's history and Armstrong's precipitous fall from grace.\"Initially, when Marina Zenovich contacted me, I asked her if Lance was participating, and she said he was. I said I wanted nothing to do with it. Because if Lance has anything to do with anything, we know he tries to manipulate,\" says Andreu.\"However, she [Zenovich] assured me he did not have any editorial control. This story is so convoluted and there are so many tentacles and the devil is in the detail ... So I decided to partake, not to tell my truth, but the truth.\"Except sometimes \"the truth\" can be difficult to pin down, especially when the documentary weaves in a series of versions of events that vary depending on the teller. For the most part that's Armstrong. Which doesn't sit right with Andreu.\"I really feel that he did this to rewrite history and change the narrative,\" she says. \"One thing that he does and he does it very effectively, is he's a good manipulator and he's very charismatic.\"JUST WATCHEDExtreme cycling down mountains and the Sacre CoeurReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExtreme cycling down mountains and the Sacre Coeur 02:27Throughout the documentary Armstrong teeters on the edge of showing remorse, before pivoting towards either justifying his actions, or indulging in an 'all-things-considered' retrospective, while speaking brazenly about how he was able to build a web of deceit for so long. On the subject of lies, he says:\"Nobody dopes and is honest. You're not. The only way you can dope and be honest is if nobody ever asks you, which is not realistic. The second somebody asks you, you lie.\"Now, it might be one lie because you answer it once, or in my case it might be 10,000 lies because you answer it 10,000 times.\"And then you take it a step further and you reinforce it and then 'fk you, don't ever fking ask me that question again,' right? And then you go sue someone and then it's ... so that's why it was 100 times worse, 'cause we all lie.\"Lance Armstrong poses for a photo at the Arataki Visitor Centre during a ride with local cyclists in Auckland's Waitakere Ranges on December 19, 2016 in Auckland, New Zealand. READ: Olympic hopeful skateboarder, 11, hospitalized after horror fall'Warts and all'The documentary is uncomfortable to watch, but there's no doubt that Armstrong is a compelling subject, exactly the complex character the film's director Zenovich was hoping to find.\"What I love about the film is that he's just there, warts and all,\" Zenovich told CNN Sport. \"He's in a different place and you can kind of, you can see what he's gone through.\"To me, someone who's not cynical, someone who came to this open feeling like he was willing to give part of themselves, I felt like he was telling his truth. Whether it is the truth, it's his interpretation of how his life unfolded.\"Betsy Andreu has been a vocal critic of Armstrong.Over the course of 18 months and eight sit-down interviews, Zenovich said the length of time she spent with Armstrong was crucial to allowing the full story to be told \"warts and all\" without the former cyclist deflecting.Early on Zenovich and her team noticed that the 48-year-old was always more unguarded after an intense workout.\"The second time we interviewed him, we filmed him swimming and running first and then it was like, wow ... it was like a killer interview ... I think these people who are used to doing such intense workouts are much more settled once they've done their workout.\"Once he did that, we saw that he was more kind of 'in the chair' and ready as opposed to waiting for it to be over. He was much more settled after he exercised.\"In the ESPN documentary, Armstrong makes clear he isn't a fan of Floyd Landis.READ: Daredevil biker swaps mountains for washing machine stunts\"It could be worse. I could be Floyd Landis'However, Zenovich admits she had a tough job trying to guard against Armstrong controlling the documentary's narrative.\"I mean there was always part of that at play,\" says Zenovich. \"One of the great beauties of having so many interviews, though, is just having the time to get what you want.\"If I had one interview with him, it would be horrible. I mean, I didn't think eight was enough. And during the last interview, I didn't want it to be over because it could have gone on longer. He doesn't disclose everything ... but at the time you have to just keep trying to get as much as you can.\"For those who've followed the disgraced cyclist's story of deceit, coverup and betrayal, it is never clear whether the Armstrong of 2020 is really any different to the one who masterminded the biggest doping conspiracy in cycling history. Especially when his bitterness towards former teammates who helped topple his empire pierces through.Speaking of his rise and fall, Armstrong says: \"It could be worse. I could be Floyd Landis ... waking up a piece of st every day.\"Floyd Landis rides during the Tour de France in 2006.Landis -- who was stripped of his Tour de France title in 2006 for doping and later filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Armstrong -- is also interviewed as part of the documentary.\"I had to come clean. He's obviously not happy about that. I don't have any further animosity towards him. I hope he's changed, and I hope he finds some peace ... I don't know why people can't move on, but here we are,\" said Landis.

I don't think he gets it. Americans ... we're very forgiving. Everybody's hung up on, did he say sorry? I think the question should be, did he reconcile? Did he attempt to make amends? He thinks that by saying he said he's sorry to people or by constantly telling the media how sorry he is that that's enough.\"",

In London \u2014 some 4,000 miles from where Floyd died in Minnesota \u2014 thousands of protesters gathered on Wednesday to show solidarity with mourning Americans.It was a peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration in Hyde Park, where protesters of many different racial and cultural backgrounds chanted Floyd's name through their face masks, demanding justice. Several protesters shared their outrage over the killing to CNN, drawing parallels with their own experiences, and expressed dismay about US President Donald Trump's reaction to the protests.Geovane Silva, 21Geovane Silva, who works at a McDonald's and studies music.\"There's racism everywhere, and we have to fight it. I don't just mean white people against black people. Racism is racism, and that's what we have to fight. We have to be just one, human beings, we just need to be one. We all breathe the same air, we all bleed the same color.\"When I saw what happened to George Floyd, I cried. Man, I cried, because someone is being killed for just looking like me.  He did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong, and even if he did, there's ways to deal with that. Why do other people get ways to deal with that but we don't? The only way to deal with us is through violence. Why? We are not savages, we are not animals \u2014 we are people, like everyone else, and we deserve to be free. Demonstrators raise their fists while observing a minute of silence during a demonstration for George Floyd outside the Houses of Parliament, on Wednesday.Read More\"We can't have people being scared when reaching for their wallets in their car. We can't have people being scared when they are raided at home by the police and being killed. We can't have people being scared of being on the street, not doing nothing, just standing on the street and the police come and finds a reason to shoot you and to kill you and to take your breath.\"It's not the first time. Five years ago we were yelling the same thing \u2014\u00a0'I can't breathe.' Why do we still have to do it today? It makes no sense. How can this still be? Why can't people understand we are one? Why so much hate?\"This is way bigger than just America, it's way bigger than George Floyd. It's way bigger than just one cop killing a black man \u2014 it's about injustice.\"Cleo Charlery, 26 Cleo Charlery, who studies social work, and her sister, Carla Charlery, 22.  \"I tried to avoid watching the George Floyd video, but it got to a point where I couldn't, so I looked and I felt so broken. I felt enraged with anger. I have a daughter, my partner's black, I've got black siblings. It could have happened to anyone, any of my family members, so I was enraged with anger. I cried, then I started sharing everything I felt on social media.\"I'm tired of it. I'm tired of everyone screaming 'black lives matter'\u2014 come on, this is common sense now. We are equal, just like everyone else. We should be, do you understand? We should have rights like everyone else. But it appears in America, and in the UK, we have no rights when it comes to justice. \"The difference is, I feel in the UK they know how to hide it pretty good, while in America, no one cares. They'll let you know they're racist. They don't care about it. Where in the UK everyone is hiding it, but it comes out unconsciously, so I think that the UK is just as bad as America.\"In terms of Trump. I'm so tired of him. I feel like he's gaslighting the entire situation and calling a war on black people.\"Kingsley Daniels, 24 Kingsley Daniels, who works as a musician and a chef.\"I'm not protesting just for me. I'm thinking about the future, for the next generation. My kids, our grandkids, trying to make sure they can do whatever they want in life, and not have prejudice against them. Not have to work 10 times as hard as a white man, just to get a job they didn't know they deserved, that they put blood sweat and tears into.\"I want my kids, anyone's kids, any black men, black women, anyone who wants to do anything with their lives, that they can do it. They don't have to worry about prejudice, or worry about 'If I walk out of the house, am I going to make it home tonight? Can I go to another country to see what it's like? If I do, will I make it home?' Protesters move between stopped buses and cars as the demonstration moved through central London.\"One of my dreams is to end up in New York and work there for a living. But now I have to put that on hold and think carefully because I don't want to go out there and not make it home. So I'm doing this now to make sure all of our kids, and the next generations after and after and after, they can be at peace and not have to worry. Parents don't have to worry about their kids not coming home. Parents are already worry about that here in London because of knife crime.\"Trump's reaction to all this shows he's a joke. He's actually a joke. The fact that they call him a president is a joke. He's not a president. He's not ruling nothing. He's a man who doesn't know how to hold his tongue, how to think before he speaks, and does not care about anyone other than his pockets and himself.\"Gail Lewis, 69Gail Lewis, an academic in race and gender studies.\"I'm here today for George Floyd. I'm here for Breonna Taylor. I'm here for all the murders that have happened in the States and here in London. I'm 69 years old ... and I'm here because of the continuing anti-blackness in this country, as well as the USA, and the connections between us here and in the USA and all of the Americas. \"And the need to protest every way in which black life is made valueless, in every way, through murder and state violence, through white supremacist violence, and also through the most demeaning of factors: Through the names our children are subjected to, through the idea the jobs that we do are not valued, and therefore we get more subject to the coronavirus and die more \u2014 in every way. The need to protest that here in this country, in solidarity, but also to make transformation in this racist society as well. Two protesters join hands as they rally in London.\"When I was a young adolescent protesting,  there would be a few of us, in this very park, just 10 or 12. Now today, I see this number of people for black life. Not for anything else, but for black life. That is a huge transformation. It makes me cry. \"It makes me cry both to see it, to see the commitment to black life, and it makes me cry because we have to be here.\"Ola Soetan, 26Ola Soetan, who works in warehouses.\"Sometimes you can be walking down the road and the cops will search you for no reason. That happened to me in Ireland, where I used to live. I've lived here in London now for eight months and I see people get racially profiled. They're wrongly accused because of their skin color. It's not fair. \"It's frustrating, because there's no justice, the evidence is right there but they always try to defend them. Like with George Floyd, they're leaning on someone's neck, and they're trying to defend them. You can't defend them. They're human beings, you know. How can you do that when they're begging for their life? As a human being, if you see someone suffering?Demonstrators gather in Hyde Park on Wednesday.\"You can't bring them back, they're gone. All the police are the same. They say there are good cops, but if you see a bad cop do something and you don't call them out, you're the same as them, because you're keeping quiet. If I see someone do something bad, I'll speak out. Everyone should be treated equally.\"If it weren't for social media, we wouldn't know the truth.\"Meisha Francesco, 20Meisha Francesco, who works in retail, with her friend, Sean Archer.\"Growing up as a young black person, especially as I've come up in a white area, I think it's important to make sure that racism does stop, and that everyone gets looked at as a person. I've come here today to show my support and to make sure we do get looked at as equal people. \"In the US, I think it's obviously very disgusting. People shouldn't have to worry about going out because they're going to get killed because of the color of their skin. You see people who are white doing the same things and it's not a problem, but people look at the color of your skin and if they're black, they automatically think 'That's a criminal and they don't deserve to live,' and that's bad, very bad. \"In the UK I feel it's obviously not as bad as in the US, but there is definitely stuff that doesn't get spoken about. I feel like when people go for jobs, people need to be looked at as a person and not the color of their skin, which is a problem here. In workplaces, in schools, even just in a large group, you get noticed for being black. \"The more people who come out against racism, the more changes they'll have to make.\"Happy Idehen Hill, 32Happy Idehen Hill, from right, with her son, Xander, and husband, Alex Hill.\"We came to protest against police brutality, against black people, mostly. They've been brutal to all races, but it's been obvious that the black race has been affected mostly, so we're just here to protest that and demand change to the system. It just needs to change.\"I think in America, it's totally different than here in the UK. Here in the UK, racism is less than when I lived in Spain. You feel it. Some people, they don't come to your face and say it. The way they treat you differently, maybe when you're at work. \"The reason we brought our son Xander here is I just want him to be part of history. I think everything is going to change after this. and I'm hopeful it's going to change. Our forefathers have done it before, and this is another kind of change we're going to experience, so we just want him to be part of that.\"Comments have been edited for clarity.",

        "content": "(CNN)An anti-LGBTQ ad by a pro-Kremlin news portal has sparked outrage on Russian social media -- and drawn attention to a propaganda campaign for a national referendum that could pave the way for Russian President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036. The viral video, produced by the Russian online tabloid RIA FAN, depicts a young boy being greeted at an orphanage by his new adoptive father. \"And where's my mother?\" the boy asks.\"There's your mother,\" the father says, nodding to another actor -- a caricature of a flamboyantly gay man -- waiting in a car outside.The video then ends with a voiceover. \"Is this the Russia you want?\" it says. \"Decide the future of the country. Vote for the amendments to the constitution.\"Read MoreJUST WATCHEDRussian coronavirus cases rise as Putin's popularity plungesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRussian coronavirus cases rise as Putin's popularity plunges 00:59At issue is a national vote that would amend the constitution and reset the clock on presidential term limits, allowing Putin to stay on as president past 2024, when his second consecutive term in office comes to an end, among other things. The set of changes also includes controversial amendments such as defining marriage as a \"union between a man and a woman.\" Russian law does not permit same-sex marriages or partnerships, and adoption laws generally bar same-sex couples from adopting.The vote was originally scheduled to take place on April 22, but those plans were scrapped amid the coronavirus pandemic, dealing a blow to the Kremlin's plans to push through the changes.The video, released Tuesday, drew immediate condemnation online. Stimul, a group of LGBTQ activists, called for an investigation of the video, saying it \"incites hatred and hostility\" and violates Russian law on online communication.The group said it had asked Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications regulator, to block the video. Alexander Filimonenko, the actor who played the gay man, apologized in an Instagram post after the backlash.\"Dear friends, I'd like to express my regret due to the situation unfolding with the clip I played a part in,\" he said. \"I'm very sorry that I ended up being involved in the politics. In no way I wanted to offend anyone. Thanks to everyone and my loved ones for the words of support.\"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, activist Pyotr Verzilov and the prominent journalist Tania Felgengauer were among those who mocked or denounced the video on Twitter.Trump, Putin and Bolsonaro find their populist playbooks are no match for coronavirusRIA FAN said it produced the video as part of a get-out-the-vote series.Nikolay Stolyarchuk, the head of Patriot Media Group, the parent company of RIA FAN, acknowledged the controversy, but said the video was in line with Russian laws passed under Putin's rule that have outlawed so-called \"homosexual propaganda,\" measures that have drawn widespread international condemnation. \"The first in a large series of videos on amendments to the constitution of the Russian Federation caused an unprecedented craze,\" he said. \"I agree that the topic is ambiguous, but the point of this video is not in campaigning against homosexuals, as some representatives of the opposition are trying to paint it.\"Stolyarchuk noted that one of the constitutional amendments -- which were passed by Russia's rubber-stamp parliament and quickly cleared by its constitutional court -- would state explicitly that marriage is only between a man and a woman.\"The main point is not to fight against the LGBT community, but to defend the institution of family as a union of a man and a woman,\" Stolyarchuk said. \"I am also of the opinion that same-sex partners must not be allowed to adopt children.\" The chairman of the board of trustees of Patriot Media Group is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch who was sanctioned by the US for funding the Internet Research Agency that meddled in the 2016 presidential election.Lyubov Sobol, an opposition activist, said she was not surprised that RIA FAN was behind the video. \"I don't understand why everyone is seriously discussing RIA FAN doing something on the amendments and are surprised,\" she wrote. \"One would be surprised if they came out with something objective, truthful and worthwhile. But a trash bin was created for dirt.\"The timing of the anti-gay video, which has drawn over 76,000 views on YouTube, seems clear. On Monday, Putin announced that the vote on the constitutional amendments will take place on July 1.",

His death has sparked widespread protests across the world in recent days.On Monday, Kick it Out chairman Sanjay Bhandari told The Guardian players must be free to protest when the current campaign resumes on June 17.\"I would like to encourage the players to protest if they want to but I would also like to encourage them to do it in a way that doesn't expose them to unnecessary sanction,\" Bhandari said. Read More\"If they could do that by taking a knee, well if every player did that it would be quite a powerful message. I would be interested to hear what the authorities thought of that, whether it would constitute a breach of the rules. To me that is about demonstrating solidarity.\"The English Football Association said in a statement that it \"strongly condemns discrimination of any kind\" and says that any protests on the pitch \"would be reviewed on a case by case basis with a common sense approach and understanding of their context.\"\"The power of football can break down barriers across communities and we remain deeply committed to removing all forms of discrimination from across the game we all love,\" it added.The Premier League did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.READ: Tiger Woods releases statement on George Floyd's death and protestsREAD: Lewis Hamilton and Michael Jordan speak out after George Floyd's deathLiverpool players take a knee in memory of George Floyd.While Liverpool's squad took a knee during training on Monday, Manchester United stars Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford also posted messages of solidarity on social media.Bhandari's comments came on the same day that the German Football Federation (DFB) announced it was investigating protests made by Jadon Sancho, Achraf Hakimi, Weston McKennie and Marcus Thuram during Bundesliga matches over the weekend, a decision for which the federation has drawn criticism.Over the weekend, Borussia Dortmund's Sancho received a yellow card for lifting up his shirt to reveal the message \"Justice for George Floyd\" written underneath. Teammate Hakimi was not booked later in the game for making the same protest.Schalke's Weston McKennie wore an armband with the slogan \"Justice for George,\" while Marcus Thuram took a knee after scoring for Borussia Monchengladbach.\"I hope there will be a degree of leniency shown by the German authorities,\" Bhandari said. \"I'm not sure how you can sanction Marcus Thuram. I don't think he's done anything wrong. He's just taken a knee. I wonder if that's the thing I would encourage if players want to protest. \"If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too -- everyone. I would urge all the authorities and all the clubs to show a degree of understanding. This is almost above politics. This is about right and wrong. \"This is someone who was killed on the streets by the police. This is about seeking justice for him and others like him. I don't see that as being political. That's human.\"The DFB said the yellow card given to Sancho had nothing to do with his message of solidarity. \"Referee Daniel Siebert followed the laws of the game here, specifically Law 12 (Fouls and Misconduct), which states that a player will be booked for unsporting behaviour if they remove their shirt or cover their head with their shirt after celebrating a goal,\" said the DFB in a statement.         View this post on Instagram           During the past few days I have thought a lot about how to express my feelings about what happened in Minneapolis. I felt anger, pity, hatred, indignation, pain, sadness. Sadness for George and for all black people who suffer from racism EVERY DAY! Whether in football, at work, at school, ANYWHERE! This has to stop, once and for all! Not tomorrow or the next day, it has to end TODAY! Violent acts of racism can no longer be tolerated. I can't tolerate I won't tolerate WE WON'T TOLERATE Racism is ignorance LOVE is intelligence STOP the silence STOP racism #NoToRacismWeAllOne #JusticeForFloyd #GeorgeFloyd #BlackLivesMatter A post shared by  Paul Labile Pogba (@paulpogba) on Jun 1, 2020 at 8:34am PDT A spokesperson for FIFA, world football's governing body, says it \"fully understands the depth of sentiment and concerns expressed by many footballers in light of the tragic circumstances of the George Floyd case\" and has urged competition organizers to \"use common sense\" when considering possible sanctions for player protests.\"I think the players understand that if they take the shirt off they're going to get booked,\" Bhandari says. \"Everything is contextual and in this context I think it would be very harsh for a punishment to go beyond that. I'm not sure how something like taking a knee could expose you.\"Every player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the Erling Haaland celebration after the first game back where all the Borussia Dortmund players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee. Racism's not about black players or brown fans. It's about all of us. \"Racism corrodes society and we're all hurt by it. Everyone should want to demonstrate their solidarity and disgust.\"F1 drivers speak outAfter Lewis Hamilton criticized the world of Formula One for staying \"silent in the midst of injustice,\" several high-profile figures in the sport have spoken out in protest against Floyd's death.The six-time world champion, currently the only black driver on the grid, said that there was \"not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport.\"Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and McLaren driver Lando Norris are two drivers who have since spoken out.\"To be completely honest, I felt out of place and uncomfortable sharing my thoughts on social media about the whole situation and this is why I haven't express myself earlier than today,\" Leclarc wrote on Twitter. \"And I was completely wrong. \"I still struggle to find the words to describe the atrocity of some videos I've seen on [the] Internet.  Racism needs to be met with actions, not silence. Please be actively participating, engaging and encouraging others to spread awareness.I have fans and followers. Support and love.

        "content": "(CNN)People from the UK's ethnic minority communities are up to 50% more likely to die with coronavirus than their white British peers, a government review has found.The analysis, conducted by government agency Public Health England (PHE), found that people of Bangladeshi heritage who tested positive for the virus were around twice as likely to die as their white British peers.People from other minority communities, including those of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani and Caribbean descent, also had a 10% to 50% higher risk of death when compared to white Britons, the report found.Those from black ethnic groups were also more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19. The diagnosis rate per 100,000 of the population was 486 for black females and 649 for black males, compared to 220 for white females and 224 for white males.The document was published Tuesday -- after the UK government denied British media reports that its release had been delayed due to protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd.Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?Read MoreCommissioned by England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty in April, amid fears the coronavirus pandemic was \"disproportionately\" affecting black and ethnic minority communities, the analysis was due to be published at the end of May, according to PHE.In response to questions from CNN on Tuesday morning about why the report had been delayed, a government health department spokesperson said: \"Ministers received initial findings yesterday [Monday]. They are being rapidly considered and a report will be published this week.\"\"It is not true to say this has been delayed due to global events,\" the spokesperson added.In an address to parliament later Tuesday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"Being black or from a minority ethnic background is a major [Covid-19] risk factor.\"Hancock admitted that there was \"much more work to do to understand the key drivers of these disparities, the relationships between the different risk factors and what we can do to close the gap.\"The health secretary said he was \"determined that we continue to develop our understanding and shape our response.\" Hancock also stressed that the report did not just look at ethnicity but also found that age was the biggest Covid-19 risk factor, with older patients more likely to die than younger ones.Among those who tested positive for the virus, those over 80 years old were deemed 70 times more likely to die than those under 40.Combination of factorsThe PHE analysis found that the link between ethnicity and health was \"complex and likely to be the result of a combination of factors.\"\"Firstly, people of BAME [Black and minority ethnic] communities are likely to be at increased risk of acquiring the infection,\" it states.\"This is because BAME people are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas, and have jobs that expose them to higher risk.\"\"People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences,\" it added.The groups are \"also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection,\" the agency's report found.\"For example, some co-morbidities [the simultaneous presence of two diseases or conditions in a patient] which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups.\"Blood clots fill lungs of black coronavirus victims, study finds\"People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from white British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups,\" the report said.The PHE analysis looked at the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region on survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases, but did not account for the effect of occupation, obesity or co-morbidities.Its publication came as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned that Covid-19 had exposed inequalities within society and was having a major disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities, including people of African descent.\"The data tells us of a devastating impact from Covid-19 on people of African descent, as well as ethnic minorities in some countries, including Brazil, France, the United Kingdom and the United States,\" Bachelet said. \"In many other places, we expect similar patterns are occurring, but we are unable to say for sure given that data by race and ethnicity is simply not being collected or reported,\" she added.",

But fear not, the intrepid adventurer has come up with an innovative escape plan. He's booked his passage on a historic aircraft destined for a Norwegian museum, with his team of dogs for company. Read More\"Winning the race and then going back on the plane ... I think this was one of the cool things that happen in life,\" Waerner told CNN Sport in a phone interview.READ: Oscar-winning director Jimmy Chin on fear, risk and finding the edgeIconic IditarodThe Iditarod is a legendary long-distance race held every year on the trail between Anchorage and Nome.The nearly 1,000-mile race covers some of the most extreme terrains on Earth, each team powered by 64 booted paws and a musher's dogged desire.This year was Waerner's second stab at the challenging contest and winning after nine days of hard work was a dream come true for the veteran musher -- the person who drives the sled. Since crossing the finish line, however, he has been holed up with friends in the rural US state whilst he plotted his somewhat unusual route home.Waerner's plan was hatched after he read a local airline was trying to sell a DC-6 aircraft -- a historic airliner -- to The Museum of Aviation History in Sola, Norway. The plane enjoyed more than 60 years of continuous service, making its maiden voyage in 1946 before flying in three separate continents.Coincidentally, Waerner's friends had connections with the plane's now owner and, with help from his sponsor, he's managed to hitch a lift home on June 2.Waerner will be joined on the aircraft by those 24 dogs -- 16 of his own and an additional eight left behind by a fellow competitor. \"Life is a little strange,\" he laughed, admitting the situation was all a bit surreal. \"But I am a forward, positive guy. If you're just positive you will always find solutions and you will overcome your obstacles.\"READ: Like 'falling off the face of the earth,' says kayaker after dropping down 134-foot waterfallThe Douglas DC-6B Cloudmaster prepares for its last flight in Fairbanks, Alaska, in May.

His wife, Guro, had traveled with him but left early when the pandemic began to take hold of the world. Waerner has five children and 35 dogs back in Norway so he's aware he has a lot of catching up to do with his veterinarian wife and kids -- not forgetting an assortment of household duties.\"I feel a little bad for her having all these jobs and I'm not there to support her at all,\" he said.\"So it'll be nice to get home and get back to normal life.\"Whilst stranded on another continent, Waerner has been filling his days by training his dogs and walking with his close friends during what he's dubbed his \"retired life in Alaska.\" He stays in daily contact with his family over video calls and can't wait to enjoy coffee with his wife and dinner with the kids again. With the traditional Iditarod winner's banquet and ceremonies postponed because of lockdown restrictions, Waerner's personal victory parade hasn't been quite what he had imagined.\"I really wanted to win the race at one point in my life, and then you suddenly do it,\" he said. \"I still have to look at the trophy and remember we actually did win, it's kind of a strange feeling.\" READ: Swiss climbs 1,800-foot vertical rock face in record time... without a safety ropeWaerner during the race in 2020.Waerner raised his arms in triumph after winning. 'You get really strong mentally'However, his adventure hasn't put him off the idea of returning to Alaska and he is keent to participate in next year's Itidarod.Waerner firmly believes it's his ability to deal with the challenges posed by the Itidarod that has helped him overcome his current predicament. \"It's like a wave of negative things coming against you when you're racing because you have so much sleep deprivation,\" he reflects.\"You have warm weather, cold weather, it's raining, you're going through bad trails, good trails and things are happening that you have to deal with all the time. \"I think my long-distance career has helped me because you get really strong mentally [in order] to deal with negative things.\"",

Cost-cutting is rapidly becoming king.Football has pressed the pause button and in doing so is bracing itself for an age of austerity. \"It's a wake-up call [...] A big chance for football to get a little bit back to reality,\" Lutz Pfannenstiel, who is sporting director at Bundesliga club Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, told CNN Sport.JUST WATCHEDNeymar speaks to CNN after joining Paris Saint-Germain for a world record feeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNeymar speaks to CNN after joining Paris Saint-Germain for a world record fee 02:16READ: In eerie silence, Bayern closes in on Bundesliga titleBursting The BubbleBefore the pandemic struck, football's upward spending curve had shown few signs of abating.Last summer, clubs in Europe's \"Big Five\" leagues -- England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France -- spent a record \u20ac5.5 billion, according to analysis from Deloitte's Sports Business Group -- up \u20ac900 million compared with the same period in 2018.In England's Premier League alone, 11 of the 20 clubs smashed their own transfer records whilst spending in Spain's La Liga broke the $1 billion mark for the first time.This summer promised to be no different.Big money moves had been earmarked for some of European football's hottest properties -- with frenzied speculation surrounding the futures of Borussia Dortmund's wonderkid winger Jadon Sancho, Manchester United's enigmatic midfielder Paul Pogba and Napoli's commanding defender Kalidou Koulibaly to name but a few.Although newly crowned French champions Paris Saint-Germain have laid down the gauntlet with the permanent signing of Argentine striker Mauro Icardi for a reported fee of $67 million, the Covid-19 crisis has thrown everything up in the air.With leagues around the world now scrapping to salvage what they can of the 2019-20 season, the latest transfer window, which opens on June 10, has a very different feel to it.Leading Dutch team Ajax is better placed than most clubs given its business model is primarily based on a youth development program that has produced a series of world class players which have delivered a steady income stream.\"I'm sure there will be reasoning with new contracts, with salaries, with agent fees and also with costs in general for a club [...] I'm sure we will get a good amount of money, even in the Corona times,\" Ajax CEO Edwin van der Sar recently told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell.That may, though, be wishful thinking.According to analysis by the consultancy KPMG, it estimates that if domestic seasons can be completed \"behind closed doors,\" the value of players will fall by \u20ac6.6 billion ($7.23 billion). If seasons across the continent are called off altogether, that figure will reach a staggering \u20ac10 billion ($10.95 billion).The game's seemingly impenetrable spending bubble is heading towards bursting point.Jadon Sancho is one of the most sought after properties in European football at the moment.READ: Liverpool's agonizing wait for English football's biggest prizeExploiting the MarketYet, even at a time of crisis, one man's loss can be another man's gain.In April, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer expressed his belief that United could \"exploit\" those clubs severely impacted financially by the pandemic. Although his comments drew criticism from some quarters, football finance expert, Kieran Maguire, believes the Norwegian was merely stating an economic reality.\"The gap between rich and poor will grow because the bigger clubs tend to have stronger balance sheets and more cash in the bank,\" Maguire explains. \"Say you've got a player who is of a very high quality -- we would normally be looking to buy him for \u00a340 to \u00a350 million ($48.8-$61 million). Tell you what we'll offer you \u00a320 million ($24.4 million) today cash and the selling club will very reluctantly go along with that offer because it will be fighting for its existence.\"It's a view shared by sports lawyer, Daniel Geey, who believes the nature of negotiations will become more varied and nuanced.\"The types of transactions that can give clubs the most flexibility are going to be the most attractive at the moment [...] loan to buys or longer loans over maybe one or two seasons and with break clauses.\"With flexibility, patience and caution poised to become the dominant buzzwords in football's lexicon, the scrutiny on player recruitment will be greater than ever.\"(Clubs) will think twice or even three times before just signing somebody [...] If you're not 100% you won't sign a player -- you'd rather wait,\" says Pfannenstiel.JUST WATCHEDHow to scout the world's best football players?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow to scout the world's best football players? 02:01READ: Inside the 'impossible' Champions League final winPrudence and PreservationVan der Sar expects \"the lifeline of the club\" -- as he refers to Ajax's academy -- to continue in the same vein and is expecting six or seven youth players to be rewarded with contracts in a year or two's time. And despite the changing landscape he insists the Amsterdam outfit will not be kowtowed into selling their prized assets on the cheap.\"If big clubs are thinking that they can maybe swap three players or one player from us, that's not the way that business has been done and is going to be done, in our view.\"It could also be an opportunity for us if players are not able to move or they're not the right amounts, that you can hold a team a little bit longer together.\"JUST WATCHEDAjax All-access: The FutureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAjax All-access: The Future 03:24READ: German soccer returns but not as we know itSocially unacceptable spending For all the insatiable gossiping on rolling news channels and whisperings in newspaper columns and websites, the current economic and humanitarian picture arguably poses a moral challenge to clubs.The realities are stark -- millions around the world are losing their jobs or being placed on furlough and struggling to make ends meets.  Daily death tolls continue to increase in their hundreds and thousands.Tottenham Hotspur manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho recently stated he didn't believe the world was ready for the 'crazy' transfers of yesteryear -- and it's a view echoed by Maguire.\"There will be a wariness of the idea of consumption by football clubs being socially unacceptable [...] If you are seen to be signing a footballer for \u00a3100 million that just looks incredibly tacky, doesn't it?\" READ: Chaos beckons as European soccer is devastatedWhilst the pandemic has led to unprecedented levels of uncertainty, it's prompted the game to take a long overdue hard look at itself.There are increased calls for football's vastly disproportionate finances to be reexamined. New ideas are emerging of how viewers can consume a product which at times has appeared unattainable.  And perhaps most importantly of all Pfannenstiel believes there's now an added impetus to reevaluate the game's core principles.\"I think we can be back to modesty [and] sustainability [...] I think we saw very important values which will now start to play a bigger role again in the heads of the club owners and managers.\"Football has a golden opportunity to right its wrongs.It may never get such a chance again and it's one it now cannot afford to waste.",

Tobias Weller completed the final leg of his 26.2-mile marathon in Sheffield, northern England, on Sunday surrounded by socially distanced neighbors and well-wishers.Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that affect the ability to move. According to his JustGiving page, Tobias cannot stand or walk unaided, and requires support with most tasks, but, inspired by Captain Tom Moore, a war veteran who raised millions for the UK's National Health Service by walking laps of his garden ahead of his 100th birthday, Tobias set his sights on a marathon. Tobias had been planning a sponsored 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) walk around a local park last month, but was unable to go ahead with it because of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.Tobias is cheered on by neighbors as he walks along his street in Sheffield, northern England. \"Then I heard about Captain Tom and I thought why don't I use my walker to try to complete a marathon by walking up and down my street every day,\" he said in a video ahead of the marathon, admitting it would be a \"ginormous challenge.\"Read MoreAt the beginning of lockdown, Tobias could walk a maximum of 50 meters (164 feet) a day, but as he grew closer to completing his challenge -- which took him 70 days, according to the PA Media news agency -- he was walking up to 750 meters (half a mile) a day. \"I can't believe I completed a marathon, it's just awesome,\" he told Sky News. He said: \"Every bit of it has been totally awesome.\"I love it when my neighbors clap and cheer for me. I'm getting stronger and stronger every day. It's such a good feeling.\"So far, Tobias has raised over \u00a381,600 ($100,700) -- \u00a350,000 more than his original target of \u00a330,000 for Sheffield Children's Hospital and Paces School, a school that supports children and adults with neurological conditions, including Tobias. Cerebral palsy couldn't stop this 17-year-old from finishing the Santa Run using a walkerTobias' mother, Ruth Garbutt, said they were going to continue walking and were aiming to reach 50 kilometers (31 miles), PA Media reported.\"I'm so, so pleased that he's completed his marathon. He's done really well. He's tried so hard all the way through. He's really achieved a massive goal,\" she said, according to PA.\"I'm bursting with pride for my little boy. He's just magnificent.\"",

For the next two-and-a-half months, the top basketball players will all be residing at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and they haven't had to win anything to get there.But it's not necessarily the treat you might think; in fact some -- like the Lakers' LeBron James and the Trail Blazers' Damian Lillard -- have compared it to a prison sentence, both using slang on social media, saying they were off 'to do a bid.'\" Welcome to Disney World! Or, between now and the middle of October, \"Make yourself comfortable in the NBA 'bubble!'\" Read MoreBeing referred to as a stretch in the joint is probably not the kind of gratitude the NBA was expecting when they wrestled with the biggest logistical challenge ever faced in the 74-year history of the league: how to resume and finish up a season amidst a global pandemic in a country which has struggled in the fight against Covid-19.Certainly Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown struck a more positive note.\"I think what the NBA has done ... in the environment we are all in is spectacularly brilliant,\" Brown told reporters. \"I think it's elite -- I have zero complaints about anything that might prohibit us from doing our job.\"And according to UFC boss Dana White, the 'bubble' approach is currently the only way forward for US sports.\"This isn't going to work outside of a bubble,\" White told CNN Sport earlier this week after the UFC staged a series of bouts on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.\"You've got to have the bubble, you have to put people in lockdown, people can't be sneaking out, people can't go home. You know, in Abu Dhabi, the people [who worked with UFC] ... haven't seen their families in two months.\"So far the NBA's approach looks to be working.

Nobody will be getting out early for good behavior; in fact, the better you play, the longer you stay.  Whilst there have been some complaints about the range of food options, the NBA's Disney bubble is obviously not a prison.The Pacers power forward Ty Leaf said, \"Given all the circumstances, they've done a really good job. I mean, it's not easy throwing together events at this magnitude.\"The Mavericks' Josh Reaves described it as \"a once in a lifetime opportunity, the hotels are great, the facilities are great,\" while the Spurs Jakob P\u00f6ltl said he was \"positively surprised,\" adding the caveat, \"We'll see how long it takes until we get on each other's nerves.\" Technically, it is not a 'bubble' either; the NBA commissioner Adam Silver has resisted describing it as such, because it isn't 'hermetically sealed.'

That's in addition to the initial two days that every player spent in solitary confinement when they first arrived in early July. The Pelicans' top draft pick Zion Williamson is one of several players who've already left the bubble for family matters, and all who do leave know that they'll be quarantined again prior to re-entry.  The guidelines are intensely detailed; it took the NBA no less than 113 pages to lay down the law in a handbook which was distributed to every team.Seemingly everything has been considered; for example -- a game of cards with teammates is OK, but only while wearing a facemask and on the understanding that the deck is disposed of at the end.You can play golf, but you can't have a caddie.

We need sports, because of what it will do psychologically for the fans.\" Dr. Jones points out that there is no research to prove that a period of abstinence has either a positive or detrimental effect on athletic performance, but she says that the players will likely be better rested.What will be fascinating, she says, is a study of how they perform without the other physical connection that they are so accustomed to -- the fans.\"How many of them are truly impacted without the energy? No matter what's going on in your environment, you've got to find a way to fight.\"She says that James might struggle without fans, \"because he's said it about 8,000 times.

But you also have to get it scanned before you leave and go to practice and when you come back.\"Hayward says it's the same procedure if you're pursuing a leisure activity -- like golf -- and every day there is a personal health questionnaire that must be completed.

You make the adjustments and you figure it out along the way.\"Life is indeed what you make it -- just ask the Trail Blazers' center Hassan Whiteside, who joyfully shot a video clip showing him and some of his teammates.Grinning from ear-to-ear, he said: \"Your chance of being seven feet [tall] is one in two million.\" He then panned the camera to show some very large basketball players wedged awkwardly into small and brightly colored paddling pools.\"To see three seven-footers in baby cold tubs! Disney is a magical place! Magic really do happen! This is better than beauty and the beast!\" It remains to be seen whether the NBA's finest athletes do come to regard this experience as akin to a prison sentence, but there's at least one thing that will make it feel very different: If they can keep their noses clean, they won't just be leaving with their personal possessions; they might be walking out through the gates with a trophy as well.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Mikhail Khachaturyan's body was found on a staircase in a Moscow apartment block in July 2018, with dozens of knife wounds to his chest and neck.  A few hours before his death, he had returned from a psychiatric clinic, lined up his three daughters to chastise them for the messy apartment and pepper-sprayed their faces, according to investigators and the sisters' lawyers. His eldest daughter Krestina, who has asthma, fainted.   That was the night that the Khachaturyan sisters -- Krestina, 19, Angelina, 18, and Maria, 17  -- decided to kill their father. They attacked him with a hammer, a knife, and the same can of pepper spray he had turned on them earlier.    Interrogation transcripts leaked to the press, and verified to CNN by a lawyer for one of the sisters, show that the women tried to inflict wounds on themselves to make it seem as if their father, who was sleeping at the start of the attack, had struck them with a knife first. Then they called the police and an ambulance.   Belarus says it's arrested Russian mercenaries, as rift grows between strongmen Putin and LukashenkoThe next day the three were arrested and confessed to the killing, saying they had endured years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse from their father, according to their lawyers and the Russian prosecutor general's office. Read MoreLast summer the sisters were indicted on charges of premeditated murder, sparking an uproar among activists in Russia, which is grappling with a far-reaching domestic abuse problem.   Legal proceedings against the sisters began on Friday, and are expected to continue for some time. The prosecution requested that sisters be banned from taking part in public events -- there are several demonstrations planned in their support -- and extend bans on internet access and talking to the media, each other and other participants of the trial for six months. The Khachaturyans' case quickly became a cause celebre for rights groups fighting to pass a law to protect victims of domestic abuse which was shelved by parliament in 2016. After a long and tangled pre-trial investigation, their trial opens Friday in a Moscow courtroom. The two elder sisters, Krestina and Angelina, will stand trial together. Maria, who was a minor at the time of the killing but indicted after she turned 18, has also been deemed mentally unfit to commit a murder and will be tried separately on a murder charge, according to one of the sisters' lawyers, Aleksey Liptser.Maria Khachaturyan walks out of a court building after a pre-trial hearing in Moscow on July 28, 2020.Domestic violence experts, along with the sisters' defense team, say that in the absence of adequate protective mechanisms within law enforcement and the court system, their only choice was to defend themselves or eventually die at their father's hands.   In text conversations obtained from their father's phone and published on Facebook by Liptser, Mikhail Khachaturyan appeared to have threatened to kill them and sexually abuse them and their mother. \"I will beat you up for everything, I will kill you,\" says one text from April 2018, accusing them of having sexual relations with a male friend. \"You are prostitutes and you will die as prostitutes.\" The interrogation transcripts also painted a chilling picture of mental, physical and sexual abuse dating at least four years prior to the killing.  \"We think that they had no other choice. The father drove the girls to despair, their whole life was a continuous hell. They cannot be compared to healthy, calm and balanced people ... [the] girls developed serious mental illnesses, including abuse syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder. This was confirmed by all examinations in the case,\" said one of the sisters' lawyers, Aleksey Parshin.  Exclusive: Russia claims it's on track to approve Covid-19 vaccine by mid-August. But speed of process raises questionsSince last summer, activists have organized dozens of demonstrations in support of the sisters under the \"I did not want to die\" campaign, calling on authorities to reclassify the case around the sisters' self-defense.  Celebrities ranging from former presidential candidate Ksenia Sobchak to the System of a Down singer Serj Tankian have issued pleas for leniency in the sisters' case.   A 2019 survey conducted by the independent pollster Levada Center showed that 47% of Russian women and 33% of men felt the actions of the Khachaturyan sisters were justified.   A 2019 investigation by Media Zona, a Russian outlet covering justice and prisons, said that almost 80% of Russian women imprisoned for premeditated murder in 2016-2018 were trying to protect themselves from an abuser.  While Russian lawmakers have left the domestic violence bill on the backburner since 2016, they did find time to decriminalize some forms of abuse three years ago.   In 2017, under pressure from the Russian Orthodox Church and defenders of \"traditional values,\" parliament overwhelmingly approved a bill that became known as the \"slapping law,\" which decriminalized first offense of domestic violence that does not seriously injure the person, making it a less serious administrative offense. Angelina (center) and Krestina (back), during a hearing at Moscow's Basmanny District Court. At first, public pressure seemed to have turned the case around for the Khachaturyan sisters.   In January, the prosecutor's office confirmed allegations made by the defense that the Khachaturyan sisters had suffered \"beating, constant humiliation, threats and abuse, physical and sexual violence,\" and that they had developed a \"defensive reaction.\" The prosecutors then ordered the Investigative Committee to reclassify the case from premeditated murder to necessary self-defense.  Parshin told state-news agency TASS at the time that the move \"essentially means the end of a criminal investigation\" against the sisters, who faced up to 20 years in prison under the premeditated murder charge.  Siberian heatwave made 600 times more likely by climate change, experts findBut in a stunning reversal, Viktor Grin, the same prosecutor who first recommended downgrading the case, confirmed in May that premeditated murder charges would indeed be laid against the sisters. No explanation was given for the change. Mari Davtyan, a lawyer for the sisters who often represents victims of domestic abuse, linked the reversal to a wider trend of dismissing human rights that has been growing since the passage of controversial amendments to the Russian constitution following a referendum on July 1.    The referendum, designed to solidify President Vladimir Putin's rule for years to come, was followed by a string of high-profile arrests, like the state treason charges brought against former journalist Ivan Safronov, or the prosecution of the ex-governor of Khabarovsk, Sergey Furgal, who has been whisked away to Moscow on years-old murder charges, prompting mass protests in Russia's Far East. Both deny any wrongdoing.\"I think it's impossible not to notice what's been going on every day since July 1, 2020, the state has chosen its path,\" Davtyan wrote on her Facebook page. \"And the Khachaturyan case is no exception.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A Dutch Holocaust survivor whose parents died at Auschwitz is demanding compensation from Germany, as well as from the country's rail network, which transported Jews to Nazi concentration camps -- often at their own cost.In 2018, Salo Muller successfully lobbied the Dutch state-owned railway company for an apology and compensation to victims and their surviving relatives who were transported on its trains toward Nazi death camps during World War II.Nederlandse Spoorwegen agreed to settle the case with 500 survivors and thousands of their direct descendants. Holocaust victim Salo Muller (L) and president director of Dutch railway company Nederlandse Spoorwegen Roger van Boxtel (R) during a presentation in Utrecht, Netherlands, on June 26, 2019. Now the 84-year-old, a former physiotherapist for Amsterdam's Ajax football club, has written to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and is seeking compensation from her government, as well as from the national railway company, Deutsche Bahn. According to Muller's own website, his parents were taken to the Westerbork camp in the northeast of the Netherlands in 1941, when he was 5 years old. From there, they were taken to Auschwitz, where they were killed. Muller's mother had been picked up in a raid shortly after she dropped him off at kindergarten; he spent the rest of the war in hiding.Dutch rail firm to compensate Holocaust survivors and familiesRead MoreAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), the Dutch government set up the camp at Westerbork in 1939 to hold Jewish refugees who had entered the Netherlands illegally, many from Germany.Between 1942 and 1944, following the German invasion of the Netherlands, Westerbork served as a transit camp for Dutch Jews before they were deported to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland.Between July 1942 and September 3, 1944, the Germans deported 97,776 Jews from Westerbork; nearly 55,000 of them were sent to Auschwitz and more than 34,000 to Sobibor, according to the USHMM. Most were murdered on arrival.Snow-covered personal effects of those deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp litter the train tracks leading to the camp's entrance, in an image from around 1945. Muller's lawyer, Axel Hagedorn, wrote in his letter to Merkel that the case centers on the \"Jews, Roma and Sinti, who were transported by the railway trains to the Westerbork concentration camps and then taken by the Nazis to the extermination camps in Eastern Europe by train.\"Dutch Jews were often forced to pay for their transportation, which netted the German railways millions of Reichsmarks between 1941 and 1944, Hagedorn wrote.\"This inflicted suffering becomes particularly reprehensible, when you know that the transported Jews had to pay the transportation costs themselves,\" he added.Hagedorn told CNN that there are varying estimates of the money the railway earned in this way, but that he could not be sure of an exact amount.80 years on, Germany to pay compensation to Kindertransport survivorsIn his letter to Merkel, Hagedorn said: \"The transport through the area of the German Reich was carried out by the German Reichsbahn (Railway). My client thinks it is about time for the Republic of Germany to take responsibility for their injustice.\"A government spokesman confirmed receipt of Muller's letter and told CNN that it would be \"carefully considered.\"The matter was raised at a German government press conference on Wednesday. Government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said that while she had not personally seen the letter, \"Germany, of course, is committed to its responsibility for the crimes of Nazi rule.\"She added: \"We will never forget the crimes committed by Germans during World War II. To this day, they fill us with great dismay and shame.\"In a statement provided by his lawyer, Muller told CNN: \"I certainly hope that awareness of the historic responsibility leads to a personal meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel.\"Auschwitz survivor to meet family of American GI whose kind gesture gave her hopeDeutsche Bahn was formed in 1994, following Germany's reunification. The company told CNN that even though it \"is not the legal successor to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, it is aware of its historical responsibility.\"Intense discussions over Holocaust compensation payouts in the 1990s led to the creation of the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future foundation and Deutsche Bahn contributed several millions to its assets, a spokesman told CNN. In addition, it launched a five-year project with the foundation in 2010 which, it said, benefited \"the survivors of forced labor, deportation and persecution.\"While the spokesman did not comment on Muller specifically, he said: \"We advocate a critical examination of the role of the Reichsbahn during the Nazi era.\"CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Josefine Ohema contributed to this article.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Moscow court sentenced former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed to nine years in prison Thursday for endangering \"life and health\" of Russian police officers in an altercation, state-run news agency TASS reported -- a sentence that drew swift condemnation from the top US diplomat in Russia.  Reed, 29, was taken into custody last year after a night of heavy drinking during a visit to Russia to visit a longtime girlfriend Alina Tsybulnik, according to TASS and Reed's family. Police told state-run news agency RIA-Novosti that Reed was involved in an altercation with two women and a police unit that arrived at the scene following complaints of a disturbance and took him to a police station. Police alleged Reed resisted the arrest, attacked the driver, hit another policeman, caused the car to swerve by grabbing the wheel and created a hazardous situation on the road, RIA stated.But Reed and his family asserted in a statement to CNN that the charges were false, and accused the Russian police of making false and conflicting statements and of suppressing evidence that could exonerate him.\"He has no memory of the evening past drinking vodka and being asked to toast many times,\" the statement published by Reed's family said. Read MoreTsybulnik, Reed's girlfriend, also disputed the police account, according to TASS. \"(The police) constantly change their story... in my opinion, Reed was too drunk to resist them,\" Tsybulnik told TASS.US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan called the criminal proceeding against Reed a \"theater of the absurd\" in a statement.\"This conviction, and a sentence of nine years, for an alleged crime that so obviously did not occur, is ridiculous,\" Sullivan said. \"I cannot even say 'miscarriage of justice' because clearly 'justice' was not even considered. This was theater of the absurd.\" Senior Russian officials did not immediately respond to Sullivan's criticism.Reed is one of several American citizens convicted in Russia in recent years on charges that their families and in some cases the US government have said are groundless.In June, former US Marine Paul Whelan was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in prison by a Moscow court, concluding a months-long case that put additional strain to already complicated US-Russian relations. The Trump administration has condemned the charges against Whelan.Whelan's lawyer has speculated publicly that his sentencing will be used as leverage by the Kremlin to arrange a prisoner swap for two Russians in US custody, Viktor Bout and Konstantin Yaroshenko.The Foreign Ministry later called ongoing speculation about a swap to be \"rumors.\" But last year the ministry raised the possibility that Yaroshenko -- who was convicted of drug smuggling in 2011 and sentenced to 20 years in prison -- could be returned \"in exchange for any American national\" held in Russia. Yaroshenko is serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. Bout, a Russian arms dealer dubbed the \"Merchant of Death\" who was sentenced to 25 years in US federal prison in 2012, has also been mentioned in Russian and international media reports about a potential swap.",

        "content": "London  (CNN)Online anti-Semitic hate incidents in the United Kingdom are on the rise, with conspiracy theories accusing Jews of creating and spreading Covid-19 circulating online, a report published Thursday has warned. The Community Security Trust (CST) recorded 789 anti-Semitic incidents across the UK from January to June 2020, with the majority of incidents in cities with the largest Jewish populations: London and Greater Manchester. Although the figures show a 13% fall from the 911 incidents recorded in the first half of 2019, it is the third-highest number of incidents the CST -- which has been recording anti-Semitic incidents since 1984 -- has ever recorded in the January to June period of any year, the charity said. Online anti-Semitic incidents rose 4% in the UK from January to June, the monitoring organization found, warning that the pandemic and lockdown measures fostered an \"explosion of antisemitic discourses.\" Wiley sparks Twitter virtual 'walkout' over anti-Semitic tweetsThere were 344 reported online incidents between January and June, compared to 332 during the same period in 2019.Read MoreHowever, the charity also warned that the figures \"understate the scale of the problem\" of online anti-Semitism, with figures only reflecting those incidents which were reported by the victim or a witness.The charity reported incidents including the circulation of conspiracy theories accusing Jews of creating and spreading Covid-19, inventing the virus as a \"hoax,\" as well as anti-Semitic rhetoric, \"simply wishing that Jewish people catch the virus and die.\"The findings come just days after actors, activists and performing arts organizations staged a 48-hour protest to challenge Twitter's handling of anti-Semitic social media posts by British rapper Wiley. Wiley, who has been described as the godfather of grime music, posted a string of anti-Semitic comments on his Twitter and Instagram late last week. Although some of the posts were blocked and removed, UK government officials and other public figures blasted both platforms for leaving other posts up for too long and for not doing enough overall to stop anti-Semitism.The CST said the lowest anti-Semitic incident monthly totals in April and March, with 98 and 102 incidents respectively, correlated with lockdown measures enforced across the country. Although there was a 45% decrease in the number of violent anti-Semitic assaults, with 47 in total, the CST said pandemic restrictions had prompted those spreading anti-Jewish hate to find new ways of working.Neo-Nazis encouraging followers to 'deliberately infect' Jews and Muslims with coronavirus In the first half of 2020, the charity said it received 10 reports of educational or religious online events being hijacked with anti-Semitic content.\"This is an entirely new type of incident, informed by a sudden widespread reliance on such platforms, demonstrating the ability, opportunism and speed of antisemitic offenders to adapt to a new social reality,\" the report warned. \"Any reduction in antisemitism is welcome, but it is worrying that even during a national lockdown antisemitic incidents only fell by 13 per cent and new antisemitic lies have emerged to add to old hatreds,\" CST chief executive David Delew said in a statement. \"History tells us that antisemitism grows at times of great social upheaval and we need to ensure the same is not happening here.\"Earlier this month, a UK government counterterrorism agency warned it was receiving increasing reports of far-right, far-left and Islamist extremists attempting to capitalize on the pandemic, exploiting the crisis to promote divisive, xenophobic and racist narratives \"to sow division\" and create social discord.The commission said it had heard reports of misinformation and harmful propaganda across the ideological spectrum, including Neo-Nazis and far-right activists telling followers to \"deliberately infect\" Jews and Muslims with coronavirus.",

It will be approved for public use, with frontline healthcare workers getting it first, they said.\"It's a Sputnik moment,\" said Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is financing Russian vaccine research, referring to the successful 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union. \"Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnik's beeping.

And while there hasn't been a \"full official approach to Russia from the US side,\" some private companies in the US have also \"started preliminary inquiries to find out more about the vaccine,\" Dmitriev claimed Thursday. However, the sovereign wealth fund declined to name the companies.Russia is open to cooperating with the US, according to Dmitriev. He added that he does not \"exclude the possibility that the [US] will be one of the countries to approve the Russian vaccine, following clinical trials and approvals.\"While some global vaccines are in the third phase of trials, the Russian vaccine is yet to complete its second phase. Developers plan to complete that phase by August 3, and then conduct the third phase of testing in parallel with the vaccination of the medical workers.Russians scientists say the vaccine has been quick to develop because it is a modified version of one already created to fight against other diseases. That's the approach being taken in many other countries and by other companies. Notably, Moderna, whose vaccine is being backed by the US government and which started Phase 3 testing Monday, has built its coronavirus vaccine on the backbone of a vaccine it had been developing for a related virus, MERS. While this has sped the development process, US and European regulators are requiring the full complement of safety and efficacy tests for the vaccine. Russia's defense ministry says that soldiers served as volunteers in human trials. In recorded comments provided to CNN, Alexander Ginsburg, the director of the project, said he has already injected himself with the vaccine.Russian officials say the drug is being fast-tracked through approval because of the global pandemic and Russia's own severe coronavirus problem. The country now has more than 800,000 confirmed cases. \"Our scientists focused not on being the first but on protecting people,\" said Dmitriev.  The vaccine uses human adenovirus vectors that have been made weaker so they do not replicate in the body. Unlike most vaccines in development it relies on two vectors, not one, and patients would receive a second booster shot.Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with health workers at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow on June 20.Officials say their scientific data is currently being compiled and will be made available for peer review and publication in early August.\"Russia marshaled its leadership position in vaccine development and its proven Ebola and MERS vaccine platform to bring the first safe and efficient solution to the world's biggest problem,\" Dmitriev told CNN previously.The World Health Organization says there is no approved vaccine for MERS.Nonetheless, officials from the Russian Direct Investment Fund told CNN at least 20 countries had expressed interest in obtaining the vaccine, including India, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. CNN could not immediately verify these details but has reached out to the countries mentioned for comment.The Health Ministry says frontline medical staff will be the first vaccinated, once the new drug has been approved for public use.In a government meeting on Wednesday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova confirmed that the vaccine would be registered in August, while adding Russia would mass-produce it by September.Large-scale vaccine trials in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere are proceeding rapidly but have not committed to deadlines by which their products will be approved.Early results from trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca were promising, but Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization Health Emergencies Program, said earlier this month that \"there's a long way to go.\"\"These are Phase 1 studies. We now need to move into larger scale real-world trials, but it is good to see more data and more products moving into this very important phase of vaccine discovery,\" he said.Earlier this month, the Kremlin denied allegations Russian spies hacked into American, Canadian and British research labs to steal vaccine development secrets.Russian officials also denied reports members of the country's political and business elite -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin -- had been given early access to the vaccine.CNN's Zahra Ullah contributed to this report from Moscow and Rob Picheta contributed from London.",

        "content": "(CNN)British wheelchair basketball athlete George Bates has said he is considering having his leg amputated after a rule change left him ineligible to play for Great Britain.The 26-year-old Bates, who is from Leicester, England, would have been likely to represent GB at the Paralympics in Japan in 2021, but the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has deemed his disability does not meet its eligibility categories.He has represented GB at the World and European Championships, helping Team GB secure gold and silver medals.Bates was injured while playing football at the age of 11 and subsequently developed complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), which has left him walking with the use of a crutch and leaves him in constant pain.The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke says CRPS is a chronic pain condition \"believed to be caused by damage to, or malfunction of, the peripheral and central nervous systems.The Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics were supposed to start this week. Here's what's happening insteadRead MoreBates, who was discovered wheelchair basketball when he was 13, was told on Tuesday that his disability does not meet its strict criteria for competing in international games -- a decision that he is appealing. He said he is considering having his own leg amputated to be able to compete and claimed on Twitter he would take legal action against the body.The IPC reviewed its classification criteria in 2015 to include just 10 eligible disability categories. At the time the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF) adhered to its own, separate criteria -- which did include Bates' condition.However, an IWBF spokeswoman told CNN it has now brought its own rules in line with the IPC following, she claimed, pressure from the body and did so \"with great sadness.\"CNN has reached out to the IPC for comment.Speaking to the BBC's \"Today\" program on Thursday, Bates said: \"The IPC have forced the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation to change their classification code. \"They basically want every disability ... to fit into a small 10 point category and if you're not in any of those points then you're deemed as ineligible, even if they acknowledge that you do have a disability, which is kind of what's happened in my case.\"Disability isn't 'black and white'The IPC, he said, had acknowledged he had CRPS and that it had long lasting effects on muscle power, weight bearing and range of movement but had nonetheless said the disability was not within its criteria.\"I fully agree there needs to be a process to go through it but as I said I'm unable to walk properly and have to walk with an aid. What more is needed than that?,\" he said.\"They've recognized I do have a disability but it doesn't fit into their 10 bullet point [check list]. There's going to be hundreds of disabilities like that because disability isn't a black and white thing, it's not a tick box you can do.\"He questioned how someone could be registered as a disabled person, but unable to participate at the highest level of the sport.Meet the Paralympic swimmer changing perceptions of disability Asked whether he was serious about having his leg amputated in order to fit with the IPC criteria, he said that, if his appeals and other avenues are \"exhausted\" then \"it's going to have to be a consideration.\"Ulf Mehrens, IWBF president, said in a statement to CNN: \"I would like to emphasize that a player who has been deemed non-eligible has not cheated the system or intentionally misrepresented in anyway. \"IWBF still fully believes in our classification philosophy and that the sport should be inclusive to anyone with an eligible lower limb impairment ... However, as a member of the Paralympic movement and a signatory to the IPC code, IWBF must meet compliance in accordance with the demands of IPC.\"",

It could be filled with anything.\"I don't even have Twitter on my phone anymore because it's almost certain that you're going to get some sort of abuse, especially after games and stuff, because it happens so freely.Read More\"That same 12-year-old boy contacted like three other players, racially abused three other players as well, in my team. So it's like, this is not OK.

Last month, we also introduced a new safety feature that allows public figures to prevent people they do not know from sending them a message.\"Facebook told CNN that it is working closely with clubs, players and anti-racism organizations such as Kick It Out to investigate racist abuse and take appropriate actions, while Twitter says it has \"suspended nearly 300 accounts and taken action on nearly 6,000 examples of abuse and hateful content.\"However, given the ease with which anonymous accounts can send him racist abuse, Zaha questions how effective these strategies are.\"What happens after that account gets blocked?\" he says. \"Then they just make a new account straight after. I've tried to block people so many times and I've looked on Instagram for the option to block them for racial abuse, but there isn't that option there. \"That doesn't come up, it has harassment [and] different stuff, but there's no racial abuse option that comes up.

Twitter didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.'Where has that hate even come from?'Zaha has been dealing with these messages throughout his career.Aside from brief spells at Manchester United and Cardiff City, the 27-year-old has spent his entire career at boyhood club Crystal Palace. On the international stage, Zaha initially played for England before switching to play for the Ivory Coast, his country of birth.In his early days playing for Crystal Palace, he recalls one instance of racist abuse prior to a match against Manchester United in which the perpetrator wished for him to break his legs and told him to \"go back to the slums of Croydon.\"With social media's growth over the last decade, Zaha says these incidents have only become more prevalent and he feels these companies place the burden of responsibility for dealing with racist abuse on the shoulders of Black footballers, rather than on the culprits or themselves.\"These people saying these things around their kids, this is the result and then we just have to deal with it,\" he says. \"Why should I have to block comments? Why should I have to change up my life so that I don't get affected by the things these people are saying?\"Why are they not prosecuted for what they're saying to us? Why do we have all these tabs? How can I go through 15 minutes just blocking racist words I don't want to see on my account? Why not get through to the person who's saying these things to us?\"These platforms have to be held accountable for these things because the statements ain't good enough. They're not good enough.\"Wilfried Zaha takes a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement before the matcha against Burnley.Speaking to CNN in 2018, former professional footballer Marvin Sordell opened up about the battle with depression he faced throughout his career.While the conversation around mental health among footballers has undoubtedly improved in recent years, Zaha believes there is still some way to go before people truly understand the impact that online abuse can have.\"People think you are a footballer, you get this much money, you do this, you get that,\" he says. \"But it comes at a price. Like the sacrifice of ... it's like you're not seen as a human, like you have no privacy, people feel like they can say whatever they like to you. It's ridiculous.\"People never understand it, people just think: 'Look at the life you have, you should just rise above it.' It's not spoken about enough but the depression side of it is unbelievable.\"A friend of mine who I used to play with, Marvin Sordell, he was talking about how he nearly committed suicide because of it. Just all the hate and all the abuse. It's just like, do you not see what is doing to people? But still no action.\"Zaha says he has hired a life coach to help him cope with his emotions and the mental toll the racist abuse has taken. \"There's so much stuff you deal with in your life already and then you go on your Instagram, you go on your Twitter and you're being abused at the same time,\" he says. \"So obviously it gets a bit much at times and I feel like that's what I needed because I'm 27.

It's sad, really, because how is a 12-year-old even thinking about that?\" he says. \"Where has that hate even come from? From the age of 12? It doesn't make sense.\"I understand he's a 12-year-old, it's sad that it's a 12-year-old but you have to be held accountable for the things that you say, too.

Its scientific name is \"Daptolestes bronteflavus,\" which is derived from Latin like most scientific names -- and translates to \"blond thunder.\" The Thor fly has flecks of gold and light brown on its body, antennae, and face, calling to mind Thor's blond hair and the gold features on his outfits.Morning @chrishemsworth!

Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston, fakes his own death at one point, betrays other characters, and uses visual illusions.Read MoreBlack Widow, also known as Natasha Romanoff, also has her own fly -- \"Daptolestes feminategus,\" meaning woman wearing leather, in reference to Scarlett Johansson's iconic leather suit worn in the movies.Deadpool also has his own fly, colored orange-red and black, the same as Deadpool's suit -- and it shares similar markings as Deadpool's mask.\"We chose the name Humorolethalis sergius (for Deadpool). It sounds like lethal humor and is derived from the Latin words humorosus, meaning wet or moist, and lethalis meaning dead,\" said CSIRO entomologist Dr. Bryan Lessard in a statement on Wednesday.The Deadpool fly is a species of Robber fly, which are \"assassins of the insect world\" -- fitting for the mercenary antihero. Finally, there's a Stan Lee fly, in honor of the late Marvel Comics visionary. Lee is known as the founding force behind the modern Marvel behemoth, and co-created Spider-Man and many other popular characters. The fly, named \"Daptolestes leei,\" has markings on its face reminiscent of Lee's characteristic sunglasses and white mustache. Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee and the Daptolestes leei fly.Naming newly discovered species is an \"important superpower in solving many of the world's challenges,\" said the CSIRO statement.The scientists also named 151 new insects, eight new plants, two new fish, one new mite, three new subspecies of bird, and 25 marine invertebrates, some of which were discovered several decades ago and remained unnamed, while others were a more recent find.The names for these aren't quite as whimsical, but some do pay tribute to other things -- for instance, they named two species after \"Investigator,\" the research ship that discovered them.Naming species allows scientists to have a little fun, but the meticulous process is also vital for researchers, conservationists, and other types of experts. Being able to identify and differentiate between species allows experts to learn more about them and to \"help save their lives and our own,\" said the statement.Only about a quarter of Australian insects are known to science, said Lessard in the study. The statement added, \"the more species are named, the better we can understand their super powers.\"",

To satisfy public health guidelines, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Department of Culture and Tourism for Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi) sealed off the near 10-square-mile (25 km) island, which included the arena, hotel, training facilities, and dining establishments for approximately 2,500 athletes, coaches, staff, event personnel, and Yas Island employees. \"It was a success in every way you can measure success,\" White told CNN World Sport's Don Riddell from his headquarters in Las Vegas, speaking about the four events which occurred between July 11 and July 25. \"Zero positives on the Island, 12,500 tests, 100 athletes, four title fights ... they're [Abu Dhabi] light years ahead of everybody else in what's going on with Covid, so it really was the perfect partnership.\"Read MoreREAD: Khabib to fight Gaethje in October return, says WhiteUFC president Dana White says his 'Fight Island' idea has been a success. 'I never listen to the media'While White was ahead of the game by bringing UFC back as quickly as possible he did seemingly come in for some criticism within the media for his sport's swift return to the Octagon. Reflecting on recent events, his sense of vindication is palpable.Leaning into the camera, the 51-year-old White exclaims; \"Where are they now!?\"He added: \"Why aren't they writing the stories that they were wrong, and we could do this, and we could pull it off, and it has been safe?\"I never listen to the media, ever. The media will never determine how I run my business or how I live my life, ever.\"Before 'Fight Island' took flight, US locations in Jacksonville, Florida, and the sport's main base of Las Vegas had been hosting events (UFC did postpone multiple events before May 9). Time never stands still, especially in the often-whirlwind world of UFC, with a Fight Night scheduled for the Apex in Vegas this weekend. Nine fights are planned for the month of August, bringing the grand total since May to 21, which (coincidentally) is a number synonymous with Vegas. In a more somber moment, White concedes that the maintaining of safety back on US soil is a constant cause for concern. \"It's something that I worry about every day,\" White admits. \"Everything that we've done has been successful; it's been safe. I think that we've now proven ourselves that we can do this and we can pull this off, because I'm not afraid to spend the money.

Games were postponed within days of America's national pastime starting its season across its many ballparks around the country. White, who tells CNN Sport that he has not heard from any of the numerous commissioners, does impart some advice he presumably would have shared with anyone who had called. \"One thing I can tell everybody,\" he adds. \"This isn't going to work outside of a bubble. You've got to have the bubble, you have to put people in lockdown, people can't be sneaking out, people can't go home. You know, in Abu Dhabi, the people [who worked with UFC] ... haven't seen their families in two months.\"White says returning sports should adopt a safety \"bubble\". READ: Major League Baseball season start overshadowed by Covid-19When matters turn to the fight game itself, White confirms that one of the sport's undoubted stars, reigning Lightweight Champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, will be returning to the Octagon on October 24, against Justin Gaethje, in a bout fans have longed to see.The Russian Nurmagomedov is reportedly back in training after the death of his father and trainer, Abdulmanap, 57, who passed away in a Moscow hospital due to complications stemming from Covid-19 infection.\"It's been very rough on him,\" affirms White. \"His father was a hero to him. He loved his father; they had a very close relationship and it was very hard on him.\"Another notable update is White offering his perspective on Max Holloway's controversial split decision loss to Alexander Volkanovski, in their recent featherweight title fight at UFC 251. (How controversial? An online sportsbook refunded bets on Holloway to win, or win by decision.)\"It's the one tough part about the sport,\" claims White. \"The refs aren't always going to be perfect; the judges aren't always going to be perfect, and I haven't really talked about this publicly, but you probably have to do the fight again.

        "content": "(CNN)Turkey's parliament passed a bill on Wednesday that regulates social media content in what is being criticized by rights groups as \"damaging\" to freedom of expression. Here's what it all means. What's in the new law?The bill imposes comprehensive regulations on social media, requiring foreign social media companies with over 1 million users -- such as Twitter and Facebook -- to have a representative in the country. Under the new law, social media providers will be required to store domestic user data in Turkey, imposing fines of up to $1.5 million, as well as bandwidth restrictions and advertising bans, for failure to comply.The government defends the bill as an effort to protect approximately 55 million users in Turkey from disinformation. \"The bill was prepared with an innovative approach to protect users as opposed to curtailing them,\" Ismail Cesur, a presidential adviser said in a tweet.\"The bill aims to protect the basic rights and freedoms of citizens and to get ahead of the disinformation,\" ruling Justice and Development Party deputy chairman Mahir Unal said in an interview with state broadcaster TRT.The official page of Twitter Turkey is displayed on a mobile phone. Read MoreWhy are rights groups worried?Critics fear the new law will weaponize social media companies against voices critical of the government.Turkey's record on freedom of speech and expression has already been on the decline. More than 408,000 websites were blocked by the end of 2019 in Turkey, according to a report from Turkish internet freedom watchdog Ifade Ozgurlugu Platformu.In the same period, 7,000 Twitter accounts, 40,000 tweets, 10,000 Youtube videos and 6,200 Facebook content was blocked. While some companies have complied with take down orders from Turkish courts for some content, other requests have been ignored.The new law forces companies to comply with take-down orders. \"The aim is to silence criticism,\" said Yaman Akdeniz, a cyber rights expert and law professor at Istanbul's Bilgi University.When does it take effect?The law still needs to be approved by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but at this point that is just a formality. He has come out in favor of more regulations on social media platforms already. The bill that passed in parliament gives the tech companies until October to comply with the new law.What are the tech companies doing?Social media companies have not reacted to the bill yet but cyber rights experts say platforms should leave the Turkish market instead of complying with the new law. \"I tell the tech companies, under these circumstances, do not come. If you do, you will become the long arm of the Turkish judiciary system and you will be compelled to comply with all the requests,\" said Akdeniz. The law effectively means platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are going to have to decide whether to pull out of the lucrative Turkish market or stick around while complying with the new measures.Facebook and Snapchat declined to comment, while Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.Has this happened elsewhere?The Turkish government says the bill is modeled after Germany's Network Enforcement Act on combating hate speech online. \"We looked at Germany as our starting point for all of it from ensuring our freedom in using social platforms, to combating disinformation to protecting the right to privacy and the protection of our data and came up with these new regulations,\" the ruling party's Unal said. But rights groups have criticized the German bill as flawed.\"It is vague, overbroad, and turns private companies into overzealous censors to avoid steep fines, leaving users with no judicial oversight or right to appeal,\" said Wenzel Michalski, Germany director at Human Rights Watch in a statement when the German law passed in 2018. Akdeniz also warned that given Turkey's political climate, a steep decline in freedom of speech and a track record of silencing critics, \"the comparison to Germany doesn't stand.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Just when it seemed that Europe was getting to grips with the coronavirus pandemic, Covid-19 appears to be spreading again.Fresh outbreaks are sweeping across the continent as they have in Asia, bringing with them renewed lockdown measures and a clear message that no country is safe from a resurgence.Germany is a perfect example; its center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), on Monday said that a recent spike in cases was \"very disturbing.\"The country was held up as a poster-child for how to handle the pandemic, with its rapid response, mass testing capacity, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's calm and clear communication all winning praise.While more than 4% of patients with coronavirus died worldwide in March, Germany's Covid-19 mortality rate was just 0.4% -- despite a high number of reported cases.Read MoreEven countries that got coronavirus under control are now struggling. That's deeply concerning for the rest of the worldBy mid-April, it had tested more than 2 million people and was carrying out around 400,000 tests a week, according to the RKI.Unlike some world leaders, Merkel -- a former scientist -- appeared to grasp the seriousness of the situation early, making a persuasive speech in March to convince the public that widespread restrictions were necessary.Germany only began reopening after its reproduction, or \"R\" rate -- the average number of people each patient with the virus goes on to infect -- had fallen below 1, to 0.7. But once the lockdown was eased, new outbreaks soon followed, with a spike of 900 cases in a day in May and a series of clusters recorded at slaughterhouses. The number of new daily cases had dropped to around 500 a day in recent weeks, but rose to 815 on Friday, the RKI said. Germany's four-day reproduction rate was 1.28 on Monday, and its seven-day \"R\" rate was 1.10, according to the Institute. It said the new cases were linked to large gatherings, workplaces and community facilities, as well as to travelers returning from other countries.  Merkel's chief of staff, Helge Braun, said Monday that the figures were a \"cause for concern,\" and that in order to tackle the pandemic in the fall, cases need to be kept \"well under 500\" a day during the summer.The government is now offering free tests to residents of the Bavarian town of Mamming, southern Germany, which is facing an outbreak among seasonal workers on a vegetable farm. Workers at other Bavarian farms will also be tested.Spreading across EuropeThe rise in European cases reflects the acceleration seen in Australia and in Asian countries that had appeared to have the virus under control.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Tuesday that there were signs of a second wave in Europe.Speaking to journalists about the UK's decision to impose a quarantine on people returning from Spain, Johnson said: \"What we had to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risk is starting to bubble up again.\"  \"Let's be absolutely clear about what's happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends, I'm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic,\" Johnson said. Spain had been recording fewer than 400 new daily cases for most of June, but reported 855 new coronavirus cases on Monday, the Spanish Health Ministry's data showed. The Director of the Spanish Center for Health Emergencies, Fernando Simon, said there was a high number of cases in Aragon and Catalonia, but he did not think it was a second wave. The UK government reported 685 new cases on Monday, with cases remaining relatively stable in recent weeks.People wait for Covid-19 tests on Monday in the Brittany resort of Quiberon, western France, after a cluster emerged there last week.The growth in infection has been tied to an increase in movement linked to summer vacations. Germany and France have both announced plans to test passengers from \"high risk\" countries on arrival -- including those from the United States -- in addition to compulsory 14-day quarantines.France, which is offering free tests, has seen new daily cases creep back to the same level as when its lockdown lifted on May 11, Health Minister Olivier Veran told the French newspaper Le Parisien Sunday.Veran said the country was not yet in a second wave of the pandemic, but warned that cases were rising sharply -- exceeding 1,000 in 24 hours last week.Echoing research from Japan suggesting that many of the new clusters were originating in people under 40 who displayed few symptoms, Veran said patients were younger than before, and in a tweet appealed to young people in particular to maintain vigilance. Women wearing masks walk along the seafront in Quiberon after a nighttime curfew was imposed on local beaches.On Friday, the French Health Ministry said the \"R\" rate had risen to 1.3 and warned that \"the virus is circulating throughout the country.\"The mayor of Quiberon in Brittany issued a nighttime curfew on beaches, parks and public gardens from Sunday after an outbreak in the popular tourist destination linked to young people gathering at bars or similar settings. Masks were also made mandatory at open-air markets and on busy streets, after the government made them compulsory in all indoor spaces last week.He called on people to greatly reduce social contact, fearing \"a detrimental relaxation in behavior and the strong potential for the spread of the virus in the territory.\"Reinstating strict rulesFrance's Prime Minister Jean Castex said Saturday that he wanted to avoid the negative impact of a national lockdown and instead would look to impose localized restrictions, as seen in Germany and the UK. Travel operators have also called for \"regional corridors\" to enable trips to certain areas, helping to minimize economic damage from the pandemic.But Belgium is tightening restrictions nationwide until the end of August after new infections increased in the country by an average of 193 a day last week -- up 91% compared with the previous seven days, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes told CNN.From Wednesday, social bubble sizes will be reduced from 15 to just five people, gatherings will be capped at 10, and stores will reinstate earlier rules which limited people to 30 minutes solo shopping.Nurses put on protective gear and gloves before taking a nasal swab test for the novel coronavirus at a temporary testing center at a church in Antwerp, Belgium, on Monday.Contact tracing will be reinforced in higher risk situations. Belgium also made masks compulsory in outdoor markets and busy shopping areas in addition to indoor spaces. \"These measures are not advice, they are orders,\" Wilmes said, according to the spokeswoman, acknowledging that this strengthening of the rules was a \"hard blow for our morale, but we'd prefer to take these measures today than to regret it tomorrow.\" As for Italy, once the epicenter of the pandemic, the country's health minister said last week that it was now \"out of the storm,\" although it has some way to go to eliminate the virus.But new daily cases exceeded 300 last week for the first time in a month, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. And the evidence from other nations shows that nothing is guaranteed, suggesting anyone rushing to book a trip to Italy should be wary of further clusters of cases. The Italian government on Friday introduced a new quarantine order for travelers entering the country from Romania or Bulgaria. \"The virus is not defeated and continues to circulate. This is why caution and attention are still needed,\" said Health Minister Roberto Speranza.\"The international situation is worrying, we are in the worst moment of the epidemic in the world,\" said Speranza, cautioning that the crisis will only \"be a thing of the past\" when a successful vaccine is developed.The evidence shows that the bluntest instruments of control are working against the virus -- such as lockdowns, quarantines, travel bans and social distancing -- and these may be humanity's most reliable tools until a vaccine is found and distributed.Whether a more nuanced approach can work will soon become clear, as countries fumble to find the most effective and least punitive defenses against further waves of infection.CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Nina Avramova, Alexander Durie, Pierre Buet, Nadine Schmidt, Duarte Mendonca, Pierre Bairin, Sharon Braithwaite, Valentina Di Donato and Nicole Ruotolo contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Chinese students in Australia are being coerced by criminal gangs to fake their own kidnappings as part of an elaborate global extortion racket targeting vulnerable overseas communities, authorities said Monday.Eight students in the state of New South Wales (NSW) were targeted in \"virtual kidnapping\" scams this year, with overseas relatives paying a total of 3.2 million Australian dollars ($2.3 million) in ransom, police said in a statement.In one case, the father of a 22-year-old Chinese student in Sydney handed over a more than $1.4 million after being sent a video of his daughter bound in an unknown location. Another family in China paid more than $14,000 after receiving a video of their 22-year-old relative bound and blindfolded via the messaging app WeChat. She was found by NSW police safe in a hotel room. The student victims are left \"traumatized by what has occurred, believing they have placed themselves, and their loved ones, in real danger,\" said NSW Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell in a statement.Read MoreThe NSW police said that scammers were targeting vulnerable members of the Chinese-Australian community, such as international students living away from friends and family in an unfamiliar environment.There are about 165,000 Chinese students in Australia this year, though the number may be lower due to the coronavirus pandemic; the figure usually hovers between 200,000 and 210,000, according to government figuresCNN has reached out to the Australian Federal Police for further comment.What is virtual kidnapping?Here's how the scam works: First, the scammers make calls to random numbers, often speaking in Mandarin. This acts as a kind of filter -- Australians who don't understand Chinese typically hang up, while international Chinese students respond in Mandarin.Then, the scammers claim to be a Chinese authority, such as a member of the Chinese embassy or police. The scammer convinces the victim they have been implicated in a crime in China, and warn the victim they face extradition to China to face criminal charges in court -- or even threaten their families with criminal sanctions if they don't cooperate. Scammers often use technology to mask their physical location and to program the host number, so it appears like the call is coming from actual Chinese authorities. If victims look up the caller's phone number online, it will match the number of Chinese police or the embassy, said Dr. Lennon Chang, a Senior Lecturer in Criminology at Australia's Monash University.The scam can then go two ways, according to the NSW police statement. In one scenario, victims are threatened or coerced into transferring money into offshore bank accounts.The victims are ordered to take photos of themselves bound and blindfolded, which are then sent to their families overseas for ransom demands.In the other scenario, victims are convinced to fake their own kidnappings, and their family is pressed for money. In this case, the scammers order victims to cease contact with their families and friends and rent a hotel room for their own protection and safety. Victims are told to photograph themselves tied up and blindfolded -- which are then sent to the victim's family overseas. When the family is unable to contact their child in Australia, they then send the ransom payment in exchange for their child's release. The scammer continues making threats and ransom demands until they can't obtain any further payments -- at which point the victim's family often reports the incident to police, said the police statement.The authorities often end up finding the victim safe at home or in a hotel. Why Chinese students make easy targetsThe scam, which has been reported in various other states across Australia like Victoria and Queensland, works well by preying on susceptible, young, often sheltered foreign students.\"International students are the vulnerable group because they don't have real support in this country,\" said Chang. \"For this kind of scam, (victims) don't have a lot of experience with society, so they might believe the so-called 'embassy people.'\"International students also make good targets because they have a home and family elsewhere, Chang said. For scammers, a good victim is \"someone with a good connection with people in China, who've left China for a long time.\"\"If you're an Australian-born Chinese and someone tells you you're involved in organized crime in China, you'd tell them to go away,\" he added. \"But if you're a Chinese international student, you might be worried about your family, your situation, back in your hometown.\"Among international students, Chinese students are also thought to be uniquely susceptible owing to mainland China's authoritarian legal system, under which activists, international organizations, and everyday citizens face detention, deportation, or other types of punishment for a wide range of crimes. Citizens have been arrested for something as innocuous as posting an online video of catching fish while wearing a red scarf. It's not that far a leap for young international students to imagine the police might be calling for some crime they didn't know they committed. Virtual kidnappings are rattling families across the USChinese students \"tend to follow the authorities ... tend to believe the government is always doing the right thing,\" Chang said. \"So when (victims) have a phone call like this, especially when we've double checked the number online, we tend to follow the instructions from the 'embassy people'. It's definitely a cultural issue here.\"Afterward, victims can be reluctant to report the incident due to shame or embarrassment, said the NSW police.\"Scams take advantage of people's trust in authorities and fear of doing the wrong thing,\" said the Australian Federal Police in a statement. \"Victims can feel an array of emotions -- from helplessness and humiliation to anger and guilt -- but it's important to know you are not to blame and there is help at hand.\"NSW police said they are working with the state government and Chinese Embassy in Australia to investigate and warn the community of these scams. Authorities are urging students and other any potential victims to report such calls to their universities, embassies, or local police, and not to respond to the callers' demands.Scams around the worldWhile these kinds of scams have been reported for years, authorities said they appeared to be increasing.\"Virtual kidnappings ... have developed considerably over the last decade by transnational organized crime syndicates,\" said NSW Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Bennett in a statement. Last year, there were 1,172 reports of what police call \"Chinese authority\" phone scam across Australia. It's unclear how many of these were attempts to coerce fake kidnappings or the other scenario of depositing money into offshore accounts, and if all were successful.Authorities said scammers targeted Chinese international students, in particular, but they also tried Australian and international victims from non-English speaking backgrounds.The 2019 scams saw a loss of more than 2 million Australian dollars ($1.43 million), according to NSW police. In 2018, the federal police said there were nearly 1,700 scam calls reported, resulting in losses of nearly 1.2 million Australian dollars ($855,000).Similar scams have been reported across the United States, targeting Chinese students and other minorities.The Chinese Consulate General of Chicago warned in 2018 that some of the more sophisticated scammers have even hacked into the mission's phone lines, calling or leaving voice messages to victims in the consular district. That year in Canada, three students went missing in the Toronto area, prompting a citywide search. They were later found by police, who said it was likely a faked kidnapping ordered by scammers.Unfortunately, these types of crimes are very difficult to investigate due to the use of encrypted messaging apps, techniques to alter host phone numbers, hacking and offshore accounts, Australian detective Bennett said in a news conference on Monday. \"Our message today is one of prevention,\" he said. \"The overwhelming message is to don't pay any money ... Call the authorities, or just hang up.\"",

But there's good news -- the animal and its owners have now made a full recovery. The feline's infection was confirmed following tests at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) laboratory in Weybridge, England, on July 22, according to a press release from the UK government.From farmed mink to your pet cat, here's what we know about coronavirus and animalsThe government said the cat was \"the first confirmed case of an animal infection with the coronavirus strain in the UK.\" It said there was no evidence the cat had transmitted the virus to its owners. \"All available evidence suggests that the cat contracted the coronavirus from its owners who had previously tested positive for Covid-19,\" the press release added. The cat was initially diagnosed by a private vet with feline herpes virus -- a common respiratory infection among cats -- but was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 as part of a research program. Follow-up testing at the APHA laboratory confirmed the cat had SARS-CoV-2, which manifests as Covid-19 in humans.Read More'Rare event'Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss called it a \"very rare event\" with \"infected animals detected to date only showing mild clinical signs and recovering within in a few days.\"Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England, said it was \"not a cause for alarm,\" adding that there was \"no evidence that pets can transmit the disease to humans.\"Cats can infect other cats with coronavirus, researchers findThat's a view shared by other animal health experts. \"It has been clear for a while that cats are susceptible to infection, but there is no evidence that they can go on to infect humans,\" said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at the University of Cambridge, adding that only a handful of pets \"have been found to be infected around the world.\"\"The data overall continue to suggest that cats may become infected by their owners if their owners have Covid-19, but there is no suggestion that they may transmit it to owners. This reflects the advice that if possible, when infected, owners should keep their cats inside,\" he said.

According to PGA statistics, the 26-year-old American golfer is hitting the ball two yards further than second-ranked Cameron Champ and 12 yards further than Sam Burns, who is ranked 10th.For his win at the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit, DeChambeau averaged 350.6 yards per drive.

The further you hit it, the more the tangent goes more crooked, more along this line.\"Charley Hoffman recently told GOLF's Subpar podcast that DeChambeau's development shows that \"the best athletes in the world are starting to play golf now. That's why it's going further.\"Meanwhile fellow Tour pro Tony Finau says he was \"inspired\" by DeChambeau and that it had \"got [him] thinking.\"DeChambeau himself had this to say about his swing and how straight he hits the ball: \"I've found some methods in the golf swing that allowed me to hit it a little bit straighter than I thought I was going to be able to. Consequently, I just feel like the harder I swing, sometimes the straighter it goes, and that's been a tremendous benefit.\"Whenever I get a little uncomfortable I just swing it harder, and luckily the way my golf swing is, the forces lined up a lot better for me. But no, I didn't think it was going to come this quick.\" Photos: Golf in 2020: What's happenedThe seven-year-wait: Michael Thompson poses with the trophy after winning the 3M Open on July 26, 2020 at TPC Twin Cities in Blaine, Minnesota.

I don't know what the answer is. As long as you hit it a long way, you should get the benefit of it if you hit it straight. If you hit it a long way and it goes off-line and you don't get penalized, that's when golf has got a problem.\"Others are not so happy with how DeChambeau and massive drives are potentially changing golf.After the Charles Schwab Challenge in early June, former Tour pro Colin Montgomerie told the BBC that the \"time has come\" for officials to introduce a \"tournament ball for professionals\" to curb DeChambeau and others from long hitting off the tee.\"Bryson had 10 holes on which he was within 100 yards of the green for his approach. And if you include the four par threes that means there were only four holes on which Bryson was more than 100 yards away for his approach.\"The game has changed dramatically. It's now brute force and a sand wedge.\"Colin Montgomerie says changes need to be made to reduce the drive distance that players like DeChambeau are able to achieve.The USGA and R&A released a report in February that said the increased distances players were hitting was \"detrimental to the game's long-term future.\"Montgomerie said he also backed Jack Nicklaus' idea for a tournament ball that goes only \"80-85% as far.\"People may not like it, but DeChambeau isn't breaking any rules, and it certainly is not the first time a sportsperson has done something others don't agree with in order to gain an advantage. That is simply the nature of competitive sport. DeChambeau said he feels, \"the harder I swing, sometimes the straighter it goes.\"Not bulletproof yetFebruary's report also said that \"increased hitting distance can begin to undermine the core principle that the challenge of golf is about needing to demonstrate a broad range of skills to be successful.\"But DeChambeau has also shown that the long-hitting approach is not foolproof.Two weeks after that win in Detroit, the 26-year-old missed the cut at the Memorial Tournament after recording a 10-stroke quintuple bogey on his second round.The incident also raised questions about DeChambeau's temperament.An errant drive forced a drop. The California native then opted for a 3-wood from the rough and skewed the shot to the right out of bounds. The next stroke produced a similar result, but even further to the right.@NoLayingUp Bryson says \"they're giving me a garbage ruling like usual\" and then something about \"can't let everything get f$&!'d?? pic.twitter.com/0s1bKGK3U0\u2014 Ryan Miles \ud83e\udde2 (@rymiles12) July 17, 2020 The ball was found to be resting against a metal boundary fence and before he could take his eighth stroke, the ball was, according to two officials, also ruled to be out of bounds.

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, has said in a video posted to his official Twitter account that he was \"way overweight\" when he was admitted to intensive care earlier this year after becoming infected with Covid-19. \"I've always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages,\" he said in the clip posted Monday. \"I think many people, I struggle with my weight.\"Johnson says in the video that since recovering from the virus, he starts each day by going for a run with his dog, Dilyn, and talks effusively about the personal benefits of losing weight as well as the societal benefits of protecting the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The video was posted on Johnson's Twitter account Monday.The video has been released alongside the launch of the UK government's strategy to lower obesity rates in the country. According to government figures, 63% of adults are above what would be considered a healthy weight, with around half of those people being obese. Equally alarming is the fact that one in five children aged 10-11 are living with obesity, with children living in deprived areas twice as likely to be obese. Read MoreThe government policy paper, released Monday, makes a point of linking the risk of being overweight during the current pandemic. \"In the last few months we have seen that being overweight or living with obesity puts you at risk of dying from Covid-19,\" singling out the impact that \"excess fat tissue has on vital organs like the heart, lungs and liver.\"The government hopes this campaign will encourage those currently overweight to lose 2.5kg, claiming it \"could save the NHS \u00a3105 million [$135m] over the next 5 years.\" The campaign comprises wide-ranging measures, from making restaurants put calorie numbers on menus to banning the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food on television and in shops. Johnson claims that these measures will help people across the country lose weight, \"not in an excessively bossy or nannying way, I hope.\" However, Johnson himself has in the past opposed attempts by previous governments to take similar action. In 2007, Johnson wrote in a newspaper column that the incumbent Labour government's proposal to put calories on bottles of wine was \"loony\" and that the \"nannying and bullying\" plan could lead to a legal challenge. In 2004, when the same Labour government was planning a smoking ban, Johnson wrote: \"It's the dogooders I can't stand, and this Labour Government is riddled with people who long to stop other people doing things of which they disapprove.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Kellie Meir has waited two years to see the man accused of causing her son's death face trial.Danny Meir, the oldest of her six children, was 22 when he was killed in a collision between his motorbike and a car in Stockton-on-Tees, a market town in northeast England, in July 2018.The driver of the car, a man in his early 60s, denies causing Meir's death by careless or inconsiderate driving. He was originally due to stand trial last month, but the case has been delayed until March next year, because of the coronavirus pandemic.Danny Meir died in a road accident in Stockton-on-Tees, England, in July 2018.The UK locked down on March 23 in an attempt to slow the spread of Covid-19, and while most courts in England and Wales have since reopened, many trials are now subject to lengthy delays, leaving victims and their families in limbo and many defendants -- who remain innocent until proven guilty -- in custody.Kellie Meir said she first heard of the change to her son's case in June, when friends shared local news articles about the decision on social media.Read More\"That's the worst thing -- we had to read it on Facebook,\" she told CNN. \"Nobody told us. We didn't have a letter. [I] just opened up Facebook and saw his picture all over the place.\"Meir said her son was a great motorcycle enthusiast. \"I know he was [on his motorbike] when he died, but he loved that thing, from such a young age.\" Danny's sudden death left his mother, four younger brothers, younger sister, long-term girlfriend and grandparents devastated. \"My mum took it particularly hard [because] they were very close,\" Meir added. \"It's been two years now, and it'll be three by [the time of the trial.] We can't move on with our lives, we haven't got closure,\" she said.'Backlog on backlog'Trial by jury is a cornerstone of democratic legal systems around the world, especially those based on English common law -- also known as Anglo-American law. But seating 12 strangers side-by-side in a courtroom for days or even weeks is impractical in these socially-distanced times. Most criminal cases in England and Wales begin in magistrates' courts, which handle less serious offenses. Following the coronavirus lockdown, the backlog in these courts stands at a record high of 483,678 cases -- up from 406,610 cases earlier this year, according to the British government.Meanwhile the Crown courts, where more serious cases are heard, face a backlog of 40,526 outstanding cases as of the week ending May 24, according to preliminary data from the British government. That's up from a pre-coronavirus caseload of 39,214, though not as high as a peak of 55,000 cases recorded in 2014.     Lawyers working in the court system in England and Wales criticized the mounting caseload -- which they say is the result of years of underinvestment, cuts and court closures -- long before the pandemic. Coronavirus has only exacerbated the situation. For victims and their families, the additional delays caused by Covid-19 have made an already stressful situation unbearable.\"It's not just the delay, it's everything around it,\" said Alex Mayes, external affairs manager at rights group Victim Support. \"Before, victims were feeling anxious. Now they have added anxiety around coronavirus itself.\"Penelope Gibbs, an ex-magistrate and the founder of NGO Transform Justice, agrees. \"It's going to be backlog on backlog, and the problem is in human terms,\" Gibbs, an advocate for the rights of defendants being held in custody, told CNN.\"The concern is that those on remand are innocent until and if they are proven guilty,\" she said. \"They may well be acquitted and they are losing their liberty when they may well be innocent. For that to go on for months threatens human rights.\"\"What I fear is that people on remand may change their plea ... from not guilty to guilty. In some cases they may then be released from prison,\" she added.And experts say some cases which have been postponed may end up never going to trial because of the lengthy delays.\"The quality of evidence declines over time,\" veteran British barrister Michael Wolkind told CNN. \"There will be certain cases where the victim won't be able to bear the further wait and withdraws. And [there will be] smaller cases where the prosecuting authorities will drop [charges].\"The socially distanced courtThere are 77 crown court centers in England and Wales that can host a trial by jury. Fifty-four have reopened since the UK's lockdown was eased, according to the Ministry of Justice, but distancing measures mean many of the courts that are open still have limited capacity for trials. In some courts, rooms required for the trial are rendered useless because of their size.CNN spoke to lawyers involved in trials who were concerned about the court estate in England and Wales, and its suitability for social distancing.16 years old and stuck in solitary confinement 23 hours a day because of coronavirusMichael Auty is a barrister and Queen's Counsel -- a title awarded by the British monarch to particularly respected advocates. Auty has seen many trials delayed because of the pandemic, including that of his client Magdalena Kissova.Kissova, 47, is charged with murdering a 67-year-old man in Derby, in England's Midlands, in February. She denies the charge. Kissova has been held in custody since her arrest -- her trial was due to begin later this month, but delays caused by the pandemic mean it has been pushed back until October.\"We didn't know if Derby Crown Court was going to be suitable for dealing with jury trials or not,\" Auty told CNN. \"We couldn't carry out the changes [needed] to spread the jury out physically. And there are a host of other things -- the jury have to walk through lots of narrow passages, and their retiring room can't accommodate social distancing. It was not built for a world where that was necessary.\"\"You couldn't begin to contemplate socially distanced trials,\" in Derby's modern court building, Auty said. \"We could possibly accommodate social distancing in the courtroom itself, beyond that it would be impossible.\"The United Kingdom's four countries take a divided approach to coronavirus crisisThe realities of a return to a full trial schedule are a worry for many lawyers.  \"I think it's quite scary,\" Danielle Manson, a junior barrister based in London, told CNN. \"I don't feel confident or comfortable about going back to work. The courts estate is crumbling -- and that was before Covid-19.\"The UK's opposition Labour Party believes a long-term lack of investment in the legal system has worsened the current crisis in the courts.\"The justice system has been brought to its knees by a decade of austerity that cut funding to the Ministry of Justice by a quarter in real terms,\" David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, told CNN in a statement.\"The result of these cuts is victims of violent crimes who are unable to see their attackers in court, wrongly accused defendants detained indefinitely while waiting for a trial, and a public unable to see justice served in a timely manner.\"Lammy says Labour wants the government \"to requisition empty public buildings to be used as temporary courts to beat the backlog,\" and \"to provide the funding necessary to keep the justice system functioning in this crisis and make sure it is never left so vulnerable again.\"Temporary 'Nightingale' courtsAs pressure mounts, the UK's Ministry of Justice is setting up new \"Nightingale Courts\" to help ease the backlog. On a similar model to the temporary \"Nightingale Hospitals\" set up around the country at the peak of Britain's coronavirus caseload, these emergency courts will be housed in facilities usually used for other purposes, such as civic centers or university buildings.The Lord Chancellor, Robert Buckland, announced on July 19 that he had identified 10 sites for such courts, and that the government would increase its investment in the legal system. The first court opened on July 20, and officials hope all 10 sites will be open by August.Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?\"[The Nightingale courts] idea is wise,\" Auty told CNN. \"Places like university lecture theaters could be turned into a makeshift courtroom -- they're big enough. But there's no silver bullet,\" he said, pointing out the enormous logistical challenge involved in converting regular buildings into temporary courts.\"You have to move people who are in remand into court, so [...] you need a secure building,\" he said. \"You can't take [defendants] past the jury. And how do you manage witnesses? Where do they wait? How do you keep them apart from defendants' families?\"\"With a drugs trial you may have 20 or more defendants. With sex [assault] trials you absolutely cannot have a woman walking past a man who is accused of raping her. You have to keep all sorts of people separate, and [need to] have a mechanism to do so,\" he added. The virtual courtroomThe administrative tangle caused by Covid-19 has left British officials racing to find alternative solutions. In March, British lawmakers passed the Coronavirus Act, granting the government emergency powers as the pandemic hit. Among other things, the legislation allows more video and audio link technology to be used in courts.Since then, new technology has been installed in many Crown Courts across England and Wales, enabling some criminal hearings to be held via video link. Hearings are separate proceedings to jury trials but are often used for sentencing those already convicted.Last month, Buckland told a parliamentary select committee that another option would be to have certain cases heard by a judge and two magistrates, rather than a 12-person jury. For this to go ahead, it would require lawmakers to pass new legislation.\"We are working closely with the judiciary on a range of measures to keep the justice system running, such as additional venues to allow better social distancing,\" a Ministry of Justice spokesperson told CNN. \"This does not include judge-only trials in the Crown Court.\"British politicians are concerned a 'virtual parliament' cannot hold Boris Johnson's government to account over coronavirusFor victims' rights advocates such as Alex Mayes, the use of video technology in courts is vitally important.\"Business as usual just isn't an option,\" he said. \"There needs to be change -- it could be something like pre-recorded video cross-examination of victims. It's about utilizing technology.\"But some lawyers balk at the thought of virtual courtrooms encroaching further on physical ones.\"I don't think we can be parachuted into a digital system when people's life and liberty are at stake and we're asking members of the public to make enormous decisions,\" said junior barrister Danielle Manson. \"I think the use of video links is something we should be anxious about, because everything ... is about people and human reaction. It's about how witnesses react and how jurors react,\" she said. \"There's something about being in the same room as someone and feeling an atmosphere. Jury trials are incredibly theatrical.\"\"The big issue is access to technology,\" said Kevin Crosby, a senior lecturer in law at Newcastle University and a specialist on juries. \"Juries are meant to be a wide cross section of people. If you add in older jurors, there are bound to be people who don't have the technology [needed] at home.\"Trials delayed around the worldThe crisis in England and Wales is replicated in legal systems around the world that use jury trials. The coronavirus pandemic has forced delays to trials in New Zealand, the US, Canada, Australia and Ireland.\"I haven't heard of any system that has [coped]. It's inherently difficult to hold a trial in this situation,\" Crosby told CNN.Providing justice in the time of coronavirus may lie in some combination of technology, larger courtrooms and longer hours. But as with many public institutions, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing flaws of the English legal system. In hardest-hit states, coronavirus is grinding justice to a haltAnd the longer officials take to work out the logistics of holding trials, the longer families are having to wait for their day in court.Kellie Meir told CNN the lockdown has made her grief over Danny's death worse. \"I couldn't wait to go back to work,\" she said. \"I didn't go out during the full lockdown and [he] was on my mind.\" As lockdown conditions are lifted, Meir wants to know why she is still waiting for the trial to begin.\"You need a jury there -- why can't they just spread them out?\" Meir asked. \"Why can't [jurors] wear masks? I thought masks protected you? I don't know about the virus ... I don't really understand it all.\"\"It's really hard,\" she said. \"I have got other kids, I have my mum [and] you have [to] get on with it. But my heart's broken. He was 22, you know? He was too young. How can we move on?\"",

Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Sampdoria. But Ronaldo eased any pressure on Juventus when he swiped a low shot past past Emil Audero having been teed up my Miralem Pjanic to break the deadlock against Sampdoria. He also created his team's second when Audero could only push his shot into the path of Bernardeschi, who netted his first Serie A goal since September 2018. Ronaldo could have extended his tally for the season late on when he thundered a penalty into the crossbar, but he remains on 31 -- three shy of Lazio's Ciro Immobile who is chasing Gonzalo Higuan's record of 36 goals in a season.

        "content": "(CNN)Poland's decision to leave a European treaty aimed at combating violence against women has sparked criticism the day before the country said it would begin the withdrawal process.  Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro announced Saturday that Poland will take the first step needed to withdraw from the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention on Monday, according to the state-run Polish Press Agency.  The Istanbul Convention, which is the first legally binding treaty of its kind in the world, aims to protect women against violence and to help bring about the end of discrimination against them.Guy Verhofstadt, the former Prime Minister of Belgium, described Poland's decision as \"scandalous\" in a tweet on Sunday. \"Violence is not a traditional value. EU and all of its members signed, because Europe stands for human rights, equality and decency,\" he added. Read MoreThe Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pej\u010dinovi\u0107 Buri\u0107 also disapproved of the country's plan to leave the treaty, calling the development \"alarming.\" Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland's Minister of Justice, shown at a meeting in \nWarsaw, Poland, on January 28, 2020. After saying that the Council was happy to engage in \"constructive dialogue\" with Poland around \"any misconceptions or misunderstandings\" that may have arisen, she added: \"Leaving the Istanbul Convention would be highly regrettable and a major step backwards in the protection of women against violence in Europe.\" Speaking at a press conference, Ziobro took aim at what he called the \"ideological nature\" of parts of the convention, which he accused of \"constructing the so-called socio-cultural gender in opposition to biological sex.\"Thousands of people gathered in Warsaw and other cities on Friday to protest against the government's plan to exit the treaty, according to Reuters. Magdalena Lempart, who helped to organize the Warsaw protest, told the news agency that the aim of the move was \"to legalize domestic violence.\" Poland debates abortion bill amid coronavirus lockdownThe announcement from the Justice Minister regarding the withdrawal from the treaty came after Andrezj Duda was re-elected as the country's President earlier this month, narrowly beating the challenge of Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw. As part of his campaign, Duda, who is supported by the nationalist ruling Law and Justice (PiS) and is an ally of US President Donald Trump, spoke out against LGBTQ rights, claiming they were an \"ideology\" worse than Soviet-era communism.

In marathon running -- a different beast compared to competing on the track -- she has a relatively new event to train for, and away from the roads and trails her filmmaking career is also taking a step into the unknown with a \"top secret\" TV project in the works.\"Trying something in a television world is almost like moving from the track to the marathon -- it's like the same sport but a different event,\" Pappas tells CNN Sport.\"It's like we're learning new rules and that's what's fun about the running and the creative worlds -- you can try new mediums and new events ... similar muscles but different.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MorePappas' wide-sweeping interests have seen her become something of a cult figure in running circles and beyond having been identified by Runner's World as an influential personality among a \"new boom\" of athletes helping to make running \"bigger and better.\"Alexi Pappas competes in the 10,000m at the 2016 Rio Olympics. She has gradually developed into a role model for young athletes. On her social media pages -- where photos are captioned with pithy poems and quirky observations -- Pappas gives guidance to followers who come to her for advice on running, injuries, diet or body image.          View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Alexi Pappas (@alexipappas) on Jul 14, 2020 at 9:45am PDT Her desire and willingness to be a role model can be partly explained by her mother's suicide when she was four years old.\"That impacted me in two major ways,\" says Pappas. \"The first was that I felt I didn't matter enough for her to stay and the second was that I suddenly had this huge vacuum in the female role model department and I needed to fill the gap of: what am I becoming and what can I look up to? \"I latched onto athletes, I latched onto anything to imitate and I really absorbed and ran with anything I saw that I liked, or what I didn't like I would steer away from.\"When somebody is looking up to me now, I'm very aware of just how much that can matter and just how much people need those mentors sometimes.\"READ: 'Uncertainties' surround next year's Olympics, says Tokyo governorPappas is finalizing her memoir in essays, \"Bravey,\" which is to be released in January next year and grapples with her experience of mentorship.

Alongside her partner Jeremy Teicher, she co-wrote and co-directed \"Tracktown\" in 2017, an indie sports drama depicting a talented runner, played by Pappas, who prepares for Olympics trials.That premiered the year after Pappas had competed at the Olympics herself, setting a Greek national record of 31:36 in the 10,000m in Rio in 2016. Alexi Pappas and partner Jeremy Teicher attend the IFC Films Spirit Awards Party in Santa Monica, California, earlier this year.Last year saw the release of \"Olympic Dreams,\" Pappas and Teicher's second film set during the 2018 Winter Olympics -- the first fictional movie ever shot in an Olympic village. It also stars Pappas, as well as American actor, writer and comedian Nick Kroll and freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy.Having turned down Masters offers for English and creative writing programs at some of the top schools in the US to pursue a running career, Pappas has made a conscious decision to embrace her double life. \"When people give the advice of 'do one thing right now,' what they're really saying is give a 100% to this goal that's perfectly worthy and I buy into that, I think that's true,\" she says.\"But your 100% might look different to mine and I think for me, my 100% is feeling like the complete person is happening. \"Honestly, I think it's helped me to have these other pursuits because it makes running this precious time in the day that I really value ...

Having competed on the track for most of her career, she says switching to marathon running -- an event inspired by Pheidippides, who is credited with running 26.2 miles to deliver news of the ancient Greeks' victory over the Persians -- was always in her blood. \"To join that tradition felt like a rite of passage and something that I was genuinely curious about,\" says Pappas.\"Being Greek, it's also one of those traditions that's deeply rooted in my background and I think everyone runs a marathon out of curiosity for what their mind or bodies might be able to do. \"It feels like a different sport to track running, it feels like a completely different system, a different mentality.\"Pappas competes at the Rio Olympics in 2016.Having run a personal best of 2:34.26 in Houston, Texas, earlier this year, Pappas is now faced with a raceless schedule and no definitive goals to train towards.\"In distance running in particular, fitness is like a pencil,\" says Pappas. \"You sharpen yourself to a point for the race, called peaking, and it's something you time very carefully with the coach. \"If you stay sharp for too long, you'll break -- if you think about the tip of a pencil. With these races around the world still an uncertainty, my goal now is to stay fit and healthy without over-sharpening myself now before I know exactly when I'll be able to race.\"She adds, too, that creative pursuits have always \"sheltered me a little bit from overtraining.\"The first barrier for Pappas is to break the Greek national record for the marathon -- a time she was 46 seconds shy of in Houston -- and then achieve the qualification time for Tokyo, which has recently dropped to 2:29.30 ahead of next year's event.JUST WATCHEDWith one year to go until Tokyo 2020, doubts still lingerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWith one year to go until Tokyo 2020, doubts still linger 02:04\"For marathoners I think this Olympic shift has been particularly impactful because there's only so many marathons you can run in a year and so the whole fall has been taken off the table for good reason,\" says Pappas.\"Training safely, doing my gym workout at home, only running with my quarantine pod -- there's only certain runners that I'm running with right now -- that's been the mentality during coronavirus.\"With racing on pause, Pappas can enjoy the benefits of having what she calls a \"spectrum of life going on.\" It could even be a taste of what lies ahead when she eventually chooses to hang up her running shoes. \"The cliff at the end of athletics can feel really daunting,\" says Pappas.\"That cliff doesn't feel like it will be a cliff for me -- I'm not so afraid of it because I know there's this career I'm growing at the same time.\"",

        "content": "Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)Istanbul's historic Hagia Sophia has reopened for Friday prayers for the first time since a decision was made to turn it back into a mosque after more than 80 years as a museum.Images on Turkish state television showed crowds of Muslims praying in and around the mosque on Friday morning.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan participated in the Friday prayers, where he recited verses of the Quran. Some people came from outside Istanbul and spent the night around Hagia Sophia waiting for the prayer, according to CNN Turk.Only 500 people were invited inside the building because of coronavirus restrictions, according to Turkey's religious affairs director Ali Erbas. Thousands more prayed in the garden and in Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul's old city. Read MoreWorshipers join a prayer program at Hagia Sophia ahead of the first Friday prayers there in 86 years.Erdogan later visited the Fatih Mosque, where he visited the tomb of Fatih Sultan Mehmet, or Mehmed the Conqueror, who conquered what was then Constantinople in 1453. The city was renamed Istanbul. The Hagia Sophia was one of the Roman Empire's first Christian cathedrals, after St. John Lateran in Rome,  and is among the best-known Byzantine structures in the world. It switched from a Greek Orthodox cathedral to a mosque after the Ottoman conquest  in 1453.The historic site then became a museum in 1935 as part of a decree by modern Turkey's secularist founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.Speaking at Fatih Mosque, Erdogan said Hagia Sophia had returned to its \"original\" use. \"Hopefully it will serve as a mosque until eternity. It is the cultural heritage of all humanity that everybody can come and visit,\" he said.Erdogan ordered the conversion of the historic monument on July 10 after a court annulled a 1934 presidential decree that made it a museum.The decision, involving one of the city's most important landmarks and a UNESCO World Heritage site, has been criticized by international religious and political leaders, with UN cultural agency UNESCO among those voicing concern.However, the move has not prompted wide opposition within Turkey.The Turkish government has tried to reassure skeptics that the building's Christian artworks and frescoes will not be touched, with technology instead being used to conceal them during Friday prayers.Men take part in Friday prayers outside Hagia Sophia in Istanbul on July 24, 2020.Erdogan has positioned himself as a friend of conservative Islamists in Turkey, moving the country further from its secularist roots.UNESCO said earlier this month that it deeply regretted Turkey's decision and that the choice was made without the organization receiving prior notification.Pope Francis said he was \"very saddened\" by the building's conversion. Greece's culture minister, meanwhile, decried the move as \"an open provocation to the entire civilized world.\"Workmen dismantle the Hagia Sophia Museum ticket booth on July 17, 2020 in Istanbul.Turkish officials have emphasized that when it is not being used as a mosque, the Hagia Sophia -- which is popular with tourists visiting Istanbul -- will be open to all to visit free of charge, according to state-run news agency Anadolu.Erdogan used a televised speech on July 10 to urge people to respect the decision to convert the building back to a mosque.\"Like all our mosques, its doors will be open to everyone -- Muslim or non-Muslim. As the world's common heritage, Hagia Sophia with its new status will keep on embracing everyone in a more sincere way,\" he said.\"We will be treating every opinion voiced on the international stage with respect. But the way Hagia Sophia will be used falls under Turkey's sovereign rights. We deem every move that goes beyond voicing an opinion a violation of our sovereignty.\"An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the Roman Empire's first cathedral. It was St. John Lateran in Rome.CNN's Isil Sariyuce and Arwa Damon reported from Istanbul and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. Emma Reynolds contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN)When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson landed on Thursday in Orkney, an archipelago off Scotland's northern coast, he boldly proclaimed that the trip proved his commitment to a united nation.\"The Union is a fantastically strong institution -- it's helped our country through thick and thin,\" he said. \"I think what people really want to do is see our whole country coming back strongly together, and that's what we're going to do.\"Together, perhaps, but not with Scotland's leader. For his first trip to Scotland this year, Johnson chose a sparsely populated group of islands hundreds of miles from the seat of Scottish political power in Edinburgh; he did not meet with Scotland's top elected official, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.That may be for good reason. Though Scotland has suffered badly from Covid-19, Sturgeon's popularity has surged, largely as she has steered a more cautious approach out of the pandemic than her English counterparts. Support for Sturgeon's ultimate political goal, Scottish independence from England, is also on the up.Johnson's personal ratings, meanwhile, have taken a hit, as the messaging around reopening south of the Scottish border has been more haphazard. His visit to Scotland was an attempt to regain some political capital north of Hadrian's Wall.Read MoreBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a crab at Stromness Harbour, Orkney. Divergent approach One of the many lessons from the pandemic in the UK has been the starkly different governing styles of the country's political leaders.Johnson, despite being educated at England's most elite establishments, has made a career of playing the klutzy everyman. It's a routine that works great for photo ops -- the infamous zipline mishap during the 2012 Olympics, as London mayor, was a highlight -- but perhaps not so well for global pandemics.Masks rule goes into effect in England as Boris Johnson calls anti-vaxxers 'nuts'Long before Johnson himself contracted Covid-19, he told a group of journalists with a mischievous smile that he had recently visited a hospital and \"I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know.\"Johnson faced particular ridicule for confusing advice about reopening. He told Brits on May 10 that if they could not work from home, they should now be \"actively encouraged to go to work\" but that they should also \"stay alert.\"Sturgeon was not impressed. \"I don't know what 'stay alert' means,\" Sturgeon said at the time, adding that she had asked the British government not to deploy that slogan in Scotland.When Johnson's government introduced new rules that allowed residents to visit certain countries without quarantining on return, Sturgeon called the decision-making process \"shambolic.\" Unlike Downing Street, she refused to allow unrestricted travel from Spain.Nicola Sturgeon's tartan face mask has become a sartorial statement.Another area of divergence has been over the issue of face coverings --  Sturgeon made them mandatory in shops here a full two weeks before Downing Street followed suit with a similar ordinance for England. Sturgeon's tartan face mask has become a sartorial signature.Johnson has not resisted masks with the zeal of US President Donald Trump, but he is more often seen without a face covering, even indoors, than with one. His visit to Orkney drew a small protest; one man heckled, \"Where's your mask, Boris?\" Perception of power To an outsider (and in fact to many Brits), the division of power in the UK can be confusing. Boris Johnson is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but since the late 1990s, much power has been transferred to the UK's constituent nations -- a process known as devolution.This means many policy decisions concerning health, education, and transportation for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are taken not in London, but in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. It has not been unusual to see a grand policy announcement emanating from Downing Street, only to find a postscript explaining that the rule only applies to England.\"This is really the most significant time where devolution has been the most obvious to the ordinary citizens,\" the pro-independence pollster Mark Diffley said on a typically rainy summer day in Edinburgh.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gives a coronavirus briefing n Edinburgh.That perception is evident on the streets of Scotland's capital. \"London is too choppy, too changing its mind all the time, can't make out what it wants to do,\" said Karen Miele, 58, from Edinburgh. \"Does it want to help people? Does it want to put the economy first? Or does it just not care? Doesn't know what it's doing.\"Andrew MacDonald, 21 from Linlithgow, said that his view of Sturgeon has \"definitely gone up\" over the course of the pandemic. \"I think Nicola has done the right thing in trying to keep the politics out of it, and go with the science first and foremost throughout the whole thing,\" he said.Despite this perceived divergence in approach, Covid-19 outcomes -- so far, at least -- have not been so dissimilar. In fact, the death rate in Scotland has only been slightly better than in England. For every 100,000 people, 77 in Scotland have died and had Covid-19 listed on their death certificate, versus 86 in England.\"There are important differences in the approach, and also important differences in the public perception of the approach,\" said Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh.

The last time Scots formally voted on independence, in 2014, \"no\" won out by more than 10 percentage points. Much has since changed. In the 2015 UK general election, the SNP went from six seats at the House of Commons in Westminster to 56 -- taking all but three Scottish constituencies. Scots voted heavily against Brexit in 2016.The renowned pollster John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, told the BBC on Thursday that support for independence has been surging for about and a year, and is now going up even among those Scots who voted for Brexit.JUST WATCHEDA timeline of the UK's coronavirus responseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA timeline of the UK's coronavirus response 03:14The latest polling, Diffley said, \"would suggest that support for independence is higher than it has been for actually a really, really long time.\"That's a problem for Johnson, leader of a party whose full name is the Conservative and Unionist Party. By visiting Scotland, Johnson hoped to underline the benefits to Scots of the 300-year-old union with England -- he was keen to point out that it was the Treasury in London that saved thousands of Scottish jobs with its generous furlough scheme, for example.But Conservative prime ministers have historically enjoyed little support in Scotland, and Sturgeon joked on Twitter that Johnson's visit didn't do her any harm.The SNP had promised a new referendum on independence before next year's Scottish parliamentary elections. That's now been put on hold, because of the pandemic.Tommy Sheppard, an SNP MP for Edinburgh East, thinks independence is a \"matter of time.\"For SNP members of parliament like Tommy Sheppard, who represents Edinburgh East, it is only a matter of time. \"Those who wish to see Scotland become an independent country welcome as many trips as possible by Boris Johnson to Scotland, because every time he sets foot in Scotland, support for independence increases,\" he said.The pandemic response, he believes, has opened many skeptical Scottish eyes to the real differences between Scotland and England.\"They're aware of that in the way they never were before. And they are perhaps open to the possibility of what an independent Scotland could do if it had the political power to act.\"This story has been updated to correct the death rate in England.Nic Robertson and Adrian Divirglio contributed reporting",

These news reports claimed King Felipe might inherit large sums from two offshore foundations allegedly linked to his father.Analysts told CNN there's now unprecedented pressure on Spain's monarchy, which King Felipe vowed to make more transparent when he took over six years ago. Felipe and Juan Carlos attend a ceremony at Zarzuela Palace prior to Felipe's official coronation ceremony on June 19, 2014. Juan Carlos abdicated on June 2 after a 39-year reign.\"The monarchy is being questioned. It's not the former king. That's the deeper problem,\" Javier Perez Royo, an emeritus professor of constitutional law at the University of Seville, told CNN.Royo said he expects further efforts \"to put a firewall between King Felipe VI and his father.\"Juan Carlos abdicated under a cloud of financial scandal and his much-criticized elephant-hunting trip to Botswana during Spain's financial crisis in 2012. But his abdication didn't stop investigations.Swiss prosecutors are examining documents that allege Juan Carlos may have received $100 million from Saudi Arabia's king in 2008, a senior Spanish official with knowledge of the proceedings told CNN. Belgian prince with coronavirus apologizes for breaking quarantine and attending party The prosecutors are focusing on people purportedly linked to Juan Carlos who may have acted as proxies for bank accounts, the Spanish official said.The official said the hypothesis is that the money may have been related to a contract for a Spanish consortium's construction of a high-speed train between Medina and Mecca in Saudi Arabia.In 2012, according to allegations in the documents in Switzerland, King Juan Carlos gave \u20ac65 million to his then companion, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the Spanish official said.Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein has testified twice before Swiss prosecutors and \"no formal charges have been brought against her,\" her lawyer, Robin Rathmell told CNN.\"She's been the victim of a campaign of harassment headed by the King Emeritus [Juan Carlos] for eight years,\" Rathmell said, adding it has hurt her reputation and business.

Juan Carlos had constitutional immunity from prosecution while king. The former king's lawyer, Javier Sanchez-Junco, told CNN, \"There are no formal charges against King Juan Carlos in Spanish or in foreign courts at this time.\" He declined further comment.CNN contacted the embassies of Saudi Arabia in London and Madrid regarding the alleged 2008 transfer from the Saudi king to Juan Carlos, but received no immediate reply.Juan Carlos, who is now 82, is widely credited with helping to guide Spain to democracy after the long dictatorship of Francisco Franco. But in recent years, his image has suffered. Last year, on the fifth anniversary of his abdication, he announced he was stepping down from public life.Spanish media have reported that King Felipe may be planning to put further distance between himself and his father -- by asking him to leave his residence at the Zarzuela Palace grounds west of Madrid.The facade of Zarzuela Palace, seen in February 2019.Reuters quoted an unnamed government source who said the matter of distance must be decided by the royal household, adding that Juan Carlos leaving Zarzuela Palace \"may be an option.\"\"The King [Felipe], if he has to make another decision, he will,\" a palace spokesman told CNN. \"The rest is speculation.\"There's also been talk of a constitutional reform to strip immunity from the king. Yet that's unlikely, three analysts told CNN, because Spain's political parties are deeply divided.King Felipe, 52, appears to be working hard to carve out his own image among Spaniards.

The child leaps forward and is again caught by the crowd.Locals were praised by Grenoble's mayor, who called the rescue \"heroic.\"Read MoreOne of those who helped the children to safety was Athoumani Walid, who told BFM TV that he heard screams from outside his window when he saw the two children trapped.The actions of those who helped rescue the children have been called \"heroic.\"\"The eldest one took a lot of courage and a lot of confidence. He put his little brother first. We took him in and we said to the other one, 'Come on, jump, it's your turn, jump,'\" Walid said.\"Then he climbed up through the window, he let go, and then we got him again. None of them fell on the floor. No one's hurt.\"Walid added: \"We saved their lives but they made the right decision to go for it. We had no choice, we had no way to go to them. They were the ones who came to us. They were the brave ones, they were the heroes.\"Grenoble Mayor \u00c9ric Piolle wrote on Facebook: \"I would like to congratulate the inhabitants of Villeneuve who made a heroic rescue of two children trapped in their burning apartment today.\"Piolle added: \"Hand in hand, they allowed the two little ones to get out unharmed from this drama.\"Father of child in 'Spider-Man' rescue was playing Pokemon GoAn inquiry into potential negligence has been launched against the boys' parents by authorities in the region, BFM reported.The children were alone in the apartment because their mother had gone grocery shopping and their father had left for work, state prosecutor \u00c9ric Vaillant said, according to BFM.\"The mother had been absent from around 11 a.m. (5 a.m ET) when she went grocery shopping and the dad had left for work around 11.30. At first glance, the mum should have returned before the departure of the husband but was a bit late. The children were not allowed to be left alone,\" added Vaillant.Samples were taken by investigators to determine the origins of the fire, which took place in the living room, BFM reported. A total of 14 people were intoxicated by smoke fumes and two firefighters were mildly injured.The scene bore a resemblance to the 2018 rescue of a child by the so-called \"Spiderman\" Mamoudou Gassama, a young Malian migrant who scaled several floors of an apartment complex to rescue a child dangling from a balcony.Gassama was made a French citizen and offered a job in the fire department after footage of his remarkable rescue went viral.CNN's Pierre-Eliott Buet, Pierre Bairin and Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)This was supposed to be a week of celebration in Tokyo. Japan would be opening its doors to the world and launching the 32nd Olympiad in the capital.Instead, the postponement of the Games amid the Covid-19 pandemic means the wait goes on before new Olympic heroes emerge, unfamiliar sports captivate and legendary Olympic moments are made. There is much to look forward to if and when the Games do begin on July 23, 2021, but it makes us long for what we missed this summer even more. Biles cementing her legendFour years ago in Rio, American artistic gymnast Simone Biles won four gold medals and a bronze, becoming one of the stars of the Games. Read MoreThis was the summer when Biles was to cement her status as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, gymnast of all-time -- as some have called her already.Her dominance in the sport is akin to American Olympic sporting greats like Michael Phelps, Allyson Felix and Jenny Thompson.At the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart last year, Biles completed a record-breaking clean sweep of gold medals in all five of her gymnastic disciplines for the first time in her career. She is unbeaten in the all-around since 2013. Her dominance is unparalleled. Biles had always maintained she would retire after this summer's Games and, in April, the 23-year-old was not fully committing to taking part in the delayed Games. She is, however, now back in the gym. A Biles-less Olympics would not quite be the same. JUST WATCHEDPandemic can't stop Simone Biles' stunning aerial displayReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPandemic can't stop Simone Biles' stunning aerial display 00:59Who will be the next Phelps?Mark Spitz's tally of seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics was an achievement few thought would ever be surpassed.That was until Michael Phelps splashed onto the scene. Phelps managed six golds medals and two bronze at Athens in 2004. Spitz could rest easy for a little longer. But four years later, in Beijing, Phelps won a magnificent eight gold medals. Spitz didn't mind being bested, saying: \"It goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest Olympian of all time, he's maybe the greatest athlete of all time.\"Michael Phelps waved goodbye for good after Rio 2016, but who will take over as king of the swimming pool?Over the next two Olympic Games, in London and Rio, Phelps took his Olympic career total to 23 golds, three silvers and two bronze medals.Phelps is now retired, and while it seems unthinkable that anyone will ever top his Olympic medal tally, who will fill his shoes as the figurehead of swimming? The signs point to Caeleb Dressel.At the 2019 World Aquatics Championships, Dressel won six gold medals and two silvers, breaking Phelps' 10-year world record in the final of the 100-meter butterfly by 0.32 seconds.Dressel may not race in the same range of events as Phelps, but he could well be Phelps' successor as American swimming's next great. New and returning sports         View this post on Instagram           \"I consider the ocean seriously like my best friend!\" :woman-surfing:Thanks to everyone who tuned in to watch our live interview with @sally_fitz yesterday! If you missed it, you can still catch the whole interview on our IGTV. . . . #surfing #surf #sallyfitzgibbons #sallyfitz #surfer #surfergirl A post shared by  CNNSport (@cnnsport) on Jul 22, 2020 at 7:31am PDT With every edition of the Olympic Games, new sports are welcomed to the fray. For Tokyo, five sports have been added to the schedule. Karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding will be making their Olympic debuts, while baseball and softball return after a 12-year absence. Much has been made of skateboard's addition, owing to the celebrity of 12-year-old prodigy Sky Brown.But the inclusion of all of these sports is huge to their respective international status.Speaking to CNN's Amanda Davies in an Instagram Live interview, Australian surfing superstar Sally Fitzgibbons said that the sport's inclusion was key to showcasing it to new audiences.\"There'll be some people tuning in ... they would have never considered it; they would have never probably seen the beach or picked up a board and to be able to have that opportunity as a sport to showcase that is fantastic,\" she said. Fitzgibbons added that surfing's addition was a sign of the Games modernizing and showing a willingness to \"move with the times.\"Can Bolt be replaced?Usain Bolt has been, arguably, the face of the Olympics since his showstopping performances in Beijing. So, the big question is: Can anyone replace the record-breaking showman? The two foremost sprinters in the world at the moment are Americans Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles. Coleman is the reigning 100-meter world champion and Lyles the 200m world champion.Who will fill the golden spikes of Usain Bolt?Coleman is currently provisionally suspended for missing a third drug test in a 12-month period. It could lead to a two-year ban, which would rule him out of next year's Games. Anime fan Lyles, on the other hand, could be the man for the job.Lyles' start-line histrionics have led to him being described as a \"rock star\" by USA teammate Justin Gatlin.The 23-year-old recently made headlines for appearing to have run a world-record 18.9-second 200m, only for replays to show he had instead run just 185m.He may well break Bolt's 19.19 second record in Tokyo though.Mo's quest for a three-peatHaving claimed a double-double in the 5,000m and 10,000m in Rio, Mo Farah set his sights on marathon running.However, Farah's announcement last year that he will defend his 10,000m title sets up a thrilling storyline as he attempts to become the first person to achieve the 10,000m Olympic three-peat.Farah has been at the center of controversy in recent years, with his former coach Alberto Salazar, from whom he split in 2017, banned for four years for \"multiple anti-doping rule violations.\"Mo Farah was aiming for a 10,000 meter three-peat at Tokyo 2020 before the postponement of the Games.If the Briton can win a third 10,000m Olympic gold in Tokyo, he will enhance his standing as a great of long-distance running.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)A former Nazi concentration camp guard was convicted of thousands of counts of being an accessory to murder and given a two-year suspended prison sentence Thursday, a court announced.The 93-year-old man, identified as Bruno D., was charged with 5,230 counts of accessory to murder over his time as an SS guard at the Stutthof concentration camp from 1944 to 1945.Questions over testimony of US witness in Nazi guard's trialHe was found guilty by the Hamburg juvenile court of aiding and abetting in the murder of at least 5,232 people. He faced a juvenile court because he was 17 years old at the time he served in Stutthof.  The defendant had previously admitted to being a guard at the camp, but told the court at the beginning of his trial that he had no choice at the time. He grew up in a village by Danzig, which is now the Polish city of Gdansk. More than 40 co-plaintiffs from France, Israel, Poland and the United States testified against the former SS guard during the trial, which began in October.Read MoreConcluding just over 75 years after World War II ended in Europe, it will be one of the last trials of a former Nazi.It is estimated that around 65,000 people were murdered during the Holocaust in the Stutthof concentration camp, near the Polish city now called Gdansk. Landmark trialBruno D. came to the attention of prosecutors during the landmark trial of former Sobibor SS guard John Demjanjuk. He was indicted in April 2019 and lives with his family in Hamburg. According to his 2019 indictment, Bruno D. knowingly supported the \"insidious and cruel killing\" at Stutthof concentration camp.Prisoners in Stutthof were killed by being shot in the back of the neck, poisoned with Zyklon B gas, and denied food and medicine, court documents allege. The verdict has been seen as \"symbolic justice\" for the victims of the camp, Ben Cohen, whose grandmother Judy Meisel was imprisoned in the camp and a co-plaintiff in the trial, told CNN in a statement.   ''On behalf of my grandmother and our family this verdict sends a powerful message that a guard in any camp cannot deny responsibility for what happened,\" Cohen wrote. His grandmother's mother, Mina Beker, was murdered in the camp. Meisel and her sister survived and escaped to Denmark. Stutthof concentration camp housed more than 100,000 prisoners.\"Unfortunately, most perpetrators of the Holocaust were never prosecuted and so we are left with something that feels like symbolic justice today, rather than true justice,\" he said. \"The most important thing to us is that these horrific things should never happen again and that the world can be educated about the capacity for seemingly normal people to be part of the most horrific evil.\"This comes after a 95-year-old man, accused of being a guard at the same camp as Bruno D., was charged July 14 with war crimes during the Holocaust, the Wuppertal, Germany, district court announced last week.German prosecutors are investigating 14 other cases connected to the concentration camps of Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, Mauthausen and Stutthof, according to the Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes.First established by the Nazis in 1939, Stutthof went on to house a total of 115,000 prisoners, more than half of whom died there. Around 22,000 went on to be transferred from Stutthof to other Nazi camps.An estimated 6 million Jewish people were killed in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Also killed were hundreds of thousands of Roma people and people with mental or physical disabilities.",

Merseyside Police say that around 3,000 fans congregated outside Anfield and nine arrests were made for affray, assault, people who were drunk and disorderly and drug driving.  During the trophy presentation, some fans lit flairs and scaled the stadium's gates despite warnings from the club and officials to stay at home given the coronavirus outbreak.

Police officers, who were alerted to the scene by Melvin Theuma's laywer, found a knife next to the taxi driver, the spokesperson told CNN, adding that Theuma had injuries on the right side of his torso and his neck. Journalists like Maria Ressa face death threats and jail for doing their jobs. Facebook must take its share of the blame\"Most probably the wounds were self-inflicted, but obviously the investigations are still ongoing,\" the spokesperson added, referring both to the Caruana Galizia murder probe and also what happened to Theuma. Theuma was granted a presidential pardon in exchange for his agreement to testify in the Caruana Galizia murder investigation.He was due to attend a court hearing scheduled for Wednesday, Corinne Vella, the murdered journalist's sister who is also a spokesperson for the Daphne Caruana Galizia's foundation, told CNN by email.Read MoreVella added that Theuma had already testified in several hearings in the two criminal cases, and in the public inquiry into the circumstances of the killing. Ongoing court caseCaruana Galizia, 53, was a leading anti-corruption journalist from Malta, killed in a car bombing near her home in 2017. Her family says she was \"assassinated\" because of her work uncovering alleged corruption in the Maltese government.The court case against murder suspect Yorgen Fenech is ongoing in the capital, Valletta, according to The Times of Malta. Rebecca Vincent, the director of international campaigns at Reporters Without Borders is also tweeting from the courtroom.Theuma's residence is kept under 24-hour guard, police said in a statement, adding that he was found injured after an officer stationed outside had entered the house with Theuma's wife.Malta gets a new prime minister amid scandal over the killing of a journalist\"An ambulance was immediately called on site and transferred Mr. Theuma to Mater Dei hospital for further medical treatment. In addition to the ongoing investigation, the Police also requested to appoint a Magisterial Inquiry,\" the statement adds.CNN has tried to contact Theuma's lawyer.Police Commissioner Angelo Gaf\u00e0 confirmed Wednesday in a press conference that Theuma was still in critical condition.Caruana Galizia's journalism -- including her research into Maltese citizens implicated in the Panama Papers -- had made her some very powerful enemies. The Panama Papers are the name for the leak of millions of files from the database of a Panama law firm called Mossack Fonseca in 2016.The journalist had suffered intimidation over the years -- her dog's throat was cut, and in 2006 her house was set on fire as the family slept, tires piled against the back door to prevent them escaping.Shortly before her death, in what was to be the final entry on her blog Running Commentary, she wrote: \"There are crooks everywhere you look now.

        "content": "(CNN)Former world No. 1 golfer Lee Westwood says golf has some work to do in addressing issues of diversity within the sport and that it's \"dominated by White people.\"While many other sportspeople and sports organizations like Formula 1, the NFL and Premier League soccer have been vocal in support of the Black Lives Matter movement since the killing of George Floyd, Westwood agrees that golf has been far quieter.During an Instagram Live interview yesterday with CNN's Amanda Davies, he said: \"You know, arguably, the best player in our sport is Black [Tiger Woods] and he's done a lot to promote golf in different ethnic quarters. But I think we can always do more for sure.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresLee Westwood (right) says the despite the \"best player\" in golf --Tiger Woods (left) -- being Black, golf can do more to promote the game with non-White players.'Sport should be for everybody'Read MoreDuring the PGA Tour's resumption at the Charles Schwab Challenge last month, a moment of silence was held during each round in place of the 8:46 a.m. CT (2:45 p.m. BST) tee time. Eight minutes and 46 seconds is how long Floyd was filmed pinned under the police officer's knee.Briton Westwood said part of the problem is the perception of golf as a \"White sport.\"\"I think it's still perceived as a White sport if I'm being completely honest,\" he said. \"If you look at the people that partake in it, and certainly the crowds that turn up, it's dominated by White people.\"There's not enough Black people that come into the game. I don't know what the answer is to that. But there has to be an answer because sport should be for everybody, shouldn't it?\"READ: As PGA Tour hit by Covid-19 outbreak, Justin Rose feels 'very safe'Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka take part in a moment of silence held in place of the 8:46 tee time to remember George Floyd during the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge.In a statement sent to CNN Sport, the European Tour said it played in 31 countries across five continents, had members from 35 countries and winners from 36 countries since the Tour began in 1972.\"We are the gatekeepers of the professional game and we discriminate against nobody,\" added the Tour statement. \"Anyone who comes through the junior or amateur ranks, from any country, to qualify for our Tour, we welcome with open arms.\"Diversity is something we celebrate each day, but at the same time we also continue to listen and work on ways to broaden golf's appeal, and golf participation, to all areas of society. We also stand in solidarity with everyone wishing to end all forms of discrimination.\"The Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, which together with the US Golf Association (USGA), governs the sport of golf worldwide, was not immediately available to comment at the time of publication.In the US, approximately 25% of those who played on a golf course for the first time in 2017 were non-White.However, 82% of all golfers in the US are White, while 25% of junior golfers (aged 6-17) were non-White.The PGA Tour sent a statement to CNN Sport, saying: \"We agree with Lee that our game is not as diverse as we would like from an audience, recreational or player perspective.\"However, we at the PGA Tour have a considerable amount of optimism and are committed to doing\u202fmore, in Diversity and Inclusion.\"The organization also indicated that it has plans to announce a substantial commitment to social and racial justice causes in the coming months.The USGA responded similarly, saying: \"While the game of golf is built on the values of fairness, integrity and respect toward all individuals, we recognize that our game has not always represented the best of these ideals.\"We will continue to use our voice, our position and our actions to inspire change. That starts within our organization and broader industry. \"We are working to reset our focus and approach and create a new plan that spells out what we are working to achieve as well as where we will lead, influence and partner.\"Westwood of England plays his shot from the seventh tee during the final round of the Honda Classic at PGA National Resort and Spa Champion course on March 01, 2020 in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.Priced outWestwood singled out the cost of playing golf as a significant barrier to entry.\"Golf's too expensive, I think,\" said the 47-year-old Westwood. \"It's too expensive to join clubs.\"According to a 2018 survey by the Golf Channel, the median cost of an 18-hole round at a public golf course is $36 including cart, but excluding clubs.Private golf clubs are particularly expensive. According to a study of private clubs carried out by Longitudes Group for Golf Digest, the most elite clubs demand an initiation fee of between $250,000 and $500,000.Only 30% of responding private clubs had a list price of $7,500 or less. That is without annual \"dues\" (membership fees) which, according to the survey, cost an average of $6,245 (approximately $520 per month). Some clubs also require a minimum amount to be spent in the club shop and bar every month.Ryder CupMeanwhile the Ryder Cup, has been postponed to 2021.The biennial competition between the US and Europe was scheduled for September 22-27 at Whistling Straits in Kohler, Wisconsin. The tournament has been rescheduled for September 2021 at the same course.Organizers said that the decision to postpone this year's event was based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"It became clear that as of today, our medical experts and the public authorities in Wisconsin could not give us certainty that conducting an event responsibly with thousands of spectators in September would be possible,\" said PGA of America CEO Seth Waugh in a statement.\"Given that uncertainty, we knew rescheduling was the right call.\"",

They would be Cedric Chouviat's last\u00a0words. The 42-year-old deliveryman and father of five died in\u00a0a\u00a0hospital two days later;\u00a0his autopsy revealing a broken larynx,\u00a0according to the prosecutor in the case.The similarities with the case\u00a0of\u00a0George Floyd --\u00a0a\u00a0Black\u00a0American\u00a0killed during\u00a0a police\u00a0arrest in the US city of\u00a0Minneapolis\u00a0-- don't end there.\u00a0Chouviat's arrest, also captured on video, would, like Floyd's, become the focus of a wider campaign against police brutality. And as in the Floyd case, action against the officers would seem painfully slow in coming.But six months\u00a0after the death of Chouviat, who was of North African heritage,\u00a0three\u00a0of the police officers involved have now been placed under formal investigation, lawyers for the\u00a0Chouviat\u00a0family told CNN on Thursday. This,\u00a0after audio of the incident\u00a0--\u00a0captured by Chouviat's own phone\u00a0--\u00a0was submitted to the investigating judge. The transcript of the recording, seen by CNN, shows that Chouviat repeated the words \"j'etouffe\" seven times. A lawyer for two of the police\u00a0officers\u00a0says his clients never heard the words as Chouviat was still wearing his motorcycle helmet at the time. All four officers deny any wrongdoing. \u00a0The case is one of two that have cast a harsh light on\u00a0alleged\u00a0police brutality in\u00a0France and on the apparent impunity,\u00a0some say,\u00a0with which\u00a0accusations\u00a0of it are all too often met. Another, involving the death in police custody of\u00a0Adama Traor\u00e9\u00a0in\u00a0a Paris suburb in\u00a02016, has also seen fresh developments,\u00a0with the testimony of two witnesses heard as part of the investigation last week.But\u00a0four years after the 24-year-old Black man died, no charges have been brought against the officers involved. Their lawyers point to a medical assessment that blames Traor\u00e9's death on a pre-existing condition that his family says he didn't have.Cedric Chouviat's widow Doria and her children take part in a march in Levallois, near Paris, on January 12, 2020.Read MoreWhat the two cases have highlighted is the difficulty that families of victims face in getting allegations of police brutality properly and swiftly investigated. According to William Bourdon, a lawyer for\u00a0Chouviat's family, France \"is getting more like the United States by the persistence of police brutality and by the denial that goes with it.\"A spokesperson for the Paris police service declined to comment to CNN.Both cases have also led to calls for a change in policing techniques. In the Traor\u00e9 case, the officers used a controversial technique that involves pinning a suspect to the ground on his stomach. In\u00a0Chouviat's\u00a0case, the allegations center on the use of the chokehold. Last month, under pressure from police unions, plans to ban the technique were shelved by France's\u00a0then-Interior\u00a0Minister\u00a0Christophe Castaner. That he had even considered the move proved unpopular with the police, who held\u00a0 several\u00a0protests in June against him.\u00a0On Monday\u00a0He\u00a0was replaced as interior minister\u00a0on July 6\u00a0as part of a wider government reshuffle.\u00a0 A person holds a portrait of late Adama Traore during a march in Beaumont-sur-Oise, northeast of Paris in 2018 calling for answers in the case.Like in the US, there is a culture of resistance in the police force to investigating fellow officers, as well as a resistance on the part of strong police unions to attempts at reform.All the more so because of its role over the last few years in France in helping the government to\u00a0put down\u00a0yellow vest protests by bringing order to the streets of\u00a0France once again. Some campaigners say the police have\u00a0simply become too powerful. \u00a0\"I think that the outrage, the anger and sometimes the violence is fueled by this systematic rejection of any allegation,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Cecile\u00a0Coudriou,\u00a0president of Amnesty\u00a0International in\u00a0France.\"And the more the authorities stick to this rejection of any allegation, the more they try to refuse dialogue, including with us, with people who work based on the evidence, the worse it gets because it means people lose confidence in the authorities and lose confidence in the people who are supposed to not only to enforce the law but also to protect the people.\"Lack of data about race or ethnicityAnother difficulty, and one that is specific to\u00a0France, is the impossibility of quantifying racist incidents. France's\u00a0public institutions do\u00a0not collect any or data on race or ethnicity, in a laudable effort aimed at treating all citizens equally.But\u00a0this law has led to a lack of data, making it\u00a0difficult for non-White French people to make\u00a0White French people aware of the very different reality they face. As Rhoda\u00a0Tchokokam,\u00a0the co-writer of \"Le D\u00e9rangeur\" a book about the race issue in France, puts it, \"people are telling you that because of race, because of religion, because of gender, they're being discriminated against.\" \"If you cannot face it, then you are basically saying to the people of your country that you don't see them and that you don't care about them. So it's very important for the French state to understand that we are going to keep talking about it. And they need to start doing the same thing.\"  All the more so,\u00a0say activists,\u00a0because\u00a0while\u00a0the French state may not see color,\u00a0the police apparently do. Non-White French people say they are subjected to identity checks far more than\u00a0White people. Ben Achour, a lawyer who specializes in police brutality and discrimination, said\u00a0the checks are being misused.Doria Chouviat, center, the widow of Cedric Chouviat, speaks during a press conference in Paris, on June 23, 2020. People gather in Toulouse on January 8 to demand justice for Cedric Chouviat.\"What the police does,\"\u00a0Ben Achour said, \"is rather than chase delinquents, they check to see if you are really French. And that allows also the frisking, the violence, the insults, and the racist slurs. That's the condition of life of a lot of kids in France. They are subjected to those kinds of actions several times a week. How can they develop self-esteem? How can they trust the republic? How can you not challenge the republic when one of the first institution you are in contact with when you are\u00a010,\u00a011,\u00a012,\u00a013\u00a0years old, is violent towards you?\"Until now, because of the data law,\u00a0the problem has been impossible to quantify and the evidence was\u00a0purely\u00a0anecdotal. But last month a report by\u00a0France's civil\u00a0liberties ombudsman, former\u00a0justice\u00a0minister Jacques Toubon, warned that people of\u00a0Black and Arab appearance were subject to police identity checks\u00a020\u00a0times more frequently than\u00a0White people.\u00a0For Achour,\u00a0this\u00a0first recognition of the problem by a\u00a0French institution is a huge step. He told CNN that what Toubon had found was \"major systemic structural discrimination in France. And he says we need to count it. We need to measure this discrimination. You cannot fight discrimination, you cannot create policies if you don't have a measure because otherwise the problem doesn't exist. And this is why the moment is very important. We now have momentum in France.\"That momentum has been helped by events in the United States. The\u00a0death of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0and America's national reckoning have given\u00a0fresh\u00a0hope to supporters of both the Chouviat and Traor\u00e9 families with several protests held these last few weeks in France. Their \"Black\u00a0Lives\u00a0Matter\" slogan may have been imported, but they have been fueled by cases and by grievances that are entirely French.CNN's Barbara Wojazer contributed to this report.",

This declaration represents our firm resolve to eliminate violence in sports in Japan.\"In a statement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged the report.The New National Stadium, the main stadium for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium (C-R) are pictured on July 24, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.\"Harassment and abuse [are] unfortunately part of society and also occurs within sport,\" said the IOC. \"The IOC stands together with all athletes, everywhere, to state that abuse of any kind is contrary to the values of Olympism, which calls for respect for everyone in sport.  \"All members of society are equal in their right to respect and dignity, just as all athletes have the right to a safe sporting environment -- one that is fair, equitable and free from all forms of harassment and abuse.\"In 2018, Japanese police reported the suspected abuse of a record 80,104 minors to child welfare authorities -- an increase of 22.4% from the previous year, and the highest number since comparable data became available in 2004.READ: Before taking her own life, South Korean triathlete asked her mother to 'lay bare the sins' of her alleged abusersNot just unique to Japan Allegations of abusive training practices in sport are not just unique to Japan. Last month, South Korean triathlete Choi Suk-hyeon took her own life at the age of 22. Following Choi's death, her teammates on the Gyeongju City \u200bHall Triathlon team have spoken of the \"habitual physical and verbal abuse\" that they say existed in the team. A coach and a team captain have since been banned for life from the sport, denying all allegations of abuse.Also last month, more than 120 alleged sexual abuse victims of Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor, sent a letter to the Justice Department requesting a copy of a report on the FBI's handling of its investigation into Nassar.The DOJ's inspector general's office said that victims and the public should rest assured that findings will be made public at the end of an investigation into the FBI's handling of the Nasser case. Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison after hundreds of women and girls said he sexually abused them over two decades under the guise of providing medical treatment.CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report",

What matters the most is that we're unwavering in trying to do what's right,\" he said. \"What guides our decision is standing up for people who need us to stand up for them.''Kapler was raised in an atmosphere of activism and has been outspoken about the Black Lives Matter movement, according to the Giants website.Athletes have been kneeling for the anthem to support protests for social justice and racial equality, as the country comes to terms with systemic racism and protests have erupted over the killings of Black people at the hands of police.Anthem demonstrations were popularized by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who first sat and then kneeled for the anthem in 2016.In an interview after Monday's game, Kapler said that the Giants had conversations about what to do during the anthem for three days leading up to the exhibition.\"I told them that I wanted to amplify their voices, and I wanted to amplify the voice of the Black community and marginalized communities as well,\" he said. \"I told them that I wanted to use my platform to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with the way we've handled racism in our country.

        "content": "(CNN)Brussels began the week in celebratory mood, as member states of the European Union finally agreed how they would distribute around $2 trillion of funds across the bloc over the next seven years.The package, agreed in the early hours of Tuesday morning after four days of talks, comprises the $1.3 trillion seven-year EU budget plus a special $858 billion emergency package. It's designed to help the bloc recover from the Covid-19 pandemic as one, rather than abandoning poorer countries to their fate as wealthier nations surged back. Getting all 27 EU states onside for a controversial package over four days of hard negotiating was undoubtedly a huge success. But as the bubbles from the champagne breakfasts evaporate, it will become impossible to ignore the fact that the union has agreed a compromise today that could create massive headaches later.In recent years, Europe has been forced to acknowledge that the union faces an existential crisis, as some member states backslide on democratic norms. The two most egregious offenders in the eyes of the EU are Hungary and Poland, who in recent years have restricted press freedoms, cracked down on critics, and eroded judicial independence. EU leaders strike 'historic' $2 trillion deal to rebuild Europe's economyThe emergency fund, first proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in May, had always been controversial, as the monies would be raised against mutualized EU debt then distributed as a mixture of loans and grants.Read MoreDespite the controversy, it was clear to most member states that some kind of EU-level Covid response was inevitable. This created the opportunity to use these funds as an incentive to pull nations like Poland and Hungary back from the brink.The EU has historically struggled when it comes to bringing delinquent members to heel. The much-discussed Article 7 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty -- which provides a mechanism for sanctioning member states by revoking their voting rights -- has always been flawed. The process is cumbersome and ultimately requires unanimous action from all other member states to punish an offending one, which was never likely to happen. There have been active discussions in Brussels since 2018 to creating some kind of external mechanism outside of the treaty, to make the process more effective. Netherlands' Prime Minister Mark Rutte, left, talks with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and France's President Emmanuel Macron at the summit.Tuesday's agreement refers to such a mechanism. But critics feel it does not go far enough: An earlier version of the agreement published on Monday evening contained stronger language than the final document. Instead of a direct, easy way to withhold funds from countries offending member states, officials in Brussels are left with a fudge, contestable and open to interpretation. The only clear line on rule of law in the final document reads: \"The European Council underlines the importance of the protection of the Union's financial interests. The European Council underlines the importance of the respect of the rule of law.\"Some felt the final text had been severely watered down. \"The original text was much more promising. [But] it seems that the Hungarian government was in a very good negotiating position,\" says Petra Bard, Visiting Professor at the Central European University. \"They wouldn't have minded the whole deal being delayed for another couple of months. That meant other member states had little choice but to agree this vaguer wording that can be interpreted in many different ways.\"This result was probably always inevitable. This EU summit has been described as the most bitterly divided in recent memory.French officials said that Macron \"slammed his fist on the table\" in anger (although the Elys\u00e9e later tried to say it was \"metaphorical\"); Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, hated him \"because Hungary, in his opinion does not respect the rule of law, must be punished financially.\"So, the Tuesday morning fudge didn't surprise Brussels observers. \"The EU has always been reluctant to act when there is a democratic backslide,\" says Daniel Kelemen, Jean Monnet Chair in European Union Politics at Rutgers University. \"They have previously hidden behind the fact that Article 7 doesn't work and that they don't have the right toolkit, so try and create new mechanisms. The problem with this new agreement is any mechanism Hungary and Poland will vote for will be so watered down and unenforceable in reality.\"Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrives at the EU summit in Brussels on Monday. This could mean that in getting this initial agreement, the EU has put out one blazing house fire while overlooking embers further down the street.\"People often forget that the EU isn't a state in itself with its own powers to enforce laws. The EU's legal architecture holds the whole thing together in some respects. If member states ignore ECJ rulings, threaten judges who implement EU law, it doesn't just threaten democracy; it threatens undermining the whole union,\" says Keleman.Ronan McCrea, professor of European Law at University College, London, agrees that this presents a fundamental threat to the integrity of the whole union. \"The EU's bureaucracy is really small compared to that of a local English council. This means the EU relies on national judges and civil servants to implement EU law in their own countries.\"Earlier this year, Poland passed legislation that permitted the government to discipline judges who made rulings that the government disagreed with. \"In any European democracy, judicial independence is crucial. However, if judges fear they are going to be disciplined for ruling against their government, how can they independently stand by EU law,\" says McCrea.Kelemen goes further: \"If judges are in the pocket of the government, how can another EU state extradite a criminal to a fellow member state? They cannot guarantee that person will receive a fair trial, especially in countries where political dissent is being cracked down on.\"While Hungary and Poland might provide much of the focus of concern, they are far from the only EU member states that have flouted some of the EU's core pinciples. And as Kelemen points out, \"failing to address this kind of backslide encourages its spread.\" And the further it spreads, the more leaders who are happy to play loose with democracy end up in prominent positions.However much leaders in Brussels were toasting European unity on Tuesday morning, it is simply a fact that leaders with these instincts are becoming more assertive at EU-level. And as Hungary proved, they are getting good at playing politics in Brussels.\"Their goal now is to wield influence within the EU while picking up EU money to run their regimes with it,\" says Kelemen. The bitter reality for those who most value the EU is that those who seek to twist its values no longer seek to run from it, but to run the show.This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Daniel Kelemen's name.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK government says it has reached a deal with the United States to change the diplomatic immunity rules that meant an American woman charged with causing the death of a British teenager in a road accident has not had to return to face trial.The UK and US agreed to revise an \"anomaly\" that allowed Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a former US diplomat, to leave Britain after 19-year-old Harry Dunn was killed, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced Wednesday. \"It's important that we have now agreed with the US new arrangements that have closed the anomaly that led to the denial of justice in the heartbreaking case of Harry Dunn. The new arrangements mean it could not happen again,\" Raab said. Charlotte Charles, mother of the British teenager who was killed in a car crash on his motorcycle, at a news conference in New York City in October.\"I know these changes won't bring Harry back, and I appreciate the pain and suffering the family are still going through, but I hope this may bring some small measure of comfort to them, because I know they want to prevent any other family going through the same ordeal they have,\" he added. Sacoolas, the driver of the car that killed motorcyclist Dunn, claimed diplomatic immunity after the crash outside RAF Croughton, a central England military base controlled by the US Air Force. According to police, the vehicle that hit Dunn's motorbike was driving on the wrong side of the road. Read MoreBritain's attempt to extradite Sacoolas to face charges of causing death by dangerous driving was declined by US authorities, and the incident has sparked an ongoing diplomatic row between the two countries, involving both leaders.Teen accident victim's family call for UK to block Julian Assange's US extraditionUnder the terms of the revised agreement, family members of staff based at RAF Croughton will no longer be given immunity from criminal jurisdiction and will face criminal prosecution where applicable. While the agreement does not guarantee the return of Sacoolas to the UK, Dunn's family say they remain committed to campaigning for her return. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, the family's spokesman, Radd Seiger, said they welcome this \"giant step,\" which comes ahead of the one-year anniversary of Dunn's death.End to 'special arrangements'Raab explained in his statement that the status of US staff at RAF Croughton had been \"the subject of special arrangements between the UK and US governments,\" dating back to 1995.\"Those arrangements contained a waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction for US staff outside the course of their duties, but there was no such waiver for their family members,\" he said.Raab said the US waiver of immunity from criminal jurisdiction was now expressly extended to the family members of US staff at Croughton, \"ending the anomaly in the previous arrangements and permitting the criminal prosecution of the family members of those staff, should these tragic circumstances ever arise again.\"It will also extend to embassy staff outside their official duties, not just administrative and technical staff, he added.On Sunday, ahead of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to the UK, Raab expressed his regret at the US government's failure to cooperate with Sacoolas' extradition request, telling Sky News that it was unlikely the US would change its position. \"I raised it with Mike Pompeo this week ... they've been adamant throughout that they will not return her,\" Raab said.  The 19-year-old's family have said they will not stop campaigning for justice. Pictured, Dunn's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn on CNN's New Day.\"Ultimately, we can call on the US to do the right thing and we hope that they will, but I think realistically, given the consistent position that they've taken, they're not going to allow Anne Sacoolas [to return],\" he added. Earlier on Sunday, Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, urged the UK government to ensure justice is carried out. \"We need the UK to work really hard with the US government now and bring a closure to this, bring her back and get that justice,\" Charles told Sky News. \"It's so important to feel supported by your own government and, unfortunately, we just haven't had that,\" she added. Addressing Charles's remarks, Raab asserted that the UK government is \"on the family's side\" and continues to call on US authorities to cooperate. \"There is a denial of justice here, there is an extradition request that is outstanding, and we have called on Anne Sacoolas to return and to our American partners to facilitate that -- we've done that consistently throughout,\" Raab said. \"We're on the family's side, we've made that clear all along,\" he added.US declines UK request to extradite American accused in teen's deathCharles, who wrote to Boris Johnson in early March asking for a meeting, said last month that she and her son Niall Dunn -- Harry's twin -- were angered by the UK Prime Minister's response.\"Having read both his letter to me and to Niall, I cannot begin to express how flat and angry I feel with this cut and paste response,\" Charles said in a statement.\"My son was killed by an American citizen, Mr Johnson and his Government let that person go and he doesn't have the courage to meet with us,\" she said, adding \"even President Trump saw fit to meet us.\"The prime minister's letter expressed his \"deepest condolences for the tragic loss of your much loved son Harry,\" a loss that was \"compounded\" by the US decision not to waive diplomatic immunity for Sacoolas.                                                                                                                                                                                                             He went on to say that \"the next steps in the legal process are a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service,\" the public prosecutions agency in England and Wales. Johnson added that he was \"determined to improve road safety around RAF Croughton\" where the crash took place.He said he was \"taking a close interest in this case\" and had asked Raab \"to be the lead point of contact with you and the rest of the family.\"In late May, the Dunns announced their intention to bring a criminal case against Raab regarding his handling of the fatal crash. Seiger, the family's spokesman, told CNN at the time that they were seeking private prosecution and accused Raab of misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice.",

I was a little bit rusty but felt like overall it was a good start. It's been a while since I've played. Got off to almost an ideal start and got a feel for the round early.

That certainly was noticeable, mostly different,\" said Woods, who has won this tournament a record five times.\"[But no] I definitely didn't have any issue with energy and not having the fans' reactions out there.

        "content": "(CNN)In a coastal neighborhood in Australia's New South Wales state, luxury beachfront homes are in danger of collapsing into the ocean.Residents in more than 40 houses along Wamberal Beach -- located 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Sydney -- have had to evacuate in recent days as coastal erosion threatened to damage or destroy the homes.The multi-million dollar properties sit on a cliff above the water, but days of strong swells have eaten away at the land, causing the cliff face to crumble. Videos from last Friday show white waves surging up the cliff, almost reaching the houses, leaving broken staircases and debris in the sand as the tide pulls away.This weekend, some homes saw their backyards swallowed by water, or front porches and balconies partially collapsed. Authorities declared dozens of homes \"at-risk,\" and residents were given two hours to pack their belongings and evacuate during low tide, according to CNN affiliate Nine News. An aerial view of the suburb of Wamberal in Australia's New South Wales on July 17.It's not clear when they'll be allowed back into their homes; authorities have shut off power, gas, and water to the most high-risk properties and fenced off the danger zone, as the Central Coast Council asks members of the community to stay away from the area.Read MoreIn the meantime, local officials and welfare agencies are working to provide crisis accommodation for the displaced residents. But many frustrated residents say it's too little too late, and accused the local council of not taking sufficient action to address long-standing concerns. For years, they've warned against coastal erosion accelerated by climate change, and lobbied for a seawall -- especially after destructive storms in 2016.Half of the world's beaches could disappear by the end of the century, study findsIn a press release on Monday, the council \"acknowledged the severe weather had caused great distress to residents.\" If residents wanted to take \"coastal engineer-designed action\" to protect their homes in the coming weeks, the council wouldn't take any regulatory action, it said.\"This is a not a time for blaming each other -- it is a time for us to work together to deliver long-term solutions for the Coast, including for those who have been so terribly impacted by this event,\" said Mayor Lisa Matthews in the release.But some residents took this as further evidence of authorities absolving themselves of responsibility.\"We can't protect our own homes at our cost -- the council doesn't want to do anything,\" said Chris Rogers, a resident who had to flee his home, according to Nine News. \"We've got no trust in them. It's pretty hard to trust someone when for over a decade they've been letting people down.\"Coasts under threatSevere storms have devastated Wamberal Beach and the surrounding Central Coast multiple times since the 1970s, causing severe erosion and damage to residential properties. However, it wasn't until last year that the council began preliminary investigations and designs for a seawall.Coastal erosion is threatening other communities around the country, too; nearly 39,000 buildings around the Australian coast are at risk of accelerated erosion due to the effects of climate change, according to the government's geoscience agency.Beachfront homes in Wamberal have experienced damage during storms and sea swells for decades. At least 7,100 miles (11426.34 kilometers) of Australian coastline -- roughly 50% of the country's entire sandy coastline -- could be threatened by 2100, a study found in March.Climate change creates more powerful and extreme weather systems, with higher seas and damaging storms posing new threats. Normally, beaches are dynamic environments. Shorelines are supposed to naturally shift and change with the tide and respond to changes in sea level. But when humans develop near the water, we further disrupt a beach's ability to move and halt the natural processes that allow sand to replenish on its own.Worldwide, as many as half of all sandy beaches could disappear by the end of the century, according to the March study. Even by 2050 some coastlines could be unrecognizable from what we see today, with 14% to 15% facing severe erosion.Staten Island seawall: Designing for climate changePlaces like Miami Beach in the United States are trucking in thousands of tons of sand to patch up badly eroded shorelines, while others have built massive seawalls and breakwaters in an attempt to hold precious sand in place.But the financial and environmental costs of these projects are enormous, and scientists say rising seas and more powerful storms, supercharged by a warmer climate, will make this a losing battle.Other countries that could see huge lengths of shoreline eroded are Chile, China, Russia, Mexico and Argentina.",

In the first hours of the siege, Kryvosh allegedly opened fire and threw a grenade at the police, according to the Ukraine Interior Ministry.

Zelensky's video was deleted after Krivosh surrendered and the hostages were released. There were no reports of deaths or injuries.

Before that he spoke to everyone for about 10-15 seconds and then hung up but then we managed to talk for 7-10 minutes and reached an agreement that he will make the first move to release our citizens.\"Late on Tuesday, the Ukrainian interior minister Arsen Avakov said: \"The film [Earthlings]... is a good one. But you don't have to be so screwed up and cause such a terror for the entire country, you can just watch it without all that.\"On Wednesday Kryvosh was charged with terrorism, hostage-taking and illegal possession of weapons, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior. Interior ministry officials added that he had previously spent almost a decade in prison for fraud, extortion, illegal sale of firearms and explosives. Kryvosh will also undergo a mental health assessment. CNN was unable to contact a lawyer or representative for him, and it was not immediately clear if he had been assigned counsel.",

        "content": "(CNN)President Donald Trump has long been reluctant to wear a mask in public, but on Tuesday he gave his most unequivocal backing yet to public health experts' calls for the US public to mask up.\"We are asking everybody, when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask,\" Trump said at a White House briefing. \"Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.\"A day earlier, he tweeted a photo of himself sporting one and encouraged his \"patriotic\" supporters to do the same.His abrupt change of tack comes amid a politicized debate over masks in the United States, which is nearing the grim milestone of 4 million confirmed coronavirus cases -- the highest figure of any nation in the world, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.Public health experts have spent months emphasizing that masks are one of the most effective tools to help fight the pandemic, and many US states have now introduced some kind of mask requirement. Yet Trump has refused to introduce a nationwide mandate, saying he wants people to have \"a certain freedom.\"Read MoreBut in many other nations, that discussion is long over and mask mandates are becoming the norm.Trump tweets image of himself wearing a mask and calls it 'patriotic'Even UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was initially reluctant to impose such rules, made face coverings compulsory on public transport in England from mid-June. People in England will face up to \u00a3100 ($125) fines if they do not wear masks in stores from Friday.France made masks compulsory in all enclosed public spaces on Monday, extending the mandate from cinemas and museums to include shops, banks and shopping malls. Police can issue \u20ac135 ($155) fines for those who break the rules. Masks have been mandatory on the Paris metro system since May. Other countries made masks mandatory months ago. In the Czech Republic, masks became compulsory for everyone anywhere outside their home from midnight on March 19, with exemptions later put in place for children under two and people driving alone. German states introduced fines of between \u20ac15 and \u20ac5,000 for failing to wear a mask in April. In May, Spain made face coverings mandatory in indoor and outdoor public spaces where a minimum two-meter distance can't be guaranteed.Masks are mandatory in stores in Italy. The country's Lombardy region was one of the worst-hit places in the world, early in the pandemic.Nations including Scotland, Italy, and Greece have also made it compulsory to wear face coverings in retail stores, while countries including Cuba, Pakistan and Iran have made them compulsory in busy public spaces.And this is old news in much of Asia, where mask-wearing has been widely accepted since the region was hard-hit by the 2003 SARS epidemic -- another respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus. Experts wrote in the journal Science in May that the world needed to take airborne transmission of the virus seriously, pointing to places where mask-wearing was universal and the virus has been largely controlled, such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan.Hong Kong's government, like many others in Asia, recommended face-coverings right from the start of pandemic. Last week it announced that masks would be made mandatory on public transport after recording a spike in infections. Most Hong Kong citizens have been regularly wearing masks in public since the outbreak.Pupils wearing fabric masks listen to their teacher in a school in Beaucamps-Ligny, near Lille, France. Masks are now compulsory in all enclosed spaces there.Dr. Padmini Murthy, professor and global health director at New York Medical College, told a United Nations panel on July 8 that \"wearing a mask, ladies and gentlemen, is respect.\"She highlighted places like South Korea, Hong Kong and Thailand, which practiced mask-wearing, social distancing and contact tracing early on in the pandemic, and now have fewer than six deaths per 1 million people. Yet masks remain a divisive topic in the US. Arkansas on Tuesday joined at least 39 states that now have some kind of mask requirement, but states including Florida and Arizona are leaving it to local officials. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is suing Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over the city's mask mandate. Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's leading infectious disease expert, has urged governors and mayors to be \"as forceful as possible\" to get people to wear them.Walmart begins requiring all customers to wear face masksIn an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said it was \"bizarre that we have turned ... mask-wearing into something political.\"The US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that the science shows face masks protect both the wearer and others from Covid-19, and advised that everyone should wear one when around other people in public.Even cloth face masks help, three top CDC officials said in a commentary published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\"While community use of face coverings has increased substantially, particularly in jurisdictions with mandatory orders, resistance continues,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Brooks and Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases Dr. Jay Butler said in a joint editorial.There is \"ample evidence\" that people who have no symptoms and may not realize they are infected may be driving the ongoing surge in infections, they wrote. \"At this critical juncture when Covid-19 is resurging, broad adoption of cloth face coverings is a civic duty.\"The World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guidance around wearing face masks on June 5, advising nations to encourage the public to wear fabric face coverings in public where the coronavirus is spreading.Buy-in from leaders is important. Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford, told CNN last week that people in countries like Italy and Spain, without a previous history of wearing masks, have \"rapidly adopted face coverings during the Covid-19 period largely because the authorities provided them with a consistent policy and clear guidelines to understand why they should wear them.\"Masks are seen globally as a key tool to help contain the coronavirus.

        "content": "(CNN)World No. 3 Dominic Thiem has said recent criticism of Novak Djokovic for his part in organizing the controversial Adria Tour in June is unfair. A host of stars, including world No.1 Djokovic, tested positive for Covid-19 after competing in the tournament, which attracted large crowds and had limited social distancing in place, with players hugging and high-fiving each other, playing basketball and dancing together.Djokovic, who bore the brunt of the widespread backlash, has since apologized for his involvement in hosting the event in the Balkans, saying in a statement he was \"deeply sorry our tournament had caused harm.\"Fellow professional Nick Kyrgios said hosting the event was \"boneheaded\" and criticized other players, including Thiem, for taking part. Despite now admitting the tournament -- initially scheduled to be played in four cities from June 13 through July 5 -- was a mistake, Thiem says Djokovic was only trying to do something positive. Novak Djokovic and the Adria Tour: the exhibition event that shocked tennisRead More\"It was unfair to him because he didn't break any law and he didn't force us,\" Thiem told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. \"He didn't force any player to come there. He didn't force any player to interact with the fans.\"It was our own decision. The whole event was for a very good cause as well.\"The tour had attracted three-time grand slam finalist Thiem, world No. 7 Alexander Zverev of Germany and three-time major semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria, among others. Djokovic's 24-year-old brother, Djordje, was named tournament director.On June 21, it was announced Dimitrov had tested positive for coronavirus and organizers swiftly canceled the entire series. Troicki would later test positive, as would Croatia's Borna Coric, Djokovic, his wife, Jelena, and others. Thiem says the players got carried away with the joyous occasion which, at the time, looked at odds with the local government advice to stay one meter apart. \"It was obviously a mistake from everybody but it's a long time ago now really and everybody who got positive there is healthy again, which is a very good sign as well,\" he said, before adding that everybody had learned from their mistakes. \"In reality, we saw happy fans, we saw happy kids and then we kind of forgot to keep the distance, to not take pictures, to not hug the kids and it was a mistake. \"Everybody regrets it, of course, but I think, at the same time, it's fine now.\"READ: Kyrgios calls Becker a 'doughnut' after being labeled a 'rat'Players pose for pictures at the Adria Tour. US OpenThiem recently played in, and won, the Bett1Aces tournament in Berlin -- an event which adhered to social distancing guidelines and was partly played in an old airport hanger. He's now turned his focus to the US Open, which is due to take place behind closed doors at the end of August. The Austrian says he has no concerns about participating in New York and says the competition in Berlin can be an example of how to stage an event safely. \"If it's going to happen, I'm very sure that it's safe and that I'm also going to play because I guess it's time that the normal tour is coming back,\" he said, admitting it will be hard to play a grand slam without thousand of fans in the stadium. \"It's tough to imagine but, at the same time, it is how it is and we have to deal with it.\"I think the main thing is that the tour, and the tennis, slowly comes back.\"A number of high-profile players have raised doubts about whether the US Open should go ahead this year but organizers are content with the safety precautions in place. They received a boost when Serena Williams confirmed she would play at Flushing Meadows and now sister Venus has expressed her wish to be involved. \"God willing you will see me in New York. If it is safe to play, I really want to play the US Open,\" Venus said on her YouTube channel.

Sofia Shapatava says 'tennis may not survive' coronavirus pandemic as she starts petition calling for financial helpDjokovic, the president of the ATP Player Council, had called for players to contribute to a fund set up by the game's governing bodies but Thiem initially did not want to be involved -- believing his donations would be better served elsewhere. He has since clarified his comments, saying that whilst he does support lower-ranked and junior players, he wants to choose who deserves his support. \"What I said is that there are guys on the Future Tour who are not living professionally,\" he added.\"That's what I said. And there are guys who don't deserve the support and I'm never going to change my opinion.\"\"There are many, many guys who deserve it and that's my opinion.

He says she took the whole year off from competing in triathlon in 2018, \u200bsaying she was tired and couldn't continue with the training.On July 1, the Korean Sports and Olympic Committee (KSOC) said it received a report from Choi \u200bon April 8 \u200balleging that she had been abused by her coaching staff, while Choi's father tells CNN he verbally filed a complaint to Gyeongju City Hall on February 6.Following that verbal complaint, Gyeongju City Hall Sports Association launched an investigation and interviewed Choi's teammates over the phone.

According to her father, Choi once even fled team accommodation: \"She ran away, saying that she can't compete in a team like this,\" he says. \"But all that time, she never talked about abuse, she just said that she was tired.\"She barely came home ... They didn't send her home. Even when she came, she couldn't stay long. She wasn't talkative either.\"He says he persuaded her to return to the team in 2019, when Kim agreed to place less pressure on Choi and the control of her weight.However, it was the influence of team captain Jang Yun-jung and senior athlete Kim Do-hwan, Choi's father says, that meant \"nightmare-like days returned\" at a training camp in New Zealand.JUST WATCHEDSouth Korea skating rocked by abuse accusations ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSouth Korea skating rocked by abuse accusations  02:32One of Choi's teammates \u200bspeaking at the National Assembly press conference said from firsthand experience that Jang \u200bhad abused members of the team.That teammate said Jang \"always drove a wedge between the athletes, pushed athletes to the abyss of hell with physical and verbal abuse and made us self-destruct due to mental stress.\" Jang also denied the allegations at the emergency meeting held by the National Assembly's sports subcommittee, adding: \"It (Choi's death) hurts me as an athlete myself, but I've sincerely cooperated in the investigation.\" She has also been banned \u200bfrom the sport for life by the Korea Triathlon Federation (KTF). Senior athlete Kim, who has been banned for 10 years, denied allegations of physical abuse: \"There's nothing for me to apologize for,\" he said. \"It is unfortunate (that Choi died), but I didn't physically abuse her, so there's nothing for me to apologize for.\" In last week's cabinet meeting, Moon \u200backnowledged Choi's death and called for a reform of sporting institutions in South Korea. \"Cruel treatment and abuse on athletes are legacies from old times that cannot be justified with any word,\" said Moon. \"The world of sports should get out of the backward \u200bbehavior that has been conventionally continued.\"Perception and culture must change first ...

        "content": "(CNN)\"I'm Fanny Smith. I was born on Flinders Island. I'm the last of the Tasmanians.\"The audio\u00a0is scratchy and distorted, sounding at times like it is being spoken through a wall. Yet the voice speaking is high and proud, with long, stretched syllables in English. When she breaks into song, in her native language, it is half chant, half bluesy-spiritual.Smith\u00a0was born\u00a0on the Australian island of Tasmania, in December 1834, to the Palawa people, an Indigenous population that had lived on the land for at least 34,000 years.By the time she died in 1905, Smith was the last native speaker of her people's language.It was one of more than 250 distinct languages spoken on the Australian continent when Europeans began arriving in the 17th and 18th centuries.\u00a0Since then, colonial rules systematically stripped Indigenous peoples of their languages through English-only education policies and discriminatory practices, causing deep-rooted issues that held communities back socially and economically, and fractured their identities.Horace Watson records Fanny  Smith, an Indigenous Tasmanian woman, speaking her language in 1899. Read MoreThe Black WarWhen Europeans first\u00a0invaded\u00a0Tasmania in 1803, there were between 4,000 and 10,000 Indigenous people living on the island.By the middle of the century, this had dropped to the low hundreds, with thousands having been exterminated by the \"Black War,\" a campaign,\u00a0beginning in the 1820s,\u00a0by European settlers to push the Indigenous Palawa people off the newly settled territory.Survivors were forced to move to Flinders Island, a remote outpost that previously served as a prison colony. On the Island, Indigenous people were encouraged to assimilate, take English names and adopt European dress.That was where Smith was born in the 1830s, one of a community of around 100 people\u00a0living on the island.   In 1847, the camp at Flinders Island shut down amid growing controversy. Smith was among a few dozen other surviving Indigenous Tasmanians who moved to Oyster Cove, south of Hobart, where years later she met her husband, William Smith, an English ex-convict transported to Australia for stealing a donkey.In 1876, Fanny Smith petitioned the government to recognize her as the last surviving Tasmanian Aboriginal. She received a parliamentary grant of \u00a350 and a 300-acre piece of land, as a form of compensation for the near extermination of the island's Indigenous population.The recognition of Smith, and before her a woman called\u00a0Truganini, as the \"last Tasmanians\" sparked a belated desire\u00a0among some Whites\u00a0to preserve the island's culture and language -- if not its people.In 1899, a few years before her death, Smith traveled to Barton Hall, a stately home in the swanky Hobart suburb of Sandy Bay.\u00a0A photo\u00a0from that day shows her standing in the house's garden, her face inches away from a phonograph trumpet connected to a wax cylinder recording device operated by Horace Watson, of the Royal Society in Hobart.Watson recorded Smith twice, talking about her life and singing in her native language. She cried when she heard the recording played back to her, reminded of her mother's voice.Yet the experience was not entirely a sad one. Smith sang hymns and traditional songs for Watson, and translated one of the songs she sang into English: It's spring time,The birds are whistling, the spring is come,The clouds are all sunny,The fuchsia is out at the top, the birds are whistling, everything is dancing,Because it's springtime, everything is dancing,Because it's springtime.\"This record was made for me by Fanny Smith in 1903,\" Watson says at the end of one of the recordings. \"We had a real excellent time here.\"When Smith died two years later, the Tasmanian languages died with her. This pattern would play out again and again across Australia in the 20th century, as the rights of Indigenous people were trampled and their languages and culture increasingly marginalized or assimilated.\n\n\nListen to a recording of Fanny Smith\n\n\nLanguage lossIt's a cliche that we do not fully appreciate what we have until it's gone, but the mass death of Australian languages has proven to be the perfect laboratory for studying language decline and the effects it has had on Indigenous communities.Decades of work by researchers has provided important findings into how the loss of language feeds into health, economic and education outcomes, and made the case for preserving and bolstering minority languages. In Australia, Indigenous people are twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to have a severe or profound disability, and more than six times as likely to live in social housing. The unemployment rate for Indigenous people is also 4.2 times the national average.In Canada, too, a government survey found First Nations and Inuit people lag far behind non-Indigenous populations \"as measured by most major indicators of health.\"\"Indigenous health is widely understood to also be affected by a range of cultural factors, including racism, along with various Indigenous-specific factors, such as loss of language and connection to the land, environmental deprivation, and spiritual, emotional, and mental disconnectedness,\" researchers Malcolm King, Alexandra Smith and Michael Gracey argued in a 2009 paper for The Lancet. \"Language is crucial to identity, health, and relations. It is especially important as a link to spirituality, an essential component of Indigenous health.\"A woman waves the Aboriginal flag on January 26, 2018, during a rally to mark what many Indigeous Australians call \"Invasion Day.\"Douglas Whalen, a speech and language expert at the City University of New York,\u00a0said that those communities which retained their Indigenous languages showed better results across a host of health metrics, from\u00a0\"suicide to diabetes.\"\"Not that I believe that language has magical properties -- although some communities do -- it's just that it reestablishes a sense of community and connectedness that is currently lacking for many people,\" he said.\u00a0\"Language and culture are very tied together. I think language still has a special place because you can connect it to any cultural practice, everybody recognizes it as part of their cultural heritage.\"Dianne Biritjalawuy Gondarra, a Yolngu woman from Arnhem Land, on the northern tip of Australia, said that \"culture is a shadow, it's something that follows your everywhere, and part of culture is language, which connects me back to my land.\" \"It disconnects a person if you don't have your language,\" Gondarra said. \"You feel it, that loss.\" Michael Walsh, a researcher at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), said that in his work on language revival,\u00a0working with people rediscovering their Indigenous languages,\u00a0\"what always struck me very forcibly was the way an individual would say that getting their language back had changed their life.\"\"We've got the gloomiest statistic of the highest level of youth suicide among Indigenous people in the OECD,\" he added.\u00a0The hope is that by improving access to Indigenous languages and culture, this can help connect people with their identity and stave off or at least reduce mental health problems.\"If language can be used to arrest this level of suicide obviously it's going to be a good thing,\" he said. Cut off from informationMany Indigenous language speakers also find it hard to access information, with key education and health materials only available in English -- exacerbating the gap between outcomes for Indigenous Australians and Whites.\"Basic primary underlying knowledge is unavailable to them,\" said Richard Trudgen, director of Why Warriors, a Northern Territory-based Indigenous rights group. \"This is why nothing is working, this is why the gap never closes and it gets wider.\"While younger Indigenous people may learn English through school,\u00a0educational outcomes\u00a0are worse\u00a0in Indigenous communities compared to White ones,\u00a0they people still lack access to resources in their native tongue\u00a0and may struggle to understand more complex materials in a second language.\u00a0In the Yolngu community where Trudgen works, in northeast Arnhem Land, a lack of access to information in their own language, as well as the tools to translate from English to Yolngu, leaves people in a \"paralyzed learning state,\" Trudgen writes in an upcoming report, a draft of which was shared with CNN.\"They cannot self-learn ... and cannot productively control their lives becoming just like dry leaves on a tree that fall to the ground,\" he said.\"When Yolngu look around at their own world they see their own economic, legal and governance structure which they understand,\" Trudgen continues. \"But the Balanda (mainstream Australian) economic legal and governance structure is just a blur of confusion. This seems to be a whole level of knowledge that the Balanda education system has not given them access to or has locked away from them like the roots of the tree in the ground.\"Gondarra, who works with Trudgen on a number of projects, said that without formal education in their own language, young people are left with a denuded version of it, with more complex topics always discussed in English. \"They're left thinking (the language) is dumb and stupid, but it's dumb and stupid because it's been dumbed down,\" she said. \"They're not learning the high and old language, the economic and academic language.\" Indigenous protesters show their support during the Black Lives Matter rally in Perth, Australia, on June 13, 2020.A lost pearlWhalen, the CUNY expert, said that \"when you talk to people from Indigenous communities\" about the value of language in promoting general health and other outcomes, \"they are completely unsurprised.\"Testifying before an Australian parliamentary inquiry in 2012, Yurranydjil Dhurrkay, a woman from Galiwin'ku, an island off the coast of Arnhem Land,\u00a0said that\u00a0\"our language is like a pearl inside a shell. The shell is like the people that carry the language. If our language is taken away, then that would be like a pearl that is gone. We would be like an empty oyster shell.\"For a large number of Indigenous Australians, however, these pearls have been actively stolen. Only 13 of the 100 or so Indigenous languages spoken across Australia are acquired by children, vital for them to survive into another generation,\u00a0according to AIATSIS. Most languages are spoken only by a handful of elders who are rapidly dying out -- joining Fanny Smith as the last speakers of their native tongues. In the past, languages were often viewed in Darwinian terms, the survival of the fittest. But more recent research has shown that by and large, languages do not die out, they are killed.After Europeans invaded the Australian continent in 1788, scant effort was made to learn Indigenous languages, except by a handful of colonists, and White and Indigenous communities largely lived separately. When they did overlap, Indigenous peoples were often treated brutally, forced into slavery or menial labor, or massacred. As White Australians took over more and more of the continent, Indigenous peoples could no longer be ignored, and efforts were made to assimilate them into colonial society. Beginning in the late 19th century and lasting until 1970, Indigenous children were routinely removed from their families and placed in White households or institutions, stripped of their culture and language. Those not of the \"stolen generations\" were often little better off. Schools and missions across the country were ordered to stop using Indigenous languages and switch to English.\"They were told don't speak your language, don't practice your culture, or your children will be taken away from you,\" said Letetia Harris, a Wiradjuri language teacher in Wagga Wagga, in New South Wales. \"The people who are the victims or the children of the victims live with that and there is not one Aboriginal person who is not affected by stolen generations or that fear (of having their children taken).\" The tide has slowly been turning in favor of language revival, or at least preservation, since the 1960s, writes Indigenous languages researcher Laura Rademaker. In 1973 -- after decades of work by Indigenous educators and activists -- the government reintroduced mother tongue education at select schools. However, this program has not been without setbacks, and many communities still struggle to access key materials, Trudgen said.Often it is not \"until the people are basically wiped out and have lost all their language and start to learn English\" by necessity, he added, that they finally gain access to vital information, on subjects such as germ theory, dealing with the government, and legal matters. This is not a failure of the language, Yolgnu for example can express and discuss these concepts as well as English, but in education and resources available.Trudgen said that many English-speakers unconsciously believe that is the only language through which people can acquire knowledge, when Indigenous languages are fully capable of being used to teach complex topics.\"The mainstream mindset is that the people are primitive, their languages are primitive, we'll just force them into school and tell them they all need to speak English,\" he said. \"A hundred years ago they whipped Aboriginal people for speaking their languages -- we've gone from that to a more subtle form of whipping, where we just won't use their languages.\"Painted memorial poles by the Yol\u014bu people of northeast Arnhem Land.Slow progressSince the 1970s, progress in revitalizing -- and in some cases reviving -- Indigenous Australian languages has been slow, but it is occurring.Walsh, the AIATSIS researcher, said revitalization work can sometimes be harmed by a focus on the \"doom and gloom around Australian languages,\" as this can encourage defeatism and make it hard to rally support for at-risk languages.\"In fact, a lot of languages are vastly ahead of where they were 20 years ago and things are really gathering pace,\" he said, pointing to successful efforts to reintroduce Wiradjuri\u00a0to schools in the region. \"In monolingual Australia, for there to be 5,000 people learning Wiradjuri, that's just off the scale. Twenty-five years ago, if there were 15 people learning a language we would be delighted.\"Even symbolic use of languages -- such as translating road signs or government announcements, or broadcasting snippets on TV -- can have a major effect, Walsh added.Whalen, the CUNY expert, agreed. \"The goal does not have to be complete fluency, having the Indigenous language spoken on the street every day,\" he said. \"Lots of smaller uses and more constrained uses are still valuable.\"Growing up in the 1960s, Cheryl Penrith only knew a handful of Wiradjuri words. Elders at that time were careful not to speak the language in front of children, and many in the community had been traumatized by experiences of the stolen generations. \"One of the reasons people were removed from their families was to stop people talking language,\" she said. \"People were really deterred from speaking language.\"As an adult, Penrith, who lives in Wagga Wagga, took a Wiradjuri course, part of the state-wide language reclamation project led by Indigenous elders and activists. \"It has been really empowering for us, it connects us to country,\" she said. \"Language can really connect you to place and your identity.\"Recent years have seen a mini-renaissance in Indigenous culture and art, with projects such as NoongarPedia, the first Wikipedia site in an Australian language, translations of Shakespeare, and more programming for Indigenous language content on radio and television. Revival movements for endangered or even dead languages are also underway across the country, including in Tasmania, where a composite language -- Palawa kani -- drawn from historical sources has gained some traction in recent years. While mother tongue teaching and language revival is important worldwide, it is of particular importance in Australia, where Indigenous culture and language is deeply connected to the land and relies a great deal on oral storytelling. Many members of the stolen generations have spoken of how being taken away from their family and culture has left them disconnected to the land as well, unsure of where they belong and who they are. Gap remainsMore than 100 years after Fanny Smith's death, Australia has changed in a way that would have been unimaginable for her generation. A White settler society has transformed into a modern, multicultural and multiracial country.But despite that progress, Indigenous people have, to a great extent, remained on the fringe, cut off from advances and still subject to discrimination and racism.Unlike other Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand and Canada, Australia still doesn't have a treaty between its government and its Indigenous people. Indigenous people are also vastly overrepresented in crime and prison statistics, and those regarding deaths in custody.

Marches held across the country featured tens of thousands of people of all races, who connected the American issue to that felt by Black people in Australia, with one sign reading \"same story, different soil.\"Echoing a key slogan of the US protests, Trudgen, director of Why Warriors, said that the \"dominant culture needs to take their knee off the neck of Indigenous people in Australia and let them breathe intellectually.\"\"This is a prime opportunity now to take it to a different level,\" he added.Harris, the Wiradjuri language teacher, took part in Black Lives Matter marches in Wagga Wagga. She was skeptical about White Australia's willingness to change and address longstanding problems of discrimination and marginalization, but nevertheless saw the protests as a step forward, with both Indigenous and other Australians joining together. \"There's still a heck load of racism in Australia,\" Harris said. \"The only thing we can do is walk, and keep lifting up our people, and welcoming those who are willing to open their eyes to us.\"James Griffiths a senior producer for CNN Worldwide and author of the upcoming \"Speak Not: Empire, identity and the politics of language\" from Zed Books/Bloomsbury.",
