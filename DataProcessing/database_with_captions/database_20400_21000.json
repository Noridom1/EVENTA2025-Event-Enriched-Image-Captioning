        "content": "Moscow (CNN)It was a remarkable and unexpected reversal: On Tuesday, Russian authorities dropped a criminal case against prominent investigative reporter Ivan Golunov after a fierce backlash against his arrest caught the Kremlin off guard.Now the question for some Russians is whether to celebrate, or keep the protest momentum going.Golunov, a reporter for the independent news website Meduza, was freed from house arrest after Russia's Minister of Internal Affairs, Vladimir Kolokoltsev, announced the case was dropped because of a lack of evidence. \"According to the results of biological, forensic and fingerprint examinations and DNA testing, a decision was made to terminate the criminal prosecution of citizen Ivan Golunov due to the lack of evidence of his participation in the crime,\" Kolokoltsev said. Golunov was detained Thursday in Moscow on drugs charges his supporters said were fabricated.Read MoreThe police officers who arrested Golunov were suspended from active duty, and Kolokoltsev said he would request the dismissal of two top interior ministry officials -- chief of internal affairs at the western district of Russia, Andrei Puchkov, and head of the Moscow directorate for drug control at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Yuri Devyatkin.A Russian journalist was arrested on drug charges. The backlash has blindsided the Kremlin That in itself was an unusual turn of events: It is rare in Russia to see the authorities reverse position, particularly in the face of street protests. Last year, for instance, the Russian government rolled out deeply unpopular pension reforms, despite a wave of street demonstrations.Golunov, best known for reports on official corruption, drew support from across Russia's political spectrum after his arrest on a drugs charge. Russia's embattled political opposition rallied along with his colleagues. But it was striking to see statements of solidarity coming even from Kremlin loyalists and state media personalities.Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova expressed joy in response to the news: \"The best day. In tears. Happiness.\"\"The last time I was this happy for my country, I was strolling down Nikolskaya Street [in Moscow] during the World Cup,\" said Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Kremlin-funded network RT. Three papers ran the same headline on Monday: \"I'm/we are Ivan Golunov.Even Liza Peskova, an Instagram celebrity who is the daughter of Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, posted a photo of herself holding one of the newspaper front pages that ran in solidarity with Golunov, headlined, \"I/We are Ivan Golunov.\"Golunov meant different things for different people. For some, his case put the spotlight on police corruption, and his release was a tacit admission of a widespread police practice of planting drugs on criminal suspects.Then there was the issue of press freedom. Golunov, an investigator of municipal corruption in Moscow, plies a dangerous trade: Many Russian journalists who probe the murky affairs of local officials face intimidation, harassment and even violence. Together we did an incredible thing: We stopped the prosecution of an innocent man.\"Meduza journalistsAnd Golunov's surprise release was cause for intense speculation about the Kremlin's political calculations. Many noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin holds his annual televised call-in show next week, and the case threatened to spoil a carefully orchestrated event meant to showcase Putin as a wise and beneficent tsar solving the problems of his subjects.Dismissing the police who fabricated the case, some noted, allows Putin to contrast his own competence with the conduct of the lackluster and corrupt officials one often encounters in everyday life.Still, the news was cast by many as a victory for Russia's civil society. In a statement released after the ministry's announcement, Golunov's colleagues said they were \"glad that authorities have heard the society.\"\"This is the result of an unprecedented international campaign of journalistic and civic solidarity,\" Meduza journalists said in a statement. \"Together we did an incredible thing: We stopped the prosecution of an innocent man.\"Colleagues and supporters of Golunov gather at a court building in Moscow on Saturday. Meduza called on Golunov's supporters to opt out of a demonstration that was being planned for Wednesday in downtown Moscow, but had not received a permit.Some of the organizers said they would proceed. \"I think that canceling the March on June 12 is the wrong decision,\" said Ilya Azar, a journalist with Russia's independent Novaya Gazeta, arguing that the authorities still needed to punish those who planted drugs on Golunov and fabricated the criminal case.Golunov, for his part, said he would not take part in the march. Meeting reporters after his release from house arrest, he promised to continue the investigative work he had been doing before he was detained.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)With every French Open title comes another remarkable record for Rafael Nadal. When Nadal beat a weary Dominic Thiem 6-3 5-7 6-1 6-1 on the court he has owned since a teen, the Spaniard became the first player to ever win the same grand slam 12 times. He moved one ahead of Margaret Court's haul at the Australian Open which he matched a year ago by bettering the same Thiem in Paris. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosSo the term \"King of Clay\" just doesn't do justice to the now 18-time grand slam champion anymore. His favorite football team, Real Madrid, opts for \"Galacticos\" to describe players they frequently purchase who are seemingly out of this world.

Love at first bite...@RafaelNadal | #RG19 pic.twitter.com/rIK3FXUIvI\u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) June 9, 2019\n\nThat seems inconceivable. It is a mastery unmatched by any tennis player on any surface in any era. \"Winning a grand slam isn't easy. Winning 12 French titles is beyond belief,\" tweeted Rod Laver, who presented Nadal with the Coupe des Mousquetaires. Laver achieved the calendar year grand slam twice. Nadal improved to 93-2 at the French Open and has never lost a final. Or even been taken to five sets. Thiem and other players must have been buoyed when Nadal -- coming off another knee injury -- began the clay-court swing poorly by his standards. He admitted to doing some serious soul searching at the Barcelona Open in April after being, atypically, negative on court in an opening round win. \"After the first round in Barcelona, I was able to stay alone for a couple of hours in a room and think about it and think about what's going on, what I need to do,\" he said. \"And (there were) a couple of issues that I had to decide, no? One possibility was to stop for a while and recover my body. \"And the other was to change drastically my attitude and my mentality to play the next couple of weeks.\"He picked the latter and beat Novak Djokovic in the Rome final last month for a considerable boost. Roland Garros was the grander exclamation mark. Within two of FedererFor the first time, Nadal pulled to within two grand slams of Roger Federer, the man he eased past in their headline semifinal Friday. If the 37-year-old Swiss doesn't win another major, Nadal could get to 20 just by wracking up more victories at Roland Garros. As he has said before, though, he doesn't obsess about equaling Federer. \"I am not very worried about this stuff, no?\" Nadal said. \"You can't be frustrated all the time because the neighbor has a bigger house than you or a bigger TV or better garden. That's not the way that I see life.\"Bravo @ThiemDomi on another great year at Roland-Garros!#RG19 pic.twitter.com/ITrCR2nJpi\u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) June 9, 2019\n\nFor the third straight season, the unfortunate Thiem lost to Nadal at the French Open after defeating him in a warmup.  He thus knows first hand the difference between trying to overcome Nadal over three sets compared to five. That Thiem was able to make matters competitive is a credit to him -- three of the four sets were close, regardless of the final two set scores. Thiem ended the tournament playing four straight days thanks to the rain in what was a huge disadvantage for the bottom half of the draw. Who knows what would have happened if he had the usual day off between the semifinal and final.Thiem's coach, Nicolas Massu, asked organizers to push the final to Monday to level the playing field but was told there was \"no chance.\" Rafael Nadal sunk to the clay after beating Dominic Thiem to win the French Open. Indeed, Saturday was about the perfect day for Nadal. Thiem battled for an intense three hours against world No. 1 Djokovic in the completion of their weather affected semifinal -- and won. Unquestionably he would have preferred Thiem to Djokovic, one of those two players to have derailed Nadal at the French Open and the left-hander's toughest all-time opponent. Great effort from ThiemAnd especially a weakened Thiem. Thiem, very well liked among his peers, is never one for excuses but admitted to feeling the effects of Saturday's thriller. \"It was a grand slam final, so I didn't feel tired in the match,\" he said. \"But at the same time, a match like yesterday, beating Novak over two days with all the interruptions, it leaves traces on the body and also on the mind. That's 100%.\"Thiem -- who stretched Nadal to a five-set epic last year at the US Open -- said Saturday adrenaline would aid in his efforts to put up a fight against the spin master. It wasn't simply fighting talk. He possesses a brilliant combination of pace and power and more than once in the early going in intermittent sun, Thiem commendably chased balls and offered up defensive lobs to neutralize the Mallorcan. His first set performance gave no hint of the struggle with Djokovic. Thiem trailed by an early break in the 2018 final but on this occasion, the 25-year-old broke first for 3-2 courtesy of his powerhouse forehand. JUST WATCHEDHow clay helped make NadalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow clay helped make Nadal 03:42What wasn't in the script was to get broken in the next game. It was a momentum changing two games but an even more important one was to come.  In an extended 10-minute game, Nadal saved a break point to hold for 4-3. Reeling, Thiem dropped serve, the game highlighted by Nadal chasing a fine Thiem drop shot and then replying with his own drop shot winner. First set keyNadal was 84-0 at the French Open when winning the first set so it spelled big trouble for Thiem.Fans on Philippe Chatrier took turns chanting \"Rafa, Rafa\" and \"Dominic, Dominic,\" and were rewarded with another sparkling set. Not phased by losing a 55-minute first set, Thiem's level didn't diminish. Both men held comfortably without a break point in sight until Thiem conjured two in the 12th game. And when Nadal sent his backhand long, he claimed his first set in their four Roland Garros duels. Could he keep it going? Further, would Nadal respond?

After a lengthy bathroom break, Nadal stormed to the first 11 points and tallied a double break advantage with a reflex forehand pass. The spectators loved it and so did Nadal, who produced a multiple fist pump. \"After the first two sets, I dropped a little bit my level\" and then Nadal \"stepped on me,\" conceded Thiem. Nadal was now rolling, orchestrating a stunning backhand drop volley that earned a thumbs up from the Austrian. He won 23 of 27 net points, often approaching behind potent groundstrokes.  \"Almost everybody will tell you that he's one of the best volleyers of our game,\" Thiem said, before jokingly adding \"because the last time he missed a volley was maybe seven years ago.\" He wrapped up the third with a sizzling 10 winners and two unforced errors. One felt the exertions of the last few days were finally catching up to Thiem by this point but the fourth set wasn't a formality. Nadal saved a break point in the first game with a trademark forehand winner, broke and saved two more break points to lead 3-0. A thinkerFor many Nadal's power and resilience are what catches the eye. But he is a thinker, too. On the first break point at 30-40, he struck a good serve to Thiem's backhand and the return went into the net. On the second, he changed direction and went down the middle with pace to prompt a forehand miscue. Nadal sealed the final on the stroke of three hours when another Thiem return sailed long. Follow @cnnsport\n\nHe sunk to the clay, on his back, before exchanging a hug with Thiem. The two share a healthy respect.

He's best known for the 14 years he spent with the Boston Red Sox, where he helped end the so-called Curse of the Bambino by winning the World Series in 2004. He nabbed two other World Series rings in 2007 and 2013, and was named the 2013 World Series MVP. He retired in 2016, and will be eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame at the end of 2021 (spoiler alert: He's gonna make it) . During his storied career, Ortiz hit 541 home runs, landing him at No. 17 on the list of all-time home run leaders. Because of his powerful left-handed swing and his reputation as a true sports folk hero, Ortiz is often compared to Babe Ruth. He was there for Boston in one of its darkest hoursGiven his stats, it's no surprise Ortiz is a legend among legends in Boston and the region. But his connection to the city runs deeper than dingers and rings. In 2013, months before the Red Sox made their push for World Series glory, the city was shaken by the Boston Marathon bombings. Before playing at Fenway Park for the first time after the tragedy, Ortiz took the field and delivered an ad hoc speech that's already gone down in Boston history.\"This jersey that we wear today, it doesn't say 'Red Sox.'

Nadal has won 82 tournaments, collecting close to $110m in prize money.But just the phrase \"Federer-Nadal\" evokes an era of unprecedented duopoly, the seemingly effortless style of the Swiss in stark contrast with the muscular, brooding intensity of the Spaniard.When Nadal arrives to play at Wimbledon later this month he will no doubt be constantly reminded that he can move to within one grand slam of Federer.Time is on his side, of course. At 33 he is four years Federer's junior, with the Swiss admitting retirement is around the corner. And few would doubt Nadal's ability to win another two or three French Open titles should his body remain strong.Federer reigns supreme at Wimbledon, however, his record eight titles the perfect reposte to those who might seek to diminish Nadal's legacy because of his domination of the French Open.JUST WATCHEDRoger Federer muses on retirement planningReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoger Federer muses on retirement planning 03:18Injury concernsBut Nadal's biggest battle may be with himself. The Spaniard estimates that he has been forced to miss around 15 grand slam tournaments through injury. His battle to overcome the chronic knee problems that have plagued his career has been well documented, but the rest of his body has suffered too.Last year, Nadal's uncle Toni, his long-time coach, told reporters his nephew had been \"living with pain and painkillers since 2005.\"The past year has been particularly difficult for Nadal. He was forced to retire from his US Open semifinal against Juan Martin del Potro last September with a knee injury and did not play again for the rest of the year.He underwent ankle surgery in November but returned to make the final of the Australian Open where he lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.There was further anguish at Indian Wells in March where a knee problem forced to him to pull out of his semifinal clash with Federer.READ: Barty wins first grand slam title READ: 'Unfair and inappropriate' change to women's schedule criticizedNadal then took a five-week break before playing three clay-court tournaments in preparation for the French Open.His demolition of Federer in the semifinal suggested he was firing on all cylinders again.\"He makes you feel uncomfortable the way he defends the court and plays on clay,\" Federer told reporters afterward. \"There is nobody who even plays remotely close to him.\"I don't even know who I need to go search for to go practice with somebody who plays like him. I was thinking that during the match. It's just amazing how he plays from deep and then is able to bounce back and forth from the baseline. It's just quite interesting.\"     Soul searchingNadal's Paris success appears even more remarkable given Nadal's omission that he was forced to \"drastically change\" his attitude after losing to Dominic Thiem in the semifinal of the Barcelona Open in April.\"Mentally, I lost a little bit of energy, because I had too many issues in a row,\" he told reporters in Paris.\"Mentally I was not enjoying. Too much worried about the health and, being honest, too negative.\"After the first round in Barcelona, I was able to stay alone for a couple of hours in the room and think about it and think about what's going on, what I need to do.\"One possibility would have been stop for a while and recover my body. And the other was change drastically my attitude and my mentality to play the next couple of weeks.\"That change proved to be the correct call for Nadal, who appears to have taken a leaf out of Federer's book in managing his workload. The Swiss opted to miss the French Open from 2016 to 2018 to prepare his mind and body for Wimbledon, which he last won in 2017.  Three's a crowdNovak Djokovic won Wimbledon last year after overcoming Rafael Nadal at the semifinal stage.But both players are acutely aware there is another threat breathing down their necks.Serbia's Djokovic has become a constant nuisance to both men's chances of further glory and has amassed 15 grand slam titles of his own.At the age of 32, Djokovic could yet leapfrog both.Between them, the trio have won 53 of the last 64 men's grand slam singles titles and all of the last 10.For now, though, all eyes will move to Wimbledon where Djokovic is the defending champion.Nadal has not won at Wimbledon since 2010, and he has since only won three grand slam titles outside of Paris, with victories at the US Open in 2010, 2013 and 2017.Visit our tennis page for more tennis storiesThe Spaniard lost to Djokovic in the Wimbledon semifinal last year and says he has been \"very close\" to winning another title on the lawns of southwest London.\"As everybody knows, I love to play on grass,\" he added in Paris. \"And as everybody knows, I am not able to play so many weeks in a row like I did 10 years ago, eight years ago.\"So I will not play before Wimbledon. The experience says that having the right preparation then, practicing well, and maybe a couple of matches, I don't know, before there.\"The history book beckons, but which of the big two -- make that three -- finishes on top at the end of their careers is yet to be decided.The \"Federer-Nadal\" era is not over yet.",

        "content": "(CNN)A British woman who served almost 10 years in prison for killing her abusive husband with a hammer will not face a retrial, a judge has ruled, after her murder conviction was quashed in February.Georgina Challen, who goes by Sally, said she killed her husband, Richard, in August 2010 after he subjected her to years of emotional abuse. The following year, Challen, 65, was convicted of his murder and jailed for life.In February, London's Court of Appeal quashed her conviction and ordered a new trial, the Press Association reported, citing new information about Challen's psychiatric state when she killed her husband. Ireland criminalizes emotional abuse with new domestic violence law Challen, who pleaded not guilty to the murder charge but admitted manslaughter, was subsequently released on bail ahead of a second trial scheduled to begin on July 1.At a hearing at London's Old Bailey Friday, Judge Andrew Edis accepted her plea of manslaughter, sparing her a second murder trial, the Press Assocation reported. Prosecutor Caroline Carberry said the decision was based on a psychiatric report that found Challen was suffering from an \"adjustment disorder\" at the time of her husband's death.Read MoreShe will be sentenced for manslaughter later Friday. Challen's heavily publicized case drew attention to coercive control as a form of domestic abuse. It became a criminal offense in England and Wales in 2015, and earlier this year in Scotland.Teresa Parker, head of communication for the UK charity Women's Aid, told CNN that her case \"displays the long-term impact that coercive control has on survivors and the long-term trauma it can cause. It underpins the vast majority of domestic abuse and the term helps to explain the dynamics of power and control within abusive relationships.\" According to the campaign group Justice for Women, which supported her appeal, Challen said her husband bullied, humiliated and repeatedly cheated on her, forbidding her from socializing without him. He also controlled the couple's finances. On August 14, 2010, Challen killed him with a hammer in home in Surrey, southern England, planning to kill herself afterward by jumping from the Beachy Head cliffs. As a family we are overjoyed at todays verdict and that it has brought an end to the suffering we have endured together for the past 9 years.Our story has become the landmark case society needs to recognise the true severity of coercive control.#SallyChallen#CoerciveControl\u2014 David Challen (@David_Challen) June 7, 2019\n\nAfter her murder conviction, her sons, David and James Challen and lawyer Harriet Wistrich, who co-founded Justice for Women, launched an appeal for her release, arguing that the abuse she withstood \"was not properly recognized\" in her initial trial.David wrote on Twitter Friday, \"As a family we are overjoyed at todays verdict and that it has brought an end to the suffering we have endured together for the past 9 years.\"\"Our story has become the landmark case society needs to recognise the true severity of coercive control,\" he said. Teresa Parker called the judge's ruling \"fantastic news,\" adding, \"We now need everyone working in the criminal justice system to receive regular, up-to-date training on what coercive control is and how to use the legislation.\"",

Albert Grannon, 77, from the village of Sproatley in East Yorkshire in northern England, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and possession of a firearm without a certificate. His grandson, Stanley Metcalf, died after he was shot on July 26, 2018. Grannon entered his plea at Hull Crown Court and will be sentenced following presentence reports at a later date.\"This was an extremely tragic incident where a 6-year-old boy who had all his life ahead of him had it cut so needlessly short,\" said Detective Inspector Rebecca Dickinson in a statement. Dickinson led the investigation for Humberside Police.\"It makes it all the more tragic that it was a member of his own family who was ultimately responsible for his untimely death,\" she said. Read MoreAn inquest at Hull Coroner's Court heard that the boy died after suffering a pellet gun injury to the abdomen, the Press Association news agency reported. In a statement given after Stanley's death, his family described him as \"vibrant and full of energy.\"  Dickinson said she was pleased that Grannon admitted his guilt and \"faced up to the enormity of his actions.\"\"Up to now he has shown no real remorse for what happened,\" she wrote.Dickinson said that Stanley has a twin sister, Elsie, and the two were \"inseparable.\"\"I can only imagine what she will feel like now and when she reaches any milestones in her life, knowing that she should be sharing them with Stanley,\" she wrote. \"There are no winners in this at all. It has been an extremely upsetting case to investigate for all my officers.\" The PA reported that Grannon was granted conditional bail, and sentencing was adjourned until July 2.Judge Peter Kelson told Grannon: \"It is important I make clear to you the mere fact I am ordering a pre-sentence report and renewing your bail should not be taken by you as any indication as to the likely sentence.\"This case, while tragic, is very serious and it's entirely possible that a prison sentence will follow, and you must prepare for that.\"",

I hope to arrive (in France) in the best condition possible. You never know what can happen but I'm working hard to represent my country well.\"Read MoreChile qualified for France 2019 with a 4-0 win over Argentina that earned it second place at last year's Copa America Femenina, behind only South America's dominant force, Brazil.It was the first time Chile had ever hosted the competition and in front of an 18,200 sellout crowd in La Serena, a city 470 kilometers north of Santiago, players and fans celebrated the historic achievement of these women long into the night.\"It was very emotional,\" Endler recalls. \"The stadiums were full supporting us all the time. It was really pleasing to have been there and to have shared that experience with my teammates. \"I think everyone will remember those moments forever, they were truly lovely.\"Christiane Endler celebrates Chile's qualification to a maiden Women's World Cup.READ: The world of women's football, as told by the players themselvesREAD: Women's World Cup 2019 -- The most important in history'I didn't even know it existed'Growing up, Endler never dared dream she would achieve so much as a footballer. Her first memories of football are kicking a ball around with her older brother in their childhood home. She credits him with being the biggest influence on her as a footballer, instilling a love of the sport in her from an early age.Despite her passion, there was very little, if any, opportunity for girls and women to play football in Chile, Endler says, and even fewer opportunities to watch it.\"I never imagined reaching so far because I didn't even know that important women's football (championships) existed,\" she explains. \"That they played important tournaments like the Champions League or professional domestic leagues at the time.\"In Chile we never had a reference in women's football, somebody who had left and tried their luck outside. There was very little that was known but once it started growing, we saw that this reality existed and we could achieve things in women's football.\"It was only when she started attending a German high school -- Endler's father is German -- that she was able to properly play football with some structure and, such were her talents, played both as a goalkeeper and a striker.READ: From nude calendars to title contendersREAD: Japan's remarkable 2011 Women's World Cup win in the aftermath of disasterBut given the lack of participants in women's football \"we just had to play with boys because there was no other option,\" she recalls.Endler eventually decided to dedicate herself to becoming a goalkeeper and in 2008 was rewarded with a call up to represent Chile in the Under-20 Women's World Cup.Chile played a friendly last year against No. 1 ranked country USWNT.That the tournament was hosted on home soil only added to its significance. For many in the country, this was the first time they had ever been exposed to women's football.And for the young women taking part, it was the first time they had been treated as professionals.\"We had great preparation, a full year training and dedicating ourselves exclusively to that event,\" she recalls.Endler was just 17 years old at the time and although Chile didn't make it out of the group stages, that squad still made history.\"It was incredible to play in the first Women's World Cup that Chile had ever competed in, at any age group,\" she says. \"In Chile, with the support of so many people, the stadiums were always full. For me, it will be an experience that I will never forget and has been one of the best I've had in my life.\"I did quite well,\" she adds humbly. \"I had a lot of recognition from different parts and they also called me from a university in the US to continue playing and study at the same time.\"In that moment I realized I could make a career from this and maybe dedicate myself to being a professional footballer and making a living from it.\"Best in Spain, best in FranceJust three years later, Endler won the Copa Libertadores -- the South American equivalent of the Champions League and the most prestigious club trophy on the continent -- and placed herself on the radar on some of Europe's top clubs.'I was outraged by the lack of respect' -- The female footballers who fought for change in South AmericaIn 2014 she earned a move to Chelsea Ladies but a succession of injuries hampered her progression and ability to challenge for a place in the first team.After just one season in London, she returned to Chile with former club Colo-Colo, not only to earn some playing time but to also rediscover her passion for a sport she had started to fall out of love with.But it would be her next move to Europe that would be the first real step on her path to becoming one of the most highly-rated goalkeepers in the world.Playing for Valencia in 2016-17, Endler earned Spain's Zamora trophy for being the goalkeeper to have conceded the least goals during the season.She let in just 11 goals in the 30-game campaign and for much of the season Valencia was competing at the top of the league with powerhouses Atletico Madrid and Barcelona.READ: France, the heartbeat of women's footballREAD: The match that changed women's football\"For us it was an achievement for the club as a whole, not only for me,\" she says. \"Because Valencia was not one of the biggest clubs and we were fighting at the top of the table. It was a great season.\"Her performances after just one season convinced PSG Feminines to sign her as part of the club's ambitious new project to try and challenge perennial champion Lyon, not only for the French league but the Champions League too.Christiane Endler playing for PSG during the Women's Champions League quarterfinal against Chelsea.In Endler's first year in Paris, the club won the French Cup -- only the second major title in its history -- and this season ran Lyon close, taking the title race to the penultimate day of the season.After finishing second in the league and reaching the Champions League semifinals, the 27-year-old was voted the best goalkeeper in France by her fellow professionals to cap another fine season in Europe.\"It makes me very happy,\" she says. \"The votes come from the players and I'm happy that they recognize my and rate me in that way. It makes you feel like you are doing things well and that you are important to the team. It's a great award.READ: 'It's way more than football' -- Jamaica's remarkable journey to France 2019READ: 'Football is life' -- Nigeria's plan to become a force in women's football\"Unfortunately, this year we (PSG) didn't win a single title but I think with the change of coach and with the new players who are all very young, we are adapting and preparing to hopefully achieve good things next year,\" she adds, referring to Olivier Echouafni's appointment in 2018.\"But I think in general they have been two very good years.\"In Chile's first World Cup match against Sweden, Endler will come up against PSG teammate and good friend Hanna Glas. She admits competing against someone she has trained and played alongside all season will be an unusual experience, but it's one she is relishing.\"We have jokes between us but we are all very focused, preparing ourselves in the best way to arrive at the World Cup in the best condition,\" Endler says. \"We have a great relationship and it is nice to face people that you already know have a friendship with.\"Christiane Endler captained Chile to second place at last year's Copa America.Role modelHaving achieved so much already in her career, Endler is acutely aware of her position as a role model and how important it is for her to be the benchmark for young girls in Chile that she never had growing up.Later this year, she will open up her third all-female football school in the country and has visions of opening more in the future.Though there have already been several talented players to have arrived at the schools, the idea is to just give girls a place to play football rather than trying to find the next star of the national team.\"The idea arose because I lived in Chile and despite the fact that they have opened schools and that today there are places -- but not many -- to practice, there was not a football school that was 100% female,\" she explains.\"We feel a responsibility to help the girls who come from below [poorer in society], who do not have the chance to play football and open doors for them with the schools and giving my country a good name outside of Chile. I feel like a reference and I hope to be a positive reference for them.\"It feels like doors are opening for other women to realize their dreams and not only in football. There are things that can be achieved with hard work and effort and I think we can help many women, to fulfill their dreams.\"",

I couldn't see where he was, as I was too busy trying to keep my car on track without crashing and I didn't squeeze him on purpose.\"I think given the way things went this weekend and even though our rivals' race pace was very strong, we deserved the win, and I get the impression that lots of the spectators here today at the circuit agree with me.\"Vettel swapped the number boards after the Canadian Grand Prix.

Though they had not won, they had created history.The scoreline would suggest that the goalless draw between Japan and Argentina was a dull stalemate, but that would not do justice to what Argentina achieved on a balmy Parisian evening in the Parc de Princes.Argentina had lost all six of its previous World Cup games by an aggregate score of 33-2. Indeed, the underdogs were playing a Japan side ranked seventh in the world, 30 places above Argentina in FIFA's rankings.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresAn indefatigable spirit -- and Japan's bluntness in attack -- ensured that the South Americans came away from a Women's World Cup match with a point for the first time in their history.Read MoreArgentina's players celebrate securing their first ever point in Women's World Cup history\"First off, I congratulate my players,\" said coach Carlos Borrello. \"The fact they see through your game plan makes you, as a coach, very satisfied.

READ: England vs. Scotland breaks UK TV viewing recordREAD: Chilean goalkeeper Christine Endler is opening doors for other womenThere were cries of \"Argentina, Argentina\" from pockets of the 25,055 fans in the Parc des Princes, and decibels rose every time the Argentines entered opposition territory, but Argentina -- competing in a Women's World Cup for only the third time -- never looked like taking the three points. A draw, however, was surprise enough.It was a disappointing result for Japan -- a finalist in 2015 and champion in 2011. Asako Takakura's youthful side created plenty of opportunities in the second half but lacked a clinical edge in front of goal. The other game in Group D took place on Sunday, with England taking top spot after defeating Scotland 2-1 in Nice. Canada off to winning startMonday's second match saw Canada defeat Cameroon 1-0 in Marseille courtesy of a Kadeisha Buchanan header.The Canadians controlled proceedings throughout the opening stages and were rewarded for their dominance on the stroke of halftime when center-half Buchanan met a Janine Beckie corner at the back post, planting her header into the ground and past goalkeeper Ngo Ndom.Cameroon's best chance came in near-identical fashion when Claudine Meffometou met a corner midway through the second half, but her shot bounced just wide.  Canada's Kadeisha Buchanan celebrates her country's first goal at the 2019 World Cup. Having enjoyed plenty of possession, Canada -- the world's fifth best side according to FIFA's rankings -- will have wanted more to show for its efforts. Star striker Christine Sinclair had an opportunity to add to her prolific tally of 281 internationals goals, but failed to bundle the ball over the line late on. Four more goals in France would see Sinclair surpass Abby Wambach at the top of the international scoring charts.Nevertheless, it was a winning start for Kenneth Heiner-M\u00f8ller's side, which is expected to progress from a group including New Zealand and the Netherlands. Those two teams meet in Le Havre on Wednesday.",

But Schneider didn't start until she was well into her teens.\"I started when I was 14 or 15, and we were at a tournament and the coach threw me in the goal probably because of my height and I ended up being pretty decent at it,\" Schneider told the Jamaica Observer. She was clearly more than \"pretty decent\" -- Schneider went on to play in Elite Clubs National League at age 16. Within three years, she earned a spot on the senior team and played for Jamaica's youth national teams.She's still in college. Schneider just wrapped up her junior year at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, where she's studying exercise science.Although she initially wasn't even sure if she was good enough to play at the collegiate level, the 5-foot-10-inch player started all 19 games as a college freshman. She is only the second goalkeeper in the school's history to play every second in a season, according to her school profile. She ranked No. 4 in the Colonial Athletic Association with a 1.13 goals against average and stopped 74.1% of the shots she faced. She's from Dayton, New Jersey. Schneider's grandparents on her mother's side were born in Jamaica. Her dad, who coaches soccer, is German.She's part of a history-making team. Known as the \"Reggae Girlz,\" the women's Jamaica National Team is the first team from a Caribbean nation to qualify for a Women's World Cup. Schneider rejected her first offer to play for Jamaica in 2015, the Jamaica Observer reported. At the time, she wanted to focus on enrolling in college. In 2016, she accepted a second offer to represent Jamaica during the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Under-17 Championship in Grenada.She was named player of the match last year. Despite her young age, Schneider was selected to play for Jamaica during the 2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship. At the tournament, Schneider made an epic six saves to help Jamaica notch an upsetting 1-0 win over one of the tournament favorites, Costa Rica.",

We kissed, we were laughing.

I said to the police that I want them to sit down and explain to me what the problem is. I want them to talk to me,\" Parkinson said, adding: \"We need to campaign for more LGBT-inclusive lessons in education. We need to educate people that we're not outsiders because we're gay, so they don't grow up thinking that being heterosexual is the norm and that being gay is something wrong that needs to be violently and aggressively corrected.\"Last month, a lesbian couple were beaten in a homophobic assault on a London bus.

        "content": "(CNN)Sometimes, the only way to get noticed is to be controversial, to be out of the ordinary. Stir it up, cause a fuss, rip up the rule book and watch the masses react. In the autumn of 1999, Katrina Boyd and her teammates assembled at the Australian Institute of Sport for a photo shoot they all knew would make headlines. There was a storm brewing in the Australian capital and the country's women's football team was in the eye of it. \"We wanted to rock the boat,\" Boyd tells CNN Sport. Follow @cnnsport\n\nWith a home Olympics on the horizon, Australia's women's football team, better known as the Matildas, needed money to help prepare for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity on home soil. Though they were international athletes, for the majority of players it was a struggle to work, train and survive. There were no sponsors, few fans, and little money to be made from the beautiful game.Just months earlier they had competed at the 1999 Women's World Cup, a tournament still regarded as instrumental in the advancement of the women's game, to little fanfare. The Matildas needed to, somehow, enter the nation's consciousness. Read MoreThe solution? After a seed was sown at a boozy party in 1999, 12 players agreed to pose nude for a black and white calendar which would go on sale in December of that year. \n\nI did a full frontal.People were up in arms\nKatrina Boyd\nNudity did not bother Boyd, who would go on to become Miss August in the calendar that would sell, in her words, \"stloads.\" As she waited for her turn to be photographed, she seated herself on the stage and made idle chit-chat with the photographer to pass away the time. That she was naked was of little concern to the-then 27-year-old. \"It was all done very tastefully, at no time did we feel preyed upon, no-one felt that we were just objects,\" Boyd, speaking from her Brisbane home, remembers. \"It was no different to the changing rooms. Some girls would shower in their bras and undies and those sorts of girls would never put themselves on the calendar. Pretty much the girls who were in the calendar were the same girls who didn't mind getting their gear off, having a shower, getting dressed and moving on.\"These weren't coy images. There were full frontal poses, no props hiding breasts. Needless to say, the press conference for the launch of the calendar was packed with journalists. \"Whatever next?\" one Sydney columnist wrote, according to Sports Illustrated. \"A lap dance of honor at the Olympics? A free trip to a massage parlor with every season ticket?\"\n\nI never cared in the slightest that males were paying more attention to us because we did a nude calendar\nKatrina Boyd\nAccording to reports, the original print run of 5,000 copies was increased to 45,000 on the strength of pre-publication publicity.There were those who argued that women should not have to use their bodies to sell their sport, let alone to raise funds to represent their country. But the players themselves believed they were portraying images of strong, powerful women. READ: England v Scotland: The most anticipated World Cup matchStriker Boyd made 28 appearances for the Matildas. At the time, Boyd told journalists \"if people want to call it porn, that's their problem,\" and 20 years on the Australian, who describes herself as an \"out there kind of person,\" still has no regrets, even though it was her picture which proved to be one of the most controversial. \"I did a full frontal. People were up in arms,\" says Boyd, now a dog trainer. \"The photographer just said: '(Are) there things you're happy to do?' I was like 'whatever' and they said, 'how about you just stand?' and I went 'yeah, go for it.' I just don't care about nudity. \"It rocked the boat a little bit over here, but we did get a bit of coverage and the word Matilda started to mean something, though probably not for the reasons we wanted.\"It was a bit of fun, it got us our 15 minutes of fame which, for us putting in a lot of groundwork, training hard, doing everything, was nice. \"I wasn't surprised by the negative reaction. That would still happen today. We were more surprised by how much people were into it, but half of them were blokes, of course. \"I never cared in the slightest that males were paying more attention to us because we did a nude calendar. That was just a given. I'm pretty laid-back about the whole thing.\"\n\nWhat happened after the calendar was more of a negative\nKatrina Boyd\nBoyd and her contemporaries grew up in an Australia where there was no financial reward for its female footballers. When she first joined the national set-up, she had to pay AUS $500 [$346] to train with the squad at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Early into Boyd's international career, the Australian Women's Soccer Association (AWSA) began to take care of travel costs for the squad, but there were still occasions when she and her teammates would have to decline playing international football purely for financial reasons. \"You didn't get any money while you were away,\" explains Boyd, who worked in corporate banking during the majority of her time with the Matildas, often taking unpaid leave to represent the green and gold. \"My partner had to pay for every trip. She's nine years older than me and captained Australia. There were amazing players back in her time who couldn't do anything because they couldn't afford to do it.\"READ: Germany teenager scores sensational goal on World Cup debutAustralia's women's soccer team poses with a nude calendar produced to promote women's footballAgainst such a backdrop, profits from what proved to be an in-demand calendar would have helped the Matildas focus more on football in an Olympic year, but according to Boyd they received little financial reward for their efforts. \"What happened after the calendar was more of a negative because we didn't get the funds from this calendar which we were supposed to,\" she says. But the calendar certainly put the Matildas on the map. \"You could get in any cab in Sydney and the cabbie would have heard of the Matildas, because of this calendar,\" Moya Dodd, a former Matildas player, told ABC News last year. A reported 10,000 fans watched the Matildas play China at the Sydney Football Stadium in June for an Olympic warm-up match -- but two defeats and a draw at Sydney 2000 meant the hosts did not progress beyond the group stages. Thereafter, interest in the team began to drop.\"Did we get what we ultimately wanted out of it? Probably no,\" admits Boyd.\"Something like that is never going to be long-term. We couldn't back up that calendar with our football at the time. We were never in a position to throw out a massive calendar like that and also back it up on the field. I guess that would've been the ultimate, if we could've still got results and had that calendar.\" The Matildas' calendar was a fleeting solution to a decades-old problem. Recognition for female footballers. After all, the opening paragraph in the Sun-Herald following Australia's first official international fixture on October 7, 1979, read: \"The first thing you notice about a women's soccer match is the players. They ARE feminine.\"As was the case around the world, women's football in Australia suffered from chauvinistic brush-offs for almost a century.Though around 10,000 fans reportedly  watched North Brisbane defeat South Brisbane 2-0 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in 1921 when the men were away at war, it wasn't until the 1970s, with the foundation of a national championship and the AWSA, that the building blocks for today's successes were laid. READ: How Bob Marley's daughter helped save women's football in JamaicaMatildas fans show their support during the Cup of Nations match between Australia and Argentina at AAMI Park in Melbourne, Australia, in March.These days the Matildas, a youthful, talented and diverse side, are among the most popular teams in the country and France 2019 is widely regarded as the country's best chance to date of winning a Women's World Cup. But it has been a long road. It wasn't until 1994 that Australia played an international outside Asia, and not until 2007 did the Matildas record a first Women's World Cup win. Indeed, it was the publication of the 2003 Crawford Report, the federal government's independent soccer inquiry, when the AWSA and the Australian Soccer Federation (ASF) -- organizations which were often at loggerheads -- came together under the banner of the Football Federation Australia (FFA) that matters gradually began to improve for the Matildas. Four years ago they became the first Australian team to win a knockout match at a World Cup when they defeated Brazil 1-0 in the last 16 in Canada and the country took notice. \"All of a sudden the media started to get involved and finally recognized there was value in women's sport and it just grew from there,\" Greg Downes -- the author of a thesis entitled \"An oral history of women's football in Australia\" -- tells CNN Sport.On returning from North America, the team continued to make headlines by going on strike over equal pay -- they were earning on average AUS $20,000 [$13,876] a year compared with the Socceroos' average of AUS $200,000 [$138,760] per man.The move paid dividends as a baseline salary of AUS $40,000 [$27,752] a year was agreed with the FFA, giving players an opportunity to earn a living from the game. With the freedom to devote themselves to their sport, the players' performances improved while societal attitudes also changed, giving rise to record crowds and increased sponsorship. \"Success breeds a lot of that and a lot of the players have become household names,\" adds Downes. READ: The female footballers who fought for change in South AmericaKerr poses with a fan after the 2019 Cup of Nations match between Australia and  South Korea in Brisbane, Australia. The most recognizable player in the current Matildas squad is captain Sam Kerr, voted the fourth best player in the world at last year's Ballon d'Or awards. The striker, who made her international debut at  just 15, plays for Perth Glory in the W-League -- the top-division in Australian women's soccer which was formed in 2008 -- and Chicago Red Stars in the NWSL. She is ruthless in front of goal and prolific, last year collecting her second consecutive golden boot in both leagues. In 2018, she was named Young Australian of the Year and earlier this year it was announced the striker would be the face of Nike in Australia, fronting the company's billboard and TV campaigns in the country in a deal which reportedly makes Kerr -- who has signed a AUS $400,000 [$278,000] contract with the FFA -- the first female Australian soccer player to earn more than AUS $1million a year [$690,000]. The 25-year-old talks of a significant increase in interest in her and her teammates since the 2015 Women's World Cup. \"There's been a lot more media ... and that's been well-earned,\" she tells CNN Sport. \"We're really lucky that Australia is behind us and we've been playing to packed stadiums. The interest in the team from the last World Cup to now is day and night.\"The Matildas' status in their homeland is a \"quantum change,\" says Downes, from the days of posing for a nude calendar. \"It's an unbelievable change. It's been a long, hard push. A lot of time, many years working two jobs with families just to play for Australia, now they're at a stage where most of the top Matildas are earning up to AUS $100,000 [$69,000] a year, if they're playing overseas as well as the W-league.\" Women's football is one of Australia's largest growing sports. A recent AusPlay survey said more than 396,000 girls and women played football, which it said was the most popular organized sport in the country. Increased participation and media coverage unsurprisingly comes on the back of unprecedented success.In 2017 a first victory over three-time world champions the US made the world sit up and take notice as the Matildas captured the Tournament of Nations. Earlier this year the Matildas won the inaugural Women's Cup of Nations. Matters have improved off the field too, with a collective bargaining deal agreed in 2017 between the PFA and FFA ensuring all W-League players would earn a minimum of at least AUS $10,000 [$6,938] for the 2017/18 season and AUS $12,200 [$8,325] for the 2018/19 season.Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosAustralia celebrate winning the  Women's Cup of Nations in March 2019. Progress has not been a continuous upward curve, however. There has been upheaval this year. Alen Stajci was sacked as head coach in January and replaced by Ante Milicic and results in the buildup to France 2019 have been poor, with the team suffering a 3-0 defeat to the Netherlands on Saturday. But the notion of Australia winning the Women's World Cup is no longer fanciful, while hosting the tournament is also a possibility with the federal government investing AUS $5 million [$3.47m] in the country's bid to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. \"Things still have to shift. The mentality, particularly here in Australia, is all about the boys, but our girls are doing much better than the boys,\" says Boyd, who will be traveling to France next month to support the team.\"The girls are making money that we, in our lifetime, would never have made and they've got opportunities like never before. It's absolutely fantastic. \"The Matildas will win the World Cup. Will it be this time around? I don't know, they might get pretty damned close, but they will be the best team in the world at some point and that was always going to happen. We just had to go through what we went through.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)To many an outsider, Britain seems to have been on drugs during its often farcical attempts to leave the European Union. Now it seems to have been proven as the race to become the next Conservative prime minister sees an avalanche of mea culpas on past drug use. The past two months have seen former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab admitting to have dabbled with recreational cannabis, followed by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt saying he quaffed a marijuana-laced drink while backpacking in India. Fellow Cabinet minister Rory Stewart joined the fray at the end of May, confessing to smoking opium at a wedding in Iran.Theresa May's days are ending but the Brexit fantasy lives onThe most recent admission came this weekend when Michael Gove admitted to taking drugs on several occasions when he was a \"young journalist\" two decades ago. He called it a \"mistake\" that he \"deeply\" regrets. In a released excerpt from a book on Gove's life, the Environment Secretary is said to have confessed, while being quizzed by his leadership team, to consuming cocaine.Read More\"He was firmly instructed not to give that answer in public, and told instead to fall back on the words (former Prime Minister David) Cameron had used when he was running for leader, namely that politicians are entitled to a private life before entering politics,\" the Daily Mail reported off a passage from Owen Bennett's book \"Michael Gove: A Man In A Hurry.\"Asked directly by the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday if he had ever taken cocaine and if he knew it was a crime, Gove responded: \"Yes it was a crime, it was a mistake, I deeply regret it.\"Gove said he was \"fortunate\" he didn't go to prison. Asked if he had a cocaine \"habit\", Gove said: \"No I don't believe it was.\"The minister, who was previously Justice Secretary, said he has a \"profound sense of regret about it all.\"Drug of the privilegedThe conventional wisdom in politics is any admission of drug-taking could finish off a person's career. But that trend has been bucked in the past few decades. Before becoming US president, Bill Clinton in 1992 tried to squirrel out of marijuana questions by saying he didn't inhale in the 1960s. Former British Prime Minister Cameron remained coy on the rumor that he had smoked a joint while at school. But cocaine is a harder drug than cannabis and has recently been blamed for a rise in violent crime in the United Kingdom. Last year, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, called middle-class cocaine users hypocrites for \"happily talking about global warming, fair trade, environmental protection and organic farming, but think there's no harm in taking a bit of cocaine,\" she said, according to The Times newspaper. Boris Johnson is front-runner for PM but he'll face the same Brexit nightmareIn the United Kingdom, addictive and expensive powder is usually considered the drug of choice among the privileged. Gove's alleged use of it \"might reinforce the idea of the millionaire conservative,\" Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, told CNN.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas admonished the \"rank hypocrisy\" of Gove, who is a former justice minister, \"while backing policies that perpetuate harm. From locking up disproportionate number of young, black men, to treating drug misuse as crime rather than health issue, prohibition fails us all,\" she said on Twitter. Past indiscretions The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, dismissed the news. \"I think people should tell us what they have done and move on in life,\" the Labour Party leader told Britain's Press Association. \"But I'm unconcerned about Michael Gove's past life or behavior, to be quite honest.\"Raab, Gove's colleague, told BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" program he did not think the revelation would affect Gove's chances in the race. \"I certainly don't see it barring him from this race in any way. I rather admire his honesty,\" he said.And Bale, the politics professor, added: \"I feel it is difficult to believe this will be a career-terminating event because there are so many other contenders who experimented when younger with soft or hard drugs.\"  Trump defied the laws of politics. Now he's trying to break the laws of economic gravity.The mixed response might be due to a move toward \"more honesty and authenticity\" in political campaigning, Bale said, adding that politicians are navigating an environment where the ease of sharing information online could be making it difficult for politicians to \"bolt the door\" on past indiscretions. Even the top contender for the Conservative Party leadership, Boris Johnson, has previously admitted to trying cocaine and cannabis when he was a teenager. The 2007 revelation in GQ magazine is just one of the litany of Johnson's admitted indiscretions that has done little to shake his popularity among Conservative voters. While it is hard to see the revelation killing off Gove's political career, it may scupper his chances among the 160,000 card-carrying members of the Conservative Party, who have the ultimate say on who will be the leader.In a statement to the Daily Mail, Gove said the decision rests in the hands of \"my colleagues in Parliament and members of the Conservative Party to decide now if I should be leader.\"\"I think all politicians have lives before politics,\" he added.But with Conservative Party members being \"older and more socially conservative than the average voter,\" Bale said, Gove might be out of luck. CNN's Sarah Dean and Kieron Mirchandani contributed to this report.",

Neighbors and fierce foes, this is a World Cup opener neither team will want to lose. Scotland, participating at the Women's World Cup for the first time, will be David to England's Goliath -- Phil Neville's team is ranked third in the world -- but as history has proved, never underestimate the Scots when beating the English is the bounty. The world's first international football match -- a men's game -- took place in 1872 between the two countries, and England vs. Scotland remains as passionate as ever, whatever the sport.  CNN Sport talked to former England stars Eni Aluko and Kelly Smith, former Manchester United boss David Moyes, and Celtic Women's captain Kelly Clark to find out what sets this fixture apart from the rest. READ: Australia - From nude calendars to Women's World Cup contendersRead MoreKelly Clark, Celtic Women's captain -- 'Whether it's the weather or sport, you just want to beat England'It's such a big fixture. At the European Championship in 2017, England beat Scotland 6-0, so the Scottish girls will want to better that. I don't think there's a bigger fixture for a Scottish player, it's the old enemy, it's who you want to play and it's who you want to beat. The buzz around Scotland for this game is different to any other game. If just feels like more. Scotland manager Shelley Kerr is one of nine female managers at France 2019.You just want to be better than England. It goes all the way back to history, when you learn about Robert the Bruce at school, and the freedom type story puts this rivalry in your head from a very young age and it doesn't end.The game in Scotland has grown a lot, even getting to the World Cup, for us to get a good result in a fixture like that the whole country would be talking about it. For the headline to be 'Scotland beat England' would just be huge in the country.  READ: Germany teenager scores sensational goal on debutEni Aluko, 102 appearances for England  --  'There's always an edge to this fixture'Striker Aluko, who currently plays for Juventus, has competed at two Women's World Cups (2007 & 2015). I have played against Scotland but always in friendly games, never in competitive ones, but even in friendlies there's always an edge to this fixture. With the history and the rivalry, it was a game taken seriously by players, by coaches and by fans. There's just that edge to it -- tackles flying in, calls to the referee. It's a game each team want to win. There are some games that very much feel like friendlies and there's rotations etc, but England versus Scotland was never that. This World Cup, generally, is going to be the best Women's World Cup in terms of the level of competitiveness between the teams. International women's football across the world is getting more professional. The fact there is a rivalry is one thing, but Scotland are also a good team. It's not really a fixture you can call and say that's a dead-cert for England. England vs. Scotland will be one of the most watched games of the World Cup and, since the draw in November, it's been one of the most highly-anticpated games of the tournament.It's a new England team, it's a much-improved Scotland team. It's a very very difficult one to call. There are many variables that means it's going to be a very tight game.Obviously, in the last tournament, the European Championships in 2017, England beat Scotland quite comprehensively and played very well in the opening game, but the Scots were without their best player, Kim Little, but she will be playing in this tournament. READ: Football is life -- the Nigerian women taking on the worldDavid Moyes, former Manchester United manager -- 'I'll be sending Phil abusive texts before the match!'Scottish football fans invading the pitch and pulling down goalposts after Scotland's men beat England 2-1 at Wembley Stadium in 1977. For years, I used to travel down to Wembley with my dad. He used to run coaches from Glasgow so we used to all go down on the buses to Wembley. I was only a young boy, I would only have been 15, and we'd all have the kit on, tartan scarves and that.At that time, Scotland had some great teams. I was fortunate enough, I'm going to say fortunate enough, to be at Wembley the day we took the crossbar down in 1977 after we beat England 2-1, though I didn't invade the pitch. The rivalry has always been big. We're always desperate for England not to be successful in Scotland and I don't think that has changed that much! But, in all seriousness, because I work in England and have had lots of England international players, I was always pleased when one of my players was capped by England, or called up into the international squad.Moyes, then manager of Manchester United (R), with then assistant coach Phil Neville, who is now England Women's manager.It's great that Shelley Kerr [Scotland Women's head coach] has got the Scottish team so far. We want to boost the women's game, which is greatly improving. They are beginning to get a lot more coverage.He's one of my ex-players [Moyes was Phil Neville's manager when the England Women's manager was at Everton], but Phil Neville is doing a brilliant job with England Women. English women's football has really taken off and it is interesting to see how well the teams are doing. The quality of the players is fantastic.I'll probably be sending Phil Neville some abusive texts before the match -- I'm joking, of course, I wish him well because he was also one of my staff members at United. But I hope Shelley does a good job.READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in Jamaica Kelly Smith, 117 appearances for England -- 'England must play the occasion not the rivalry'It was always the big game that you wanted to play in because of the rivalry, because of the home nation connection. A lot of the Scottish players back then played in the English league. You wanted to beat them to have bragging rights when you went back to play club football. I played them a few times and we won by big scorelines. It was always a physical and mental battle because you knew Scotland wanted to beat England so badly. Smith scored 46 goals for England.When I was playing England were always so much better technically. But now some of the Scotland players would get into any team in the world, Kim Little, Caroline Weir and Jen Beattie.For England, it's about trying to play the game and not the occasion and not get caught up in that rivalry. All the pressure is on England. Scotland are a fantastic side and have a great manager in Shelley Kerr, they're going to perform to a very high standard so it's going to be a fantastic occasion.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Three turbulent years after 17 million British people voted to leave the European Union, Brexit has grown from a quaint word to an ugly cloud hanging over the nation.This week it claimed its second Prime Minister, Theresa May, who was forced to step down after trying, but failing, to grapple with its inconsistencies, the many lies and exaggerations told during the referendum campaign, and the deep divisions within her own party.The Brexiteers claimed for instance that Britain would \"hold all the cards\" (David Davis), \"getting out of the EU can be quick and easy\" (John Redwood) and that a free trade deal with the EU would be the \"easiest in history\" (Liam Fox).Brexit was her constant shadow, casting her in an unflattering light and dwarfing her abilities to tame its effect.In the week she finally capitulated to its capricious impact and relinquished her weakening grip on party and Parliament, Brexit took several more bites out of Britain's confidence.Read MoreTrump wants to do a 'phenomenal' trade deal with Britain. That won't be easyFirst, US President Donald Trump swept into the UK Monday, with the usual political maelstrom in his wake,  on course to collide with the Brexit vortex.Even before his plane touched down, Trump chilled his reception by criticizing May for failing to turn the Brexit tables on Brussels and said bookmakers' favorite Boris Johnson would be \"excellent\" as her successor. He also made an undiplomatic over-reach in comments on Brexit talks, telling the UK, \"if you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away.\"Once on the ground Trump took his Brexit meddling even further. He walked the country to the edge of the precipice, offering Brexitted Britain a \"substantial\" and \"fair\" trade deal, and saying \"we have the potential to be an incredible trade partner with the UK.\" Then he flashed the price tag for his post-Brexit nirvana: access to the UK's revered, state-run National Health Service (NHS).Why Britain's National Health Service keeps coming up during Trump's UK visitAt a news conference standing next to the exiting Prime Minister, Trump said everything should be on the table for a trade deal between the countries, including the cherished free-at-point-of-provision health system.Trump's statement was a double whammy given that some Brexiteers campaigned on the duplicitous claim that, once out of the EU, the UK would receive a \u00a3350 million a week rebate that could be used to top up the NHS's depleted coffers.The President's comments triggered a toxic backlash, opening May's Tories up to a tongue-lashing from opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and leaving Trump's pick for PM to insulate himself from the fallout. Johnson opted to talk to the President by phone rather than meeting him face-to-face in London, as another leading leadership contender Jeremy Hunt did.The only bonus Brexit delivered this week was to the bookies who continue to cash in on its uncertainties and the myriad options they open for a quick flutter.Trump likely added to their profits by backtracking on his NHS comments within hours of his previous pronouncement on the subject.The infamous claim written on the \"Vote Leave\" battle bus continues to dog the Brexit debate.Too large to ignoreWith mercurial partners like Trump in the offing, in what could potentially be the UK's biggest post-Brexit trade deal, the whole project looks more tarnished by the day.Not so long ago the word Brexit sounded ridiculous, a made-up name to cover up an incredibly complicated concept, akin to describing an elephant in a single word: gray.At the EU's HQ in Brussels, Brexit permeates many conversations. Even if not mentioned by name, it stalks the rooms and corridors like the proverbial beast in the room, too large to ignore and not tame enough to lead through the exit door.This week, Jean Claude Juncker, the outgoing European Commission President, tried to take the Brexit beast by the horns, declaring that the UK will leave the bloc on the already negotiated terms. But this raises the likelihood of a confrontation with Johnson, or whomever becomes the British PM, which in turn increases the possibility of a hard Brexit -- which might be best likened to the aforementioned elephant storming out of a china shop.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened his country might cease sharing intelligence with the UK  if it uses Huawei to build its 5G network.Unpredictable worldIf that weren't enough mayhem for the week, Brexit shook another card out of its flimsy house, with an unwanted intervention from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Pompeo implied that, if the UK buys Chinese telecoms giant Huawei's 5G network infrastructure, vital intelligence sharing between other Five Eyes partners (US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand) could be withheld from the UK.A world divided by 5G: Russia's Huawei deal is the latest sign of an emerging internet iron curtainThe UK's answer to this latest conundrum likely falls in line with so much else to do with Brexit. That is policy put together on the fly, in this case assuming that the UK is powerful and has enough leverage to trade with anyone it wants.So secretive was the UK/Huawei trade discussion that, when word of it leaked, May sacked her defense secretary. Since then, she implied she would stick with some sort of deal, and Trump implied after he met her this week the pair had overcome their differences.But May is now gone and Trump's word is unreliable.This is yet another factor that no one discussed or even predicted before Brexit. What if the world order changes and the UK's allies outside the EU become less reliable or trustworthy? What does it do if it has to put all its trade eggs in the US basket?Under a new PM, the Huawei deal may fall by the wayside. Indeed, a Boris-Trump alliance could rewrite much of the pre-Brexit logic and diplomatic landscape, two self-admiring charismatic populists with similar agendas, albeit with polar opposite lexicons.Last week Brexit's shadow got bigger not smaller.",

His arrest provoked an outpouring of support from Russian journalists, with many critics accusing local authorities of fabricating the case.If convicted, Golunov could be jailed for 10 to 20 years.

        "content": "(CNN)Lee Bamber is standing in his garden on a gray day in Fairbourne, northwest Wales. The sea is within earshot -- in fact, it's just on the other side of a wall separating the Irish Sea from his land. The local council says because of rising sea levels, one day garden and sea will meet and the village will be flooded. Today, however, Bamber's feet are resolutely dry.Is he worried? \"Absolutely not,\" says the 45-year-old, his property has weathered floods before. \"It's not like tomorrow we'll suddenly be in the land of Noah.\"But Old Testament theatrics isn't climate change's only guise. Sometimes it creeps up slowly, millimeters at a time, until the brine is lapping at your doorstep. The village, says one council manager, is in the midst of \"a very slow emergency,\" treated with the utmost seriousness. Plans are being drawn up that could remove Fairbourne from the map before nature does -- and what happens here could have far-reaching implications for the rest of the UK.\"You cannot build your way out of it\"Some glaciers giveth; others taketh away. Read MoreDuring the last Ice Age much of Wales was covered in glaciers. When the ice melted, it left behind the principality's famous hills and valleys. In places where glaciers once nestled rivers ran, depositing sediment over thousands of years and creating new land in patches along the coast.On one such patch, south of the Mawddach river in northwest Wales, lies Fairbourne. It's an aging community of around 1,000, and some of its residents have moved to the coast for sea air in their retirement. With surrounding views of Snowdonia's mountains and its long beachfront to the west, it's easy to see Fairbourne's appeal. \"It's like a land that time's forgot,\" says local campsite owner Stuart Eves. But this rugged idyll faces an existential crisis. Fairbourne is built on a natural flood plain, contending with the sea, a river estuary, water flowing off neighboring hillsides and the prospect of rising groundwater. It's barely above sea level, hunkered down behind a reinforced shingle embankment. Following flooding in 2014, defenses were upgraded at a cost of \u00a36.8 million ($8.7 million), but the council says they will only hold for so long. It concedes it is fighting a losing battle.Stuart Eves, a resident of Fairbourne since 1976, runs a camp site in the coastal village.The primary concern is sea level rise. Levels have risen 5 millimeters a year since the 1990s, says Huw Williams, a civil engineer at Gwynedd Council, which has oversight of Fairbourne. Part of the reason is glaciers and ice sheets melting because of global warming, another is seawater increasing in volume as temperatures rise. The rate is predicted to accelerate. Gwynedd Council is working on the basis of a one-meter sea level rise in the next 100 years, but some scientists say it could be more. A recent study's worst-case scenario model said global sea levels could rise two meters by 2100, placing 187 million people at risk globally.The problem isn't just the base sea level, he adds: \"As sea levels rise there's more energy, bigger waves, more frequent storms. More and more water is going to overtop the embankment.\"  The council's plan is to stop defending Fairbourne in around 35 years -- when the sea level is predicted to have risen 0.5 meters from 2014 levels -- if not sooner. By 2054, Williams says a seawall between 4-6 meters high would be required, with defenses costing \u00a3115-120 million ($146-152 million). But a seawall for Fairbourne would come with no guarantees. \"If that wall were to be overtopped or breached, the consequences would be dire,\" Williams adds. \"The reality of sea level rise is going to be of such a magnitude that you cannot build your way out of it.\"\"We'd need to remove any trace anyone's lived there\"As a result of a plan approved in 2014, the council is considering relocating residents and yielding the land to the sea by the middle of the century.Lisa Goodier is a senior project manager at Gwynedd Council's flood and coastal erosion risk management team. Goodier says local data collected over 25 years has been used to calculate sea level rise predictions that align with those made by the UN scientists behind last year's damning climate report. \"We can't not plan for something we know is going to happen,\" she says, \"it would be foolish not to.\"  Sea levels may rise much faster than previously predicted, swamping coastal cities such as Shanghai, study findsGoodier says 2045 is when relocations could begin, although a dramatic weather event could bring that date forward. \"We'd need to remove any trace that anyone's lived there in order for the sea to be able to come in there and not be polluted by anything that's man made,\" she explains. Houses, infrastructure, the lot.\"It's not something that we're used to talking about,\" she adds, \"planning for something you can't actually see happening at the moment.\"The lack of immediate peril paired with talk of relocating residents has been met with understandable agitation. A word that keeps arising in media reports is \"decommissioning.\" That stings. \"I don't like the word,\" says Eves. \"You decommission a factory. You don't decommission a village that's full of people.\"Goodier is quick to stress the council doesn't have the power to force anyone out of their homes and says police would only do so if there was a threat to human life. Nonetheless, she adds \"we have a duty to inform people they are at risk.\"Lisa Goodier, senior project manager at Gwynedd Council covering flood and coastal erosion risk management.\"I think it's a bit of scaremongering,\" says Philip Hill, 72, who moved to Fairbourne in January. \"I've seen nothing come over that wall that's made me worry at the moment, anyhow.\"\"It's what they (the council) think is going to happen -- you just have to hope that they're not right,\" he adds. Exacerbating residents' plight is uncertainty over the possible relocation. Hemmed in by mountains, Fairbourne can't simply be rebuilt further inland. Instability spreading in West Antarctic ice sheetFive years on, the council has not yet confirmed where evacuees would be moved and who will foot the bill. Moreover, the council says there are no measures in place for Fairbourne's residents to receive compensation for lost property assets. What no one wants is for Fairbourne's residents to become the UK's first climate change refugees.A masterplan which would outline some of the council's future strategy has been completed and is waiting for internal approval before release.House prices have already been affected. Goodier says they are down 35-40% against comparable communities -- a partial recovery after they fell to \"almost zero in the course of a week\" in early 2014. However she cautions prices could tail off in future.Eves has lived in the village since 1976 and says he will stick it out. \"We're not burying our head in the sand, we're not saying climate change isn't happening,\" he explains. \"Let's monitor what's going on year by year ... and if it does start to show a danger period, then it's time to do something drastic.\"A blueprint for UK policy?What happens at Fairbourne could be seen as a blueprint for future UK coastal strategy -- or a cautionary tale, depending on how events pans out. Other vulnerable communities along the Welsh coast, as well as sections of East Yorkshire and East Anglia, will be taking note.An October 2018 report by UK advisory body the Committee on Climate Change estimated 100,000 properties in the country may be at risk of coastal erosion by 2080, with 1.2 million homes in areas at risk of annual flooding. A half-meter sea level rise will \"make a further 20% of England's coastal defenses vulnerable to failure.\"Climate change: Do you know the basics? As Gwynedd Council notes, coastal defences must meet \"economic justification.\"  It's hard not to compare Fairbourne to London and the Thames Estuary, and the \u00a33.3 billion ($4.2 billion) funding required to protect the latter between now and 2050. The Thames Estuary 2100 Plan outlines maintenance and improvements on structures including the Thames Barrier, protecting \"1.3 million people and \u00a3275 billion worth of property and infrastructure.\" \"I hope Fairbourne will be used to influence some national policy,\" says Goodier. \"I want people to learn from the challenges we've had to face and the problems we haven't yet solved.\"Back in Bamber's garden, he remains optimistic about sea level rise, even touting the idea of building houses on stilts for future holidaymakers. It's a cheerful acceptance that trying times are ahead. \"It will be dramatic,\" he says, \"what a time to be alive.\"",

Secret odour-samplers embedded into living rooms sofa to collect signature body scents, to be stored for future use so sniffer dogs can track surveillance targets. These are just some of the ingenious devices used by the East German State Security Police -- better known as the Stasi -- between 1950 and 1990 to spy on private citizens, many of which are now on display at the Stasi Museum in Berlin.Yet these devices pale in comparison to the smartphone in your pocket or the virtual assistant in your home that is collecting data on your daily habits. A \"Bodil\" passive eavesdropping transmitter on display at the Stasi Museum in Berlin. Now, Germany's national police -- like many law enforcement services -- wants access, not only to phone data, but also information collected by digital assistants such as Google Home and Amazon Echo.Germany is planning to discuss this issue in a meeting of interior ministers next week. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Interior Ministry broached the subject in a news conference, saying: \"To fight crime effectively, it's very important that federal and state authorities should have access to data collected by these devices.\"Read MoreThat set off alarm bells for those monitoring digital privacy rights. \"They are fully aware this is unconstitutional what they are planning to do. I expect data protection agencies will interfere,\" said Jeanette Hofmann, Professor of Internet Politics at Freie University in Berlin and an expert member of the German Parliament's inquiry into Internet and the Digital Society. Tech's antitrust problem has been out in the open for years\"The home is still considered a holy place as compared to what happens in public. The possibility that everything you do at home will be tracked and the data given to law enforcement, just because of court order, is pretty scary.\" Germany is certainly not the only country grappling with where to draw the line on digital privacy. But because of its history, Germany has been especially sensitive to privacy rights, installing some of the strongest privacy laws in the world. Cybersecurity expert Sven Herpig said German policies have traditionally been supportive of encryption for this very reason.\"The policy that we've had for the past 20 year says 'we don't touch encryption, we don't weaken it, we don't build backdoors, law enforcement has to find another way to access data,'\" he said. \"You have to look at the historical experience with surveillance from the Nazi regime and then by the (East German Communist secret police) Stasi ... we have a strong history of being against government surveillance.\"But in the case of digital assistants like Google Home or Amazon Echo, much of the data gathered is not held in Germany, but in outside countries, especially the United States. On Thursday, the European Commission Security Union met to evaluate proposals that would allow for any member, including Germany, to access digital evidence gathered in another country. \"For far too long, criminals and terrorists have been abusing modern technology to commit their crimes,\" Commissioner for the Security Union, Julian King, said in a statement. \"By setting international standards to obtain access to electronic evidence, we are taking yet another step to close the space in which they operate by ensuring law enforcement authorities can more effectively investigate and prosecute them, with full regard for fundamental rights.\"Digital evidence as criminal evidenceAccording to the European Commission, digital evidence is needed in about 85% of criminal investigations and in 2/3 of these cases the evidence must be obtained from outside service providers, particularly in the US.   But digital rights groups in Germany have criticized the EU proposals, pointing out that Germany's strict privacy laws can be subverted and arguing that current proposals don't take into account whether a crime committed in one country is necessarily considered a crime in another.  Facebook's new plan doesn't protect your privacy, and neither does the FTC\"Such a regime would only make sense if there was consensus in the EU or internationally on what constitutes a crime and the same procedural safeguards apply,\" explained Elisabeth Niekrenz of Digital Society, a digital rights watchdog. \"If abortion is a criminal offense in one state and not in another, then service providers in the latter should not be forced to give evidence of such events.\"Personal experiences of surveillance Germans know from personal experience how mass surveillance can be abused.  Today, a German citizen can look up their personal files in the Stasi archives to see what information the police had collected on them and their family, using that intelligence to harass dissidents and control ordinary citizens. With digital devices, however, it is private companies that are mining the data gathered through this surveillance around the world.  Now, warns Professor Hofmann, through the legal framework of criminal investigations governments also want access to that wealth of data, leaving it up to digital rights activists to defend their case to court.  National Security Agency halts surveillance program\"This is an international issue.  We are scandalized when Amazon hears our private conversations at home. But now the government is saying it is going to do the same thing,\" Hofmann said. \"We privatized a lot of infrastructure and handed over decision making power to the markets. Previously, when citizens believed that the market was abusing that power, they could turn to governments and call for regulation. But this leaves the judicial system as the only alternative left to turn to.  And, I think, in the long run, this is a big issue for any democracy.\"",

The current African Women's Footballer of the Year uncorked a thunderbolt to the top right corner past the outstretched arms of Spanish keeper Sandra Panos to give South Africa a 25th-minute lead. South African forward Thembi Kgatlana celebrates after scoring a goal of the tournament candidate early in the match on Saturday.

Atletico Madrid's Jennifer Hermoso, playing in her 70th match for Spain, calmly took the penalty to tie the game. A few minutes later, South African defender Nothando Vilakazi was given her second yellow card for a studs-up tackle in the box, allowing Hermoso to score another penalty. The Spaniard became the first player to score twice from the penalty spot in a Women's World Cup match.

The Chinese leader saw works from the Renaissance collection of the State Hermitage Museum, and got an evening boat cruise with the Kremlin leader. The rest of St. Petersburg, meanwhile, seemed to be out at the cafes.Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping tour the Kremlin following their talks, Moscow, June 5.But the friendly atmosphere was more than just the usual display of Russian-Chinese friendship. The St. Petersburg Economic Forum was an occasion for Putin and Xi to show a unified front in a broader confrontation with Washington.China's Huawei will build Russia's 5G network In advance of the forum, Russia and China rolled out a big announcement: On Wednesday, Huawei signed a deal with MTS -- Russia's largest telecoms operator -- to develop 5G technologies and launch a fifth-generation network in Russia.The deal comes as Huawei, one of China's most important companies, is at the center of an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington.Read MoreThe Trump administration has barred Huawei from any involvement in American 5G networks over spying concerns, urging US allies to follow suit, while Huawei denies that its products pose any national security risk.Putin and Xi Jinping at a gala dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and China.Ban risks 'technological war'At the St. Petersburg forum, Putin came down firmly on the side of Huawei, warning that Washington's actions risked \"technological war\" over digital technology.\"Let's take the situation around Huawei, for example, which is being not only driven out but unceremoniously pushed out of the global market,\" he said. \"Some are already saying it's the first technological war of the coming digital era.\"Putin warned that Washington's actions risked \"technological war\" over digital technology.Putin also pivoted to a broader complaint: US unilateralism, something the Kremlin leader has long accused Washington of promoting.In Putin's reading, the US wants to replace a rule-based system where states are treated as equal and sovereign actors with a situation where the US and other economically powerful countries dictate the terms.\"This is what the US is doing today, trying to expand their jurisdiction over the whole world,\" he said in St. Petersburg.Xi meets 'best and bosom friend' Putin amid raging US trade warIt's easy to see why Putin's sympathies lie with Huawei. Russia has also been on the receiving end of US sanctions following the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. Sanctions and a risky investment climate have deterred much foreign direct investment, and the Russian government has touted Chinese investment as a more reliable alternative to Western investment.But Russia's investment climate shows little hope of changing. Even as Putin was preparing to go onstage to cheer for Russian-Chinese partnership, attendees at the forum received some negative news: US investor Michael Calvey, who is currently under house arrest in connection with a controversial fraud charge in Russia, would not be attending the forum. Calvey, who has been an ardent promoter of investment in Russia, was detained in Moscow in connection with a large-scale fraud investigation this February. He was moved from jail to house arrest in April following outcry from prominent Russian CEOs and government officials, and hopes were running high that he might be allowed to attend the forum.Such a move would have been widely seen as a signal that Russia was ready to repair its image with investors. But that, in the end, did not materialize, despite the outpouring of support for Calvey.After the delegations leave St. Petersburg, then, Russia may still have to continue to look to China to boost its image as an investment destination.",

She might have to change that after beating Czech teen Marketa Vondrousova 6-1 6-3 to become the first Australian to win the clay-court French Open since Margaret Court in 1973.  \"I played the perfect match today,\" Barty told the crowd. Vondrousova concurred. \"I think she just gave me a lesson today,\" the 19-year-old said. Read MoreIt was a feat that almost never was, since Barty quit tennis five years ago -- weighed down by expectations following a stellar junior career -- and even played professional cricket before returning in 2016.\"I don't even know if I'd be sitting here talking to you if I was playing tennis if I didn't step away,\" she said. \"It's obviously a part of my life that I needed to deal with, and I feel like it was the best decision that I made at the time, and it was an even better one coming back.\"The well liked 23-year-old with the big forehand and varied repertoire has been on an upward trajectory since and will rise six spots to No. 2 in the world behind another young star, 21-year-old Naomi Osaka, when Monday's new rankings are released. Never letting go.@ashbar96 | #RG19 pic.twitter.com/ipLDB1TpfA\u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) June 8, 2019\n\nSuch is Barty's ability that, after winning junior Wimbledon aged 15, she has become a grand slam champion in both singles and doubles. READ: Women's semifinal venue's 'unfair and inappropriate'Barty likes to use the term \"cheapies\" to describe unforced errors and there weren't many that came off her racket against Vondrousova in what was the most lopsided women's final at Roland Garros -- in games -- since Justine Henin downed Ana Ivanovic 6-1 6-2 in 2007. Perhaps it was due, since the last six finals didn't lack drama. Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosHenin possessed a wonderful, versatile backhand slice that can help in defensive positions, neutralize opponents and coax those cheapies.And with Vondrousova on the stretch in the second set against Barty, one crosscourt slice from well beyond the baseline flummoxed the left-hander for a clean winner. Great startIt was Barty's start that was likely key to the encounter.

But the Australian is more established than her foe and, thus, accustomed to playing on bigger stages. In March, for example, Barty won one of the biggest tournaments outside the grand slams, the Miami Open. Vondrousova, meanwhile, had never played on the main Philippe Chatrier stadium. That extra experience felt pivotal. Ashleigh Barty won her first grand slam title at Roland GarrosBarty raced to a quick 4-0 advantage, a day after leading another teen, Amanda Anisimova, 5-0 in the semifinals.  The American rallied, though, to take a set and break advantage, which meant Barty had to come back herself to make the finale. She didn't make the same mistake twice. \"Yesterday was an absolute roller coaster,\" said Barty. \"There's no way about it. I think I played some really good tennis and some pretty awful tennis.\"Then today I just kept saying to myself, 'I may never get this opportunity ever again,' so try and grab it with both hands.\"Barty hit 27 winners to 26 unforced errors in the late afternoon sunshine that countered that rain earlier in the day. The winds that so drastically affected the men's semifinals Friday were still something for Barty and Vondrousova to contend with, but not nearly as drastic. Vondrousova, like Barty, possesses super touch. But the drop shot that she enjoys rarely worked, unlike in her previous rounds. Vondrousova was able to recover from ominous positions in her previous two matches against Johanna Konta and Petra Martic -- down 5-3 in the first set and saving set points -- yet Barty wasn't as generous. First set lostVondrousova hadn't lost a set prior to the final, so Barty winning the opener and in quick time, must have been a blow. Had the left-hander won, Vondrousova would have become the first teen to win a major since Maria Sharapova at the 2006 US Open and the first at Roland Garros since Iva Majoli in 1997.  \"I think I'm proud of myself at everything, because I'm just 19 and I won six tough matches,\" said Vondrousova, whose parents were in attendance. \"It was an amazing two weeks for me.Barty made history with her title on the surface she had limited experience on. \"I said to my team at the start of the year I was just worried about falling over,\" said Barty. \"And I can successfully say that we got to the end of the clay court season and I did not fall over once. So I'm pretty pumped with that.\"And guess what grand slam is up next? Wimbledon. On grass.",

A disgruntled Djokovic exited the French Open Saturday in a thriller, beaten by Dominic Thiem in a completion of their weather affected semifinal. Thiem's 6-2 3-6 7-5 5-7 7-5 victory ended the world No. 1's unblemished 26-match run in majors that began last year at Wimbledon. It also quashed his hopes of landing four straight grand slams for the second time.

He became the first player outside the big three of Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer to make back-to-back men's finals at Roland Garros since Sweden's Robin Soderling in 2009 and 2010. Dominic Thiem hits a backhand during his French Open semifinal Saturday against Novak Djokovic. READ: Unfair and inappropriate schedulingThiem's task was always going to be difficult versus the 11-time champion -- Nadal won in straight sets in 2018 -- but even more so now given the draining win over Djokovic and no day off between the semifinal and final. The fourth seed spent almost three hours on court Saturday after proceedings were paused with the 25-year-old ahead 3-1 in the third Friday. \"I'm feeling fine,\" said Thiem. \"I'm full of adrenaline, of course, still from today's match and also I will have that tomorrow. I'm not going to be tired. It's all going to come after the tournament. \"So I'm ready to leave all or everything that I have left out on the court tomorrow.\"Twelve months ago at the French Open Djokovic left in deep frustration, too, losing to the relatively unknown Marco Cecchinato in a quarterfinal where he had chance after chance. Djokovic clashes with umpireIn still blustery conditions in Paris -- though not nearly as windy as Friday -- Djokovic became agitated when chair umpire Jaume Campistol handed him a time violation warning while serving at 5-6, 30-15 in the third set. Djokovic has been known, like Nadal, to take his time between points on serve. He later appeared to tell Campistol to wait for the crowd to settle before starting his shot clock. Soon after Thiem ripped a backhand return on a fourth set point, the 15-time major champion received a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct. His frustration grew. Djokovic asked Campistol, \"Have you ever played tennis?\"Campistol replied \"yes.\"\"So you know how it is in this situation at 5-6, long point, crowd still clapping, right?\"\"You've made yourself recognizable now,\" he also said.   READ: Nadal beats Federer to make 12th finalNovak Djokovic clashed with chair umpire Jaume Campistol.It ultimately was that kind of semifinal for Djokovic. \"Obviously when you're playing in hurricane kind of conditions, it's hard to perform your best,\" Djokovic told reporters moments after stepping off court. \"It's really just kind of surviving in these kind of conditions and trying to hold your serve and play one ball more than your opponent in the court.\"That's what it felt like playing yesterday.\"Due to the extreme wind, Djokovic asked supervisor Andreas Egli to stop the contest in the first set. He was rebuffed. \"He said as long as there are no flying objects coming to the court, we're good,\" said Djokovic. \"I didn't know that an umbrella is not a flying object, which flew in in the first game of the match, but that's their decision. I guess they know tennis better.\"After a second rain delay, organizers suspended play at 6:30 pm local time despite the rain stopping and the sun making an appearance.

Asked why the postponement came, Djokovic replied: \"I don't know. You can ask them.\"Upon the restart, Djokovic constantly pressured Thiem and got his reward to pull to 3-4 in the third. At 4-4 on another break chance, a 21-shot rally concluded with the Austrian hitting a drop shot winner -- off the net. The drama of the extended 12th game ensued, a game in which Thiem sent a routine backhand slice long on a first set point. A first serve into the body plus an ace fended off two more set points prior to Thiem anticipating Djokovic serving and volleying and crushing a backhand. Djokovic grabbed an early break lead in the fourth but Thiem leveled and even led 5-4. Temporary reprieveOne game from victory and at 0-15 on the Djokovic serve, Thiem error's helped a relieved Djokovic hang on. As the tension escalated, Djokovic broke in the next game courtesy of a double fault. There were extended, breathtaking rallies, including when the speedy Thiem conjured another break chance by racing to a drop shot and deftly putting his angled, backhand reply past Djokovic. Djokovic held firm but then erred on a break point at 1-1 in the fifth. And what a chance it was. As the drop shots accumulated, Djokovic comfortably got to one of Thiem's but pushed his forehand long.

Dramatic last setIncredibly the first point after the hour delay -- which cut into the women's final due to start at 3 pm local time between Ashleigh Barty and Marketa Vondrousova -- saw Djokovic and Campistol disagreeing about a ball mark when the Serb stopped playing off a Thiem ball near the baseline.The point thus going to Thiem, Djokovic saved the second break point with a good serve then broke for 3-4.With all the momentum Djokovic, however, stuttered -- crumbling from 30-0 to trail 5-3.The drama, though, didn't end there.Seemingly cruising to victory at 40-15, Thiem missed a pair of backhand slices -- one into the net and one wide -- on two match points.On break point, he snatched at his backhand and sent it into the net.But Djokovic couldn't save a third match point at 5-6, as Thiem blasted a forehand winner to book a clash with Nadal.\"Somehow I had the feeling that I had the lead in the whole match, and then at the end it got so tough,\" said Thiem. \"At the end, both of us could win, and I luckily got\" the win. Thiem improved to 2-1 against Djokovic at the French Open but hasn't taken a set off Nadal in their three Paris tussles. And unluckily for Thiem, Nadal is playing his best tennis of the current clay swing. \"I try to keep all the positive emotions I'm having right now from this amazing match today,\" said Thiem. \"And go with a really positive mind into the match tomorrow. \"Then we'll see.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The lawyer for the model Najila Trindade, who accused Brazilian footballer Neymar of rape and assault, defended his client in an interview with CNN, calling her a victim \"who, until proven otherwise, has been raped.\" \"Najila is a victim. [Is there] nothing more important in Brazil than Neymar?\" lawyer Danilo Garcia de Andrade told CNN, adding that \"if Neymar is innocent, let the police get it straightened out, but in a just, human, legal way.\"The soccer star denies the allegations that he raped and violently assaulted her in a Paris hotel room on May 15.On Friday, Trindade fainted and hit her head while being questioned by police in relation to the alleged incident, according to Garcia.  He accused members of the press and the public of hostility as he carried Trindade to a police car after the interview.Read MoreNajila Trindade is carried by her lawyer Danilo Garcia de Andrade to a police car.The lawyer also denied allegations that he was having an affair with Trindade. \"My involvement with my client is only in the criminal sphere to defend her,\" Garcia said, adding that his client was taken to hospital, where she received medical attention and was released after an hour. \"This girl needs help. Whether or not the rape happened, and I believe in her version, it does not take away the question that she needs help. It is a lack of humanity that I saw today.\"CNN sought comment from Neymar's lawyers. \"The police investigation procedure is kept confidential and it is not possible to comment on the respect of its content,\" Neymar's spokeswoman Day Crespo said. Neymar is facing two separate police investigations in Brazil, according to Rio de Janeiro's Police press office. One investigation is being conducted by Sao Paulo police, where Trindade filed a police report on May 31 claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain player assaulted and raped her earlier that month.Neymar has denied the accusations in an Instagram video, saying: \"I was induced to do it, it was something that happened, it was a trap and I ended up falling for it, but that's a lesson from here on out.\" His representatives have said he is the victim of extortion.The video has since been taken down, but the second police investigation focuses on cybercrime given Neymar took to Instagram two days after the report was filed to deny the accusation and share sexually charged text exchanges that occurred between the two after the alleged rape took place, in order to prove their interactions were consensual.The texts included sensitive photos of the model. Posting intimate photos of another person is a crime under Brazilian law. Rio de Janeiro police have opened the investigation, because Neymar showed the photos on social media while he was in Rio de Janeiro training with the Brazilian national team. Neymar gave his testimony Thursday at the police station in Rio de Janeiro regarding the cybercrime case, according to his defense attorney. His lawyer, Maria Fernandes, confirmed to Reuters that Neymar had given a statement to police.Neymar plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain.Neymar, who was in a wheelchair after suffering an ankle injury while playing for Brazil earlier this week, was wheeled to the entrance of the police station through hordes of reporters before standing up and entering on crutches.Speaking outside the police station, Neymar was quoted by Reuters as saying: \"I appreciate the support and all the messages that the world has sent, my friends, my fans, that the world is with me. I want to say thank you for the well wishes, and say that I have felt very loved. Thanks for everyone's well wishes.\"Lawyer Fernandes added: \"He made the point of coming as soon as he could to give a statement, to clarify everything that needed to be clarified.\"The testimony has nothing to do with the rape allegations which allegedly took place in Paris.\"We are absolutely confident that we will prove the innocence of our client. The process was thorough, but he provided all the clarifications that were to be provided,\" said Fernandes.CNN has contacted Neymar and his club Paris Saint-Germain for comment on the allegations made by Trindade in the interview, but has yet to receive a response.The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed to CNN Friday that there is still no investigation opened about the case in France.  Meanwhile  Nike says it is \"very concerned\" by the rape allegations against  Neymar, casting doubt over its partnership with the world's most expensive soccer player.\"We are very concerned by the recent allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation,\" Nike said in a statement sent to CNN.Follow @cnnsport\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday to Brazilian network SBT TV, Trindade says she contacted Neymar on Instagram, intent on pursuing a sexual relationship with the soccer star.\"There was a sexual intent, it was a desire of mine. I think that was clear to him,\" she said.Brazil's star striker Neymar arrives at the police station in a wheelchair.Trindade says she met Neymar at the Hotel Sofitel Paris Arc du Triomphe, after she says he paid for her to travel to Paris.\"I had the desire of being with Neymar and when I got there everything was good, everything was fine, the messages, I was going to succeed, do you understand? But when I got there he was aggressive, totally different from the guy I met through the texts.\"\"I don't think that just because I was keen to be with him that he had the right to do that to me.\"Neymar ended his Instagram video showing flirty and at times explicitly sexual texts and intimate photos that he said were exchanges with his accuser even after the alleged incident. The exchanges began in March, according to the time stamp on the texts.\"I will expose everything, expose all the conversations I had with the girl, all our moments, which are intimate ... but it is necessary to open and expose them to prove that nothing really happened,\" he said.When asked about why she continued to message Neymar after the alleged rape, Trindade said: \"Initially, I wasn't able to react, due to the trauma.\"And then I knew that if I didn't speak to him normally, pretending that I hadn't understood what had happened, he wouldn't speak to me again and I wouldn't have how to prove what he had done to me.\"Visit CNN.com/sport/football for more news and featuresAccording to Forbes, Neymar is ranked fifth in the list of the world's highest-paid athletes.

        "content": "(CNN)At just 17-years-old, Dutch teenager Noa Pothoven had already written an award-winning memoir detailing her struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anorexia in the wake of sexual assault and rape.In her autobiography, Pothoven wrote that she had nothing left to live for.At 16, she approached the Levenseinde, or \"end-of-life,\" clinic in The Hague to inquire about euthanasia, but, according to an interview last year with local newspaper the Gelderlander, her request was rejected.Last week, after years of battling mental illness, Pothoven announced on Instagram that she had begun refusing all food and liquids.\"After years of fighting, the fighting has finished. I have now stopped eating and drinking for a while, and after many conversations and reviews it has been decided that I will be released because my suffering is unbearable,\" Pothoven wrote in a post, which has since been removed. Read More\"I have not really been alive for so long, I am surviving, and not even that. I am still breathing but I am no longer alive.\"On Sunday, Dutch media reported that Pothoven had died in a hospital bed in her family's home in Arnhem after she stopped eating and drinking.What happens when a patient says, 'Doc, help me die'But, in the hours and days that followed, a barrage of international media reports falsely suggested that Pothoven had been \"legally euthanized.\" It was a sensationalist version of an already tragic story that swiftly spread across the globe, triggering an emotive debate over the ethics of euthanasia and raising questions over how someone so young could be allowed to die that way.How to get help for someone who might be suicidalPothoven had not been euthanized, according to her family, who issued this statement in the Gelderlander: \"Noa had chosen not to eat and drink anymore. We would like to emphasize that this was the cause of her death. She died in our presence last Sunday. We kindly ask everyone to respect our privacy so we as a family can mourn.\"The Levenseinde clinic, the Royal Dutch Medical Association and the Dutch health minister also denied that Pothoven died by euthanasia.\"Despite international media reports to the contrary, there is no question of euthanasia in this case,\" Dutch Minister of Health Hugo de Jonge said in a statement. \"Questions about her death and the care she has received are understandable, but can only be answered once the facts have been established.\"So why did so many media outlets get it wrong?Media's misreportingMuch has already been written about the failure of the media to do its due diligence in telling Pothoven's story.Politico Europe reporter Naomi O'Leary, one of the first English-language journalists to get the facts straight, laid out the details of Pothoven's case in a Twitter thread on Wednesday.\"A 17-year-old rape victim was NOT euthanised in the Netherlands\" O'Leary tweeted. \"It took me about 10 mins to check with the reporter who wrote the original Dutch story.\"A 17-year-old rape victim was NOT euthanised in the Netherlands.@euronews @Independent @DailyMailUK @dailybeast are all wrongIt took me about 10 mins to check with the reporter who wrote the original Dutch story.Noa Pothoven asked for euthanasia and was refused (cont.) pic.twitter.com/e7PYQSCxG1\u2014 Naomi O'Leary (@NaomiOhReally) June 5, 2019\n\nAfter she called out the outlets who had misreported the story, many began to tweak headlines and change copy, some without issuing corrections.According to a Dutch news report, many British news outlets were initially alerted to the story by Central European News (CEN), a newswire service that specializes in foreign tabloid stories. CEN has previously been accused of providing unreliable information to clients, an accusation CEN fervently denies.Michael Leidig, who runs the agency, told CNN that when it became clear CEN's original report mischaracterized Pothoven's death, they published a new story describing the way she ended her life as a \"legal gray zone.\"But Dyck Bosscher, a spokesman for the Dutch Voluntary Termination of Life Association (NVVE), which established Levenseinde, the end-of-life clinic where Pothoven sought out assisted suicide, said this case was clear-cut -- she did not die by euthanasia. Sex vouchers for migrants? The truth behind Europe's fake stories\"There is a lot of misunderstanding about our legislation around euthanasia,\" Bosscher told CNN. \"The media reports make it seem as if it is easy to get euthanasia in the Netherlands, but it's not the truth.\"In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are strictly defined as \"the active termination of life at a patient's voluntary and well-informed request,\" according to the Royal Dutch Medical Association; both were legalized in the country in 2002. According to Dutch law, patients as young as 12 may request and receive euthanasia with parental consent. For those age 16 and 17, parents must be aware of the request.Bosscher explained that gaining approval was a complex, lengthy process under the criteria set out by Dutch law. Over the course of multiple interviews, those seeking euthanasia must convince a doctor that their request is voluntary, they are suffering unbearably, have exhausted all alternative options and are capable of understanding the weight of their decision, he said.Vaccination deniers gaining 'traction' on social media, health chief warnsAnd, in cases like Pothoven's, when the patient is living with mental illness, the application is even more difficult, because the burden of proof is so high.Of the patients who are approved to receive euthanasia by the Levenseinde clinic, only 9% are psychiatric patients. The rest are living with cancer or another disease.Last December, Pothoven told Dutch newspaper the Gelderlander that she was devastated to be denied euthanasia by the clinic. \"They are of the opinion that I am too young to die. They believe I need to receive trauma focused treatment first and wait until my brain is fully developed. That won't happen until I am 21. I am devastated because I cannot wait that long,\" she said. Ethics of euthanasiaWhile inaccurate reports about Pothoven's death spread from Australia to the United States, the story also fueled a long-running debate over the ethics of euthanasia -- particularly in Italy.#NoaPothoven began trending on Italian Twitter and even grabbed the attention of the Pope, who appeared to refer to the case in a subtweet.Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.\u2014 Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 5, 2019\n\n\"Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all,\" Pope Francis posted on Twitter. \"We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.\"And after major Italian outlets like la Repubblica, Corriere della Sera, ANSA and AGI misreported that Pothaven was euthanised, far-right politician Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy party declared that Pothoven's death was \"a defeat of an entire civilization that has stopped defending life.\"It was only after Italian politician Marco Cappato, a former member of European Parliament who has campaigned for legal euthanasia in Italy, cited local Dutch media to debunk the reports, that some Italian media outlets issued a correction.L'Olanda ha autorizzato #eutanasia su una 17enne? FALSO!!! I media italiani non hanno verificato. L'Olanda aveva RIFIUTATO l'eutanasia a #Noa. Lei ha smesso di bere e mangiare e si \u00e8 lasciata morire a casa, coi familiari consenzienti. Si attendono smentita e SCUSE.\u2014 Marco Cappato (@marcocappato) June 5, 2019\n\nBioethicists say confusion around the definition of euthanasia helps fuel misinformation.\"There is genuine confusion about what constitutes euthanasia and it's quite tempting to conflate it with the withdrawal of treatment,\" Iain Brassington, a bioethicist and senior lecturer at the University of Manchester in northern England, told CNN. \"What's crucial is the intention.\"Brassington, whose research centers on autonomy and euthanasia, said reporting on assisted dying can quickly become emotive and polarized. Those two things together -- polarizing content that elicits an emotional response -- are key ingredients in the spread of misinformation.  'It could be any day now': Why how you die mattersAnd the consequences of false reporting in places like Italy can have wide-ranging effects on passing end-of-life care legislation elsewhere.NVVE's spokesman Dyck Bosscher told CNN, in Italy false stories like this regarding euthanasia serve to, \"warn people that they should never have this liberal legislation ... to underline that this is a slippery slope.\"  But Philip Nitschke, an Australian activist and founder of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, said that while the false story was being touted by the religious right, and others who are against euthanasia, it had also provided a rare opportunity to discuss the issue on a global level.\"What you see is a whole spectrum of opinions from those who believe it is never right to give away your life, and I imagine the Pope falls into that category, through to those who see it as a human right, to be able to decide when and how to give away your life,\" Nitschke, whose offices are based in Amsterdam, told CNN.\"It's quite a good thing to open up the debate.\"For support outside of the US, a worldwide directory of resources and international hotlines is provided by the International Association for Suicide Prevention.

Ivan Golunov was arrested Thursday after being accused of possessing and attempting to sell drugs. His lawyer and colleagues have accused police of planting the drugs on the 36-year-old and framing him, Reuters reported.The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called for Golunov's release as well as investigate allegations that he had been beaten in police custody. \"Russian authorities should immediately drop their charges against Ivan Golunov, release him, and investigate allegations of mistreatment of the journalist in police custody,\" said Gulnoza Said, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. \"Russia has a long history of politically motivated charges against independent reporters. Investigative journalism is treated as a crime where it ought to be viewed as a public service.\"Read MoreIvan Kolpakov, the editor-in-chief at Meduza, an online newspaper where Golunov works, told the CPJ that the drug charges were \"absurd,\" and that he had \"no doubts that the charges are fabricated and are related to Golunov's journalism.\"In a statement posted online, Kolpakov and Meduza CEO Galina Timchenko said Golunov had been beaten by police during detention. A police spokesman rejected those claims, according to TASS.Meduza also cited Golunov's lawyer, Dmitry Dzhulai, as saying that the detained journalist had not been allowed to eat or sleep for more than a day. Police officers detain Russian journalist and writer Victor Shenderovich during a rally in support of arrested journalist Ivan Golunov outside the Russian Interior Ministry in Moscow.News of Golunov's arrest galvanized Russian journalists on Friday, with several dozen holding a small protest outside the Russian Ministry of Interior in Moscow. Authorities detained at least 11 individuals who were protesting Golunov's arrest, the monitoring site OVD-Info reported Friday.Detained protesters included prominent journalists and video on social media showed the arrest of Viktor Shenderovich, a popular Russian columnist.The opening of the criminal case immediately drew skepticism from local journalists for being fabricated, as Russian reporters routinely face intimidation, harassment and violence.According to the CPJ, Golunov will appear in court on Saturday, where a judge will rule whether the reporter should be released while the investigation is pending.If found guilty, Golunov could be jailed for 10 to 20 years, according to Reuters.",

Fighting VondrousovaVondrousova started slowly and trailed 3-5 in the first set against Konta, who was aiming to become the first British woman to reach a grand slam final since 1977.However, the Czech fought back to clinch the set and also came from behind in the second to become the first teenager to reach a grand slam final since Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki at the 2009 US Open.She is also bidding to become the first teenager to win a major title since Maria Sharapova, who was 19 when she clinched the 2006 US Open.

I was just happy that I kept my nerve at the end. I'm so happy with everything here,\" said Vondrousova, who has never been beyond the fourth round of a slam.  A deflated Konta added: \"It is always tough to lose a match, any match, and always tough to lose matches where you have opportunities and chances.\" Dream over for AnisimovaAmanda Anisimova was has only participated in four grand slams as part of the main draw.

The 23-year-old Australian, who stepped away from the game in 2014 to play professional cricket, stormed to a 5-0 lead in the first set but Anisimova rallied to produce a classic match. Undeterred by her shaky start, the teenager won six games on the bounce as the first set went to a tiebreak which, despite trailing once again, Anisimova won. With confidence boosted, the American stormed to a 3-0 lead in the second set but, remarkably, lost the next six games as Barty took the set and leveled the match. The third set was relatively straight forward as Barty broke early and held firm against the resilient Anisimova.

One investigation is being conducted by Sao Paulo police, where Najila Trindade filed a police report on May 31 claiming that the Paris Saint-Germain player assaulted and raped her earlier that month. She is currently being questioned by police in relation to the alleged Paris incident in a closed setting.Neymar has denied the accusations in an Instagram video, saying: \"I was induced to do it, it was something that happened, it was a trap and I ended up falling for it, but that's a lesson from here on out.\" His representatives have said he is the victim of extortion.The video has since been taken down, but the second police investigation focuses on cybercrime given Neymar took to Instagram two days after the report was filed to deny the accusation and share sexually charged text exchanges that occurred between the two after the alleged rape took place, in order to prove their interactions were consensual.The texts included sensitive photos of the model. Posting intimate photos of another person is a crime under Brazilian law. Rio de Janeiro police have opened the investigation, because Neymar showed the photos on social media while he was in Rio de Janeiro training with the Brazilian national team.

His lawyer, Maria Fernandes, confirmed to Reuters that Neymar had given a statement to police.Neymar plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain.Neymar, who was in a wheelchair after suffering an ankle injury while playing for Brazil earlier this week, was wheeled to the entrance of the police station through hordes of reporters before standing up and entering on crutches.Speaking outside the police station, Neymar was quoted by Reuters as saying: \"I appreciate the support and all the messages that the world has sent, my friends, my fans, that the world is with me. I want to say thank you for the well wishes, and say that I have felt very loved. Thanks for everyone's well wishes.\"Lawyer Fernandes added: \"He made the point of coming as soon as he could to give a statement, to clarify everything that needed to be clarified.\"The testimony has nothing to do with the rape allegations which allegedly took place in Paris.\"We are absolutely confident that we will prove the innocence of our client. The process was thorough, but he provided all the clarifications that were to be provided,\" said Fernandes.CNN has contacted Neymar and his club Paris Saint-Germain for comment on the allegations made by Trindade in the interview, but has yet to receive a response.The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed to CNN Friday that there is still no investigation opened about the case in France.

But when I got there he was aggressive, totally different from the guy I met through the texts.\"\"I don't think that just because I was keen to be with him that he had the right to do that to me.\"Neymar ended his Instagram video showing flirty and at times explicitly sexual texts and intimate photos that he said were exchanges with his accuser even after the alleged incident. The exchanges began in March, according to the time stamp on the texts.\"I will expose everything, expose all the conversations I had with the girl, all our moments, which are intimate ... but it is necessary to open and expose them to prove that nothing really happened,\" he said.When asked about why she continued to message Neymar after the alleged rape, Trindade said: \"Initially, I wasn't able to react, due to the trauma.\"And then I knew that if I didn't speak to him normally, pretending that I hadn't understood what had happened, he wouldn't speak to me again and I wouldn't have how to prove what he had done to me.\"Visit CNN.com/sport/football for more news and featuresAccording to Forbes, Neymar is ranked fifth in the list of the world's highest-paid athletes.

        "content": "(CNN)The eighth edition of the Women's World Cup has been described as the most important in history. Kicking off in Paris on Friday, the tournament certainly promises to be the best yet. Never before has there been such a wealth of talent or as many title contenders and, perhaps, never before has women's football had such a platform. The four-week competition in France offers an opportunity to change attitudes, to push the drive for equality farther forward. Follow @cnnsport\n\nEstablished in 1991, initially as the FIFA World Championship for women's football for the M&M's Cup, only after the tournament in China did FIFA, the sport's governing body, allow for it to be called a World Cup -- the Women's World Cup is still, relatively speaking, in its infancy. But there is a sense that France 2019 could be a turning point. Twenty years after the record-breaking 1999 Women's World Cup which propelled the women's game into wider consciousness, the next month provides an opportunity to not only build on those foundations but to surpass the achievements of the 1999 groundbreakers. Global stars will emerge over the course of the 52 games as a bigger audience than ever tune in to watch more countries than ever compete for the prestigious prize. Read MoreThe capacity of the stadiums in France means that the record attendance of 90,185 set on that sweltering Californian afternoon in the summer of 1999 -- still a record for a female sporting event -- will not be eclipsed, but the television figures for France 2019 are expected to put the 2015 Women's World Cup, which attracted a global TV audience of 750 million, in the shade. READ: The match that changed women's football     In April, FIFA said ticket sales were \"smashing records.\" The opening match in the Parc de Princes and the semifinals and finals at the Stade de Lyon were sold out within 48 hours of going on sale. Such is the focus on the tournament, it leaves former players wishing they could play again. For those who grew up in a world where young girls struggled to find teams, the rate of the progress made in recent years has come as a surprise. Kelly Smith is regarded as the finest female footballer to have played for England, making 117 appearances from 1995 to 2014. \"It's been an eye opener, just the attention that's now on women's football,\" Smith, speaking as part of Three UK's unveiling of three lioness emojis (England's women's team are called the Lionesses) on the front of its flagship London store, tells CNN Sport. \"Certain nations are investing more resources. FIFA has opened up the tournament to 24 teams, so more nations are getting to experience tournament football. \"When I was playing, there were only two or three teams who could potentially win a World Cup. Now you could name six to eight teams who could potentially do something special at this tournament and it just makes it more competitive, it makes it better for viewers to watch.\"And there are just so many cool stories out there of the women. There are a lot of social media campaigns promoting the players and teams.

Two-time winners Germany have also been part of a powerful and innovative ad campaign, which had the players saying: \"We don't have balls, but we know how to use them.\" The video was made by the team's sponsors and it is the keenness of business to now be associated with women's football which partly helps explain the increased investment. \"We don't have balls. But we know how to use them!\" The @DFBFrauen with a \ud83d\udd25 campaign ahead of this summer's Women's World Cup. #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/IC1b9b2VHU\u2014 DW Sports (@dwsports) May 14, 2019 The rise of women's football is a result of a myriad of reasons, the biggest arguably being societal change (this will be the first tournament since the #MeToo movement), and now sponsors and FIFA are adding their voices.Last year, FIFA announced a five-pronged global strategy to grow the game, one being to ensure all 211 members have comprehensive women's plans in place by 2022.The governing body has said it wants women's participation to double to 60 million worldwide by 2026, and that the women's game offers \"vast untapped opportunities,\" but there is continued criticism of FIFA over the prize money on offer at this tournament. Raised from $15 million in 2015 to $30 million, the overall prize fund has doubled since 2015, but for the 2018 men's World Cup it was $400 million, with winners France taking home $38 million. \"Women national team players around the world should receive equal treatment to their male national team counterparts; this should include their travel and accommodation as well as their medical treatment and financial compensation,\" said world players' union FIFPro earlier this week.\"Within the last few weeks, FIFA has agreed to our request to start negotiating new conditions for women's national team players after the 2019 Women's World Cup and we are determined to making real and lasting progress on behalf of them.\"     In CNN Sport's \"World Cup Continental\" series, the thread which entwined female footballers around the world was that the battle for recognition and equality is ongoing. Yet, not only is there inequality between men's and women's teams, but there is also a gulf between the countries competing at France 2019. Only last month did the Jamaican Football Federation and its Women's World Cup squad agree contracts which at least ensures the players are being paid for representing their country at this tournament. READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in Jamaica Jamaica is the lowest-ranked team in the tournament. Before they departed for France, some of Jamaica's players held fundraising events, while Hue Menzies has coached the team -- the first Caribbean country to qualify for the Women's World Cup -- on a voluntary basis. Were it not for funding from the Bob Marley Foundation, the Reggae Girlz may not have been in a position to qualify for France. In recent years, Nigeria's Super Falcons have had to protest over unpaid bonuses and went through 2017 without playing an international match. There has been progress, but for some of the players the fight for change has been exhausting. \"It's really tiring to keep complaining about the same thing all the time without getting any improvement, but if you want something you don't stop talking,\" Asisat Oshoala, Nigeria's star striker, told CNN Sport. The absence of Ada Hegerberg, the first female recipient of the Ballon d'Or and widely regarded as the best player in the world, casts a shadow on the tournament.

But the USWNT's ongoing battle for equal pay illustrates that even for the most successful and well-funded teams more progress needs to be made.  Female footballers are more visible and powerful than ever before, while the women's game has certainly advanced, but for how long female footballers will have to fight for equality will depend on how the world looks back on France 2019.",

But this case is a little different.In Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday, Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry was pushed by a man sitting in the front row at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.It turns out the \"fan\" is Golden State Warriors investor Mark Stevens. He won't be attending any games for a year and he'll be writing a check for $500,000 to cover a fine announced by the team and the league.On Thursday, the NBA also announced it was banning Stevens from attending any team activities through the end of next season's playoffs.Earlier an NBA spokesman said team representatives are held to the highest possible standard.Read More\"The conduct of Golden State Warriors investor Mark Stevens last night was beyond unacceptable and has no place in our league,\" the spokesman, Mike Bass, said in a statement.          View this post on Instagram           \ud83d\udde3There's absolutely no place in our BEAUTIFUL game for that AT ALL. There's so many issues here. When you sit courtside you absolutely know what comes with being on the floor and if you don't know it's on the back on the ticket itself that states the guidelines. But he himself being a fan but more importantly PART-OWNER of the Warriors knew exactly what he was doing which was so uncalled for. He knew the rules more than just the average person sitting watching the game courtside so for that Something needs to be done ASAP! A swift action for his actions. Just think to yourself, what if @kyle_lowry7 would have reacted and put his hands back on him. You guys would be going CRAZY!! Calling for him to damn near be put in jail let alone being suspended for the rest of the Finals all because he was protected himself. I've been quite throughout the whole NBA playoffs watching every game (haven't missed one) but after I saw what I saw last night, took time to let it manifest into my thinking \ud83e\udde2 I couldn't and wouldn't be quiet on this! #ProtectThePlayers #PrivilegeAintWelcomeHere A post shared by  LeBron James (@kingjames) on Jun 6, 2019 at 9:42am PDT Lowry, going after a loose ball, jumped into the stands. Stevens, whom Lowry didn't land on, shoved him. Lowry called for security, and Stevens was escorted out. The NBA said Stevens also directed obscene comments at Lowry, whose team led by 10 points at the time, earlier in the fourth quarter. The Raptors went on to win 123-109 have a 2-1 series lead.The Warriors released a statement on Stevens earlier Thursday.\"Mr. Stevens' behavior last night did not reflect the high standards that we hope to exemplify as an organization,\" the statement said. \"We're extremely disappointed in his actions and, along with Mr. Stevens, offer our sincere apology to Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors organization for this unfortunate misconduct. There is no place for such interaction between fans -- or anyone -- and players at an NBA game.\"Stevens said in a statement Thursday that he accepts his punishment.\"I take full responsibility for my actions last night at the NBA Finals and am embarrassed by what transpired,\" Stevens said. \"What I did was wrong and there is no excuse for it.\"Mr. Lowry deserves better, and I have reached out today in an attempt to directly apologize to him and other members of the Raptors and Warriors organizations. I'm grateful to those who accepted my calls. I hope that Mr. Lowry and others impacted by this lapse in judgment understand that the behavior I demonstrated last night does not reflect the person I am or have been throughout my life. I made a mistake and I'm truly sorry. I need to be better and look forward to making it right.\"Speaking to reporters Thursday, Lowry said \"there's no room in our game\" for what Stevens did.\"In that situation, I don't think I could have handled it any better,\" Lowry said. \"I'm glad I did what I did, and I understand that things could have been a lot different if I reacted a different way or if I did something or put my hands on him or did anything of that nature.\"But the support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done. He's not a good look for the ownership group that they have. And I know Joe Lacob. Those guys are great guys. The ownership that they have that I know, they're unbelievable guys. But a guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.\"Stevens is listed in the Warriors media guide as one of the organization's executive board members. It's not immediately known how much of a stake Stevens has in the team.Earlier Thursday, the NBA Players Association said it will be closely monitoring the Warriors and the league's investigation into the situation, NBPA executive director Michele Roberts said in a statement.\"The NBPA has previously expressed its support of a 'zero-tolerance' policy with respect to verbal and/or physical assaults perpetrated against players,\" Roberts said. \"Stevens' status as a member of the ownership group does not alter that view.\"Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James also weighed in on Thursday, saying that what Stevens did was \"so uncalled for.\"\"He knew the rules more than just the average person sitting watching the game courtside so for (that's) something needs to be done ASAP!\" James said in an Instagram post. \"A swift action for his actions.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Roger Federer's comeback at the French Open is over. But Rafael Nadal just keeps going as he usually does at Roland Garros after downing the Swiss 6-3 6-4 6-2 to reach a 12th final.  The 39th meeting of the tennis behemoths didn't match the drama of their 2008 Wimbledon epic or 2017 Australian Open classic but will be remembered for one big thing, the wind.  Organizers were surely relieved the rain that caused havoc Wednesday didn't resurface early Friday, as some forecasts suggested another complete washout was a possibility. Yet Mother Nature still sought to intervene. And did.  There was light drizzle for the captivating women's semifinals before a huge breeze rose up for the men's semifinals. Temperatures additionally struggled to top 17 degrees Celsius (63 Fahrenheit). Federer and Nadal, who own 37 majors between them, took turns pausing before serves as gusts blew clay into their eyes and the ball danced once airborne. Read More\"The conditions out there today have been so hard, so difficult to manage,\" said Nadal. \"Was the day to be just focused, accept all the adversities. That's what I tried to do.\"  Photos: Nadal still perfect against Federer at French OpenRafael Nadal (right) exchanges a hug with Roger Federer after they played in the French Open semifinals. Who won? Nadal, to improve to 6-0 against the Swiss at Roland Garros.

Hide Caption 7 of 7The victorious Spaniard won't know who he will encounter in the final until Saturday, since the second semifinal between world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and last year's finalist Dominic Thiem was surprisingly suspended in a third set with Thiem leading the 15-time major champion 6-2 3-6 3-1. The rain made another visit. When play was called off, however, at around 6:30 pm local time, the rain had stopped.  An annoyed Djokovic -- seeking to win four straight grand slams for the second time in his career -- had wanted play to be halted in the first set due to the playing conditions but he was denied by supervisor Andreas Egli. Whoever eventually wins will be at a sizable disadvantage Sunday, bereft of the usual day off between the semis and finale as they try to dethrone Nadal.  READ: Teen Vondrousova to meet Barty in French Open finalREAD: Women's semifinal venue's 'unfair and inappropriate''Surprised myself'Novak Djokovic wanted play halted in the first set of his semifinal against Dominic Thiem due to the playing conditions but his request was denied. Nadal said only last week that hailing from an island -- Mallorca -- he was accustomed to wind and adapts well to such breezy conditions. His heavily spun ground strokes help with control. The numbers backed him up as the newly turned 33-year-old struck 33 winners, dovetailing with a mere 19 unforced errors. Federer wasn't dismal by any means, tallying 25 winners and 34 unforced errors. The wind aside, clay is Nadal's preferred surface. He improved to 6-0 at the French Open against his 37-year-old friend and 14-2 on dirt altogether. Federer's five-match winning streak over Nadal that stretched back to 2015 vanished, like last weekend's summery conditions in the French capital. But he can at least start to think about the grass following a likely break. Even so, the 20-time grand slam champion felt it was a successful return to the French Open after missing the previous three editions to prepare for his preferred grass of Wimbledon.  \"I thought it was a great tournament,\" said Federer. \"I really enjoyed it. Crowd support couldn't have been better. Maybe one of the best ever in my entire 20-year career that I have been on tour at a slam. \"In terms of playing, I think I played really, actually, well. You know, I think I surprised myself maybe how deep I got in this tournament and how well I actually was able to play throughout.\" Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosRafael Nadal reached his 12th French Open final in Paris. 'Biggest regret'Federer called his Australian Open victory against Nadal two years one of the finest moments of his record-breaking career, and downing the 11-time champion at Roland Garros would have come close to topping that.But for that to happen Federer needed to take every half chance -- like an underdog in football facing Barcelona or Manchester City. Despite the first set being about how to cope with the conditions, Federer said, he started well enough. The 2009 champion earned a break point in the first game. He failed to capitalize and Nadal broke immediately for 2-0. Even though Federer got back on serve, Nadal restored his break advantage by converting on his sixth chance at 3-2. The second set, as Federer admitted, was truly his opportunity. He led 2-0, threatened but couldn't break Nadal at 4-3, and then was broken from 40-0 at 4-4. The miniscule chance of a comeback fizzled. \"Second set, I think there is definitely the biggest regret to get broken at two love with the wind in my back,\" said Federer. \"If I can avoid that one, maybe the second set turns out to be different.\" JUST WATCHEDRed clay and no roof: The unique Roland GarrosReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRed clay and no roof: The unique Roland Garros 02:35Chanting his nameNadal was now in full flow, doing his thing. He ripped backhand passing shots, curled forehands down the line and defended well when Federer attacked. Federer called him unique, despite seeing players come and go over the course of his 20-year career.  \"I don't even know who I need to go search for to go practice with somebody who plays like him,\" said Federer. \"I was thinking that during the match. It's just amazing how he plays from deep and then is able to bounce back and forth from the baseline. It's just quite interesting.\" Relayed his comments, Nadal replied: \"I don't find any sparring partners, either, playing like Federer. There are no two people like Federer on this planet. Luckily, actually.\"     Frustrated when a net-cord adversely affected a volley on break point at 1-1, Federer duly slammed a ball skywards. Nadal's combination of a drop shot and forehand flick to break for 4-1 in the third had much of the crowd on Philippe Chatrier gasping in appreciation. But on Nadal's second match point, the spectators began to chant Federer's name, fully aware that this could have been his last ever appearance at Roland Garros. The chants continued as he departed and Federer told reporters he wasn't sure if he'd be back.  \"Next year, just like with any other tournament, I don't know. We'll see what happens,\" he said. It was Nadal who left as the winner, again, at Roland Garros.",

France took notice of two of those three nuggets of advice at least, as the home nation ensured a copybook start to its Women's World Cup campaign with a commanding performance against South Korea.Before a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes, a team shouldering a country's desire for history swept aside inferior opponents with a comfortable 4-0 win.Follow @cnnsport\n\nOn the morning of opening day of this anticipated tournament, the front pages of the French national newspapers had pictures of the country's female footballers. \"One more time,\" wrote L'Equipe, referring to France's victory in the men's version of this competition last year, while Aujourd'hui en France proclaimed \"on a quest for the world.\"There is much pressure on France's women, a desire for the team to become world champions for the first time, paving the way for the country to lay claim to being the preeminent footballing country of the era -- the first to simultaneously hold both the men's and the women's World Cup titles.The build-up has been intense. But after the pageantry of the opening ceremony and the passionate rendition of the national anthem, and despite the presence of the country's president, there were no visible sign of nerves from the home team.Read MoreREAD: How Bob Marley's daughter saved women's football in Jamaica French President Emmanuel Macron and French first lady Brigitte Macron applaud ahead of the start of the Women's World Cup.In a cafe in the shadows of the stadium, the flags of the nations competing in a tournament described as the most important Women's World Cup in history hung from the facades. \"Vive le France,\" cried a group of enthusiastic young fans, dressed in red white and blue, four hours before kick off.But Paris has not been taken over by Women's World Cup fever. Not yet at least. On a dreary afternoon in the heart of the French capital, neither along the banks of the Seine or in the vicinity of the Eiffel Tower was there evidence that, just five kilometers away, a 45,261 crowd would be congregating later that evening for the opening match of a global tournament.Perhaps many events would be swallowed up in such a vast city. Many, perhaps, other than the men's World Cup and the French Open, the second tennis grand slam of the year which is reaching its climax in Paris this weekend.The semifinals and finals will be held in Lyon, the heart of women's football and the home of the reigning women's Champions League winners, and a city which is likely to be more consumed by this four-week festival of football expected to be watched on television by a billion people.But three of the matches being played in the capital have sold out and inside the Parc des Princes on a blustery Friday evening there was no questioning the passion of the partisan crowd, which appeared to be a mix of both young and old, male and female.They cheered at the first glimpse of their compatriots on the big screen, waiting in the bowels of the stadium before making their entrance.READ: Football is life -- the Nigerian women taking on the worldNo opening ceremony is complete without pyrotechnics ...And massed dancing ...VAR used for first time at Women's World CupRanked fourth in the world and with seven members of Lyon's Champions League-winning side in the ranks, France should progress from Group A with ease and should reach the semifinals at least.However, with this being the most competitive Women's World Cup since its inception in 1991 it is difficult to predict whether the women in blue will match what their male counterparts did in Russia last year.Few opponents will be more obliging over the next month as South Korea, a country competing in its third Women's World Cup but which has only one victory at the tournament to its name. Rare was the sight of a white-shirted South Korean in the opposition half. French goalkeeper Sarah Bouhaddi didn't have to make a save until the second half.     The home team went ahead in the ninth minute when Eugenie Le Sommer side-footed home captain Amandine Henry's low cross.Other than Bouhaddi, the entire team gathered near the corner flag in celebration. Much joy, and perhaps a touch of relief, to make such a superb start.South Korea was too poor an opponent to make this match a spectacle. France thought it had scored a second in the 27th minute when Griedge Mbock Bathy superbly volleyed home only for VAR to disallow the goal for offside.  A chorus of boos rippled around the stadium before France went on the attack again, and again. And again.A second goal came in the 35th minute when Wendie Renard headed home from a corner and in added time came the third. Again it was Renard rising high at the far post and producing a bullet header.Eugenie Le Sommer celebrates France's first goal.Wendie Renard added two more goals in the second half.'Entrenched in chauvinism'South Korea improved after the break, closing down quicker and even going close to scoring when a defensive lapse allowed Lee Mina clear on goal, but a deserved goal for captain Henry late in the game lifted the crowd and ensured the match concluded with boisterous renditions of \"Allez Les Bleus.\" After the final whistle France showed appreciation for the home support with a lap of the stadium. This tournament doesn't need a home triumph for it to be successful, but having the home nation in the latter stages would add to the sense of joie de vivre to a competition which, according to FIFA, is \"smashing records.\"Nearly a million tickets have been sold and never before has there been such a wealth of talent or as many title contenders and, perhaps, never before has women's football had such a platform.But the golden hue surrounding France 2019 -- the sell-out crowds, the record television audiences -- should not mask the inequalities that still exist.There is continued criticism of FIFA, the sport's governing body, over the prize money on offer at this tournament.Raised from $15 million to $30 million, the overall prize fund has doubled since 2015, but for the 2018 men's World Cup the pot was $400 million, with winners France taking home $38 million.Former USA goalkeeper Hope Solo told BBC Sport earlier this week that the disparity illustrated that FIFA was \"entrenched in chauvinism.\"READ: The match that changed women's footballIn CNN Sport's \"World Cup Continental\" series, the thread which entwined female footballers around the world was that the battle for recognition and equality is ongoing.Yet, not only is there inequality between men's and women's teams, but there is also a gulf between the countries competing in France.Much remains to be improved upon, but this was the perfect start to a tournament which promises much.",

Although the ICC says the insignia flaunts regulations, it stresses Dhoni will face no penalty. Indian Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju has asked the Indian cricket board (BCCI) to intervene on Dhoni's behalf. Read More\"The government does not interfere in matters of sports bodies, they are autonomous,\" he said on Twitter.\"But when the issue is related to the feelings of the country, then the interest of the nation has to be kept in mind.

Vinod Rai, the head of Indian cricket's Committee of Administrators, said Dhoni \"is not in breach of ICC regulations.\"\"The BCCI had already sent a formal request to the ICC for clearance,\" he told Press Trust of India. \"As per ICC regulations, players can't sport any commercial, religious or military logo. There was nothing commercial or religious in this regard as we all know.\"And it is not the paramilitary regimental dagger that is embossed in his gloves.\"Later on Friday, the ICC issued a statement saying it had responded to the BCCI \"to confirm the logo displayed by MS Dhoni in the previous match is not permitted to be worn on his wicket-keeping gloves at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019.\"The regulations for ICC events do not permit any individual message or logo to be displayed on any items of clothing or equipment. In addition to this, the logo also breaches the regulations in relation to what is permitted on wicketkeeper gloves.\"This isn't the first time Dhoni has been criticized for \"politicizing\" sport.In March, shortly after an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed more than 40 paramilitaries, he distributed military-style camouflage caps to his Indian teammates who wore them during an international game.The BCCI wouldn't respond to CNN for comment.",

The 92nd Scripps National Spelling Bee had an epic ending with eight co-champions.The spelling bee was finally over after it went 20 rounds, which included a run of 47 correct words. Thursday night's unprecedented decision was made after round 17, when it was announced that while there were plenty of words left in the dictionary, there were only enough challenging words for three final rounds.The eight co-champions are: Rishik Gandhasri; Erin Howard; Saketh Sundar; Shruthika Padhy; Sohum Sukhatankar; Abhijay Kodali; Christopher Serrao; and Rohan Raja. \"We have plenty of words left on our list but will soon run out of words that would challenge you,\" said the Bee's official pronouncer Dr. Jacques Bailly, calling those remaining in the 17th round \"the most phenomenal assemblage of super-spellers\" in the competition's history. The crowd agreed with a standing ovation.Read More\"We're throwing the dictionary at you and so far, you are showing the dictionary who is boss.\"And, sure enough, all of the competitors from round 17 made it to the end. The Dictionary concedes and adds that it is SO. PROUD. https://t.co/VY3TmUAwpr\u2014 Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) May 31, 2019\n\nThursday night's finals went on more than an hour and half past the scheduled time with words like omphalopsychite, Geeldikkop and auftaktigkeit.Spellcheck may not recognize these words, but the champions sure did.Five rounds and 47 words in a row were spelled perfectly. Each of the eight champions will receive a $50,000 prize.Memorable momentsEven as the night grew late and the tension ran high, many competitors would still offer high fives or a clasp of hands as another student prepared for or came back from successfully spelling their word. By the end, it was full hugs of support for one another.The kids got tired, some misheard words at times, but their determination never broke as they carefully worked through each spelling. Rohan Raja, 13, of Irving, Texas, spells the last word in competition as the remaining competitors celebrate an eight-way tie.Rohan bemoaned to Bailly how funny he sounded pronouncing two of his words in a row with guttural noises, but that didn't rock his performance.And, once it got late, Rishik spoke for everyone in the audience by tiredly asking what the time was when he went to spell his word. It was 11:18 p.m. Almost an hour past the scheduled end time.Erin Howard, 14, of Huntsville, Alabama, one of eight co-champions, reacts to her final word in the final round.Erin was exuberant for much of the competition but was brought to near tears of happiness when she heard the word that, if spelled correctly, would make her one of the champions: erysipelas. She knew she had it before she even began spelling.

Contestants came from all 50 states, as well as several territories and other countries including the Bahamas, Canada, Germany, Ghana, Jamaica, Japan and South Korea.Most of the competitors attend public schools.And the words they spelled are not on a regular middle school spelling test. This feat takes hours of repetition, coaching from a teacher or loved one, and study of etymology, or the origin of words.CNN's Martijn Edelman and Gabrielle Sorto contributed to this report.",

At first glance, that makes sense: The Soviet Union did not take part in Operation Overlord, the massive amphibious invasion that laid the groundwork for the liberation of western Europe in World War II. But Putin has attended in the past. In 2014, he attended the 70th anniversary of the 1944 Allied landings. Asked on Thursday why he was not invited, Putin dismissed the suggestion that he was deliberately snubbed. Trump bids farewell and thank you to the greatest generation\"As to whether I was invited or not, we also do not invite everyone to every event,\" Putin said. \"Why do I have to be invited everywhere to some event? Am I a wedding general, or what? I have enough of my own business. This is not a problem at all.\"But Putin also used the question to draw attention to a longstanding Russian grievance: The perception that the Soviet population's massive sacrifices in World War II have been somehow overlooked in the West. Read More\"As for the opening of the Second Front, I draw your attention to the fact that this is the Second Front,\" Putin said, referring to the Normandy landings. \"The first was with us.

The war against Nazi Germany, in the Russian view, ended decisively with the fall of Berlin to the Red Army in 1945. It's a touchy subject for Russia. Veneration of the Soviet war dead has been elevated to something approaching a secular religion in Russia, particularly after the collapse of the USSR and the demise of Communism as a guiding ideology. But the past isn't past for Russia. The long shadow of World War II still hangs over Russia's foreign policy.In comments ahead of the D-Day commemorations, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova took a swipe at the ceremony, saying: \"The Normandy landings were not a game-changer for the outcome of WWII and the Great Patriotic War. The outcome was determined by the Red Army's victories -- mainly, in Stalingrad and Kursk. For three years, the UK and then the US dragged out opening the Second Front.\" Picture taken during the winter of 1942-43 shows Soviet soldiers driving out the German army during the Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning-point in the Allied victory over Germany during World War II. The battle, lost in February 1943 by the Germans, cost 70,000 German lives and yielded 91,000 prisoners-of-war to the Russians. Zakharova's remarks drew immediate condemnation. \"The USSR bore the brunt of the fight +lost 20 million people!\" wrote retired US Ambassador (and former State Department spokesperson) Nicholas Burns on Twitter. \"It was the key ally. The U.S. sent significant supply of planes, tanks+munitions to the Red Army. But simply wrong for Moscow to discount the heroism of our soldiers on D-Day\u2014a turning point of the war in the West.\"The USSR bore the brunt of the fight +lost 20 million people!  It was the key ally.  The U.S. sent significant supply of planes, tanks+munitions to the Red Army.

Why was Putin not invited to D-Day commemoration?\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Is it: (A) Red Army played no part in Normandy invasion (B) Russia today conducts low-intensity war against its neighbor, having made biggest land grab in Europe since WW II I'm going with: (C) Both of the above.\" Let's see. Why was Putin not invited to D-Day commemoration?  Is it:(A)  Red Army played no part in Normandy invasion(B)  Russia today conducts low-intensity war against its neighbor, having made biggest land grab in Europe since WW III'm going with:(C)  Both of the above https://t.co/aFzocHt9ep\u2014 Steven Pifer (@steven_pifer) June 6, 2019\n\nPifer here was referring to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 by Russia, a move many world leaders have seen as a dangerous break from the post-war order in Europe after 1945 -- and one that for some appeared to have historic parallels with Hitler's annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, a prelude to World War II.That may seem like ancient history, but Russia keeps replaying it. Zakharova has dedicated considerable time in her briefings decrying the \"Munich betrayal\" -- the 1938 agreement ceding the Sudetenland to Germany. Highlighting the piece of paper that UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain waved on returning from Munich presents a convenient counter-argument: It allows Russia to gloss over the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the nonaggression pact between Hitler and Stalin that paved the way for the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and the Soviet invasion a few weeks later. In short, the memory and massive sacrifice of World War II is still a way for Russia to claim the moral high ground both in current affairs. In his comments on the D-Day celebration, Putin claimed about the \"glorification of Nazism\" that was going on in Ukraine and the Baltic states, a familiar Russian propaganda line that continues -- despite the fact that Ukraine, for instance, just elected an ethnically Jewish president. For the Kremlin, Soviet suffering in World War II is a megaphone that drowns out all other argument.",

        "content": "Peterborough, United Kingdom (CNN)Nigel Farage's Brexit Party has been denied its first seat in the UK Parliament, after the opposition Labour Party held on to the seat of Peterborough in eastern England in a tight by-election race. Despite winning huge support across the UK during last month's European election, the Brexit Party was edged out by Labour by a margin of 683 votes.Addressing supporters after the count, Labour candidate Lisa Forbes hailed her party's victory as a sign that the \"politics of division\" would not triumph.Forbes, a union activist, won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party's Mike Greene, who took 9,801 votes. Prime Minister Theresa May's governing Conservatives came third, with 7,243 votes, while the Liberal Democrats took 4,159 votes. Turnout was 48%. A remarkable result for our 8 week old party. If we can come so close in our 201st target seat, no seat is safe. We're very proud of @MikeGreeneTBP & our supporters who worked so hard. Thanks to the people of Peterborough who voted for us - we promise you that we're here to stay! pic.twitter.com/ARmLuADZ1P\u2014 The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) June 7, 2019\n\nThe result is something of a setback for the insurgent Brexit Party, which since its launch in April has moved to harness dissatisfaction among traditional Labour and Conservative voters, many of whom have grown frustrated at the inability of traditional parties to deliver Brexit. Read MoreLed by Farage, the former head of the UK Independence Party, the Brexit Party has advocated for a no-deal departure from the European Union. At last month's European Parliament election in the UK, the party secured 31.71% of the overall vote -- the largest share for a single political party. Despite his party failing to secure the seat, Farage hailed the result as a \"fundamental\" change in British politics.\"Two party politics is no longer going to be business as usual,\" he told CNN. \"Something very big is changing here -- a huge number of people don't trust the existing political parties.\"Labour's victory was marred by an anti-Semitism controversy. In the final days of the campaign, it was revealed that Forbes had liked a post on Facebook that said British Prime Minister Theresa May had a \"Zionist Slave Masters agenda.\"Forbes said she hadn't seen the text but was reacting to the accompanying images of children praying after the Christchurch terror attack in New Zealand.In another Facebook comment, Forbes said she had \"enjoyed reading\" posts that claimed Islamic extremism had been stoked by the CIA and Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. After her victory, Forbes said she was not anti-Semitic. \"I think anti-Semitism is abhorrent,\" she she told Sky News. \"I just hope that people will understand that I don't have a bad bone in my body towards any race of people and anti-Semitism is something that I condemn completely.\"Two official complaints have been filed against Forbes over the issue. One of the complaints came from Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who said she had \"seriously mixed feelings about the Peterborough result.\"\"I never want to see Nigel Farage's party in Parliament. But Lisa Forbes & the Labour Party have a lot to answer for,\" she tweeted.Europe figured strongly in the Peterborough campaign. The city voted overwhelmingly for Brexit during the 2016 referendum and again for the Brexit Party at the recent European elections. The failure of the Conservatives to secure a higher share of the final vote could now galvanize those inside the party who feel that in order to beat Labour at the next general election -- and neutralize the threat posed by Farage -- they must support a more hard-line supporter of Brexit for their next leader.  For Labour supporters, the result will likely provide a boost following the party's poor showing at the European elections -- and help ease pressure on leader Jeremy Corbyn.In a statement posted early Friday morning UK time, Corbyn declared the result a rejection of \"Tory austerity\" and praised what he described as the party's \"people powered campaign.\" This result shows that despite the divisions and deadlock over Brexit, when it comes to a vote on the issues that directly affect people's lives, Labour's case for real change has strong support across the country.I look forward to welcoming Lisa to parliament next week.\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) June 7, 2019\n\n\"Despite the divisions and deadlock over Brexit, when it comes to issues that directly affect people's lives, Labour's case for real change has strong support across the country,\" said Corbyn. The by-election was triggered when the incumbent Labour lawmaker, Fiona Onasanya, was ousted by constituents in a recall petition, owing to a conviction in relation to a speeding offense.Anna Stewart contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)The way Roger Federer was talking ahead of his battle against Rafael Nadal at the French Open, you would think something especially crazy has to happen for Spain's \"King of Clay\" to lose their semifinal. \"Every match needs to be played before it's decided, and that's exactly what everybody believes by facing Rafa,\" Federer, the 20-time grand slam winner, told reporters. \"They know it's going to be tough but you just never know. \"He might have a problem. He might be sick. You might be playing great for some reason and he is struggling. Maybe there's incredible wind, rain, 10 rain delays. \"You just don't know.\"What we do know is that Federer has never beaten Nadal -- who owns a record 11 French Open titles and 17 majors -- in their five Roland Garros contests. Overall on clay, he trails his newly turned 33-year-old pal 13-2. Nadal holds a 23-15 advantage in the on-court rivalry that has transcended tennis.

It would unquestionably be one of the biggest wins of his career, especially as he is 37. Federer, of course, is back in Paris for the first time since 2015, preferring to miss the clay-court major to preserve his body and focus on Wimbledon, where he has won a record eight titles.READ: How underarm serves are making a comeback in tennisBut if Federer creates break points and increases his conversion rate, he could very well stun the lefty and progress to a first French Open final since a tight-four set reverse to Nadal in 2011. Despite the unblemished record in Paris against Federer, only one of Nadal's victories has been a blowout. It was, indeed, a huge blowout in 2008, when Federer grabbed a meager four games in a 6-1 6-3 6-0 drubbing that lasted an hour and 48 minutes -- exactly three hours fewer than their seismic Wimbledon clash a month later, which was also won by Nadal and is often revered as one of tennis' greatest ever matches.Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosFederer and Nadal will meet in Paris for the first time since 2011. Break points keyBut in their four other matches in Paris, Federer created more total break points with 54 yet only converted 15 times or 28%. Nadal by contrast earned 50 break points but converted 24 times or 48%. Even though Federer went an eye-catching 2-for-18 against fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals Tuesday, he lifted his level in the two tiebreaks that heavily influenced the outcome. Federer also enters the match against Nadal holding an unprecedented five-match winning streak in their head-to-heads. There are additionally no fresh scars from any clay-court losses since their last duel on the surface came in Rome in 2013. \"What I will do is try to do my best so that the victories I have won on this surface against him count for something,\" said Nadal. \"And he will do his utmost to make sure that his latest victories against me have their weight. And so we'll see.\"      Two days between the quarterfinal and semifinal -- their half of the draw began first, a bonus with the inclement weather that has wreaked havoc with the other half -- gives Federer not only time to recover from the three-and-a-half hour outing against Wawrinka but more time to practice against a left-hander. Nadal will be the first left-hander he has confronted this tournament and first since Fernando Verdasco in February in Dubai. \"For me it's a complete switch around,\" said Federer. \"Just the way the ball goes out of your strings with different spins, it's just different. \"So you have to get used to that quickly. Don't have much time to waste.\"      Net approachesFederer accumulated an elevated 60 points at the net against Wawrinka and the tactic mostly paid off. He got joy against Wawrinka serving and volleying on second serves, most notably in the pivotal third set.

Nadal, however, is a superior defender than Wawrinka.  \"The level of tennis that you need to play always is the highest against Federer,\" said Nadal. \"And I am playing well, but I need to play very well against him. I hope to be ready to make that happen.\"When Wawrinka was asked for a prediction, he played it safe: \"I cannot see the future.\" He is friends with Federer and has a healthy dose of respect for Nadal, too, not to mention knowing the latter's record at Roland Garros. Nadal crushed him in the 2017 final.  But he said he will be watching on Friday, like hundreds of thousands, if not more, around the world.",

However Hoegel was acquitted of 15 cases on Thursday because there was not enough evidence.     Hoegel was accused of giving his victims various non-prescribed drugs, in an attempt to show off his resuscitation skills to colleagues and fight off boredom.Read MoreIn past hearings, Hoegel said he felt euphoric when he managed to bring a patient back to life, and devastated when he failed.Police suspect the true death toll may be as high as 200, but can't be certain as many patients were cremated before autopsies could be performed, reported Agence France-Presse news (AFP) agency. The former nurse is already serving a life sentence for six convictions, including homicide and attempted homicide in 2008 and 2015. Those convictions led authorities to investigate hundreds of deaths and exhume the bodies of former patients in the clinics where he worked.Hoegel asked his victims' families for forgiveness on Wednesday for his \"horrible acts.\"\"I would like to sincerely apologize for everything I did to you over the course of years,\" he said during the hearing, AFP reported.'Collective amnesia'One of the biggest questions in the case is how Hoegel was able to murder so many people apparently under the watch of hospital staff.Former colleagues at the Delmenhorst clinic where he worked admitted to having had their suspicions about Hoegel, according to AFP. But all the staff from the other hospital in Oldenburg who testified said they were oblivious to the rising death toll.During sentencing Judge Sebastian Buehrmann criticized what he called staff's \"collective amnesia,\" adding that Hoegel's killing spree was \"incomprehensible.\"About 126 relatives of the victims are co-plaintiffs in the trial, which has been running since October 2018.CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this story.",

It's unusual for a World Cup final not to be played in the host country's capital city, but in the case of Lyon -- France's third largest city -- the women's game has found itself its own capital. At the heart of the city's story is Olympique Lyonnais' women's team. Thirteen league titles, six-time Champions League winners, the first team, male or female, to win four successive Champions League titles -- no other football team can currently compare. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"Lyon has the perfect model of how you should run a modern club,\" Ada Hegerberg, Lyon's Norwegian striker and Ballon d'Or winner, told CNN Sport. Lyon's rise is down to one man, president Jean-Michel Aulas, who believed in his \"girls\" before anyone else did. Aulas, 70, has been in charge of the club since 1987. When he took over the female section of the club in 2004, he felt it was the moment to promote the women's game in his country.\n\nWe've started on a blank page and tried to imagine what tomorrow's women's football would be\nJean-Michel Aulas\nRead MoreSpeaking at the club's 59,000-seat stadium, Aulas told CNN Sport: \"We are on the eve of big and fascinating events here.\"Before 2004, the local women's football team was FC Lyon. Started in 1970, the ancestor of OL Women was already one of the greatest French clubs of the 1990s, according to Antoine Osanna, who reports on the women's game for local newspaper Le Progr\u00e8s. \"FC Lyon was competing against Juvisy. These two clubs have today disappeared, as FC Lyon was absorbed by OL and Juvisy by Paris FC,\" he explained from his desk at the newspaper's headquarters in the city.But in the mid-2000s, Aulas decided to lend a hand to a failing FC Lyon, using what he had learned from building the men's team to transform the women's team into a European giant. \"In Lyon, we're a bit of a football startup,\" Aulas added. \"We've started on a blank page and tried to imagine what tomorrow's women football would be and how we, through this startup adventure, could become a global company that could convince the others later on.\"\n\nThere is no women's football or men's football, only football and Lyon understands this better than anyone else\nMelissa Plaza\nFrom the beginning, Aulas and his team took the women's game seriously, sparing no expense by investing when competitors were  only surfing the wave. Men and women have access to the same training facilities, and the women's team often uses the men's stadium for big games. \"There is no women's football or men's football, only football and Lyon understands this better than anyone else,\" said Melissa Plaza, who played for Lyon during two seasons and now holds a PhD in Sports Psychology. Plaza wrote her thesis in gender stereotypes in sports.With a world-class performance from their striker Hegerberg -- she scored a hat-trick in a 4-1 win over Barcelona -- the Lyonnaises won a record sixth Champions League in nine years last month. Added to 13 league titles and eight French Cups, it makes them the most successful team in Europe.READ: Jamaica's remarkable journey to France 2019Lyon celebrates beating Barcelona in Budapest.Whereas France's top men's teams have struggled in European cup competitions, \"Les Fenottes\" have been confidently beating Europe's best for more than a decade. The secret to the team's success? \"The President, of course, but also the sum of talents that allows players, through the collective, to express themselves and win titles,\" said Reynald Pedros, a former Lyon player, who has been coaching the women's team for two years.\n\nIt seems easy to win titles for Olympique Lyonnais, but nothing is easy\nReynald Pedros\n\"It seems easy to win titles for Olympique Lyonnais, but nothing is easy. There is a lot of work to be done each time, a lot on investment, and this is why they deserve it. \"Coaching the best team in Europe and being able to recruit any players each summer is working under exceptional conditions,\" added Pedros, who gladly accepts the comparison with countryman Zinedine Zidane, a Frenchman who won the Champions League three years in a row as coach of Real Madrid.Pedros has forged a collective spirit, which is Lyon's biggest strength. Dounia Mesli, the founder of Coeurs de Foot, a French website specialized on the women's game, told CNN Sport: \"Lyon is more than a sum of individuality, an incredible team of women. Their rivals can't compete on that level. PSG, for instance, does not have this collective culture yet. They are more individualistic. That might be why they fall short from winning the title.\"READ: From nuclear disaster to World Cup winnersPedros has been Lyon coach since 2017.But individuals certainly stand out for Lyon. The team's most recognizable player, Hegerberg, was the recipient of the first women's Ballon d'Or award last December. In Lyon, the 23-year old -- who will not play in the World Cup after she stepped away from the Norwegian national team due to frustrations with the way women's football was treated in her country -- feels at home. \"We're so well integrated into the men's club, you could say. It is our club, men's and women's teams,\" she said.Parc Olympique Lyonnais, which hosted games for the 2016 European Championship and last year's Europa League final, is one of Aulas' most visible achievements. The venue is mostly used by the men's team, but hosts the women for their most important games. In April, Lyon defeated rivals PSG 5-0 in a title-decider, setting a new French record attendance of 25,907 for a women's league game.READ: The female footballers who fought for change in South AmericaAround 180,000 fans are expected in Lyon in the final week of the Women's World Cup. In an interview with CNN, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said that attitudes towards the women's game had changed in his homeland. \"You see that in the headlines, the women's team gets now in the newspapers. There's more credit, more expectation and more attendances in the stadium. It's positive, the trend is very positive in France for women's football,\" said Wenger. The announcement of the French squad by coach Corinne Diacre on the national evening news program was followed by more than 5 million people and made the front page of l'Equipe, the national sports daily. \"There's a big hope in France. We have a good chance to do it. The pressure will be high,\" Wenger added. \"They look quite confident and recent results against the States shows the potential is there.

Exhibitions and conferences about the women's game will also be held, while Louis Nicollin, the late president of Montpellier Herault -- the first Ligue 1 side to invest in a women's team -- will also be honored. After France's men lifted the World Cup in Russia last year, France could become the first country to be world champion in both the men's and women's edition of the competition.

I can imagine you in the garden having tea with Janey and Anne getting ready to put them to bed.\"What was D-Day? D-Day -- the military term for the first day of the Normandy landings -- was the largest amphibious invasion ever undertaken and laid the foundations for the Allied defeat of Germany in World War II. The invasion took place on June 6, 1944, and saw of tens of thousands of troops from the United States, the UK, France and Canada landing on five stretches of the Normandy coastline -- codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword beaches.US troops landing on Omaha beach during the Normandy landingsPlanning for D-Day began more than a year in advance, and the Allies carried out substantial military deception -- codenamed Operation Bodyguard -- to confuse the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place. The operation was originally scheduled to begin on June 5, when a full moon and low tides were expected to coincide with good weather, but storms forced a 24-hour delay. What happened on D-Day? The amphibious landings -- codenamed Operation Overlord -- were preceded by an extensive bombing campaign to damage German defenses. Deception tactics employed in the months leading up to the attack led the Germans to believe that the initial attacks were merely a diversion and that the true invasion would take place further along the coast. Allied divisions began landing on the five beaches at 06.30 on June 6. The US troops were assigned to Utah beach at the base of the Cotentin Peninsular and Omaha beach at the northern end of the Normandy coast. The British subsequently landed on Gold Beach, followed by the Canadians at Juno, and finally the British at Sword, the easternmost point of the invasion.      By midnight on June 6, the troops had secured their beachheads and moved further inland from Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword. However, not all the landings were successful; US forces suffered substantial losses at Omaha beach, where strong currents forced many landing craft away from their intended positions, delaying and hampering the invasion strategy. Heavy fire from German positions on the steep cliffs, which had not been effectively destroyed by Allied bombing before the invasion, also caused casualties.US assault troops and equipment landing on Omaha beach the day following D-Day D-Day in numbers In total, around 7,000 ships took part in the invasion, including 1,213 warships and 4,127 landing craft.  What D-Day taught my grandpaSome 24,000 Allied troops were also dropped behind enemy lines shortly after midnight on the day of the invasion, and 132,000 men landed on the beaches. The troops were supported by 12,000 Allied aircraft, and 10,000 vehicles were delivered to the five beaches. On D-Day alone, 4,414 Allied troops were confirmed dead, with more than 9,000 wounded or missing. The precise number of German casualties on the day is unknown, but they are estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000.What followed D-Day?Despite securing a stronghold on the French coast on D-Day, the Allied forces faced the risk that bombardment by the Germans could push them back into the sea. They needed to build up troop numbers and equipment in Normandy faster than the Germans, allowing for a continued invasion into mainland Europe. The Allies used their air power to slow the German advance toward Normandy by blowing up bridges, railways and roads across the region. This allowed the Allies to gain total control of Normandy 77 days later and move on toward Paris, which they liberated in August 1944.",

I didn't because I knew how good Ruiz is.\"Andy Ruiz Jr. (right) punches Anthony Joshua during his surpise victory. READ: Kash Ali -- Boxer given six-month ban for biting David PriceRead More'We're both fat'Much has been made of Ruiz's physical condition for the fight, sharply juxtaposed by Joshua's chiseled body. Despite Fury's less than complimentary remarks about Ruiz's body mass -- he weighed in at 268 pounds -- the British fighter has nothing but praise for the Mexican's boxing ability and credits the 29-year-old for \"lighting up\" the division. \"I'm happy that he's a fat guy. We're both fat,\" said the 30-year-old Fury. \"He's an inspiration for all fat people out there.Anthony Joshua: 'I had no panic attack,' says boxer after shock defeat\"Everyone has always been told you need to be in shape, you need to be looking good, you need to have a great body,\" added Fury. \"He's [Ruiz] just defied everything, the laws of ethics, because he came and he wasn't in great shape, he didn't look like a fighter and he knocked out this guy [who] looked like an Adonis.\"Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn said on Tuesday that a rematch would take place in November or December when Joshua will attempt to regain the WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO titles from Ruiz.However, Fury, who is looking to regain the world titles he forfeited in 2016, can only see one outcome -- another defeat for Joshua. \"Styles do make fights and if he [Joshua] could have done anything he'd have done it there and then that other night,\" said Fury. \"AJ didn't just get knocked out fluky, he got beaten up first and then knocked out.\"When asked how he would have overcame Ruiz, Fury quipped: \"Just give him a couple of chocolate bars in between rounds.\"JUST WATCHEDAnthony Joshua on combating racism: 'Our parents' generation has been sleeping'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAnthony Joshua on combating racism: 'Our parents' generation has been sleeping' 01:07Ruiz on beating JoshuaSpeaking in the days after the fight, Ruiz pointed to the strategy he pursued to secure his stunning victory which made him Mexico's first ever heavyweight champion.\"The key of beating Joshua was the speed, the combinations, the pressure. I couldn't be scared,\" he told CNNE.\"All the people that he fights are scared so I didn't want to show no angry or no respect. I just wanted to go in there and let my hands go and make it a real fight.\"Ruiz is now keen for the rematch to be held in his native country, which has never seen a heavyweight clash of this magnitude. \"I want all my Mexican people with me,\" he said.The \"Gypsy King\" has staged a remarkable comeback from severe mental health issues.READ: Boxing 'shooting itself in the foot,' says Dana WhiteMental health struggles Fury knows what it means to be the underdog after staging one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport -- returning from severe mental health issues and drug abuse to once again be a contender in the heavyweight division. \"Eighteen months ago, I didn't ever envision that I'd be back at this position, on the verge of suicide not wanting to live anymore,\" said the British boxer.\"I think when you give up the ambition to live you're in a bit of a dark place I'd say.\"Due to his two-year absence from the sport, the 30-year-old Fury faced issues with his weight. He weighed  276 pounds in his first comeback fight in 2018, where he easily beat Albanian boxer Sefer Seferi, but dedicated himself to an intense training regime to get back in proper fighting shape. What next for once 'invincible' star Anthony Joshua after shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr? Fury is now using his comeback to spread awareness of dealing with mental health problems and wants his journey to be an inspiration for others suffering in silence. \"If I can come back from it then anybody else can. I'm no special person, just a human being made of blood and bone,\" he said. \"But it's not what brings you to your knees, it's the character you show that makes you get back up again.\"Nonetheless, Fury admits he is still struggling daily with his anxiety and depression. \"I liken mental health to a famous song The Eagles wrote called 'Hotel California,'\" he said. \"There's a verse in that called 'you can check out anytime you want but you can never leave.' And that's mental health. \"You can check out and get help any time you want. But if you don't maintain and manage your mental health problems then it'll never go away. It never does go away.\"Fury insists he is not thinking about the Deontay Wilder rematch yet. READ: Anthony Joshua on combating racismFury's future Since Joshua's defeat, Fury believes the heavyweight division has become a two-horse race between himself and American fighter Deontay Wilder. The pair slugged out a highly controversial draw in December and a rematch has been penciled in, though no date has been set. Ahead of that fiercely anticipated rematch, Fury will take on German Tom Schwarz in Las Vegas on June 15. \"You can never look past any opponent as we saw last Saturday night,\" said Fury, referring to Joshua's defeat.\"So I must focus and give all my energy to this fight. I'm not interested in Deontay Wilder or anybody else, only Tom Schwartz.\"Despite insisting he hadn't thought of Wilder in recent months, Fury was keen in his CNN Sport interview to deliver a few verbal combinations for the undefeated American to ponder.\"I don't think about him in the morning, or in the afternoon, or in the evening. He's nothing to me but a bad bum in the shower,\" he said, vowing to beat Wilder whenever they next meet. \"That's all Deontay Wilder is. A little known world champion in his own country. That's what he is, a bum.\"Previously Wilder insisted he is too dangerous for Fury and is looking forward to the rematch.\"I have definitely got his number in a rematch. We are going to see who has got whose number. I am not worried about nothing,\" Wilder told talkSPORT earlier this week.",

The matches were pushed back to Thursday, as well as the remaining two men's quarterfinals, due to rain washing out all play in Paris a day earlier.

Busy Friday on the wayDjokovic and Thiem face off Friday in an appetizing semifinal but Rafael Nadal against Roger Federer is the main attraction. Due to the rain causing havoc with the schedule, both women's semifinals will take place away from center court starting at 11 am in Paris.

Anisimova's smooth power in mostly sunny conditions, especially her backhand, befuddled Halep, whose bid to become the first back-to-back female winner since Justine Henin won three in a row through 2008 came to a thudding halt. Simona Halep waves to the crowd after losing to Amanda Anisimova at the French Open.

Coming as a defending champion, the pressure was on.\"JUST WATCHEDTearful Roger Federer remembers late coachReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTearful Roger Federer remembers late coach 03:21She admitted to suffering from nerves -- not because of being the substantial favorite in the quarterfinal but because she was playing so well. \"Maybe my expectations for myself were big today,\" Halep said. \"Maybe I couldn't handle the tension in my body so I couldn't play my best and I couldn't move at my best level.\" Anisimova's parents moved to the US from Russia -- like the parents of Maria Sharapova and Sofia Kenin, who beat Serena Williams in the third round. But it was to provide more opportunities for her older sister Maria, who went on to play tennis at the University of Pennsylvania. Barty turned to cricketBarty was once also a top junior like Anisimova although her career appeared over when she stepped away from the game in 2014. She had stopped enjoying it.  Playing professional cricket thereafter -- she is still a cricket fan and keeping an eye on the World Cup in England -- Barty returned to tennis in 2016. Ashleigh Barty will face Amanda Anisimova in the French Open semifinals. Her ranking has climbed every year since. Even if she loses against Anisimova, Barty will rise to a new career high of fourth, having been as high as fifth in doubles. \"I have grown as a person and obviously as a player as well,\" said Barty. \"But I have had some heartbreaking moments. I've had some amazing moments. All in all, I have enjoyed every single minute. \"I think that's been the biggest thing, that I haven't had one ounce of regret. I felt like when I came back, it was my decision, we did it my way, and yeah, it's paying dividends.\"The 23-year-old possesses an all-around game, including a wicked backhand slice, that has disrupted more experienced foes than Anisimova.

        "content": "(CNN)The leader of Denmark's center-left Social Democratic party, 41-year-old Mette Frederiksen, is on course to become the country's youngest Prime Minister, after an election that inflicted deep losses on the country's far-right. Frederiksen adopted a hardline stance on immigration during the election campaign, luring voters away from the right-wing populist Danish People's Party (DPP).While far-right parties have made gains in other European countries, the DPP saw its share of the vote dip by half on Wednesday.Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats have supported some of the most aggressive anti-immigrant laws in Europe put forward by the current center-right government.The center-left grouping, which Frederiksen's party leads, is projected to win 45 seats in the Danish parliament, the Folketing, in Wednesday's election, according to national broadcaster DR.Read MoreThat tally beats the 37 seats won by the three-party center-right bloc led by Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of the center-right Venstre party, putting Frederiksen's Social Democrats in position to take power. In this prosperous nation -- normally associated with its egalitarianism and a high position in various global well-being rankings -- immigration and the welfare state were key issues ahead of Wednesday's vote. Mette Frederiksen from The Danish Social Democrats is on course to become the Nordic country's youngest Prime Minister.But climate change also punched through as the biggest concern with voters, especially among millennials, Kristian Madsen, a political analyst at the Politiken newspaper, told CNN. \"It was a non-issue in the last election and has come creeping in, really, in the last couple of months,\" Madsen said, adding that it reflects the healthy state of Denmark, which is enjoying strong public finances, growth and record high public employment. \"If we had a 10% unemployment rate or refugee crisis\" like the one in 2015, the priorities would have been different, he added.DR's exit poll was based on 4,550 voters across 40 polling stations.A shift to the right on immigrationAfter four years in opposition, the resurgence of the Social Democrats has been credited to Frederiksen tacking left on socio-economic issues -- by promises to boost welfare spending and tackle climate issues -- while shifting right on immigration. By \"co-opting the populist right, she is attempting to steal their voter base,\" Madsen told CNN prior to the exit poll's release.  Denmark plans to isolate 'unwanted' migrants on remote islandThis legislation includes a controversial law banning face coverings, a moratorium on accepting a UN refugee resettlement quota, and plans for so-called \"ghetto laws\" targeting disadvantaged areas where more than half the inhabitants originate from non-Western countries. Wednesday's apparent results marked a stunning collapse for a party which swept into second place during the 2015 elections, and was credited for transforming Danish politics with its anti-establishment and anti-immigrant message over the last several decades.\"Many of these popular right voters, who have supported DPP for the last 20 years, are turning their backs on them,\" Kasper M. Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CNN, referring to the voters flocking to the Social Democrats or to a new crop of smaller far right parties.\"What we are witnessing here is a really interesting experiment for European center-left parties,\" Madsen added.The gambitPending collaboration with other parties in the red bloc (the traditional name for the center-left grouping), the Social Democrat party looks set to take the majority in parliament after what may be several weeks of tough negotiations.\"The big question is whether or how easily they will get to that position because all the parties in the red bloc want policy concessions,\" Rune Stubager, a political scientist at Aarhus University, told CNN.The Social Democrats may have won back some of the traditional working class vote, but it was also predicted to lose a cohort of liberal voters, who are opposed to its hardline immigrant stance, Madsen said.Ballots being counted after the polling stations closed in Copenhagen City Hall.That played out on Wednesday. Both the Socialist People's Party, which focused on environmental issues, and the Social Liberal Party almost doubled their vote compared to 2015.Taking a hardline position on immigration may be a 'recipe for success\" in the parliamentary election, but the Social Democrats have another hurdle: it will now have to \"square the circle with [left wing] parties who want a different policy on immigration,\" Stubager said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Tens of thousands of Czechs took to the streets of Prague on Tuesday, taking part in what its organizers described as \"the biggest protest since the fall of Communism.\"They were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Andrej Babis, a controversial politician accused of fraud and collaborating with the Communist era secret police, and his justice secretary Marie Benesova. The demonstration was part of a series of anti-Babis protests that have been going on for weeks.A crowd that was estimated by organizers to be around 120,000 people filled Wenceslas Square in the Czech capital, the site of the protests that ultimately led to the fall of the country's Communist regime three decades ago. What are the protests about?Read MoreBabis, mostly. The Prime Minister is at the center of a number of controversies and the protesters want him gone.Organizers said the protest was the country's biggest since the fall of Communism in 1989.He has been accused of fraud related to EU subsidies received by his former agricultural business empire. An investigation ended in the police proposing criminal charges against him. Prosecutors are now deciding whether to indict the Prime Minister. Babis has denied the accusations.Separately, the European Commission is investigating whether Babis was in conflict of interest because of his role as the PM and the owner of a major business receiving EU funding. A draft report by the Commission, leaked to Czech media last week, said Babis' business should not have access to EU funding, and suggested that the money it had received in the past might need to be returned by the Czech Republic. Central European countries to skip migration summit as EU tries to work out refugee issueThe Commission said it would not comment on ongoing audits. The Czech Finance Ministry confirmed it had received a preliminary audit report, but would not comment further. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Babis rejected the allegations and said the audit was \"an attack on the Czech Republic.\"What do the protesters want?Apart from the resignations of Babis and Benesova, the organizers are demanding that Babis' business empire Agrofert stops receiving subsidies, tax breaks, investment incentives and public tenders. In addition to being Prime Minister and an agricultural tycoon, Babis is also the owner of Mafra, a major Czech publishing house that owns two of the nation's biggest daily newspapers. The protesters want to see him sell his stake in the media. The rally in Prague demanded the resignation of Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis.They are also asking lawmakers to push for new safeguards for the country's justice system. Who is Babis?Babis is a divisive figure in the Czech Republic. The billionaire tycoon first stormed into Czech politics in 2012 and became Prime Minister in 2017. His populist ANO movement then received nearly 30% of the vote -- almost three times more than the conservative party ODS that came second.Another Babis controversy relates to his alleged role as a secret agent for the Communist-era secret police, the StB. The Slovak-born politician was identified as an agent operating under the codename \"Bures\" by historians using archival documents. Party of billionaire Andrej Babis wins Czech electionBabis has rejected the claims and sued for defamation, but in 2018, a court in Slovakia dismissed his complaints, ruling that he was not wrongly identified as an agent in the archival documents. \"We think it unacceptable that ... 29 years after the Velvet Revolution, an StB agent would be the Prime Minister of our country. We will not pretend that that is normal, we demand his resignation,\" the organizers of the protests said.Despite the controversies, Babis continues to be relatively popular among Czech voters. ANO was the clear winner in the recent European Parliament elections, securing 21% of the vote.What happens next?The organizers have already called for more protests. They are urging people in cities other than Prague to march next week, and are planning another mass protest in the capital on June 23.Babis has been accused of fraud related to EU subsidies. This time, they are planning to move to Letna Plain, a huge open space atop a hill overlooking the historical center of the city, which is capable of holding many more people than Wenceslas Square. The leaders of Czech opposition parties said Wednesday they would meet to decide whether to press for a confidence vote. Tomas Etzler contributed to this report.",

I remember it all very clearly, but I thought I'd got it all in perspective and I wasn't going to be emotional about it,\" he said in a video on the Normandy Memorial Trust page.\"It wasn't until I went back, saw the children playing on the beach, that I was sort of overwhelmed with recollection of what I've seen and moved to tears by the contrast, as a lot of veterans were.\"It took Radford several years to write it all down and a long time to sing it in public because it was \"a powerful recollection\" for him, he said.The song is also available for download via the Normandy Memorial Trust website.",

        "content": "(CNN)A wedding ring and a photograph are all Leon Lomax has left of his mother, a woman he has longed to know his whole life.Leon's white British mother met his African-American GI father during World War II, when he was stationed at RAF Birch, an airbase in Essex, southeast England. When Leon was born in December 1945, his mother, who was unmarried, left him in a children's home. He has a \"distant memory\" of what he thinks was the last time he saw her -- remembers \"standing in the corner of a crib and crying real hard.\" Leon, now 73, is still haunted by the choice his mother made. For decades, he has wondered: Did she want to give him up, or was she forced to?Leon Lomax with a photograph of his mother. He is haunted by the question of why she gave him up.\"I just want to know what conditions she was under,\" he tells CNN, from his home in Ohio. \"I always thought about trying to find her.\"Read MoreLeon is not alone. Social stigmaHistorian Lucy Bland estimates that around 2,000 mixed-race children were born in the UK to British women and African-American servicemen between 1943 and 1946.The US Army refused permission for black GIs to marry their pregnant white girlfriends and so the babies they gave birth to were branded \"illegitimate.\"Hundreds of babies born to British women and African-American GIs were placed into care.The social stigma of having a mixed-race child out of wedlock was too much for many mothers to cope with, and so many of the children were given up.Between a third and half of the babies are thought to have been placed in children's homes, according to Bland, who told some of their stories in her book, \"Britain's Brown Babies.\" (The term was coined by the US press in the 1940s).Of the 45 former GI babies Bland interviewed, Leon was the only one later adopted by his father. Corporal Oscar Lomax was already married when he met Leon's mother Maud, but after returning to the US at the end of the war, he tracked Leon down and had the-then three-year-old flown to the US in January 1949. Leon Lomax's British passport, used when he flew alone to the US to live with his former GI father.\"My heart did a complete flip-flop,\" Leon's stepmother Betty told the Pittsburgh Chronicle in an article celebrating his arrival. \"I took him and his little hands were so soft. He asked my name. I told him 'Mommie' and the man's name was 'Daddy.'\"But there was to be no happy ending for Leon -- his stepmother died suddenly when he was eight years old, and his father sent him to live with a succession of aunts and uncles. There was always someone missing, \"kind of like a void,\" he says. Leon did eventually trace his mother, but it was too late. Maud had died two years previously -- all he got to visit was her gravestone. That \"kinda broke my heart,\" he says.Search for identityWhen African-American GIs, many of whom came from the Deep South, served in Britain the US Army forced them to abide by the \"Jim Crow\" racial segregation laws. But many white British women paid no attention to such rules and attended \"black-only\" dances and pubs, where relationships were formed.GI babies were sent to other homes, fostered or adopted after leaving Holnicote House.\"When the black GIs wanted to marry some of the white women and asked the officers -- who were all white -- they invariably refused,\" says Bland, professor of social and cultural history at Anglia Ruskin University. \"It wasn't a legal thing but this is what they did, which is outrageous.\"Lucy found one case in which a black GI who said he wanted to marry his pregnant girlfriend was told by his commanding officer \"if you do that you will be charged with rape, and the penalty for rape is death.\" Such attitudes mean that many of the \"brown babies\" -- now in their early 70s -- have spent a lifetime searching for their identities after being separated from their parents. Around 20 of the so-called \"brown babies\" were placed in a nursery at Holnicote House near Minehead in Somerset, southwestern England, where they were raised until they turned five. Once they reached this milestone they were fostered, adopted or sent to homes for older children.Carol Edwards (back row, fourth from left) and  Deborah Prior (front row, third from left) remember their time at Holnicote House in Somerset, southwest England, with great affection.Deborah Prior and Carol Edwards, both 74, were given up by their mothers and sent to Holnicote House in 1945. Their best childhood memories are from the five years they spent growing up amongst nature and other mixed-race children in the beautiful home.\"Every day was a summer's day,\" recalls Carol. \"We were just like one big happy family.\" \"They never knew what to do with our hair though,\" laughs Deborah.'All white faces'It wasn't until they were packed off at the age of five, far away from everything they'd ever known and other children who looked like them, that Deborah and Carol say their struggles with their identity began.Deborah was adopted by a childless couple named Sid and Queenie who lived on the other side of the country. \"It was my first memory of feeling really scared. I had no idea where I was going or what I was doing.\". \"I was the only black kid in the community -- it was horrifying and there was no preparation,\" she says. Carol Edwards (second from left) and  Deborah Prior (third from left) spent five years at Holnicote House. Deborah was later adopted, while Carol spent years in children's homes.Carol was never adopted; instead, from the age of five she was moved from one children's home to the next. \"It was all white faces,\" she says. \"I found that strange.\"  After decades of searching, Deborah managed to find her mother, but only got to meet her once, briefly, on the condition -- set by her half-sister -- that she didn't reveal who she was. A war-widowed teacher, who already had two children when she fell pregnant, Deborah's mother told her: \"You look familiar.\" Three little words, but enough for Deborah to believe that her mother knew her real identity.  \"I have no idea who my father is to this day... that name died with my mother,\" she says.Deborah Prior and Carol Edwards grew up together at Holnicote House, and have remained friends.Carol tracked down her father, but theirs wasn't the reunion she'd hoped for. Instead it was an awkward meeting, surrounded by extended family. \"I felt really uncomfortable... there were questions I wanted to ask but I didn't want to do it in front of other people,\" Carol says. Her father died two years later. Lifelong love storyIn contrast to Leon, Deborah and Carol, Dave Greene, 74, grew up knowing exactly who -- and how loved -- he was.His mother Joan Bagwell was just 18 years old when she met his father, Corporal David Greene, a photographer in the US Army, in Yeovil, southwestern England. He invited her to a dance and a lifelong love -- albeit one separated by the Atlantic Ocean -- began.\"It was a very strong relationship despite all the opposition,\" Dave explains, detailing the racism and abuse the couple faced at the hands of white US servicemen and locals alike, simply walking down the street together.Dave Greene with photographs of his father, who was serving as a photographer in the US Army when he met Dave's mother during World War II. Her family would not let her move to the US.Corporal Greene, from North Carolina, wooed Joan's family with homemade peach cobblers and was well received by her parents -- but they drew the line at letting their daughter move to the US.\"She told me she would have loved to have gone to the States because he always kept in touch,\" said Dave. \"But I understood, when I was a little bit older, that she didn't get all the letters -- my gran kept them aside, she didn't want her going off and marrying this black guy.\"By the time Dave was born in August 1945, his father had left the UK, but he sent money to help Joan raise his child, and continued to urge her to join him in America. Joan refused to give in to pressure and give Dave up -- despite facing the joint stigmas of illegitimacy and racism.\"She was a very strong woman, she would not have anything bad said about me,\" Dave says.GI babies who grew up in care, like these at Holnicote House, seen here with the nurses who cared for them, were regularly photographed in an attempt to find adoptive families.Eventually, Joan married a local man who brought Dave up as if he was his own son, and stood up for him in the face of racist abuse. But Dave says she continued to hold a torch for his father. \"My mum could always remember his Army number,\" he says, adding that she was \"obviously totally smitten.\"Missing puzzle pieceWhen he was 12, Dave and his mother received Valentine's cards from his father. Dave and his father wrote to each for a couple of years until a change of address meant that they lost contact for decades. Then, when he was 53, Dave managed to track down a phone number for his father, and called him up, asking the man at the other end of the line if he had been in England during the war? When he replied: \"Yes, Yeovil,\" The missing piece of the puzzle fell into place.Dave and his father spent the next two hours talking. \"It was like we'd never been apart. It was closure and it was emotional,\" Dave says. A month later, in July 1999, Dave flew to New York to meet his father for the first time. \"I don't think there was a lot said,\" he remembers. \"It was a physical embrace. I did ask if it was okay to call him 'Dad,' and he said, 'Of course it is, you are my son.'\" Dave's father died in 2009, his mother a year later. \"I don't think she ever got over him,\" he says. Dave was lucky enough to know both his parents, but for hundreds of Britain's other mixed-race GI babies, the search for answers about their identity continues.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)A series of high-profile defamation cases have been brought against women in response to the outpouring of sexual misconduct allegations in the wake of #MeToo, and women's rights activists say they could have a chilling effect on the movement's future.Last week, Sandra Muller, the woman who started France's version of #MeToo, appeared in a Paris court, where she faced a defamation lawsuit brought by the man she accused of making lewd comments about her. In October 2017, just days before the #MeToo hashtag went viral in the wake of allegations made against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, Muller, a French journalist, shared her own story on Twitter using the hashtag #balancetonporc, which roughly translates to \"squeal on your pig.\"Muller alleged that Eric Brion, a senior French television producer, had humiliated her by saying: \"You have big breasts. You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.\"Woman who started France's #MeToo campaign faces lawsuit by man she accusedHer story soon inspired thousands of others to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault, catapulting France's national discourse on sexualized violence into the global spotlight.Read MoreIn a public apology published by the French daily Le Monde in December 2017, Brion admitted he had made those comments to Muller, saying that he had made \"inappropriate remarks\" to her, \"very late at night, during a drink-fueled cocktail party evening, but I did it only once.\"In court last Wednesday, Brion once again admitted that he had said those words to Muller, adding that he had sent her an \"apology text message\" but didn't get an answer the following day. He added that, \"Muller's violence against me has never stopped. The violence of people hiding behind their phones.\"While he has said that he regretted his words, Brion noted in Le Monde that he would have rather been tried in a court of justice than in the court of social media.And that's exactly what he's done.A 'grey zone'In January 2018, Brion announced he would sue Muller for defamation, asking for \u20ac50,000 (about $55,745) in damages and \u20ac10,000 worth of legal fees.While Brion admitted he had made \"inappropriate\" comments to Muller, his lawyer Marie Burguburu told CNN the reason they filed a defamation suit was because Muller had accused him of \"sexual harassment at work\" on Twitter.\"This is defamatory because we can't blame a man for making himself guilty of an offense when that's absolutely not the case,\" Burguburu said.Muller, who had recently been honored as a \"silence breaker\" and person of the year by Time magazine, said at the time that she was surprised by Brion's change of strategy.Writing on her Facebook page, Muller said: \"The #balancetonporc movement has inspired victims to speak out, and has shed light on a real social problem that is still such a taboo.\"\"With this summons, however, they want to force me to shut up.\"French journalist Sandra Muller, who started the #balancetonporc campaign.Vowing to \"fight this until the end,\" Muller said that she hoped that the \"trial will be an opportunity to hold a real debate on the ways to combat sexual harassment.\" But Celine Piques, spokesperson for the French feminist association Osez Le F\u00e9minisme, (Dare Feminism) told CNN that the trial is \"absurd,\" and one that amplifies a culture in which the courts are \"trying to make us believe there is a grey zone between harassment and seduction.\"Women already face immense challenges in speaking out against sexual harassment and gender-based violence for several reasons, Piques added, including the fear of losing their job or other forms of retaliation.The threat of defamation only compounds that fear.France's judicial system already doesn't \"respond to the testimonies of women,\" Piques said, adding that even in the wake of #MeToo, only a fraction of women who have been raped brought their case to police.The latest available figures from the French Ministry of Social Affairs, Health and Women's Rights show an average of 84,000 women become victims of rape or attempts of rape every year. Less than 40% of estimated sexual violence cases were registered with police from November 2014 to October 2015, with only 771 people convicted the crime in 2014. French journalist Lauren Bastide and spokesperson for the feminist movement Prenons La Une (Let's Take the Front Page) told CNN that societal norms still inform the judicial process in France. 'Dangerous' rape laws must be updated, Amnesty report says\"Women are asked how they were dressed before the accused gets asked any questions,\" she said, explaining that critics of the feminist movement are dangerously conflating sexual assault and rape with the French \"tradition of flirting, of seduction.\"\"Justice is sexist, in the image of society,\" Piques added. She attributes backlash against the #MeToo movement to men who are \"not ready to give up their privileges\" in society.Bastide also said that economic factors play a role in assault cases, with women from working class or poorer backgrounds less likely to report their abuser because they can be sued.\"Fortunately, there are spaces where you can express yourself, but it is extremely paradoxical. Twitter is a wonderful tool but it is also the most violent tool that can turn against us,\" Bastide said. 'A precision strike'Brion, however, seems to believe he is a casualty of the #MeToo movement, saying in court last Wednesday that he is \"the victim of a precision strike\" by Muller.In suing her for defamation, Brion joins a growing list of wealthy men in powerful positions who have taken legal action against their accusers.Last month, Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush was awarded $2.9 million Australian dollars (approximately $2 million) after winning his defamation case against a journalist and Sydney newspaper the Daily Telegraph.This is why people hesitate to report sexual misconductThe Australian newspaper reported that Rush had inappropriately touched his \"King Lear\" co-star Eryn Jean Norvill on her breasts and back, followed her into a bathroom and sent her an inappropriate text message during the show's production in Sydney between 2015 and 2016. Rush denied all the accusations.Norvill had made the allegations in a private workplace complaint, but later agreed to testify for the paper. She continues to maintain that her claims are true.In a series of interviews with Australia's ABC News and The New York Times, actress Yael Stone -- who also accused Rush of sexually inappropriate text messages, exposing himself to her and attempting to watch her shower -- told ABC News last year that she waited years to come forward with the allegations due to fears that publicly accusing a major star could ruin her career. Rush has also denied all those accusations.Stone added that Australia's defamation laws deterred her from coming forward, as laws in Australia place the burden on publishers to prove allegations are true.Defamation law varies from country to country. In countries like Australia, France and the UK, the burden of proof lies entirely upon the defendant, whereas in the United States, when the plaintiff is a public figure, they must prove that the defendant's statements are untrue and made with intentional malice. And while defamation suits are often taken to civil court, where accusers can face fines, in countries with criminal-defamation statues, defendants can also face jail time.'Hugely chilling' In India, defamation lawsuits can be filed in civil or criminal court. If a defamation case is lodged in the criminal court, defendants found guilty of libel can face prison sentences for a term of up to two years -- an outcome that adds an additional layer for victims coming forward.Two high-profile criminal defamation cases have recently shaken the country's #MeToo movement.MJ Akbar, a former junior minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and a former influential newspaper editor, has been accused by at least a dozen women of groping, assault and harassment. He has denied the allegations.Facing allegations of sexual assault and harassment from former female colleagues, Akbar said in October that he had decided to resign and challenge what he labeled \"false accusations.\" \"Since I have decided to seek justice in a court of law in my personal capacity, I deem it appropriate to step down from office and challenge false accusations levied against me, also in a personal capacity,\" he said.Akbar sued journalist Priya Ramani -- who had made the first allegation against him -- last October, calling the allegations \"false and fabricated.\"In another case that month, Bollywood star Alok Nath filed a defamation suit and gag order against writer and producer Vinta Nanda, who alleged that Nath raped her in the 1990s. In a chilling Facebook post, Nanda said she remembers \"being violated endlessly\" by him after they finished working together on a daytime soap opera. Nath has denied the allegations.\"I have waited for this moment to come for 19 years. I shout out to each one of you who have suffered at the hands of predators to come out and say it aloud,\" Nanda wrote in her post. Nath's request for a gag order was dismissed by a judge, however, and both defamation trials are ongoing.                        Where survivors of sexual abuse are sued by the perpetrators\u00a0In the United States -- where the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff -- at least 24 states have defamation laws with criminal-defamation statutes. Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, an organization set up in response to #MeToo to defray legal costs for people who have experienced sexual harassment or related retaliation in the workplace, said that in the year and a half that they've been operating, they've received some 5,000 requests for assistance. Two-thirds of requests come from low-income workers, who are often concerned about becoming a target for retaliation.She explains that while retaliatory measures, such as having shifts cut or being disciplined or suddenly fired, are commonplace, defamation is also a concern now.Tejani, who has been working in the field for 20 years, said that the organization has been surprised to see how many people have come to them for help in defamation cases.\"It's a higher number than we expected, and certainly something that is concerning for people who want to come forward.\"And for victims of sexual and domestic abuse, the threat of defamation can deter victims from speaking out altogether, according to Harriet Wistrich, director of the UK's Centre for Women's Justice.This court ruling could silence victims of sexual misconduct In the UK, Wistrich explains, the standard of proof in rape or sexual assault cases is high and can be quite difficult to prove. In defamation cases involving allegations of rape or sexual assault, that standard of proof still exists.She points to a current case involving a musician who has threatened to sue a group of women who all started sharing their stories on social media.  \"Obviously the point of them sharing their stories is wanting to share their story,\" Wistrich said, noting that often this is the way that serial abusers are identified, \"but the women weren't aware of it (defamation law) before they were threatened, and now they are facing consequences of that.\"\"Once you are threatened, you are advised to shut up because it would exacerbate the problem for yourself. So it is hugely chilling.\"'We're going to keep fighting'But women like Muller have not shut up.    Speaking in French court last Wednesday, Muller's lawyer Francis Szpiner said that \"If this hashtag worked, it's because hundreds of women have had enough and recognized themselves in this tweet.\" \"Balancetonporc is not a movement that opposes men and women, it helps everyone,\" Muller added. The verdict in the case is expected on September 25. Dutch actress Sand Van Roy, who accused French film director Luc Besson of raping her at a hotel and of repeated non-consensual sexual relations, some of which were violent, had come to the court to support Muller. In February, the French prosecutor's office dropped her case, saying there was not enough evidence to support the charge. Besson denied the allegations. In a statement to CNN, Luc Besson's lawyer Thierry Marembert said Besson \"regrets that some people prematurely condemned him and thanks others for their consistent support that helped him to face these complicated months.\"Van Roy told CNN she believes there is a \"culture of rape everywhere...that is nourished by culture, parents, school -- one is conditioned to judge women.\"Women are afraid to speak out, she said, because they know that \"they can lose everything, as I did.\"\"But we're stronger than this and we're going to keep fighting,\" she added.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify the accusations that Sand Van Roy made against Luc Besson.CNN's Kara Fox reported and wrote, while Antoine Crouin contributed reporting from Paris.",

Not a ball was struck, meaning defending champion Halep, world No. 1 Djokovic, Amanda Anisimova, Ashleigh Barty, Madison Keys, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov were all left looking on from the sidelines. Wednesday's matches will now take place Thursday but start two hours earlier at noon, with no players asked to do double duty on the day that was supposed to showcase the women's semifinals. READ: Federer to meet Nadal in Paris for first time since 2011 Read MoreVisit CNN Sport for more news and videosThe umbrellas were out at the French Open Wednesday due to steady rain that canceled play. Scheduling reshuffleThe women's finalist from Halep's top half of the draw will likely now have to play three consecutive days to end the tournament instead of having the usual day off between the semifinals and final. The bottom half finalist, meanwhile -- either Johanna Konta or Marketa Vondrousova -- will have had two days off prior to the semifinals. The men's finalist from Djokovic's top half -- expected to be either the world No. 1 or 2018 finalist Thiem -- will probably have to play on three of the final four days, with no customary day off between the quarterfinal and semifinal. That is assuming no more weather delays -- and there is a good chance of rain Friday. \"The weather for tomorrow [Thursday] seems to be OK, so we will be able to move on with that schedule,\" tournament director Guy Forget said in a press conference. \"If we achieve that, it's a good start. Then we will worry about Friday after that.\"Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, already through on Wednesday, will have benefited from two days off ahead of their blockbuster semifinal Friday. If Djokovic defeats Zverev, the Serb would reach the semifinals at the French Open for the first time since completing his grand slam collection in Paris in 2016.

Djokovic's opponent, though, has beaten him in two of their four meetings and justifiably silenced critics -- for the time being -- who questioned his credentials at grand slams. Novak Djokovic stretches for this shot but hasn't been stretched in his matches so far this French Open. The fifth-ranked German is coming off an impressive four-set win over clay danger man Fabio Fognini and is in better shape physically than last year when he fell to Thiem in the quarterfinals, hindered by a hamstring injury. He had played three straight five-set duels. The 22-year-old has downed Djokovic in their two biggest clashes, in the Rome final on clay in 2017 and in last year's year-end championship finale in London. Djokovic has won their other two encounters. \"Obviously last year's quarterfinal was very unfortunate to me, very sad, the ending, with an injury,\" said Zverev.\"Hopefully this year will be different, and it will be a great match.\" JUST WATCHEDAlexander Zverev: 'Amazing' to win ATP FinalsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAlexander Zverev: 'Amazing' to win ATP Finals 01:41Djokovic is unquestionably in better form than 12 months ago.

Djokovic has barely broken a sweat this fortnight, not conceding more than four games in any set as he attempts to win four straight majors for a second time. He wasn't worried about not being pushed ahead of the big test Zverev could give him. \"I have played plenty of, I think, tight matches in my career that I can rely on that experience,\" the 15-time grand slam winner said. \"I think it's good to be tested from that perspective, but at the same time, it's also good to cruise along and kind of conserve the energy for what's coming up.\"Nadal could be coming up Sunday in the final.  Another teenager for HalepHalep confronts the youngest player remaining in the draw in 17-year-old Anisimova. Not since Martina Hingis in 1998 had a player that young advanced to this stage in Paris. Anisimova is a fan of Halep's two-handed backhand and has a fine two-hander of her own. But Halep is fresh off a 6-1 6-0, 45-minute demolition of another teenager, Iga Swiatek. Simona Halep is bidding to become the first repeat women's champion at the French Open since Justine Henin in 2006 and 2007. \"If you're in the second week, your expectations are bigger,\" said Halep. \"So I expect more from myself. \"Next round is just a big challenge to go through this tournament.\"Mother Nature proved to be a challenge that couldn't be overcome Wednesday.",

But mention the National Health Service, as President Donald Trump did on Tuesday, and the country unites in one voice: Hands off our NHS.So what is the issue, why is it so sensitive and why has it kept coming up during Trump's visit to the country?Britain's healthcare system is free at the point of delivery for everyone in the UK and has been since after the end World War Two. Over the years, it has become a cherished national institution, immune from criticism. Whenever governments plan to introduce charges, or suggest private investment, it inevitably causes an uproar. The trouble is, pressures on the NHS are increasing. An aging population, demand for more expensive treatments, and a public spending squeeze, give politicians little room for maneuver. The NHS is in perpetual crisis and eventually something will need to be done about it.American healthcare companies spot an opening. The NHS needs investment -- and after Brexit, Britain wants a trade deal with the US. The opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games included a musical number honoring the NHS.Read MoreWoody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, started it off when he suggested on a BBC political show on Sunday that it would be part of any post-Brexit US-UK trade negotiation. The fact that the US wants access to UK healthcare is no secret. When the office of the US Trade Representative published its negotiation objectives, it specifically mentioned it will seek full market access for American pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The President addressed it again on Tuesday when he was asked about it at a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May. \"When you're dealing in trade everything is on the table, so NHS or anything else, a lot more than that, but everything will be on the table, absolutely,\" Trump said.After 70 years of universal health care, is the NHS at a crisis point?But the British public is concerned that would lead to the breakup of the health service, with parts of it being privatized. So the political backlash was immediate -- in particular from those vying to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister.  \"I want to see the UK get fair deals on trade with the US and many other countries when we leave the EU,\" said Dominic Raab, one of the contenders. \"But the NHS is not for sale to any country and never would be if I was Prime Minister.\"And this was the health secretary, Matt Hancock, another putative future Prime Minister: \"Dear Mr President. The NHS isn't on the table in trade talks -- and never will be. Not on my watch.\"Donald Trump attacks the UK's health service, and Britain hits backThe backlash was enough for Trump to backtrack later in the day. Asked about the NHS in an interview with British broadcaster ITV, Trump appeared to suggest the exact opposite of his earlier comments. \"I don't see it being on the table. Somebody asked me a question today and I said everything is up for negotiation because everything is. But I don't see that being -- that's something that I would not consider part of trade, that's not trade,\" he said. The British love their NHS. A survey last year by the leading UK healthcare think tank, the King's Fund, showed that a huge number of Britons still support its founding principles , which command that it should be free at the point of delivery, provide a comprehensive service available to everybody, and be primarily funded through taxation. \"There's this deep-rooted affection for the NHS. It certainly feels that the NHS is almost part of our national psyche,\" said Dan Wellings, senior fellow at the King's Fund.Trump wants to do a 'phenomenal' trade deal with Britain. That won't be easySince its inception in 1948, the NHS has become an integral part of the British society and the country's biggest employer. When London hosted the Olympic Games in 2012, the opening ceremony featured an entire musical number honoring the NHS and its staff, with nurses dancing around children in hospital beds.\"There has been polling done few times over the past few years asking people what makes them proudest to be British and the NHS always tops that poll, above the royal family,\" Wellings said.The resistance to overhauling the NHS cuts across the British society -- most people said they would pay more tax if the NHS needed it, according to the surveys. (Of course, once confronted by political parties who propose tax increases, it's often a different story.)Despite the strong feelings, parts of the NHS have been privatized over the years. Dentistry, optical care and pharmacy services have been provided by the private sector for many years, according to the King's Fund. Most GP practices, or family doctors, are also private partnerships. Overall, around 7% of the NHS revenue budget is spent on private companies. \"When politicians and governments have started to look at changing the NHS, that's when you get a huge resistance from the public,\" Wellings said.  \"The fact that those politicians reacted as quickly tells you... they realize that tampering with the NHS is potentially a political dynamite.\"In the United Kingdom, no politician, not even the world's most powerful one, is allowed to tamper with the NHS.",

Britain's mixed-race GI babies want to know why they were given awayIn a heartfelt speech, Elizabeth described her own wartime generation as resilient, saying that she was \"delighted\" to be at the event, which marked 75 years since the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France.\"When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. But the wartime generation -- my generation -- is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today,\" she said. The Queen paid homage to the hundreds of thousands of servicemen who \"left these shores in the cause of freedom,\" and quoted a broadcast delivered by her father, King George VI at the time: \"What is demanded from us all is something more than courage and endurance; we need a revival of spirit, a new unconquerable resolve.\"Trump turns sour as trouble brews at home\"That is exactly what those brave men brought to the battle, as the fate of the world depended on their success,\" she said, thanking the veterans for their service.  Read More\"The heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten. It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country -- indeed the whole free world -- that I say to you all, thank you,\" she said. The Queen's speech was greeted with a warm round of applause, which was followed by a striking UK military flypast. Queen Elizabeth II (center) is seen with (from left) Prime Minister Theresa May, Prince Charles, US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump at the D-Day commemorations Wednesday.Earlier, US President Donald Trump spoke on stage, where he read a prayer that Franklin D. Roosevelt gave over the radio during the Normandy landings.UK Prime Minister Theresa May also delivered an emotive reading of a letter by\u00a0Captain Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, who was killed the day after arriving in Normandy. Other world leaders in attendance included German Chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel,\u00a0French President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron\u00a0and Canada's Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau, among others. This plane flew on D-Day. Now it's back in the airD-Day -- the military term for the first day of the Normandy landings -- was the largest amphibious invasion ever undertaken, laying the foundations for the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.The invasion took place on June 6, 1944, and saw of tens of thousands of troops from the United States, the UK, France, Australia and Canada landing on five stretches of the Normandy coastline.The plan began more than a year in advance, and the Allies carried out substantial military deception -- codenamed Operation Bodyguard -- in order to confuse the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place.The operation was originally scheduled to begin on June 5, when a full moon and low tides were expected to coincide with good weather, but storms forced a 24-hour delay.More than 4,400 Allied troops were confirmed dead, with at least 9,000 wounded or missing on D-Day alone.While the exact numbers of German casualties on the day are not known, they are estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000.",

        "content": "(CNN)Defeating the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals isn't the only task at hand for Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard.On Monday, Leonard filed a lawsuit against Nike over a personal logo that Leonard says Nike fraudulently copyrighted and that Leonard designed.The nine-page lawsuit was filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California.\"In 2011, just after being drafted to the National Basketball Association (the 'NBA'), Kawhi Leonard authored a unique logo that included elements that were meaningful and unique to him,\" the lawsuit said.\"Leonard traced his notably large hand, and, inside the hand, drew stylized versions of his initials 'KL' and the number that he had worn for much of his career, '2.' The drawing Leonard authored was an extension and continuation of drawings he had been creating since early in his college career.Read More\"Several years later, as part of an endorsement deal with Nike, Leonard allowed Nike to use on certain merchandise the logo he created while Leonard continued to use the logo on non-Nike goods.\"Unbeknownst to Leonard and without his consent, Nike filed an application for copyright registration of his logo and falsely represented in the application that Nike had authored the logo.\"Leonard intends to use the logo on clothing lines, footwear and on other products and, among other things, in connection with sports camps and charity functions, but Nike explicitly has objected to such uses.\"A Nike representative told CNN on Monday that the company does not comment on pending litigation. The Raptors declined to pass along any statement from Leonard.Leonard, wearing a hoodie featuring the logo in dispute, speaks with the media in May.Leonard's contract with Nike expired in September. He's now under contract with New Balance.A resident of San Diego County, he played college basketball at San Diego State University before entering the 2011 NBA draft. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers but was traded on draft night to the San Antonio Spurs, where he played for seven seasons, winning the NBA Finals and garnering NBA Finals MVP honors in 2014.Leonard was traded to the Raptors in 2018. Toronto has since gone on to have its best season with the forward, reaching the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. The series with the Warriors is even at a game apiece. Game 3 is Wednesday in Oakland.Lawsuit: Leonard never transferred logo rights to NikeLeonard signed with Nike in October 2011. During his agreement with the company, the two parties started discussions about creating a logo to add onto merchandise to be sold under the Nike agreement, the lawsuit said.\"Leonard never transferred the rights to the Leonard Logo to Nike -- conversely, as the many communications, including text and e-mails show, Leonard permitted Nike to use the Leonard Logo for their mutual benefit and for the specific purpose of effectuating the Nike Agreement for the term of the contract,\" the suit said.\"Indeed, Nike representatives recognized Leonard's rights to the Leonard Logo -- referring to it as 'Kawhi's logo' in written communications with Leonard. Leonard, without dispute or challenge from Nike, continued to use the Leonard Logo on non-Nike goods, including apparel and merchandise used for basketball camps, appearances and charity events, even while Nike was affixing Leonard's Logo to Nike merchandise.\"In May 2017, the lawsuit alleges, Nike filed an application with the US Copyright Office to register the \"Kawhi Leonard Logo\" without Leonard's knowledge or consent. On the application, the lawsuit said, Nike claimed authorship in 2014 of the logo and rights and permissions to the logo.Meanwhile, the lawsuit said, Leonard in November 2017 applied for and subsequently received registration for two trademarks of the logo.On January 30, Leonard's counsel requested for Nike to rescind its copyrights to the logo, according to the suit. Nike responded March 11 that it owns property rights and demanded Leonard cease use.CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Even if you don't pay much attention to what goes on in the UK, there's a good chance you'll have heard the name Boris Johnson before.A former mayor of London, former British foreign secretary and current media personality, Johnson finally launched his official campaign to replace Theresa May as prime minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Monday. He joins a crowded field -- but he's probably the only candidate whose name resonates outside of the UK.Johnson posted a slickly produced video on social media a few minutes after US President Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One at the start of a state visit to the UK.  Johnson received the tacit approval of Trump over the weekend.The timing -- which can't possibly have been coincidental -- ensures that coverage of Day 1 of the Johnson campaign will be muted. That may well be part of the strategy -- Johnson is acutely aware that being the frontrunner at the start of any leadership campaign doesn't always work out well.Read MoreIt may also have the effect of defusing the impact of the Trump endorsement.  Under normal circumstances, the approval of a US president would be a boon to any leadership hopeful. But Johnson, already often described as the British Trump, knows that he cannot afford to appear any more divisive if he is to succeed in winning the Conservative leadership. The backing of Trump is not likely to win him the friends he needs from moderates. A screengrab from Boris Johnson's leadership campaign launch video.Seen by many as the man who most influenced the UK's decision to leave the European Union, Johnson is loved by Brexiteers and loathed by Remainers. But if his launch video is anything to go by, it's clear that Johnson understands that whoever takes over from May needs to unite a country still badly divided by the Brexit referendum. In the video, Johnson is seen talking to people from ethnically diverse background and to voters across the political divide. He talks about uniting the country and hammers home the need for the UK to be positive and confident. It's fair to say that this is miles away from the Trumpian way of doing politics.Name recognitionJohnson's international name recognition has not always been achieved for good reasons. His extensive list of controversies includes such hits as calling people across the commonwealth \"flag-waving piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles,\" saying that women who wear Islamic face veils look \"like letter boxes\" and writing a poem about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan having sex with a goat.It's not just gaffes: Johnson has been criticized for saying that a British citizen who is serving a jail term in Iran for alleged espionage was in the country to teach people journalism. The Iranian authorities jumped on this and used Johnson's statement as evidence against her.  JUST WATCHEDBoris Johnson to appear in court over alleged falsehoodsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBoris Johnson to appear in court over alleged falsehoods 01:31So, it might come as a surprise that such a controversial figure is the frontrunner to be the next PM.Johnson's history as a two-term mayor of London -- a city that skews heavily towards voting for the opposition Labour party -- has always been seen as the Conservative's not-so-secret weapon.However, since the referendum he has become one of the most divisive political figures in the country. Leavers see him as a hero of the Brexit campaign; Remainers think that he lied his way to victory and is to blame for the mess the nation is in. As recently as October, most Conservative MPs recognized that Brand Boris had become too toxic and that he wasn't a viable option to replace May, whenever the moment came. It's not just in the UK that Johnson divides opinion. The Brussels elite, with whom the UK has been negotiating Brexit, remember his time there as a journalist covering the EU, where he wrote dubious stories about how Brussels operated. That, combined with his antics since the referendum, makes it very unlikely that he would be seen as a credible negotiating partner by the powers-that-be. Given that one of the key tasks for any new PM will be to convince Brussels to renegotiate May's Brexit blueprint -- the very thing that Johnson resigned from her Cabinet over -- crowning Johnson as prime minister seems a strange choice. So why on earth is he the Conservative favorite? It's all about BrexitMuch has changed since October. First, May's deal is all but dead and her leadership is drawing to a close. Brexit hasn't been delivered, which means that a number of options are back on the table. For many Conservatives, this means the prospect of a harder Brexit, or even leaving the EU without a deal -- something May was ultimately unwilling to do. Brexiteers believe that Johnson would be happy with letting the clock run down and not requesting a Brexit extension. More importantly, they believe that the EU believes he would do this. They also believe that Johnson is the only Conservative who is charismatic enough to take on the unique electoral challenges facing party at the moment. Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour Party is gunning for an election, calculating that a Conservative party in chaos would be easy to pick off. The Conservatives are also facing a new electoral threat in Nigel Farage's new Brexit party. The longer Brexit doesn't happen, the more support this new, openly no-deal supporting group, is likely to get.It's definitely a risk. The Conservative party is badly divided and many in the party believe that Johnson isn't up to the job. He is seen as untrustworthy and lazy by some of his fellow MPs. And being popular with Conservative members is very different to being popular with the country at large -- especially among Remain voters. It could backfire badly for the Conservatives and ultimately hand the keys to 10 Downing Street to Corbyn, a man they see as a risk to national security. But, unfortunately for the Conservatives, their bungling of Brexit has left them with very few options.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Angela Merkel may have been hoping for a smooth exit to her long tenure as German Chancellor. Instead, she could be in for a rough ride, after suffering two major political blows in the past week.  First, her chosen successor as Germany's leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer -- better known as AKK -- has plunged in the polls after a series of blunders.Second, Merkel's coalition partner, Andrea Nahles of the Social Democrats, resigned after taking a battering in last week's European elections.  Now, Merkel's so-called \"Grand Coalition\" is teetering on the edge.  On Sunday, Merkel made a statement at her party headquarters in which she vowed to carry on and keep the coalition together.Read More\"We will continue the government's work with all seriousness, and above all greatly conscious of our responsibility,\" she said. \"The issues we must solve are plain \u2014 in Germany, in Europe and in the rest of the world.\"Understanding GroKoTo get Merkel's predicament, you have to understand \"GroKo\" -- the German nickname for the Grand Coalition between the two largest parties in the Bundestag -- which for most of Merkel's time in office has been between her conservative Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats, or SPD.   Angela Merkel warns against dark forces on the rise in EuropeThe SPD have been stalwart partners to the Chancellor for her first, third and now fourth term in office (though she had a brief dalliance with the Free Democrats during her second term), consolidating Merkel's control over Germany's parliament.  But over the years, and particularly after the 2015 refugee crisis, voters became disenchanted with GroKo. In the 2017 federal elections, millions deserted the CDU and SPD for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), and the German Greens, who are now ascendant on the left.  Despite the dismal results, Merkel was not ousted and her CDU clung to power with the help of its coalition with the SPD, despite objections from the SPD's radical youth wing, who argued that the coalition with the CDU would kill their party.  EU election falloutThe results of the EU election last week prove that the SPD's internal critics were right: the party plummeted to just 15% of the vote in Germany, a historic low. Adding insult to injury, in a regional election held the same day, it lost the top spot in Bremen, a city the SPD has held for more than 70 years. That prompted SPD leader Andrea Nahles to resign, and triggered calls by party members to finally pull the plug on the coalition, which would likely imperil Merkel's last term in power. \"The discussions within the parliamentary group and the large amount of feedback from the party have shown me that there is no longer support for me in holding these offices,\" Nahles wrote in an email to party members on Sunday, urging continuing support for the Grand Coalition. Europe's old guard is punished by voters demanding changeThe fall of the SPD, and the possible collapse of the coalition, would have been bad enough for Merkel. But it was compounded by a series of political blunders from her appointed CDU successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. The European Election was the first test of AKK's vote-getting ability without having Merkel to help her out.  While Merkel remains Chancellor until 2021, she is no longer head of the CDU and has conspicuously left the campaigning to AKK. It did not go well.  Just before EU voting day, she had an online dust-up with a group of YouTubers, who had urged voters not to elect the CDU, SPD or AfD.  Kramp-Karrenbauer called their YouTube videos political \"propaganda\" that needed to be regulated, unleashing a social-media backlash against the CDU. The politician admitted that she had failed to connect with voters. The EU election results showed that the CDU had lost more than a million votes at the ballot box, many of them to the Greens. That was a shock for CDU members who may have hoped a fresh leader would put a halt to the party's slide. All of which has fueled reports of Merkel herself casting doubts over whether her heir apparent is up to the job. Bloomberg, citing two officials close to the Chancellor, reported that she had \"given up hope\" in her successor. Merkel dismissed the report, calling it \"nonsense.\" In the meantime, Kramp-Karrenbauer doesn't appear to be instilling confidence either inside or outside the party.  Last week a Forsa poll by CNN affiliate RTL showed that 70% of respondents did not want Kramp-Karrenbauer to take over for Merkel as Chancellor. Merkel (R) with Kramp-Karrenbauer at CDU headquarters in October.Rise of the GreensWhat does that mean for Merkel? Well, she's not out just yet. GroKo still stands and her term as Chancellor doesn't end until 2021.  But if the coalition finally does crack, the CDU will need to build another coalition, this time with the Free Democrats and the Green party, now surging in the polls.  Climate change concerns sour Germany's love for carsFor the first time ever, this week the Greens polled in first place, usurping the CDU, according to the Forsa Trendbarometer conducted by CNN affiliate, RTL.Merkel is nothing if not a pragmatic dealmaker. But she has tried this political combination before and failed. In the past, Merkel has said she only intends to complete her term and ruled out running for any political office after 2021. Is her successor ready to take on the challenge?  On Monday, when asked if she was prepared to become chancellor in the event of a coalition collapse, Kramp-Karrenbauer took it in her stride. She said: \"There are very good reasons to not recklessly end a government, considering the situation in Germany and Europe.  We at the CDU are obliged to provide reliability and stability.\"\"You can be assured that the CDU is ready for any possibility that may or may not happen.\"",

This was a rather more sobering sight -- one that defender Aya Sameshima admits she could hardly bring herself to look at. The players may have been thousands of miles away from home in Germany, but the scars from of the earthquake and tsunami that had devastated the northeastern corner of the country still lurked in their thoughts. \"It is certain that it motivated the whole team to win,\" Sameshima, who is moved to tears by the memory of those events eight years on, tells CNN Sport. \"However,\" she qualifies, \"I could not look directly at those [pictures].\" \n\nAlmost nobody in the world seriously thought that Japan would win\nAsako Takakura\nRead MoreOn a bitterly cold day in March 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake rocked the north eastern corner of Japan -- the largest earthquake recorded in the country's history.  Its shockwaves threw up waves 40 meters in height, sweeping across the Pacific Ocean and onto coastal towns. In total, over 20,000 people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands more were forced from their homes. Although they didn't realize at the time, many residents living near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on the east coast would never return as water flooding into the plant caused radiation to leak into the surrounding area.Follow @cnnsport\n\nResidents throw bouquets of flowers to mourn those killed in the 2011 tsunami and earthquake.The cleanup is estimated to take 40 years, and only in recent months have residents started to return to the area. It's no wonder, then, that those pictures shown to Sameshima and her teammates ahead of the World Cup quarterfinal elicited such a powerful response. Nadeshiko -- the nickname of the Japanese women's football team -- went on to defeat hosts Germany in extra-time.Having entered the tournament as an unfancied outsider, Japan proceeded to topple the USA on penalties in the final, becoming the first ever Asian nation to win an international football tournament. READ: 'It's way more than football' -- Jamaica's remarkable journey to France 2019READ: From nude calendars to title contenders -- the Matildas' long road to successInstilling hopeBack home, the news was received with delight. \"I think almost nobody in the world seriously thought that Japan would win,\" Asako Takakura, who played for the women's national team in the 1980s and 90s before becoming coach in 2016, tells CNN. \"Many people in Japan saw Nadeshiko winning even though we didn't have absolute power and strength, and they told us they got lots of power from us. I feel that the whole of Japan won the title.\"Watching players who are trying really hard in all sports -- football, in our case -- can move people's hearts ... I felt we could move the hearts of the people watching us back home.\"  The feats of Nadeshiko that year and the Fukushima disaster that had ripped through the country four months previously are curiously interwoven.\n\nIt brought a bright light because their life was afflicted by pain\nShunsuke Ono\nJ-Village, Japan's national football training center based in Fukushima, was used as a place of refuge immediately after the earthquake and tsunami.Later, it became a base for the nuclear recovery. Steel plates were lined over the grounds that transformed the once-green pitches into a parking spot for heavy machinery.The players did their bit for the recovery, too. \"The 2011 World Cup gave us great courage, especially for the people enduring difficult times because of the disaster,\" Shunsuke Ono, now a rep at the J-Village but previously a coach of the Japanese team, tells CNN Sport.\"I believe that many people were encouraged by watching the World Cup. I think it brought a bright light because their life was afflicted by pain ... it was great to make the Japanese people happy.\" Vehicles are seen parked on the football pitches at the training center in November 2011.Reopened for businessOno took up a job to help rebuild the J-Village in July 2013. Progress has been slow since then, but now the site is back up and running and footballers are starting to trickle through the doors once more.\"We had a dark time but we are expecting more people will come here in the future,\" Ono continues. \"We are working hard for that reason. It is too quiet here without people. J-Village in Fukushima was instrumental in the recovery effort following the nuclear disaster.READ: The summer of '99 and the match that changed women's football\"I really want to regain the bustle here, and I really want to make it a place where more football players, football teams and football fans come back.\"After we started the operation here at the end of July, we had approximately 250,000 people visit for eight months which is about half what we had before [the disaster].\" READ: Nigeria's plan to become a footballing superpower The reopening of the J-Village has coincided with residents returning to towns surrounding Fukushima. Earlier this year, the painstaking process of removing nuclear fuel rods from one of the nuclear reactors got underway. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe presents a ball to a local football club ealier this year when the J-Village was repoened.Now thoughts can turn to this year's World Cup in France, ahead of which the training center has been put to use by the Japanese players.Nadeshiko is hoping to avenge the 5-2 defeat to the USA in the 2015 final having been drawn in a group that includes England -- which Japan beat in the semifinals four years ago -- Scotland and Argentina. According to head coach Takakura, the team's spirits are high.\"I feel players are really positive, full of motivation, cheerful and get along very well with each other,\" says the former midfielder, who led her team to an Asian Cup victory in Jordan last year.\"The Japanese players and Japan as a country suffered from the loss [in 2015]. However, we've put those feelings behind us by focusing on the future all the time. I remember that renewed energy came to us very soon afterwards.\"Japanese players lift the World Cup in 2011. READ: The female footballers who fought for change in South AmericaA repeat in 2019?There is a youthful look to Nadeshiko's squad this year with more than half the players aged 23 or younger. With over 100 appearances, Sameshima is one of the most experienced members of the team, but the defender admits the experience of two previous World Cups won't make her job in France any easier. \"I am playing with far more pressure than I was before,\" she says.\"We've had a generational change. I do wonder how many years younger some of the girls are than me. Some very young girls have joined who have never player in a big tournament like the World Cup before.\"Winning the World Cup is the team's aim ... The important thing is to let these girls play freely on the pitch. I'd like to create an atmosphere where these young girls can play freely.\"      While the 2011 victory saw a surge in the popularity of women's football in Japan, Sameshima, who turns 32 during this year's tournament, admits that the sport needs to raise its profile domestically if Nadeshiko wants to consistently match the likes of the USA. \"It's necessary to establish women's soccer more firmly [in Japan],\" says Sameshima. \"US really has a great pool of players. There are lots of little girls playing soccer as well. That helps them produce more good players.\"A paper published by the Japanese government in 2017 recorded 54,117 female footballers in Japan. In contrast, a FIFA report from 2014 detailed over two million registered female players in the US and Canada. Although the men's J League has received international attention in recent years through the arrival of some of the game's leading players -- the likes of Fernando Torres, Andres Iniesta and Lukas Podolski -- the women's equivalent has struggled.     In the aftermath of the 2011 World Cup, league games \"attracted five to 10 times the usual crowd,\" according to Arthur Syin, a freelance Japanese journalist, but today he says the competition is \"suffering from low funding and very few fans at the games.\"Olympic opportunityNadeshiko's young squad, however, has a chance to inspire the next generation in France this year. And beyond that, there's the prospect of a home Olympics on the horizon, too.  Japan failed to qualify for the Olympics in 2016 having finished runner-up to USA in 2012, but host status for next year's Games guarantees Japan's involvement. Japan's players thank their supports after defeating USA to win the World Cup. Fukushima will also be put under the spotlight. When the Olympic torch arrives on Japanese shores next year, it will start its procession through the country from the site of the three-fold tragedy -- earthquake, tsunami, then nuclear meltdown -- that unfurled eight years ago. \"The decision to host the Tokyo Olympics was a big reason to regain and rebuild this place and the football facility,\" says J-Village rep Ono. \"We would like many teams to visit here for the Tokyo Olympic Games, especially Japan's national teams, both male and female. I would love them to train here and get a good result at the Olympics.\"I hope it will be a really bright light for those in Fukushima who have had such a dark and painful time.\"",

Ruiz's quick hands and ruthless counter punching exposed Joshua's defense, flooring the Briton on four occasions -- twice in the third round, and twice again in the seventh. Ruiz was given an 11-1 chance of winning in New York, but defied his outsider status to be crowned Mexico's first ever heavyweight champion.Rarely one to speak in inflated terms, Joshua was magnanimous in defeat.\"Boxing's a tough sport.

Semenya, 28, took her case to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland after an appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in May.In its ruling last month CAS announced that its three-person panel had rejected Semenya's challenge \"by majority\" but did add that it had \"serious concerns as to the future practical application\" of the new rules.Under the IAAF's policy all DSD athletes, who are usually born with testes, would have to reduce their blood testosterone to a specific level for a continuous period of at least six months -- and maintain that for the rest of their athletic career in order to compete in events from 400 meters to a mile. Semenya's legal representative, Dorothee Schramm, said in a statement: \"The Swiss Supreme Court has granted welcome temporary protection to Caster Semenya. This is an important case that will have fundamental implications for the human rights of female athletes.\"The IAAF told CNN Sport Monday that it had no comment to make as it had not received any information from the Swiss court. Athletics' governing body believes DSD athletes have a competitive advantage -- findings that were disputed by Semenya and her legal team.South Africa's Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, supported the decision on Twitter.\"We welcome the decision taken by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court to suspend the implementation of the IAAF's regulations for athletes with \"differences of sex development\" pending @Caster800m #CasterSemenya's appeal.

        "content": "(CNN)Late afternoon in Dallas and the Toyota Stadium in the city's suburbs is all but empty. Dotted around an otherwise sweep of vacant red and blue seats are a few hundred fans. In the lower bleachers, looking like the first specks of a pointillist painting, some supporters are wearing plastic ponchos, protecting themselves from the drizzling rain on what is a chilly October Wednesday. Though they create sound, the cheers and the cries are largely swallowed up into the ether. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe majority of ticket-holders have yet to filter into the 20,000-seat arena for that evening's top-billed match between the US and Canadian national women's teams. It means only the few experience the drama and the history unfolding on the pitch as Jamaica and Panama engage in a stomach-churning penalty shootout. \"No one was paying attention to us, so to speak, but it really wasn't about anything else but us,\" Jamaica goalkeeper Nicole McClure tells CNN Sport, remembering the match which would alter the course of women's football in her country. Deadlocked at 2-2 after 120 minutes, there was only one way to resolve the high-stakes third-place playoff which would determine which team would qualify for the Women's World Cup in France. The winner, indeed, taking it all. \n\nI don't think a single thought was going through my head other than World Cup! World Cup! World Cup!\nDominique Bond-Flasza\nRead MoreJamaica had already been bold, bringing on McClure especially for the shootout. She and her teammates had practiced spot-kicks throughout the week. Was this shootout destiny or an example of how well prepared the squad was? Perhaps both. Four penalties in and no one has yet missed. Pulses quicken. Panama's Lineth Cedeno steps up, directs her effort at an obliging height and McClure saves but there is no wild celebration from the team's unflappable substitute goalkeeper. Instead, she calmly tells herself that she must save another. \"The first save I felt something. I would say something within myself,\" she recalls.Kenia Rangel, Panama's fourth penalty taker, places the ball on the white spot 12 yards from goal. She shoots to her left, McClure dives low, her outstretched hand making contact with the ball. Save. Jamaica is on verge of becoming the first Caribbean island to qualify for the biggest tournament in the women's game. Supporters continue to filter into the stadium. The majority of the Jamaican team look as if they're on trampolines, bouncing on the halfway line in an attempt to contain the butterflies as Dominique Bond-Flasza prepares to take the penalty which could make history. Walking towards the penalty spot, the PSV defender decides where to place her shot. To the right, towards the top corner. \"You know what to do,\" she tells herself, before taking a deep breath. Though there are nerves, she does not fear failure because she has not contemplated missing. \"I just went for it,\" Bond-Flasza tells CNN Sport. The ball flies into the net. READ: The match that changed women's football Bond-Flasza celebrates scoring the penalty which saw Jamaica qualify for France 2019. Against the odds, after cuts in funding, after disbandment, after hearing naysayers opine that women couldn't and shouldn't play football, Jamaica's women qualify for the Women's World Cup for the first time in the country's history. The 22-year-old Bond-Flasza, the daughter of a Jamaican mother and Polish father, starts running towards her teammates before turning on her heels, switching direction to sprint towards McClure after noticing her goalkeeper is not among the yellow swarm racing towards her. \"I don't think a single thought was going through my head other than World Cup! World Cup! World Cup!\" recalls Bond-Flasza, who was engulfed by her teammates, buried at the bottom of a heap of unbridled joy after they eventually caught her. \"I couldn't believe what we'd just accomplished.\"Bond-Flasza and McClure revel in victory.'I'm not here for money and accolades'Jamaica's head coach Hue Menzies did not see Bond-Flasza's penalty because a cameraman was in his sight line, but he did not need a bird's-eye view to know the right-back had scored. The force of his 6 feet 4 inch, 270-pound goalkeeping coach jumping on his back in a sugar-rush of emotion told Menzies all he needed to know.Anyway, he had never doubted his players. \"We had confidence,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"Some of these players come from very adverse situations. When you're dealing with that, you don't feel a difficult situation like that is going to jolt them.\" \n\nWe're earning our respect, we haven't got it, we're earning it.\nHue Menzies\nAn American-based soccer coach who moved to Jamaica after living the first four years of his life in England, Menzies describes himself as a \"mommy's boy.\" With his father having left the family when he was young, he was brought up by a mom who, he says, had to be both a mother and a father. \"A strong-minded woman,\" is how he describes her, his respect unbounded. It is partly because of the influence and strength of the women in his life, his mom, his grandmother, that Menzies has devoted himself to lifting his country's female players from the depths of disbandment to the highs of World Cup qualification. READ: Australia's long road to football success\"We can't let all these obstacles stop us from what we're doing,\" says Menzies. For all his time and commitment, for all his passion, despite his role in his country's soccer history, neither Menzies or his coaching staff have ever been paid by the Jamaican Football Federation (JFF). But, the Jamaican insists, he is not coaching for financial reward. His mission has never solely been to improve how Jamaica's women play the beautiful game. \"It's way more than football what we're trying to do here,\" says Menzies, an eloquent progressive who is taking care of his sick mother while juggling commitments with the Reggae Girlz and his paid role as executive director of Florida Kraze Krush (FKK), a successful youth soccer organization in Orlando, Florida. \"We're not talking about football, we're talking about culture, about how they perceive females playing football, so we have to change the mindset of people in Jamaica to understand that female football is just as exciting, that the opportunities are there for them and it gives hope to all those young females on the island to get somewhere in life. \"We've got to keep plugging, we can't let all these obstacles stop us from what we're doing.\"\"Big up to Cedella Marley for putting her neck on the line for us.\"To say Jamaica's success owes much to Menzies' vision and passion would be an understatement. When the JFF had little interest in organizing international matches for its female footballers, Menzies ensured the country's most promising players had a pathway, had hope. In 2008, funding was cut and the women's senior team was disbanded. Six years later, Bob Marley's daughter, Cedella, attempted to fix things by becoming an ambassador and sponsor through the Bob Marley Foundation, raising just enough for the team to re-form. But in 2016, the federation disbanded the team again. Cedella, who lives in America, redoubled her efforts, convincing Alessandra Lo Savio, co-founder of the Alacran Foundation, to become a major contributor. \"Big up to Cedella Marley for putting her neck on the line for us,\" Menzies told reporters immediately after the shootout win in Dallas. But perhaps her greatest act was persuading Menzies to coach the team because, in truth, it took some convincing. \"She told me her purpose. A large part of it is her dad's love for the game and, second of all, she wanted to inspire young females in Jamaica,\" explains Menzies, who gave up a career in corporate finance to become a full-time soccer coach.\"At the time, the program was in a downward situation. She helped create some type of positive vibe. When she talked about the impact it could have on the kids, the culture, the mindset, I said 'I'm in' because that's what I'm here for. I'm not here for money and accolades, I'm just here to change the mindsets of people.\" Disbandment, strategies, phone callsWere it not for Menzies' foresight, ensuring Jamaica's most promising young talents were given opportunities to play in the States when the country's women's league was disbanded in 2015 and the national team lay dormant, it is difficult to envision how Jamaica, nicknamed the Reggae Girlz, could have successfully negotiated a qualifying campaign. The break up of the women's league was, says Menzies, a \"blessing in disguise\" as it gave him the freedom to formulate a long-term strategy which has resulted in the development of world talents such as forwards Khadija Shaw and Jody Brown \"I had all our players playing. Younger players, we were putting them in boarding schools and so forth, so yeah, there were things in place. We were sitting there waiting to see when we were going to get that phone call,\" he says.Jamaica's forward Khadija Shaw (right) is expected to make an impact in France.  Two years ago, Jamaica's women were unranked by FIFA, the sport's governing body, because the national team had not played since its failure to qualify for the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada. Despite the inactivity, Menzies said he knew the JFF would eventually ask him to form a team for the 2019 World Cup qualifying campaign because FIFA was putting pressure on every national federation to support the women's game.Late last year, the governing body announced a five-pronged global strategy to grow the game, one being to ensure all 211 members have comprehensive women's plans in place by 2022.In February 2018, three months before the opening qualifier, Menzies received the call he had been waiting for.\"I always knew we were going to have this phone call so even though our program was disbanded, I knew the qualifiers was coming around and the way FIFA was handling the adjustment for female football around the world, I knew the federation here had to figure out a way to get the team on the field or they won't get more funding,\" Menzies explains. The Reggae Girlz played South Africa in an international friendly earlier this year. The road to FranceHaving not played an international match since a 2-1 defeat by Guyana in November 2015, the Reggae Girlz played Barbados and Cuba in April 2018 before starting their World Cup qualification campaign in May. It got off to a bright start with a thumping 13-0 win over Guadeloupe in the opening match, followed by a 3-0 victory over Martinique and a draw with Haiti. Victories continued, against Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Trinidad and Tobago and Cuba before, to no one's surprise, the team lost to Canada. But it was the match two days after the defeat by Canada, a 1-0 win over Costa Rica in Texas last October, which gave the team belief they could achieve what many had felt impossible. \"Going into the tournament without a lot of preparation was a little nerve-wracking but a lot of the girls are passionate about the sport,\" says Bond-Flasza.\"When you're able to win a match like that against Costa Rica, you build this sense of confidence and a sense of: I actually belong here, and perhaps we can really do something with this, perhaps we can really qualify for the World Cup. \"That win against Costa Rica was a big turning point for us.\"      Celebratory cakes and bus paradesDays after celebrating with teammates and singing the national anthem in a Dallas dressing room, it is time for McClure to return to reality. She is traveling back to her club in Sweden and, despite her protests that she does not need to be driven to training, her goalkeeping coach collects her from the bus station and takes her to the training ground in Sundsvalls, a town nearly 400 kilometers (248 miles) north of Stockholm. As she approaches the dressing room, she can hear Bob Marley being played loudly enough for the whole of Sweden to hear. \"They surprised me with a cake in Jamaican colors,\" McClure recalls of her teammates' welcoming party. \"It's been a very warm reception since qualification.\"\"I hope we can shock the world,\" says McClure.In December, the players were paraded on a bus tour of Jamaica.From Montego Bay to Saint Catherine Parish, Kingston and Trench Town, the team, which is doing much to challenge stifling gender norms, was lauded.   \"It was very gratifying, and it speaks volumes about the diversity in our team,\" said Menzies. \"We have kids of affluence and kids of struggle. That was a very good celebration. We also had a couple of concerts for us and a banquet with the Prime Minister.\"He jokes: \"People I haven't heard from in years are my best friends now.\"      'Earning respect'Menzies says the government has stuck to its promise of providing financial assistance. The Minister for Sport, Olivia Grange, whom the players affectionately refer to as \"Auntie Babsy,\" is making sure the team has been \"taken care of,\" says Menzies.There are sponsors on board now, too, and a women's league exists, albeit only for two months a year, but there is still much work to be done. After all, society can be slow to change. Jamaica will be the lowest ranked team competing at France 2019.  \"We're going to the World Cup. Does it open the door for sponsorships? Does it open the doors for professional clubs that has male teams to go ahead and start a women's team?\" Menzies asks.  \"We're hoping that this World Cup experience, and everything that we're going through, is going to provide some of that for these players. Our attitude is to go there and get results. We look at it as a challenge, a challenge to show the world that we can compete at that level, that stage and that platform.\"Qualifying was important but we have a bigger picture that we want to fix. We're earning our respect, we haven't got it, we're earning it.\"Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videos'I hope we can shock the world'Reaching the World Cup, where Jamaica will be the lowest-ranked team in the tournament, is not the conclusion of the story. Though the tale may not necessarily have a happily-ever-after ending there is a determination within the camp to prove people wrong in France or, as McClure puts it, to  \"shut up the haters and the naysayers.\" \"I hope we can shock the world,\" says the goalkeeper. \"Like with anything, everyone isn't going to support what we're doing. For me, that's motivation to do even better. I hear the word no and I say 'Oh, yeah, then watch me.'\"If you have spent years following your dream with little support, if you have excelled despite the snorts of derision from some compatriots, the fire will never die.",

Serbian world No. 1 Djokovic -- who awaits Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals -- became the first man to make 10 straight French Open quarterfinals. Nadal likely would have matched him had he not been forced to pull out in the third round in 2016 with a wrist injury. In another milestone, 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova became the youngest female quarterfinalist at the French Open since Martina Hingis in 1998 after topping Spanish qualifier Aliona Bolsova 6-3 6-0. Up next is defending champion Simona Halep, who advanced in similar fashion, 6-1 6-0 in 45 minutes over 18-year-old Wimbledon junior champion Iga Swiatek. Showman Monfils has admittedly become more focused towards the latter stages of his career, realizing that at 32 time is indeed running out. And unusually for him at a grand slam, he didn't drop any sets through three rounds. There was plenty of energy left on the eve of the much anticipated clash with Thiem. Early leadThiem, however, grabbed a commanding 5-1 lead in about 20 minutes and a rattled Monfils never really recovered.Perhaps Monfils trailing Thiem 4-0 in their head-to-head duels contributed to the Frenchman's shaky start. \"I didn't start the match well indeed. I don't have any explanation,\" said Monfils. \"I had two double faults in the first game. I made a lot of mistakes, a lot of errors very fast. I wanted to be aggressive but maybe too aggressive.\"JUST WATCHEDRoland Garros clay: A layered cake - with red frostingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRoland Garros clay: A layered cake - with red frosting 02:25The quick lead for Thiem quietened the crowd and Monfils himself admitted to being more muted than usual. \"Of course we are used to seeing me using the audience a bit more, but with the coach, we decided to do some things differently, to try something else,\" he said. Having dropped a set in each of his first three rounds, progressing in under two hours was exactly what Thiem sought with bigger tests ahead. Djokovic sits in Thiem's half of the draw, meaning a possible semifinal showdown. Thiem might be relieved his next challenger isn't Juan Martin del Potro, given the Argentine won all four of their tussles. Instead he will tangle with maiden grand slam quarterfinalist Karen Khachanov, a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 winner over the 2009 US Open titlist. Del Potro and Khachanov, by contrast, had no problems getting the crowd involved. They traded mammoth forehands for more than three hours, with Khachanov crucially doing better converting break points. The Russian saved two at 5-5 in the first, then broke. Reeling, del Potro buckled in his first service game of the second to trail 2-0. And in the fourth, Khachanov saved a pair of break points in the first game, immediately breaking thereafter.  Frustrated, the animated del Potro struck his head with his racket and on another occasion took a swipe at the courtside flowers. But ever a crowd favorite, he left the court to a rousing reception.

Resuming down two sets to one after darkness halted proceedings Sunday, Paire saved two match points in the gripping fourth-set tiebreak and led 4-1 and 5-3 in the final set. But Nishikori is one tough customer in deciders. He improved to 23-6 in fifth sets and has bagged 11 of his last 12. In the previous round against Laslo Djere the Japanese baseliner rallied from 3-0 down -- two breaks.

Still a success for PaireNevertheless, the tournament proved a success for Paire, as it did for countrymen Nicolas Mahut, 23-year-old Antoine Hoang and 20-year-old Corentin Moutet.

        "content": "Madrid (CNN)After one of the most thrilling and unpredictable Champions League seasons in memory, Saturday's final was meant to be the grand finale. Instead, it was a damp squib.The past few months saw the rise of an upstart Ajax side that demolished defending champion Real Madrid in its own house, an overachieving Spurs side that reached the final without captain Harry Kane and without a new signing all year, and two of the greatest Champions League comebacks ever.  Liverpool and Tottenham had played some of the most exhilarating football in Europe this season, including a pair of three-goal comebacks that took them to the Champions League final.  But whether it was the weight of the occasion, the suffocating Madrid heat, or the disruptive three-week break, the final didn't live up to its billing.Read MoreVisit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosBy all accounts, Tottenham was the better side -- or at least the side in control -- for much of the game.With 62% possession and eight shots on target to Liverpool's three, Tottenham won the statistical battle, except where it really mattered.Liverpool's ecstatic manager Jurgen Klopp, fresh from breaking his six-game losing streak in major finals, had no problem with that. \"I played a lot more finals than I won,\" he said after the game. \"And I always played the better football. I don't want to explain why we won it, I just want to enjoy winning it.\"On the other side, I know how Tottenham feel in this moment better than anybody else in the world.\"They played a sensational season and would have deserved it as well. I told Poch (Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino) they should be really proud of what they achieved this season.\"Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur in Champions League final to win sixth European Cup'The final is about winning'Questions have lingered over Pochettino's future at Tottenham for the better part of two years.After the final, the Argentine offered no assurances he would remain at the club next season, but praised the vision of Spurs' ownership and management.Tottenham's season featured the unveiling of a gleaming new stadium in March, but the project truly came to fruition on Saturday night, Pochettino said.He proudly and rightly pointed out he had \"spent zero\" on this side over the past year and not only competed against teams that spent hundreds of millions, but also got the better of them.\"You can interpret things in different ways,\" Pochettino told the assembled media. \"People want to compare me with other managers, but we are different managers, in different places with different pressures.\"After five years at Tottenham, the project was clear. Our ambition has been amazing and the commitment from our players was amazing.\"Now it's about staying calm and changing the mood and our minds.\"The 47-year-old made it clear, however, that not winning a trophy this season will sting, despite all the progress his club has made. \"The final is about winning,\" he said. \"It's not about deserving it or playing well.

You don't want to be in my place.\"Wawrinka creaked in the final set but never cracked. The lone break points Tsitsipas faced in the fifth set, meanwhile, came in the last game. In a tussle filled with breathtaking strikes, Wawrinka's finish was both sublime and atypical. With the players taking turns ripping one-handed backhands and going to the net throughout the marathon -- particularly Tsitsipas -- it was defense that officially got Wawrinka over the finish line. His backhand slice from well outside the tram lines angled just enough to catch the outside of the line on a second match point. Chair umpire Renaud Lichtenstein had a closer look at the mark and confirmed the ball was good. 5 hours, 9 minutes. 1 amazing tennis match.@stanwawrinka outlasts Tsitsipas 7-6(6) 5-7 6-4 3-6 8-6 to reach the quarter-finals at Roland-Garros. \ud83c\udfbe https://t.co/YBfhOfEkVk#RG19 pic.twitter.com/2Ql6Rz92on\u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) 2 June 2019\n\nFittingly the two men embraced at the net seconds later, to cap the fourth-longest match in tournament history. How sweet it was for Wawrinka, who thought his career might be over following a knee injury in 2017 that necessitated multiple surgeries. Even though Tsitsipas failed to convert many of his break chances -- \"so many break points, so many,\" he lamented -- it would be harsh to criticize the 20-year-old. He dived for volleys like Boris Becker in his heyday, and rallied impressively after dropping the third set. Wawrinka's famous backhand, however, was in full flow. He saved a set point in the opening tiebreak with a backhand passing shot and broke Tsitsipas to temporarily stay in the third set with another glittering pass. In the third set, at 4-5, one of the five set points he saved in the game came when he ran Tsitsipas all over the court before gently stroking a drop shot that clipped the net.

Seconds later, seemingly the same fan shouted, \"I love you,\" to the Greek who was contesting just the second fifth set of his blossoming career. He also smiled. \"This kind of atmosphere, for sure, I enjoyed,\" said Wawrinka. \"I enjoy a lot.

It certainly pleased Federer. \"It's good to see,\" said Federer. \"You feel more free by hitting with the one hand.\" Roger Federer (blue shirt) and Stan Wawrinka will meet in the French Open quarterfinals. When they played in 2015 in Paris, Wawrinka won. Rafael Nadal possesses a two-handed backhand that has shown more zip from the baseline in recent years and the King of Clay, like Federer, cruised into the last eight by ousting Mayer's fellow Argentinean Juan Ignacio Londero 6-2 6-3 6-3. This after the 11-time French Open winner dropped a set against David Goffin in round three. While the top 10 men's seeds in the draw had all advanced to the fourth round, the same couldn't be said in the women's draw.

While this could make for a less than warm welcome for Trump, it will not be the first time Queen Elizabeth II has welcomed a controversial leader to the British capital. As the country's longest-serving monarch, the Queen has entertained a variety of heads of state with grace and diplomacy during her 67-year reign. Here's a look back at some of the world leaders whose trips have raised eyebrows. Xi JinpingRead MoreThe Queen accompanies Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, during their state visit in 2015. Protesters gathered in central London to demonstrate against China's human rights record during President Xi Jinping's 2015 visit, which was aimed at strengthening economic ties between China and the UK.  George W. Bush US President George W. Bush and the Queen at the end of a three-day state visit to the UK in 2003. Anti-war demonstrators swarmed the British capital when US President George Bush made a state visit to the UK in 2003. Vladimir Putin Putin and the Queen share an open carriage along the Mall following his arrival in London in 2003. President Vladimir Putin made the first state visit to the UK by a Russian leader in more than 125 years when he arrived in London in 2003. The trip was met with protests over Russia's role in the Chechnya conflict and concern over the Kremlin's support for Iran's nuclear program. It also came on the heels of tensions between the two countries over the US-led Iraq war, which Britain supported but the Kremlin opposed.  Bashar al-Assad Queen Elizabeth II receives Asma and Bashar al-Assad on December 17, 2002 at Buckingham Palace.In 2002, President Bashar al-Assad became the first Syrian leader to make an official visit to the UK. While it wasn't a state visit, but he still met the Queen at Buckingham Palace. The four-day trip was partly sidetracked by a public disagreement between Assad and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair over a possible war in Iraq. Saudi King Abdullah The Queen, Prince Charles (R) and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia look on during a ceremonial welcome for the King at Horse Guards Parade in London in 2007.The Saudi monarch's 2007 visit attracted controversy for a number of reasons, including the Kingdom's treatment of women and the gay community. Robert Mugabe President Robert Mugabe has visited the UK on multiple occasions over the years, pictured in 1994. Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was greeted by the Queen and her husband, Prince Phillip, at Buckingham Palace during his state visit in 1994. He was given an honorary knighthood during the trip, though he would later be stripped of the award. Mugabe resigned as his country's president in 2017 after 37 years of autocratic rule. Nicolae Ceausescu The Queen with Ceausescu in 1978.Queen Elizabeth hosted the Romanian communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1978. Ceausescu ruled Romania from 1965 using secret police to brutally repress his people. The Queen was apparently so displeased that Ceausescu had been invited to the UK that she hid behind a bush on the ground of Buckingham Palace to avoid speaking to him, Reuters reported.Mobutu Sese Seko Mobutu Sese Seko with the Queen in December 1973.Mobutu Sese Seko, President of Zaire -- now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo -- embarked on a UK state visit in 1973. He seized power in 1965 and led one of the most brutal African regimes for the next three decades. Western support for the dictator waned in the early 1990s after years of allegations of human rights abuses and rampant corruption, and he died in exile in 1997.",

        "content": "Luke McGee is a senior producer for CNN based in London. London (CNN)When US President Donald Trump touches down in London on Monday morning, he sets foot in a nation living through its worst political crisis since the end of the Second World War.Theresa May last week became the second British prime minister to fall victim to Brexit. The governing Conservative party is engaged in a myopic fight over who will replace her. Voters are sick of the mess and are flocking to political movements on the extreme ends of the Brexit debate. Ordinarily, a state visit from the sitting US President is a chance for the UK so show off to the world the \"special relationship\" it enjoys with America and Britain at its best. But the best outcome for the Trump state visit is that it passes with as little fuss as possible. The chances of that seem slim. On Friday night, the Sun newspaper published an interview with the President in which he said that Boris Johnson, the current front-runner to replace May, would do a \"very good job\" as prime minister. It was his second intervention in as many days. Earlier in the week, Trump said that  Johnson was a \"friend\" for whom he had \"a lot of respect.\" He said the same thing of the hard Brexiteer and Conservative Party nemesis, Nigel Farage. Trump even hinted that he might meet the pair while he's in London.Read MoreOfficials would rather he didn't, and there's nothing on the official schedule so far. And while Farage would thrive from the attention, it's not at all clear that Johnson would benefit from a presidential one-on-one.Under normal circumstances, someone hoping to be the next leader of a country would bite the hand off a US President offering an endorsement. But these are not normal circumstances and Donald Trump is not a normal President.Johnson is often described as a British Trump. Both men have a history of saying controversial and sometimes offensive things in public (Johnson famously wrote a newspaper column last year saying that women wearing full Islamic face veils looked like letter boxes). Both have been accused of lying during political campaigns (something for which Johnson now faces a court hearing). And both have absolutely epic hairstyles.Boris Johnson and Donald Trump at UN headquarters on September 18, 2017, when Johnson was UK Foreign Secretary.However, the comparisons only work at this superficial level. Comparing Johnson's politics to Trump's populism is at best disingenuous and at worst a smear. The thing is, it's a smear that works.Trump is not popular in the UK. Most Brits regard his style of politics as crass. His public comments about women and Muslims don't go down well. There is a sense of British fair play that tends to extend to the level of decency expected by those elected to power. This is especially true of Conservative party members. Think people drinking warm beer and watching cricket, not screaming \"lock her up\" at rallies.Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London sums it up: \"I think people in the US don't appreciate that Donald Trump is seen on all sides of British politics as a figure of fun and not someone to take too seriously. Any endorsement by him isn't likely to do a candidate any good -- and might do them some damage.\"The problem for Johnson is that, in calling him a \"friend\", Trump has already given him something of an endorsement. It's unlikely that Johnson feels the same. In 2015, when Johnson was mayor of London, Trump said that some areas of the British capital with large Muslim populations had become so radicalized \"that police are afraid for their own lives.\" Johnson's riposte was that he wouldn't visit some parts of New York for the \"real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\" Nigel Farage visiting Trump Tower. For Farage, the Trump connection plays differently. His newly-formed Brexit Party finished in first place at last week's European elections. Broadly speaking, Farage's base is far more sympathetic to Trumpian politics than Johnson's. An endorsement from Trump could help Farage lock down that harder-line voter at a crucial moment in British politics. And Farage has the luxury of not needing to look outside of that pool of voters.Unlike Farage, Johnson has to appeal to a far broader church if he is to succeed as leader. Many Conservatives voted to remain in the EU and remain ardently pro-European. As recently as October, liberal Conservatives grimaced at the idea of Johnson becoming prime minister. Today, many of them see him as their only option if they are to avoid electoral oblivion.The success of the Brexit Party has spooked Conservatives. The longer Brexit remains unresolved, the more vulnerable they are. On Friday, the polling company YouGov published a survey of voters' general election intentions which placed both the governing Conservatives and opposition Labour behind the second-placed Brexit Party.Boris Johnson, favorite to be Britain's next PM, to face court for alleged Brexit liesBrexit, as if anyone needed reminding, is the single most divisive issue in Britain today. Ahead of the Brexit Party in the YouGov survey were the Liberal Democrats, a party that campaigned in last week's European elections using the slogan \"Bollocks to Brexit.\"The UK's traditional two-party system has held for a long time, but it is creaking. Brexit has devastated the traditional dividing lines and rewritten the rules of politics. Neither of the main parties has even begun to work out how to address this new challenge.And into this mayhem marches a US President with a proven track record of being wildly unhelpful to the British government. On his last visit, his opening gambit was to give an interview to the Sun newspaper in which he trashed Theresa May's handling of Brexit.Trump wades back into Brexit fight, says May 'didn't listen' to his adviceLast year, he publicly stated that the deal she had struck with the EU would prohibit the UK from being able to trade with the US.Whether or not the President will meet with either Johnson or Farage is getting a lot of attention. As things stand, people working on the details of the trip do not officially expect either meeting to happen. But this is a president who marches to the beat of his own drum and loves attention -- good or bad.It probably hasn't occurred to him that others would prefer that he kept his mouth shut.",

Hide Caption 12 of 12For Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's victory -- its sixth European Cup triumph and first since 2005 -- breaks his curse of six consecutive defeats in major finals and gives the German his first Champions League title in three finals.\"I'm really happy, I have a lot of silver medals now I have a gold medal,\" Klopp told reporters after the match. \"In the dressing room everyone feels it but you don't really know what to do with it -- but tomorrow when we drive through the city (Liverpool), we will realize what the boys have done. \"I'm happy for the boys. Jordan Henderson is captain of the 2019 Champions League winner, that is satisfying. It was not important for me to touch the trophy, but I loved seeing the pictures of the boys with it. Going to Liverpool tomorrow and having something to celebrate is big. \"The last six occasions I flew with my family on holiday with the silver medal and it doesn't feel good -- so this is for them as well.\"Pandemonium, then quietSo off-script was that scarcely believable opening 60 seconds, neither side knew what to do next.At one minute and 48 seconds, it was the second-fastest goal ever scored in a Champions League final.Tottenham players, to their credit, regained composure almost immediately. Though they controlled much of what followed, a blunt attack not once looked like troubling Liverpool.Harry Kane -- playing for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in the semifinal first leg seven weeks ago -- flitted in and out of the game, dropping deep in an attempt to force some creativity.The Spurs captain mustered just 11 touches of the ball in the first half, less than every other player in white.Unsurprisingly, Son Heung-min looked like Tottenham's most threatening player. On two occasions the South Korean's twinkling feet looked to have evaded Liverpool's defenders, only to be smothered by more backup in red.Tottenham Hotspur argue with referee Damir Skomina after the penalty decision.After a heart-pounding start, the game -- and the fans -- suffered a significant lull. In the 45 minutes that followed Salah's goal, the stadium was strangely subdued.Whether it was the stifling Madrid heat, the nerves of the occasion or the bizarre opening 60 seconds that affected the two teams, neither side managed to play the swashbuckling football that had defined their Champions League runs this season.The stunted football on the pitch was mirrored by the fans in the stands.Trent Alexander-Arnold fizzed a shot narrowly wide after 15 minutes, temporarily resuscitating a stadium that had mainly fallen into a stunned silence since the opening goal.READ: Former Arsenal 'Invincible' Jose Antonio Reyes dies in car accidentREAD: Wenger says 'fear factor' cripples teams in big moments Tottenham fight backThe biggest cheer from the Spurs end in the first 45 minutes came after Salah shanked a volley high above the crossbar. On a handful of occasions, a pocket of Tottenham fans would attempt to inject some life into the rest of the 17,000 around them.They would begin to gather momentum, before promptly being drowned out by the swathes of red shirts at the other end of the stadium.While 'Allez allez allez' -- Liverpool's adopted Champions League anthem -- sounded at regular intervals in the first half, it was sung with far less gusto than football fans have become accustomed to over the course of the season.Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson of Liverpool celebrates with manager Jurgen Klopp at the final whistle.Tottenham knew it needed a reaction in the second half to have any chance of salvaging the game. The club had waited nearly 140 years for this moment, and everybody involved was determined to not go down with a whimper.Lucas Moura, Spurs' hat-trick hero in the semifinal against Ajax, forced goalkeeper Alisson Becker into a sharp save after Kieran Trippier's rasping strike had stung the Brazilian's hands.The fans behind the goal Tottenham were now attacking responded to the players' efforts. For the first time, it was songs from the Liverpool end that were engulfed, fading into the noise of their opponents.Dele Alli, one of several of Spurs' big names to have a quiet night, somehow missed a header from underneath the crossbar, but was spared his blushes by the linesman's flag.With Liverpool fending off wave after wave of Tottenham attacks and Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip being truly stretched for the first time in almost 90 minutes, Origi found the decisive goal.A crisp left-foot strike that evaded Lloris' despairing dive found the bottom corner, causing those in red to truly erupt for the first time. \"I look stupid if I'm going to say we dominated, had 68% possession, had eight shots to their four,\" Pochettino said. \"The final is about winning, it's not about deserving it or playing well, it's about winning. Nobody will remember that we it deserved it more.\"Son Heung-Min: The rise of a South Korean superstarREAD: How Bob Marley's daughter saved Jamaican women's football After 90 fraught, nerve-shredding minutes, it was Origi who provided Liverpool's moment of catharsis.As the full-time whistle blew, Liverpool's bench scattered onto the pitch. Van Dijk held his head in his hands, unable to comprehend the enormity of his achievement.James Milner held six fingers up to fans, his face contorted with joy, his biceps and veins bulging.Since Klopp took over four season ago, this team has improved so much together but had ultimately only known defeat and second best.Tonight, the German and his players walk away with club football's most coveted prize.They've conquered all of Europe -- and you wouldn't bet on them stopping now.",

        "content": "(CNN)Serena Williams' bid for a record 24th Grand Slam title ended on Saturday when she was ousted from the French Open in the third round by US compatriot Sofia Kenin.The 6-2, 7-5 loss came as a shock as Williams hasn't departed this early from a major tournament in five years. \"I feel like she, in that first set in particular, hit pretty much inches from the line, and I haven't played anyone like that in a long time,\" Williams told reporters. Williams' exit from the Open followed another shock earlier in the day when newcomer Naomi Osaka, who surged during the last two major tournaments, lost  6-4, 6-2 to Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic. Heading into the French Open, Williams and Osaka were chasing record-breaking performances, with Williams attempting to equal Margaret Court's record for the most Grand Slam singles championships and Osaka trying to become the first woman to win three consecutive major tournaments since Williams did it in 2015. Read MoreBut Williams lacked matches entering the French Open, completing a mere three after her eventful  Australian Open that ended with an ankle injury in a quarterfinal defeat. Illness, but more prominently of late, a knee injury, kept her on the sidelines.With three titles, the French Open, too, is the Grand Slam she has found most difficult to conquer.  \"I'm definitely feeling short on matches, and just getting in the swing of things,\" Williams said, acknowledging she needed to work on her conditioning. \"I'm just pretty far away,\" she said. \"But that's the optimistic part, is I haven't been able to be on the court as much as I would have.

And when Williams recovered from a set and break down to lead her 35th-ranked rival 5-4 in the second set, few would have bet against her. Williams has engineered countless Grand Slam comebacks. Her smooth, potent serve started to click and the 10th seed had the fans at Philippe-Chatrier Court behind her, especially as the feisty and fast-rising Kenin contested several line calls that appeared to rile Williams. But her 20-year-old opponent, born in Russia, didn't buckle and broke for 6-5 in a game that began with Williams erring long on a forehand with Kenin stranded. Williams had one more chance but sent a forehand wide on break point. Then on a second match point, her backhand sailed long. Kenin -- who counts Maria Sharapova as her idol -- dropped her racket and during her handshake with Williams appeared to be in disbelief at what she had just accomplished. Osaka, meanwhile, admitted the French Open was just too much to handle. Different feeling\"Definitely I think this tournament I have had a feeling that was different to the other grand slams, or every other grand slam that I have played, because usually I find it very freeing and fun, and this time around I was kind of tense the entire time,\" the world No. 1 told reporters.

But she is a quick study, evidenced by a 7-1 record on the surface this season coming into the French Open. That combined with her performances at the US Open -- where she defeated Williams in a controversial contest -- and Australian Open suggested that another comeback would be in the cards against Siniakova. Osaka after all rallied from set and break deficits in the first round against Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and second round against fellow grand slam champion Victoria Azarenka. It felt like her victory over Azarenka could spark a glittering run but it wasn't to be.The 42nd-ranked Siniakova -- No. 1 in doubles -- starred in the juniors and for her country in last year's Fed Cup final against the US.  The 23-year-old took her chances, converting three of six break points, while Osaka went 0 for 7, all in the opening set. She was also tidy from the baseline, whereas Osaka committed 38 unforced errors.When Osaka erred on match point, Siniakova moved into the fourth round at a major for the first time like Kenin and collected a maiden victory over a No. 1. Halep, Djokovic cruiseSiniakova downed defending French Open champion Simona Halep in China two years ago. On Saturday, Halep prevailed against Lesia Tsurenko in around an hour 6-2 and 6-1 after three-setters in her opening two outings. Also advancing in warm and sunny conditions were men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic, three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka and fifth-seed Alexander Zverev. Djokovic breezed past Italian qualifier Salvatore Caruso 6-3, 6-3 and 6-2 and is yet to drop a set -- or come close to it.

This year, it started melting earlier, in May, and this week's heatwave is expected to accelerate the melt.The country's mammoth ice sheet rises 3,000 meters above sea level. Forecasters predict that its summit will be particularly warm this week, at just below zero degrees. Read More\"It's a very warm temperature for that altitude,\" said Ruth Mottram, climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute.Now 2019 could come close to the record-setting year of 2012, said Jason Box, professor and ice climatologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. During that \"melty year,\" he said, Greenland's ice sheet lost 450 million metric tons -- the equivalent of more than 14,000 tons of ice lost per second.     Global effects What happens in Greenland will be felt across the world. Box said that this year's melt is flooding the North Atlantic with freshwater, which could affect the weather in northwestern Europe. The result could be stronger storms, he added, citing flooding in the UK in 2015 and 2016.\"Whatever happens in Greenland radiates its impact down,\" he said.Vehicles in a flood caused by rising sea levels on a highway in Central Java, Indonesia on February 2.During a year like 2012 or 2019, water produced by Greenland's ice sheet adds more than one millimeter to global sea levels, according to Box. But countries in the tropics could see a rise of two millimeters or more, he said. Extreme is the new norm It will still be some time before the full \"meltiness\" of 2019 is measured. But it's already poised to rival the proportions of 2012 -- and we haven't even reached the end of summer.In July alone, Greenland's ice sheet lost 160 billion tons of ice, according to Clare Nullis, spokeswoman for the UN World Meteorological Organization. That's roughly the equivalent of 64 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, she told reporters on Friday.One of the most remarkable things about the 2019 heatwave is not just the number of records it broke across Europe -- but the margin by which it did so, she said. \"Normally when you get a temperature record broken, it's by a fraction of a degree,\" said Nullis. \"What we saw yesterday was records being broken by two, three, four degrees -- it was absolutely incredible.\"And it's not just the heat that's breaking records. Last year, Greenland experienced it's coldest year in decades, said Box. Visitors interact with blocks of melting ice from an exhibit called 'Ice Watch' in central London in December 2018.According to Nullis, intense heatwaves such as the one bringing up temperatures in Greenland \"carry the signature of man-made climate change.\"It's a view shared by a group of European scientists, including scholars at the University of Oxford, who earlier this month concluded in an analysis published in World Weather Attribution that recent French heatwaves had been made five times more likely because of climate change.The researchers also said that the world is \"very likely\" to see more extreme heatwaves in the future due to climate change.CNN's Isabelle Gerretsen contributed to this report.",

Reuters said the forced marriage protection order related to one of the couple's two children. In addition, the princess asked for both children to be made wards of court, PA reported. She also requested a non-molestation order for herself.After two days of legal argument, the judge ordered a full trial to begin on November 11. No other details could be disclosed.Read MoreUnder English law, a forced marriage protection order is intended to protect a person from marrying against their will, or to help someone already in a forced marriage, for example by preventing the person from being taken abroad. In the case of children who become wards of court, major decisions about their welfare cannot be made without the approval of a judge.Sheikh Mohammed opposes the applications and has asked the court to order the return of his children  to Dubai, where he lives. He was not present in court, and his representatives declined CNN's request for comment.The sheikh and the princess issued a statement earlier this month confirming the case related to their children. \"These proceedings are concerned with the welfare of the two children of their marriage and do not concern divorce or finances,\" the statement read,.Princess Haya bint al-Hussein of Jordan leaving the High Court in London on July 30, 2019.The proceedings were subject to the strict reporting restrictions that pertain in family courts in the UK. CNN and other international media were not allowed into the courtroom.However, after hearing representations from British media organizations, the President of the Family Division, Sir Andrew McFarlane, allowed the broad outlines of the case to be reported.\"There is a public interest in the public understanding, in very broad terms, proceedings that are before the court,\" the judge said, according to PA. He did not allow the gender or ages of the two children to be disclosed.Reports have been swirling in British media for weeks about the collapsed royal marriage after the princess reportedly left her husband and traveled to London. She is the third female family member of Sheikh Mohammed's court to leave the UAE. Two of his daughters -- from another marriage -- have previously attempted to flee the country. Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan and the half-sister of the King of Jordan, is a well-known international figure. She is close friends with the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.The princess, 45, studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University and is a keen equestrian, representing Jordan at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.Sheikh Mohammed, 70, is the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Dubai.Princess Haya was represented in court by Fiona Shackleton, who acted for Prince Charles in his divorce from Princess Diana. Sheikh Mohammed's legal team is headed by Helen Ward, who represented the actor Guy Ritchie in his split from the singer Madonna.This article has been updated to reflect new information on the forced marriage protection order from the High Court",

When the 18-year-old takes to the start line at the Goodwood Festival Thursday, surrounded by an oasis of green in the south of Engand countryside, it will seem a far cry from the venue in which she's more accustomed to riding horses. Thursday's Magnolia Cup -- the annual ladies-only charity race at \"Glorious Goodwood\" -- will be a momentous occasion for Mellah. On top of marking her competitive racing debut, it will also make her the Cup's first Muslim rider, as well as the first jockey to wear a hijab at a British racecourse.

        "content": "(CNN)The California teen accused of murdering an Italian police officer in Rome had been previously charged over an assault in the United States, according to a source with knowledge of the events following the incident. The source said Finnegan Lee Elder, 19, was charged over a 2016 assault of a high school classmate that resulted in severe injury. The details of the assault and Elder's involvement, which took place on October 29, 2016 in San Francisco, were first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle Tuesday.Elder, who was 16 at the time, struck a fellow student and football teammate from the Sacred Heart Preparatory school in San Francisco resulting in the victim hitting his head on the pavement, the source told CNN. It's unclear what, if any, punishment Elder received.Elder, left and Hjorth, right, were arrested in their hotel room in Rome last Friday.Elder and a fellow American Gabriel Natale Hjorth, 18, were arrested last Friday in their room at Rome's Le M\u00e9ridien Visconti hotel. They are accused by Italian police of killing a Carabinieri officer, Mario Cerciello Rega, earlier that day.  Rega, who was unarmed and in plainclothes, was attacked while attempting to recover a backpack allegedly stolen by Elder and Hjorth after a botched drug deal, police say.Read MoreWhile both teens admitted to the assault, according to police, only Elder is accused of stabbing Rega 11 times with a seven-inch knife which officers say he brought from the US to Italy. Hjorth's father said Wednesday his son was \"distraught\" by what happened but is innocent of the officer's death. Fabrizio Natale told CNN Natale Hjorth did not know Elder was armed and only became aware of what actually happened after his arrest. He said he visited his son in an Italian detention facility on Wednesday morning, describing the encounter as \"very emotional\" and \"very hard.\"\"He's devastated by the Carabinieri's death. And I, for one, as a father painfully feel this family's grief,\" Natale said.'Put into a coma'The Chronicle reported Wednesday that back in 2016 Elder punched a fellow member of his high school football team at a night-time gathering of students. The San Francisco District Attorney's office would not comment on the case as it involved a minor and the juvenile records are sealed. The San Francisco Police did not immediately comment.Caleb Lagafua, who played on the football team with Elder at the time, told CNN that he was not present that night. But he remembered the fallout from the incident.\"I remember the kid he punched ... got put into a coma ... and then the parents were pressing charges. The kid didn't come back I think until the last few months of school,\" he said. Lagafua, who is now attending college in San Francisco, said Elder told him about the incident afterwards.Blindfolding US teen accused of killing officer 'unacceptable,' says prosecutor -- but interrogation is still valid\"I remember Finn tried to tell me the whole story. He told me that it wasn't his initial contact that put him in a coma. He said that after he punched him, he fell and he hit his head on the rock.\"Lagafua said he was friendly with Elder, but tried to keep his distance from his teammate. He remembers Elder getting into fights with teammates during football practice. \"It was over stupid stuff,\" Lagafua said.\"He was always running with like some bad kids and I didn't want to mess up my future being around that. But I do remember the fight because it happened over a weekend and I just remember I came back to school and everyone was talking about that Finn was in jail ... it was crazy cause I didn't think anything like that would happen at Sacred Heart. I just know that Finn had a lot of anger in him.\"An image of the knife  Elder is alleged to have brought from the US to Italy was displayed prior to a press conference in Rome on Tuesday.Immediately following the incident, the Chronicle published a news story, citing a San Francisco police spokeswoman, reporting that the victim was hospitalized with \"life-threatening injuries\" and that Elder turned himself in and was booked with juvenile authorities on suspicion of battery involving serious bodily injury.The Elder family had no immediate comment but family spokesman and Finnegan Elder's uncle Sean Elder told the Chronicle that the 2016 incident was part \"a mutual pre-agreed upon fight, which many football team members knew about and egged on.\"\"I've known Finn for his entire life and have never seen him be violent, or even lose his temper,\" Sean Elder told the Chronicle.  He added that Finnegan received no disciplinary action from the school. Forensic analysisSlain Italian police officer Mario Cerciello Rega with his wife on his wedding day.Italian investigators were carrying out forensic analysis on their hotel room on Wednesday, Italian police confirmed to CNN.Police images of their arrest show Elder with a partially missing middle finger. His mother Leah Elder told CNN Tuesday that her son fell off a ladder in an industrial accident a few years ago, leaving his left hand partially paralyzed and his finger amputated.\"He was hospitalized for days while they attempted reattachment surgery of the finger twice and then it didn't take and he had to have amputation surgery,\" she said.Arrest and court documents do not mention this physical detail.",

Afterward, he started chirping with the Pirates' bench.Things then got crazy.While Garrett was on the mound talking with coach Jeff Pickler, he sprinted toward the Pirates' dugout. Garrett threw a punch, taking on the entire Pittsburgh team himself.

Goodell and the officials should appear in court to give depositions in a civil suit over the \"no-call,\" Orleans Parish Civil District Court Judge Nicole Sheppard said Monday. Tony LeMon, a Louisiana attorney and Saints fan, filed the lawsuit over the game and is seeking monetary damages, which he says would be donated to charity. A state appeals court last week said LeMon's case could proceed, WVUE reported. All the ways New Orleans is rejecting the blown call that may have cost the Saints a spot in the Super BowlBarring an appeal from the NFL, the questioning would take place in September in New Orleans. CNN has reached out to the NFL for comment.Read MoreLate in the fourth quarter of the NFC title game between the Saints and the Los Angeles Rams in New Orleans, a Saints-led Drew Brees drive stalled with a controversial no-call from officials on an incomplete pass to Saints wide receiver Tommylee Lewis. The crowd wanted a flag for pass interference or helmet-to-helmet contact on a defenseless receiver by Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman. It wasn't thrown.The Rams went on to win in overtime. Since then, the rules have been changed to allow for instant replay of pass interference starting this season.Ahead of the Super Bowl in Atlanta, Goodell admitted publicly that the game officials -- as Saints fans would spell it -- \"bleaux\" the call but said it was not under consideration by him to overturn the game and have it replayed.\"Absolutely not,\" Goodell said at the time.After the loss, Saints head coach Sean Payton said he ate ice cream and watched Netflix for three days. Payton and Goodell spoke briefly during that dark period, the Saints coach said.While LeMon knows he can't overturn the game, he wants to hold the NFL accountable, he told WVUE.",

Interest in the case was renewed in summer last year, when the Orlandi family received an anonymous tip, hinting that Emanuela's remains may be located in the tombs of Princess Sophie von Hohenlohe and Princess Charlotte Federica of Mecklenburg at the Teutonic Cemetery. Thousands of bones were found in two ossauries discovered at the Teutonic Cemetery in Vatican City. The family had received an image of a sculpture and an instruction to \"look where the angel is pointing.\" This led them to the Teutonic Cemetery, which is located adjacent to the grand Saint Peter's Basilica and is typically reserved for the burials of German-speaking Catholics. Read MoreAfter the Vatican agreed for forensic investigators to open the tombs on July 11, no human remains nor traces of coffins were found. The Vatican indicated that the remains of the princesses may have been removed during renovation work on the cemetery and surrounding buildings in the 1960s and 70s. Nevertheless, two ossuaries -- chambers in which bones of the dead are stored -- were uncovered during their investigations beneath the floor of an area inside the Teutonic College.Investigators subsequently discovered \"thousands of bones\" in the chambers, which are believed to correspond to \"dozens of people,\" according to Giorgio Portera, a geneticist appointed by the Orlandi family. Pope John Paul II with Emanuela Oralndi (pink jumper, center), and (from right) her brother Pietro, father Ercole, and mother Maria.DNA analysis will now take place on each set of remains, but Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said the precise data will have to await \"morphological evaluations next Saturday.\"\"It must be considered that many of the bones being dated are shattered and therefore this increases the number present, many of which are small,\" Gisotti told CNN. \"This means that there may be more fragments of the same bone structure.\"While the origins of the bones remain unknown, Emanuela's brother, Pietro Orlandi, 60, said the investigation into the ossuaries had been \"a great satisfaction.\" \"In the ossuaries, there shouldn't be any recent bones, so if there are, even if it's not Emanuela Orlandi, it will be a problem for the Vatican,\" he told CNN. \"There are hundreds, thousands of bones and now the Vatican is classifying them by age and will investigate the more recent ones.Pietro Orlandi says that the investigation into the ossuaries has been a \"great satisfaction.\"\"To think if she was buried in the ossuary all these years, just 200 meters from our house, it would be devastating.\"He added that it is important for an independent expert to investigate the bones to ensure the objectivity of the results. \"The Vatican doesn't want this out and doesn't want to be seen in this way, but finally I feel like they have taken a step back and we have moved a step forward,\" he said. The Vatican responded in a statement, according to Reuters, saying that it is \"once again showing its openness towards the Orlandi family\" in agreeing for investigations to take place in the Teutonic Cemetery, even when only based on an \"anonymous report.\"",

        "content": "Stockholm, Sweden (CNN)American rapper A$AP Rocky pleaded not guilty to assault charges in a Swedish court on Tuesday, on the first day of a trial that has grabbed the attention of US President Donald Trump and the world's media.Known for his song \"Praise the Lord,\" the 30-year-old performer, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was detained almost a month ago following a street brawl in the capital Stockholm on June 30. If convicted, A$AP Rocky, who was charged with assault last week, could face up to two years in prison. On Tuesday morning, Swedish public prosecutor Daniel Suneson read out the charges against the artist and two other men in his entourage. Suneson said they assaulted the victim by kicking and beating him with a whole or part of a glass bottle while he lay on the ground.A$AP Rocky's trial starts Tuesday. Here's what we knowThe victim told the court he suffered injuries to his arm and head in the fight, as well as broken ribs. \"I felt that they would beat me to death,\" he said.A$AP Rocky's lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, maintains his client did not commit any crime. The rapper asserts that he was acting in self-defense when he threw the victim to the ground and stepped on his arm.Read More\"Please bear in mind that A$AP Rocky is an international, very well-known artist,\" Jovicic said, adding that his client is used to being approached in the street, but that these men were \"deeply provoking\" and that he acted out of fear.Both members of A$AP Rocky's crew, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers, also deny any wrongdoing.Magnus Stromberg, a lawyer for the victim, said his client is seeking 139,700 Swedish krona in damages (about $14,600).The Stockholm District Court was packed with international press and A$AP Rocky's family members, including his mother, Renee Black, who sat still, staring straight ahead as the charges were read out. President Trump has appealed for A$AP Rocky's release, and the US Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, Robert O'Brien, was in court on Tuesday to \"support the members of the family and the American citizens.\" O'Brien told CNN he wouldn't go into details about his conversations with the President about the case, but that Trump \"has made it very clear that he wants these individuals to come home as soon as possible.\"Some audience members were audibly sobbing and shaking their heads as Suneson showed evidence, including surveillance footage from the burger restaurant where the fight began.  In photos of the crime scene displayed to the court, a broken glass bottle was visible on the street where the brawl took place and a fragment of what appeared to be the same bottle could be seen stuck in A$AP Rocky's sweater.\"This is a nightmare!\" A$AP Rocky's mother Renee Black (second from left), told the press at the district court in Stockholm.The victim described being \"hit\" and \"stabbed\" with broken glass, but Suneson said police did not find any finger prints or DNA on the bottle.Playing a video clip of the exchange, Jovicic argued that the bottle was broken behind A$AP Rocky's back as he was \"occupied with throwing\" the victim to the ground. He claimed that glass shards from the bottle could have been caught underneath his client's shoe, which may have inadvertently cut the victim.Jovicic also referred to transcriptions from the footage, when A$AP Rocky could be heard appearing to try to cool tensions: \"Listen, listen. We don't wanna fight you all. We're not trying to go to jail.\"Justin Bieber: I appreciate Trump helping A$AP Rocky, but 'can you also let those kids out of cages?'Footage of the altercation posted by TMZ and clips shared by A$AP Rocky himself, which have been at the heart of the investigation, were also played in court.The prosecutor suggested that one of the videos shared by A$AP Rocky on Instagram had been edited to omit the moment when his security guard grabbed the victim by the neck and lifted him off the ground. He also shared text messages exchanged between different members of A$AP Rocky's team, who spoke about \"cleaning up\" and \"deleting\" the videos.But Jovicic argued the videos painted a different picture -- one of \"aggressive\" and \"threatening\" behavior by the victim, who he claimed attacked A$AP Rocky's bodyguard and refused to stop following his crew.\"It is in this context that Mayers fears that there will be another attack on the bodyguard\" and decides to throw the victim to the ground, Jovicic said.Asked by the judge whether A$AP Rocky had stepped on the victim's arm on purpose, Jovovic replied: \"It was intentional.\"Dave Rispers Sr., father of David Rispers, one of the accused, on the first day of the trial.As the prosecutor detailed the case against A$AP Rocky, the rapper's fans were gathered in a nearby room to watch the proceedings unfold on a big screen.\"I'm a big fan of A$AP Rocky,\" Marie-Thiella Hakizmana, one of those gathered at court, told CNN. \"I think he will be convicted -- there is quite a lot of evidence against him. It would be right to convict him, but he shouldn't get a very long sentence, since he was provoked.\" \"I mean, there are laws in Sweden, just because you are a celebrity doesn't mean you should get away,\" she added.That fact is something that Swedish authorities tried to impress upon Trump after he took an interest in A$AP Rocky's case, campaigning for the rapper's release.The US President previously said on Twitter that he had spoken with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven and \"offered to personally vouch for (A$AP Rocky's) bail, or an alternative.\" But Swedish law doesn't have a bail system and after Swedish authorities refused to release the musician, Trump tweeted: \"Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!\"Trump: Sweden has 'let our African American community down' in A$AP Rocky caseIn response, L\u00f6fven's spokesperson Mikael Lindstr\u00f6m said in a statement to CNN that \"all people in Sweden are equal before the law.\"\"The Government is not allowed, and will not attempt, to influence the legal proceedings, which are now ongoing,\" Lindstr\u00f6m said.Several high-profile celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, musical artists Post Malone and Shawn Mendes, and actress Jada Pinkett Smith have also thrown their support behind the rapper, petitioning for his release using the hashtag \"JusticeForRocky.\"The trial, at the Stockholm District Court, is scheduled to continue on Thursday and Friday. Under Swedish law, A$AP Rocky could face a maximum penalty of two years in prison. However, according to Swedish media, the prosecutors have indicated they do not expect to ask for the maximum penalty.CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Melissa Bell contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's been the case for quite some time that there are no longer 20 managers involved in the world's most popular football league, but rather millions -- more than six million during the 2018/19 season -- agonizing over a squad of 15 players with a mere budget of \u00a3100 million ($122m) .I know, right? \u00a3100 million! That's barely enough to buy a handful of average-to-good English Premier League players, let alone 15 of them. But that's the least of my issues. Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Fantasy Premier League.The moment I realized that my interest in this particular version of the (free to play) game -- which the English Premier League has officially sanctioned since a mere 18,000 played when it launched back in 2002 -- was tipping over from a hobby to obsession was when I asked a former top-flight winning manager -- no names but he has since bid adieu to English football -- how often he would be selecting a new signing, since this defender was such good value in the game (\u00a35 million if I recall. And believe me -- I recall).A raised eyebrow and the merest hint of a smile was the closest I got to a response. Let's just say that said defender was not a regular.If you think I feel guilty about putting the legendary manager on the spot, think again: apparently Prince Abdullah bin Mosaad of Saudi Arabia, once telephoned George Gillett, when the American was the co-owner of Liverpool, to find out if Steven Gerrard was going to play, such was his level of interest.Read MoreHis squad should make for interesting reading this season, considering the Prince is currently the co-owner of newly promoted Sheffield United.Kevin de Bruyne at \u00a39.5 million ($11.55 million), is the bargain of the season ... in Fantasy Premier League.READ: Man Utd to play Chelsea on opening Premier League weekendDouble points at stake!But whether you are a Prince or a pauper who plays, the eternal question for millions of us is whether to go for a 3-4-3 or the traditional 4-4-2 formation.By the way, I'll defend my love of the 3-4-3 until my final team selection in the 2099/2100 season when a still sprightly Cristiano Ronaldo returns to Manchester United and continues to score goals and assists for fun.Then there's the captaincy dilemma -- double points at stake! -- to say nothing of those infernal \"chips\" (such as being able to play all your substitutes in one game week) and how best to make the most of a wildcard, where you can transfer out as many of your squad and not take a four-point hit for every outgoing player, outside of the one free transfer you can make each week (two freebies if you can maintain your discipline and roll the transfer over to another week -- as if anyone with a pulse can do that).And if you thought an encyclopedic knowledge of the players would help, well, you need help.I've played in mini-leagues against opponents who are self-confessed newbies, and barely have a passing interest in the game (real or fantasy) and have selected Liverpool's Mohamed Salah or Tottenham's Harry Kane as captain in week one and -- ahem -- NOT CHANGED THE CAPTAINCY FOR THE REST OF THE SEASON, EVEN IF THE PLAYER GOT INJURED!!! and they have still managed to comfortably beat me for many of the 38 game weeks.I'm a lifelong football fan, been covering the sport professionally for the best part of 20 years, spend hours a week on my team selection, and I'm now expecting to score fewer points than any Johnny or Joanna come lately.Second guessing Pep Guardiola's team selections is tough for any Fantasy Premier League boss.READ: Manchester City's rivals are 'jealous,' says chairman'Pep's roulette'But it's the real managers -- those 20 hapless souls who are never seemingly more than three consecutive defeats away from losing their actual job -- that are the people who truly infuriate.Take Pep Guardiola. He might be in contention for being the world's best manager but any regular FPL player will be well accustomed to \"Pep Roulette.\"This refers to the Manchester City boss having a propensity for chopping and changing his real line-up with such regularity, that none of his world class players -- apart from arguably goalkeeper Ederson (\u00a36 million if I recall. And believe me -- oh never mind) -- is a surefire selection in his side.There have been plenty of occasions in which Guardiola's lethal striker Sergio Aguero (\u00a312m) has made my weekend. Indeed, the five goals the Argentine once scored in the span of 20 minutes against Newcastle in 2015 on a game week I captained him (50 points!) is up there with the elation I experienced with the birth of my children.Wait, who am I kidding, that's taking it a tad too far ... I had nine months to prepare for the arrival of the kids -- you only get a week to make the crucial captaincy call.Manchester City's Argentinian striker Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring his team's third goal during the English Premier League football against Chelsea in February.But even the awesome Aguero is subject to being dropped by the heartless Guardiola, who may or may not have any idea how he's not only ruining his actual player's day, but the weekend of us millions of managers around the world.That said, I stand by the well-worn mantra, \"if the question is Fantasy Premier League, the answer is Aguero.\"I'm serious: Aguero once scored a hat-trick against the team I actually support ... and I was happy about it -- we were on the verge of getting relegated anyway.Nowadays, in the social media dominated landscape of 2019, players have been known to comment on their performances from an FPL standpoint, though I still think it will be tough to top the then West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster \"dropping\" Manchester United's Robin van Persie from his team during the 2012/13 campaign.Foster was set to face the Dutch striker, and the prospect of the WBA keeper accruing points for his FPL team by conceding goal/s to RVP, would have been a conflict of interest surely too much to comprehend.And ever the realist, the recently retired striker Peter Crouch once took the painful decision to leave himself out from his team, because he wasn't performing on the pitch for Stoke City. Guess what? His replacements outperformed him.So as Liverpool great Gerrard once said: \"We go again.\"The 2019/20 season is nearly upon us and I'm almost certain this is the year my squad comes out on top.When looking for an omen, I've settled on my near namesake, and no relation, the New Zealander Adam Levy, beating out the more than 6.3 million managers last season to win the game.I have committed to memory the game's Scout recommendations, even if every single player seems worthy of consideration.I have the perfect blend of \"premium\" and \"budget\" players. I promise not to tinker with my selection (too much). And I retain an unwavering faith in Aguero. But if you happen to see Guardiola this week, would you mind asking for a friend whether he's planning to play him?",

        "content": "(CNN)In January 2019, Nico Yennaris gave back his British passport, moved to Beijing and became a naturalized Chinese citizen. Aged 26, he adopted a new name.From now on, he would be called Li Ke.  Growing up in east London, Yennaris had perhaps the most British of boyhood dreams: he wanted to become a famous soccer star. Born in David Beckham's stomping ground of Leytonstone to a Cypriot father and a Chinese mother, Yennaris got off to a good start.Aged 7, he joined the Arsenal FC Youth Academy, a production line for Premier League talent, and went on to play for the England national side at youth level. But after a series of injuries cost him a prestigious scholarship, relegating him to the lower league dressing rooms, Yennaris opted for another route to stardom. He looked to China.  Read MoreEarlier this year, Yennaris signed with Beijing Sinobo Guoan FC, a club that is now worth more than Italy's AC Milan. Within months, he became the first naturalized player to score in the Chinese Super League (CSL) and to play for China's national side, in a game against the Philippines.  China's Nico Yennaris (left), known as Li Ke in Chinese, plays in  friendly match in Guangzhou, in China's southern Guangdong province on June 11, 2019.  Yennaris is not alone. In January, John Hou Saeter, who also has a Chinese mother, renounced his Norwegian passport to become Chinese and join Beijing Guoan. And they could soon be joined by other foreign-born players who can't even claim partial Chinese ancestry. Two Brazilians and one Portuguese transfers are tipped to join the Chinese national squad in time for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Players who are not ethnically Chinese can play for the Chinese side under FIFA eligibility rules after five years of residency in that country.Their decision says as much about the rising power of a Chinese passport as it does about the nation's monied sporting landscape. Perhaps more importantly, though, for a country in the grip of a Han nationalist movement, it also raises important questions around identity.\"China has such a black and white definition of what's Chinese and what is not,\" says Cameron Wilson, a Chinese football writer in Shanghai. \"This actually challenges the notion of what being Chinese is in a very public way.\"The first Swedish footballer in ChinaWhen Swedish midfielder Pelle Blohm arrived in northeast China to play for Dalian Wanda (now Shide) in 1995, the city was gripped by sub-freezing temperatures. \"The Siberian wind was coming in from the bay. It was a winter but without snow,\" remembers Blohm. \"It was not pleasant.\"       In the 1990s, the Swedish game was full of part-time professionals, the pay was bad and Blohm says he was yearning for adventure. Professional football was only in its third year in China when Blohm began playing in the Jia-A season -- China's equivalent of the Premier League, which became the CSL in 2004 -- but Blohm says the stadiums often attracted 35,000 fans, although that was short of their 55,000 capacity.The level of professionalism, however, was lacking.\"The players were smoking and drinking a lot ... the football field was quite bad and there was never a dressing room. We had to get ready in the hotel,\" says Blohm, who was immediately asked to cut his long hair short, to conform with the league's strict appearance code. The Swede politely refused.The club didn't employ an interpreter for two months, and before then \"nobody spoke in English or any other language except Chinese, as I can remember,\" he adds. Blohm, who was the first Swedish professional soccer star to play in China, was paid in US dollar bills, but for months couldn't find a bank account that would even take his foreign currency.Pelle Blohm with the Dalian team in 1996.Dalian at the time was a city of 5 million people, with scant Western influence -- no cafes, international brand-name shops or hamburgers, Blohm says. And few foreigners.In the mid-1990s, most Chinese hadn't been abroad. And those who did travel went on group tours run by government-approved operators. Often, travelers had to wait around six months for a passport, says Wolfgang Georg Arlt, who ran a Beijing-based company organizing Chinese tours to Germany throughout the 1990s.\"And at that time it was not really passport, it was a piece of cardboard called an exit visa,\" he says. Couples were not often allowed to travel together -- \"it was either the husband or the wife who could travel. The other was staying behind as a hostage,\" Arlt adds. Rattled by the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991, China was worried that once holidaymakers saw what was beyond their border, they wouldn't want to come home, he says.      \"When I was in China, people were not even allowed to talk to a foreigner,\" Arlt says. \"If I asked someone, 'Where is the railway station?' he would have to go and report that.\" After one year -- which Blohm nostalgically calls the \"the most important year in my life\" -- the Swede left China. \"Mentally, I was really tired,\" he says.Certainly, the idea that Blohm would trade his Swedish passport for a Chinese one was out of the question. A point of national prideBy the summer of 2008, Beijing was dropping an astonishing $40 billion on the most expensive Olympic Games ever held. Its athletes won 51 gold medals at the Games, the most of any nation in the competition. And China was now the world's third-largest economy, behind Japan and the United States.   The message being sent to the world was clear: with a soaring economy and growing political and cultural clout, China itself was now in the super league. But none of that changed the fact it still struggled at soccer. China hasn't been back to the World Cup since its 2002 tournament debut. And by July 2009 its team ranked 108th worldwide, according to FIFA. Furthermore, match-fixing and corruption were considered so rife that an ethics committee was founded to clean up the game. As vice president in 2011, Chinese President Xi Jinping made getting better at the beautiful game a national goal. As a child, Xi had played football at school. Now he wanted the entire nation to fall in love with the sport.Xi Jinping, then the Chinese vice-president, kicks a  football in Dublin, in February 2012.Businessmen including Alibaba's Jack Ma were encouraged to invest billions in the CSL, the all-male, 16-side championship. Wang Jianlin's Dalian Wanda Group (DWG) has also poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the sport. Soccer academies and pitches were planned across the sprawling nation, and an ambitious scheme to hire thousands of foreign coaches offered everyone from professions to gap-year students financial incentives to teach young Chinese how to score.As the cash came, so did the foreign talent -- albeit, mostly fading stars or youngsters with no chance at the big time in their native leagues.In 2012, former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba signed with Shanghai Shenhua -- while this year, Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini moved to Shandong Luneng. Transfer fees are never announced officially, but Fellaini is rumored to have been bought for about $13 million. That number was eclipsed by reports this week that Welsh star Gareth Bale was leaving Real Madrid for a three-year deal with Chinese club Jiangsu Suning that would see him earn $1.2 million a week, before the Spanish side blocked the deal. Foreign players are not subject to the 10 million RMB ($1.45 million) salary cap that was recently imposed on domestic players, to prevent clubs from running up huge debts.Homegrown talentFor Xi, however, the goal was not to attract foreign stars. It was to make Chinese ones.  As a result, CSL sides are only permitted to register four foreign players -- and can only pay three at once -- as well as one from a Chinese territory, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macao. All CSL teams have maxed out that quota.  \"That's basically to ensure that Chinese players can get playing time,\" said Wilson, the expert on Chinese football. Some sides have used the Chinese territory rule to get more non-Chinese players on their books. Nigeria-born Alex Akande, for example, lived in Hong Kong long enough to naturalize there and now plays for Dalian as its one allotted player from the semi-autonomous Chinese city.       Foreign goalkeepers, however, have been outright banned from the league since 2001. And in 2017, clubs were hit with a 100% tax, also designed to stem capital flight, on players who cost more than 45 million RMB ($7 million), that levy going into a grassroots development fund for Chinese talent. But Wilson says that the millions of dollars in investment hasn't been able to make up for one crucial factor: China doesn't have a football culture.\"I think they're just not into football,\" he says. \"Nobody will tell you that. For a long time, even I was that person who was an advocate, saying: 'Yeah there's a lot of potential here, it's a sleeping giant and it's a massive goldmine waiting to be discovered.'\" Not a single Super League match sold out in this 2019 season, with stadium capacity averaging at 51% full. Most of the CSL teams make a loss. Manchester United, on the other hand, reported record revenues of \u00a3590 million ($730 million) for the year ending June 2018.      \"The football culture we have in the UK is so profound and deep that it would take a long time for any country that doesn't have that to generate it,\" says Wilson, who is from Scotland.  Kids in China simply don't grow up kicking balls around their block dreaming of bending it like Beckham.Chinese for the long game?If China lacks football culture, it's been shooting to win in soft power and economic might.In a promotional video posted by his club, Yennaris says he has \"never questioned\" his  decision to leave British football, and -- in sharp contrast to Blohm's experience of Dalian in the 1990s -- describes Beijing as being very \"similar to big cities like London, Paris and New York.\"  \"Ten years ago, it was absolutely unthinkable that someone would choose a Chinese passport over a British passport,\" says Philippe May, managing director of Arton Capital Singapore, which compiles the annual Passport Index.Chinese nationality back then, May adds, would have severely limited a person's freedom of movement, but the Chinese passport has gone from strength to strength over the past decade. I don't think that these football players plan to spend the rest of their life in ChinaWolfgang Georg Arlt, sinologist Arlt, the German tour operator, who is now a professor in sinology specializing in Chinese tourism, is skeptical. He believes that athletes becoming Chinese are banking on reversing that decision after having lucrative careers that were out of reach in their home nations, either because the market there was too competitive  or simply not rich enough. \"I don't think that these football players plan to spend the rest of their life in China,\" he says. \"If you earn $25 million playing football for three years in China, then maybe you'll be happy to say goodbye to a million to get a Canadian or Portuguese passport,\" he adds. Colin Bloomfield, of Hong Kong-based immigration consultancy British Connections, says that reclaiming a British passport is possible, but applicants need to \"provide a good reason why they wish to reapply\" -- and there is \"no guarantee the UK will accept.\" On Weibo, the popular Chinese social media app, netizens have generally responded positively to the decision of Yennaris and Hou to naturalize, because of their Chinese roots. But the idea of Elkeson de Oliveira Cardoso, the Brazilian attacking midfielder simply known as Elkeson, becoming Chinese through residency, rather than having Chinese blood, is a more complicated issue.   Naturalized Chinese football player John Hou S\u00e6ter, of China's Beijing Sinobo Guoan.  In March, the Chinese Football Association decreed that all foreign players must be educated on Communist Party values, with clubs filing a written report on their performance each month.  CNN has reached out to China's General Administration of Sport for comment, but had not heard back at the time of publishing. For Yennaris, who is learning Mandarin and has memorized the national anthem, becoming Chinese has enabled him to realize that childhood dream of being a famous soccer star -- just in a different country. The London-born midfielder looks set to make it onto China's 2022 Qatar national squad, to be selected by the country's Italian coach, Marcello Lippi, who won the World Cup for his home nation in 2006.  Yennaris says it's his dream to help China get to the World Cup. But it's a tall order -- of the 32 teams in the competition, there are only four spots for sides from Asia.  But Yennaris says he has no regrets.\"In 20 years' time, I'll be able to tell my kids where I've come from and what I've done,\" he says.Whether he is Nico Yennaris or Li Ke when that conversation occurs remains to be seen.Additional reporting by CNN's Jordan Ashmore in Hong Kong and Serenitie Wang in Beijing.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Vatican has said human remains discovered during an excavation earlier in July do not belong to missing teenager Emanuela Orlandi, again dashing hopes that the decades-long mystery of her disappearance would finally be solved. An anonymous tip given to Orlandi's family led to the Vatican opening an investigation in the Teutonic cemetery to determine whether the daughter of a Vatican clerk, who mysteriously vanished when she was 15, was buried there. An analysis of \"several hundred partially intact bone structures\" and \"thousands of fragments\" uncovered in the search was conducted on July 27, monitored by an expert appointed by the Orlandi family. But the findings showed that \"none of the remains could be dated later than the end of the 19th century,\" according to Vatican News. It marks another turn in the saga that began when Orlandi, who lived with her family within the walls of the holy city, disappeared in the summer of 1983 while on her way home from a music lesson in central Rome.The Teutonic Cemetery in the courtyard of Collegio Teutonico, where the bones were discovered.The mystery surrounding Orlandi's disappearance has gripped Italians for more than three decades, inspiring conspiracy theories involving everyone from mobsters to international terrorists, as well as the highest echelons of the Vatican.Read MoreThe Holy See confirmed that the investigation of the cemetery had now come to an end, stressing its \"desire to seek the truth about the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi\" and denying that the \"Holy See's attitude of full cooperation and transparency can in any way signify an implicit admission of responsibility.\"Vatican News reported that further laboratory testing will be done on 70 bone fragments, upon the request of an advocate for the Orlandi family.The search was prompted after the Orlandi family received an anonymous tip last summer, which hinted that Emanuela's remains may be located in the tombs of Princess Sophie von Hohenlohe and Princess Charlotte Federica of Mecklenburg at the Teutonic Cemetery.The family had received an image of a sculpture and an instruction to \"look where the angel is pointing.\" This led them to the Teutonic Cemetery, which is located adjacent to Saint Peter's Basilica and is typically reserved for the burials of German-speaking Catholics.Pope John Paul II with Emanuela Orlandi (pink jumper, center), and right her mother Maria, father Ercole, brother Pietro.After the Vatican agreed for forensic investigators to open the tombs on July 11, no human remains nor traces of coffins were found. The Vatican indicated that the remains of the princesses may have been removed during renovation work on the cemetery and surrounding buildings in the 1960s and 70s.Nevertheless, two ossuaries -- chambers in which bones of the dead are stored -- were uncovered during their investigations beneath the floor of an area inside the Teutonic College.Investigators subsequently discovered \"thousands of bones\" in the chambers, which are believed to correspond to \"dozens of people,\" according to Giorgio Portera, a geneticist appointed by the Orlandi family.CNN's Valentina DiDonato and Matthew Robinson contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)A fight for the moral high ground is publicly playing out over the US Women's National Team's gender discrimination lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation.While both sides have agreed to mediation, US Soccer is now posting numbers saying the back-to-back FIFA Women's World Cup champions actually earn more than the US Men's National Team.It's a claim the women say is \"utterly false.\" The women also received the backing of the men's team, which issued a statement saying they support the women \"in their pursuit of fair compensation for their work as professional soccer players.\"On Monday, US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro released an open letter on Twitter, saying that from 2010 through 2018 the federation paid $34.1 million in salary and game bonuses to the women, compared to $26.4 million for the men.Those figures do not include benefits, such as healthcare, that the women receive. Included in the federation's numbers is that US Soccer pays WNT contracted players a salary to play in the National Women's Soccer League, while the men are paid by their individual teams.Read MoreThe women's and men's compensation structures are different, as those each were collectively bargained.And the fact sheet...

This is why they use words like 'fair and equitable,' not equal in describing pay.\"The numbers USSF uses are utterly false and, among other things, inappropriately include the NWSL salaries of the players to inflate the women's players compensation. Any apples to apples comparison shows that the men earn far more than the women.\"In the most recent CBA negotiation, USSF proposed a compensation structure that is exactly the same as the MNT's compensation structure but with less compensation across the board. In every instance, win or draw for a friendly or competitive match, the women players were offered less compensation. Equal Pay was never on the table for the women regardless of structure.\"The USSF fact sheet is not a 'clarification.' It is a ruse.\"Here is what they cannot deny. For every game a man plays on the MNT he makes a higher base salary payment than a woman on the WNT. For every comparable win or tie, his bonus is higher.\"That is the very definition of gender discrimination. For the USSF to believe otherwise, is disheartening but it only increases our determination to obtain true equal pay. If the USSF cannot agree to this at the upcoming mediation, we will see them in the court of law and the court of public opinion.\"The US Men's National Team said they too \"were not impressed\" by Cordeiro's letter. \"The women's national team players deserve equal pay and are right to pursue a legal remedy from the courts or Congress,\" the men's team said.Rose Lavelle of the USWNT celebrates with Emily Sonnett after winning Women's World Cup final.Victory tourIn March, members of the USWNT filed a federal class-action lawsuit against US Soccer, citing gender discrimination.The suit alleges that the federation discriminates by paying the women less than members of the men's national team \"for substantially equal work and by denying them at least equal playing, training, and travel conditions; equal promotion of their games; equal support and development for their games; and other terms and conditions of employment equal to the MNT.\"Overall, the American women have had much more success on the pitch than their male counterparts, winning four World Cups and four Olympic gold medals.During that time frame US Soccer provided in Monday's letter, the women have won two World Cups, in 2015 and earlier this month, while the men missed the 2018 World Cup, having failed to qualify.The USWNT begins its World Cup victory tour on Saturday with a match against Ireland at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.",

        "content": "Rome, Italy  (CNN)Blindfolding one of the two American teenagers accused of murdering an Italian police officer was \"grave and unacceptable,\" Rome's chief prosecutor said Tuesday, but he insisted that the suspect's interrogation was still valid.Gabriel Natale Hjorth,18, was pictured blindfolded, with his arms behind his back in a photograph leaked to Italian media over the weekend.The image raised questions over the conduct of his interrogation at the hands of police, but Italian prosecutor Michele Prestipino told a news conference Tuesday that Hjorth was not blindfolded while he was being questioned. Prestipino insisted that Natale and fellow murder suspect Finnegan Lee Elder, 19, \"were interrogated by the magistrates in conformity with the law.\"Hjorth's lawyer, Emiliano Sisini, had earlier told CNN that he did not know how long his client was blindfolded for, but said the incident took place before his interrogation. Read MoreItalian police officer Mario Cerciello Rega was killed in an altercation after a botched drug deal in Rome. Carabinieri police officer Mario Cerciello Rega was stabbed to death Friday in a case that has gripped Italy.Rega was attacked while attempting to recover a backpack allegedly stolen by Elder and Hjorth following a botched drug deal, police say. Police allege that both Americans confessed to taking part in the assault, and say Elder confessed to murder in the interrogation on Friday. Seven inch knife New details of Rega's murder were revealed during the wide-ranging press conference held by Prestipino, Rome prosecutor Nunzia D'Elia, and Gen. Francesco Gargaro, of the Provincial Carabinieri Command.An image of the seven-inch knife police believe was used to kill Rega was shown to reporters. The weapon was found stashed in a ceiling panel in the hotel room both suspects were staying in, police said.  Gargaro told CNN on Monday that the knife was brought to Italy from the United States by Elder.Police say the knife used to kill Carabinieri officer Rega was found in the suspect's hotel room.Elder recognized the knife police say is the murder weapon \"as his own,\" according to court documents seen by CNN. On Tuesday, prosecutor Nunzia D'Eli said both suspects had lawyers and an interpreter with them to make sure they could properly express themselves during their interrogations.The teens were \"in shock,\" and under the influence of alcohol, but they were otherwise in good condition, she said.Their interrogations lasted a long time and the suspects were allowed to give their side of the story, rather than simply having to answer yes or no questions, D'Elia said.\"They were lucid in their answers, giving us detailed accounts,\" she said.\"At the beginning, the suspects were having a hard time understanding the gravity of the situation. So much that one (Hjorth) asked: is he really dead?\" she said.No weapon on slain officerThe incident unfolded Friday after the two US citizens approached a man about buying drugs, according to police. After being sold crushed aspirin instead of cocaine, officers allege that the Americans stole a backpack from the man. The teenagers subsequently answered the owner's cellphone, which they had also taken, and told him \"they would not return the backpack without 100 euros ($111) and 1 gram of cocaine,\" police said.The owner of the stolen bag then contacted the police and two unarmed plainclothes officers -- Rega and his partner Andrea Varriale -- met the American suspects under the guise of retrieving it, police said.Slain police officer Mario Cerciello Rega and his wife on their wedding day, less than six weeks ago.Both Americans are accused of assaulting the policemen, who reportedly identified themselves as law enforcement officers during the meeting early on Friday morning. Elder is further accused of stabbing Rega 11 times before fleeing the scene, Gargaro told CNN Monday. The two Americans were arrested Friday evening inside their hotel room, close to the scene of the stabbing. They are accused of aggravated murder and attempted extortion, police said. During Tuesday's press conference, Gargaro said the slain officer was not carrying his weapon when he was stabbed. \"Only he [Rega] knows why he didn't have the weapon with him. It could have been forgetfulness. But that doesn't change the fact that he would not have been able to use it,\" Gargaro said.  He added that Rega, who had recently returned from his honeymoon, was hit in the abdomen area and it \"was impossible for him to react,\" Gargaro said.\"Some of the stab wounds went right through his body; his stomach, his spine and so on,\" Gargaro told the press conference. In these photographs released by the Italian Carabinieri, Gabriel Christian Natale Hjorth, right, and Finnegan Lee Elder, sit in their hotel room in Rome.According to court documents, Elder and Hjorth have turned on each other and are accusing each other \"reciprocally.\" Their stories are \"absolutely in contrast\" with one another, the documents said. The court documents suggest that Elder had not understood that the two men who approached them were police officers.Elder's appointed public prosecutor, Francesco Codini, said during his court appearance Saturday that his client \"maintained his right to remain silent\" in front of a judge.Elder's family said in a statement on Monday that the US consul in Rome had been allowed to visit Elder briefly. \"We continue to gather facts about his case through his legal representatives.

His funeral was attended by hundreds of mourners.Tuesday's press conference came a day after hundreds of mourners gathered to pay tribute to Rega at his funeral in his hometown of Somma Vesuviana, near Naples.

According to OVD-Info, an independent site that monitors arrests, 1,373 people were detained in connection with Saturday's unsanctioned protests, which came a week after a legal demonstration in support of free and fair elections drew over 20,000 people, according to White Counter, a group that monitors attendance figures at protests. The question, now, is whether protests in Moscow will build more national momentum -- and how the Kremlin will respond if they do.Members of the Russian National Guard detain a protester during an unauthorised rally in downtown Moscow on July 27, 2019.The protests were spurred by local politics: A move by local election authorities to keep independent and opposition candidates off the ballot in September's elections. But demonstrations have become a barometer of discontent with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as a gauge of the Russian government's willingness to crack down on dissent.Unlike in the much larger marches in Hong Kong, authorities in Moscow have not deployed tear gas or fired rubber bullets. But eyewitnesses to Saturday's protest, including CNN reporters, saw well-equipped riot police cordon off the crowds, with squads of helmeted officers surging into the crowd to detain and disperse protesters, truncheons at the ready.Read MoreAuthorities signaled in advance that protests would be dealt with severely. In advance of Saturday's rally, police warned Muscovites to stay away, saying their security would not be guaranteed if they chose to take part in an unsanctioned march to the Moscow mayor's office. More than 1,000 people were detained during election protests in Moscow at the weekend.Police also made a pre-emptive effort to thwart the organizers. In the days running up to Saturday's protest, authorities rounded up a number of prominent opposition figures. Among those detained was top opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who was arrested as he went out for a morning jog and to buy flowers for his wife's birthday. JUST WATCHEDNavalny: Putin's regime is built on corruption (2018) ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNavalny: Putin's regime is built on corruption (2018)  03:23The day after the rally, attention shifted to Navalny himself, after the opposition leader was hospitalized for an \"acute allergic reaction.\" Later on Sunday, Navalny's spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, quoted a Facebook post by Navalny's personal physician who was able to observe him at the hospital where he was taken from a Moscow detention center. \"We cannot rule out toxic damage to the skin and mucous membranes by an unknown chemical substance with the help of a certain 'third person,'\" the post read, adding that visiting doctors had not been given full access to Navalny. Doctors were able to examine him Monday.On Monday, Yarmysh said authorities had ordered the Kremlin critic back to jail. While his condition apparently had improved, Navalny's sudden illness prompted worried speculation. The opposition leader has been physically attacked before, and was partially blinded in one eye in 2017 when he was splashed with an antiseptic green dye.While the cause of Navalny's illness is still unknown -- a physician who examined him said no toxicology report was available -- one thing is clear: Russian opposition figures continue to face physical threats, intimidation and violence.  Vladimir Putin is not invincible In 2014, members of the punk performance-art group Pussy Riot were beaten by security officials in the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi. One year later, Boris Nemtsov, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, was gunned down on a bridge near Red Square. And poisonings are not unheard of: Anna Politkovskaya, a renowned investigative journalist, claimed to have been poisoned in 2004. She was later assassinated in 2006, on Putin's birthday. At Saturday's march, one of the slogans marchers chanted was, \"Russia will be free.\" But the Kremlin, up to this point, has been officially silent on the weekend's events. On the day of the protest, state news was covering a classic Putin photo opportunity: The president descending to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland in a bathyscaphe to observe a submarine that sank during World War II. These manly adventures have been a cornerstone of Putin's popular appeal. But it remains to be seen if the president's bare-chested patriotism will be enough to appease those Russians who are willing to take to the streets.",

In 2017 Navalny was attacked with an antiseptic green dye that damaged vision in one of his eyes.  Russia's most outspoken opposition figure was detained by police Wednesday following a sweep of opposition candidates in the days leading up to anti-government demonstrations in the capital on Saturday.

Navalny had called for demonstrations over the weekend after the disqualification of opposition candidates for Russian municipal elections.On Sunday, a spokesperson for Navalny said on Twitter he was experiencing \"severe swelling of the face and redness of the skin,\" adding that the cause of the reaction had not been determined but that Navalny had never experienced an allergic reaction before.The spokesperson confirmed that he is being given all necessary medical assistance and is still under the protection of police officers.\u00a0Hundreds of protesters were detained at an opposition election demonstration in Moscow on Saturday.\n'Country's future at stake'More than 1,000 protesters were detained Saturday by police in the center of Moscow, in a crackdown on opposition supporters demanding free and fair elections.The local branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said at least 1,074 people were detained, while OVD-Info, an independent monitoring group, put the number at 1,127. Thousands of Russians pledged to attend the protest in the capital Saturday, after Russian authorities banned a number of independent and opposition candidates from taking part in municipal elections in September. Authorities stated that the candidates were barred from running because they had failed to obtain a sufficient number of signatures to be put on the ballot paper. Opposition politicians and supporters have rejected this allegation.   The decision has sparked a number of protests across Russia this month, including the largest demonstration in recent years last weekend, when 22,000 people took to the streets. Dmitry Gudkov, another disqualified candidate, was also detained hours before Saturday's protest. He had previously claimed that the country's future was at stake due to the barring of opposition candidates.  \"If we lose now, elections will cease to exist as a political instrument,\" he said. \"What we're talking about is whether it's legal to participate in politics today in Russia, we're talking about the country we're going to live in.\" Ilya Yashin, an ally of Navalny, reported on Facebook that he had also been detained hours before the demonstration following a raid on his house, and had been taken out of the Russian capital. Other prominent activists to be detained include Kira Yarmysh, Navalyny's spokeswoman, Lyubov Sobo and Ivan Zhdanov.",

Period.\"However, Bale's agent, Jonathan Barnett, told French publication Le Journal du Dimanche that their falling out is personal, rather than professional or tactical.\"It's quite simple, Zidane doesn't like Gareth,\" he said. \"There is no relationship between them, there never has been.\"Read MoreGareth Bale and Zinedine Zidane have \"no relationship,\" according to the player's agent.READ: Real Madrid hit for seven by AtleticoREAD: From dream start to nightmare end, Gareth Bale's Real Madrid career turns sourZidane is desperate to offload Bale and his $16 million per year salary to make room for one more signing in his squad revamp, rumored to be Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.But Real president Florentino Perez, who has often come to Bale's defense during his time at the club, reportedly vetoed his imminent transfer to Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning.Madrid-based paper Diario AS report that the club now has concerns about squad depth following the long-term injury to Marco Asensio. \"Signing a player with his characteristics would cost 150 million euros -- if there was a player like Bale currently on the market,\" they write.The nominal transfer fee to be paid by Jiangsu Suning reportedly led to Perez canceling the move with just 72 hours of the Chinese transfer window remaining.It has been widely reported that Bale had already agreed a contract with the club worth an eye-watering $1.25 million per week, around double his current weekly wage.The club instead signed Croatian forward Ivan Santini, meaning it has reached the four foreign player limit that CSL rules allow.Florentino Perez reportedly vetoed Bale's transfer to China.Bale and his partner are happy living on the outskirts of Madrid and Spanish sport newspaper Marca report that they are unwilling to move their young family abroad.Real did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment about Bale's immediate future.Pre-season woesIt's not just Bale's future that has been a concern for the club's fans -- Real Madrid's pre-season form has been underwhelming, to put it kindly.Zidane dropped Bale from the squad for the 3-1 defeat by Bayern Munich, before bringing him off the bench against Arsenal to score and help mount a comeback.Despite Bale's performance, the Frenchman insisted that \"nothing had changed\" and both parties were still negotiating his exit from the club.Gareth Bale came off the bench during Real's 7-3 humiliation at the hands of Atletico Madrid.But Perez's decision to keep Bale came soon after the 7-3 humiliation at the hands of city rival Atletico Madrid.Once again, Zidane opted to leave Bale out of the starting line-up and again brought him on with 30 minutes remaining -- by which time Real found itself 6-1 down.The 30-year-old still has three years left on his current contract but a frustrating succession of injuries has limited his playing time over the past four seasons.However, despite the stop-start nature to his Real career, Bale has proved himself to be invaluable to Real on the biggest of stages.He has scored three goals -- and one penalty in a shootout -- in four victorious Champions League finals, netting two winners and arguably the greatest final goal in the competition's history against Liverpool in 2018.Gareth Bale's stunning overhead kick against Liverpool turned the 2018 Champions League final in Real's favor.Bale played 42 times last season but ended it on the bench as Real endured one of the worst seasons in its recent history, finishing 19 points behind La Liga winner Barcelona.During his six years at the club, he has collected 14 major trophies and his 102 goals and 65 assists in 231 matches -- 0.72 goals or assists every game -- is undeniably impressive.With just three days left to complete a switch to China and a manager that doesn't want him, Bale's Real limbo could continue for another season.",

        "content": "Bialystok, Poland  (CNN)Drag queens strut, rainbow flags flutter in the breeze, and smiling marchers form heart symbols with their hands.From certain angles, the pride parade looks just like other such events held around the world, from San Francisco to Berlin, London to Taipei.But behind the glitter and glamor, there is a darker side to this celebration: Cher's \"Believe\" blasting from the sound system isn't simply music to dance to; it is there to drown out the boos, the bangs of flash-bombs and the chants of \"perverts!\"Because this is no ordinary pride gathering: It is the first-ever equality march in the deeply conservative Polish city of Bialystok, where the LGBTQ community's increasing visibility has sparked a backlash.The northeastern city of 298,000 is located in the Bible-belt region of Podlasie, which is a stronghold of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) and has become synonymous with far-right movements. \"Many of the acts of xenophobic aggression have been committed in Podlasie compared to other regions in Poland,\" Rafal Pankowski, from the anti-extremism group Never Again, told CNN.Read MoreThe mayor of Bialystok, Tadeusz Truskolaski, an independent, is eager to change that reputation.Unlike some centrist and right-wing counterparts in Poland, who have attempted to ban pride marches from their cities -- Truskolaski let the Bialystock event proceed -- despite widespread criticism from officials in the PiS. Football \"ultras,\" far-right organizations and others took part in counter-protests across Bialystock.According to one 2017 study by Poland's Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS), more than half of Poles (55%) think homosexuality is abnormal but should be tolerated. Around a quarter (24%) believe it should not be tolerated at all.  As the country gears up for an election this fall, the right-wing PiS is targeting what it calls \"LGBT ideology\" to fire up its conservative base. This hostile rhetoric has emboldened far-right elements in the country. The ruling party's socially conservative message has also helped it in the national polls -- it crushed a coalition of opposition parties in May's European Parliament elections, winning 46% of the votes. Experts predict another victory in October's elections and LGBTQ activists are bracing for the worst. Poland's opposition is divided on whether to address the increased marginalization of the country's LGBTQ community, or to cater to socially conservative voters.In February, Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from the opposition Civic Platform (PO), signed a declaration in support of LGBTQ rights. But just months before, his PO colleague Krzysztof Zuk, mayor of Lublin, banned that city's first pride march, citing security concerns. The march went ahead after Lublin's Court of Appeals overturned the mayor's decision.The police kept a protective ring around pride marchers throughout the three-hour march.\"The problem for PO is that if they embrace LGBTQ rights too much, they might lose some of their conservative electorates,\" explained Volha Charnysh, assistant professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). That played out last Saturday. According to Hubert Sobecki, co-president of Warsaw-based LGBT+ organization Love Does Not Exclude, the Bialystok event was one of 24 such parades planned this year in Poland-- a country where same-sex marriage and adoptions are illegal, there is no hate crime category for the LGBTQ community, and gay conversion therapy is legal. The pride marches reflect many urban Poles' growing support for increased LGBTQ rights. They are also a defiant response to a rise in homophobic and transphobic rhetoric from Poland's Catholic leaders, the right-wing press, and the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS). In June, tens of thousands of people took part in Warsaw's pride march -- said to be the largest pride parade in central and eastern Europe.But Bialystok's pride marchers were outnumbered, four to one, by thousands of counter-protesters, according to local police. Precel was chased down a street by counter-protestors after stewarding at the march Nationalist football \"ultra\" fans, members of far-right groups and others packed the parade route and nearby parks.\"Get out of this city,\" yelled a group of men trying to break through the 700-strong line of riot police protecting the marchers. \"This is MY city,\" orange-haired parade steward Precel, 19, shouted back, warning marchers to watch out for rocks thrown by the counter-protesters.Dozens of LGBTQ marchers were physically assaulted before, during and after the parade, according to the Warsaw-based advocacy group Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH), the organizers of the parade, and witnesses CNN spoke to. Ant Ambroziak, a journalist from Warsaw, told CNN he was spat at and assaulted as he live-streamed the protest for work. \"I have a friend who was assaulted before the march. He was punched in the face because he [was wearing] lipstick\" he said. Another marcher was spat on and hit in the back, \"all in front of my mother's eyes, who started to cry and tremble,\" Paulina Brzoza, 28, told CNN. Hundreds took part in a vigil outside Bialystok Cathedral\"They were hunting us down,\" said Precel, who is gender non-conforming and prefers they/them pronouns, adding that they had been spat at and chased by a group of men. Michal Bilewicz, who researches the social psychology of groups at the University of Warsaw, said Poland's socio-political environment had demonized diversity and otherness. \"What happened Saturday is a consequence of political language and discourse which targets gay people,\" he told CNN.  According to Urszula Boublej, the spokesperson for Bialystok's mayor, there were about 32 protest groups registered for Saturday, the majority in opposition to the pride march.It included the far-right group All-Polish Youth, which took its name from fascist and anti-Semitic pre-war youth organization.Last year, its former head Adam Andruszkiewicz who went to college in Bialystok, joined the federal government as Secretary of State at the Ministry of Digital Affairs. The march after riot police deployed stun grenades and pepper spray to clear the far-right protesters.Critics said the appointment was another example of PiS mainstreaming right-wing extremism, according to Pankowski. Both the PiS and the government refused repeated requests for comment from CNN.Bialystok's Archbishop Tadeusz Wojda told congregants to \"defend Christian values\" by attending a family picnic -- organized by the marshal of Podlasie Artur Kosicki -- or an outdoor prayer vigil. Kosicki, a PiS member, refused to speak to CNN at the picnic, which came replete with a military artillery display and bouncy castles.At the vigil, CNN saw hundreds praying, some on their knees, outside the grand Bialystok Cathedral, in which participants held a banner aloft that read, \"reparation to god and the blessed mother for the sin of sodomy.\"How the Stonewall riots inspired today's Pride celebrationsThe Polish Ministry of the Interior said they have determined the identity of 104 people who broke the law in Bialystok \"with 77 people, actions have already been carried out in relation to committed crimes or offenses,\" it added.A colorful history of the rainbow flagInterior Minister Elzbieta Witek, who is a member of the PiS, condemned the violence. \"Officers ensure security regardless of the ideas, values and beliefs proclaimed by citizens. Any person who breaks the law... should know they can be held responsible,\" Witek said on Twitter, Reuters reported.But according to research by The Warsaw-based nonprofit Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH), some 90% of violent incidents against people who identify as non-heterosexual go unreported, Miroslawa Makuchowska, head of the political division at KPH, told CNN. \"People who are attacked don't want to report to police because they feel the authorities can't do anything. They are traumatized and afraid of having to hear homophobic slurs,\" Makuchowska, head of the political division at KPH, said.Precel, who has been toying with the idea of leaving Bialystok, said the attacks at the Pride parade may have hastened that decision: \"I was born here, and now I am studying here, but now I don't know how it will be in the future.\"I don't really feel safe in Bialystok.\"",

Italian police have confirmed to CNN that an investigation has been launched into who leaked the photo to respected Italian newspaper Corriere della sera.\"The general command of the Carabinieri police strongly distances itself from the photo and the distribution of the photo of the people detained for the homicide of the Officer Mario Cerciello Rega. The provincial Carabinieri command of Rome is quickly carrying out investigations to locate who is responsible,\" police said in a statement Sunday.The two Americans, Finnegan Lee Elder, 19, and\u00a0Gabriel\u00a0Natale Hjorth, 18, were arrested\u00a0while on vacation in Rome in connection with the murder of Italian police officer\u00a0Mario Cerciello Rega on\u00a0Friday, Italian police told CNN Saturday.Officer Rega, 35, was stabbed eight times at 2 a.m. local time on Friday, in the Prati neighborhood of Rome, near the hotel where the two young men were staying, police said. He was declared dead at 4:30 a.m.A 'heinous crime'Surveillance footage and witness testimonies had allowed the Capitoline Investigative Unit to identify the two responsible for the \"heinous crime,\" according to the police statement.\u00a0Italian police officer Mario Cerciello Rega was killed on Friday in Rome. The two Americans, both from San Francisco, were arrested inside their hotel room in Rome.Police allege the boys stole a backpack from a man whom they had approached about buying drugs. The order and details of what happened next are still being investigated. However, police allege the Americans\u00a0stole the backpack because they were sold crushed aspirin instead of cocaine.\u00a0The teenagers subsequently answered the owner's cellphone, which they had also taken, and told him \"they would not return the backpack without 100 euros and 1 gram of cocaine,\" police added.After police were contacted by the owner of the stolen bag, officers met the American suspects under the guise of retrieving the backpack, police said.Both the Americans are accused of assaulting the police officers, who reportedly identified themselves as law enforcement officers. Then one of the suspects took out a knife and stabbed the officer eight times before fleeing the scene, police said. The officers were unarmed, police added.The Carabinieri police force said in a statement that the Americans were arrested Friday night for \"the crime of aggravated murder and attempted extortion.\"Alleged confessionPolice\u00a0allege\u00a0both Americans confessed to taking part in the assault, and say Elder confessed in the early hours of the interrogation on Friday to murder.\u00a0Elder's appointed public prosecutor,\u00a0Francesco Codini, said that during his court appearance Saturday his client \"maintained his right to remain silent\" in front of a judge.In this combo photo released by the Italian Carabinieri, Gabriel Christian Natale Hjorth, right, and Finnegan Lee Elder, sit in their hotel room in Rome.In a statement to CNN, Elder's family said: \"We write as a family to express our deepest condolences to the grieving family and community that loved Brigadier Cerciello Rega. We are shocked and dismayed at the events that have been reported, but have very little independent information about these events.\" Elder's family added that they haven't been able to have any communication with their son and appealed to the public to respect their privacy. \"We plan to go to Rome as soon as the State Department assures us we will be able to see our son,\" the Elder family said in another statement. \"We are also aware of the funeral plans for Officer Rega, and wish to be respectful of his family and friends at this devastating time.\"Elder's father, Ethan Elder, spoke briefly with CNN outside his San Francisco home Sunday and called his son's case a \"precarious situation.\" Ethan Elder says he wants people to know his son is \"a good man.\"Italian police can legally hold suspects for an entire year without official charges.Italy's far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini commented on the blindfold photo Sunday, saying in a statement:\u00a0\"To those complaining about the blindfolding of the arrested, remember that the only victim to cry for is the man, the son, the husband who is 35 years old, a Carabinieri officer, a servant of the homeland who died in service at the hands of the people who, if guilty, deserve only life imprisonment.\"\u00a0The day before, Salvini had called for life-long prison sentences for the accused teens, despite them not having been put on trial. \"Hoping that the murderers of our poor policeman will never get out of prison, I remind the do-gooders that in the United States whoever kills risks the death penalty.\u00a0I'm not saying we should go that far, but life in prison (obviously working), this, yes!\" Salvini wrote in a message on Twitter on Saturday.",

last year's race. \"The Devil\" is sure ot make his customary appearances this year.Hide Caption 10 of 10READ: Froome to miss Tour after 'horror crash' Colombia expectsFroome may indeed be missing, but Team Ineos still has a formidable line-up and in 22-year-old Egan Bernal the rising star of the peloton and the hope of cycling crazy Colombia to deliver its first-ever winner of the Tour de France.Like so many of the Colombian riders, Bernal had the advantage of being being born and developing his talent in the altitude (2,640m) of Bogota, not dissimilar to the advantage enjoyed by Kenyan long distance runners from the Rift Valley.\"This year is a good year for Colombians who are from high altitude, the born climbers,\" said Rigoberto Uran, a compatriot of Bernal and another with a chance of victory having finished runner-up in the 2017 Tour to Froome.Bernal impressed in last year's Tour in support of Thomas and Froome, but this year has been winning top races in his own right, most recently the Tour of Switzerland where teammate Thomas crashed heavily and had to pull out, adversely affecting his preparations for a successful defense of the title he won to such acclaim, particularly in his native Wales.Colombia's cycling obsessionEarlier this year, in March, Bernal also took top honors in the prestigious Paris-Nice stage and has won plaudits from Tour de France organiser Christian Prudhomme, who told AFP: \"It made one think what might come in the future, and now the future is coming, it's this July,\" he said.It was fitting and perhaps an omen that Bernal was presented with his yellow jersey for winning Paris-Nice by the legendary Belgian Eddy Merckx, a five-time winner of the Tour de France.The Tour's Grand Depart in Belgium is specifically to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Merckx's first Tour win in 1969 and his other incredible achievements, before it moves into France on day three.Ahead of the riders will be one of the toughest routes in recent Tour history, with five mountain top summit finishes and a host of other testing climbs and hair-raising descents where the smallest error of judgment can lead to disaster.Just about every meter of every major climb will be densely populated with fans, many donning the national flag and colors of their favorite rider or dressed in crazy costumes.Tour de France: The history of the La Caravane Du TourHard core fans camp out for several days in advance to claim the prized viewing spots from where to cheer on the heroes of the peloton, some of the estimated 20 million people viewing the Tour from the roadside.As they wait for their heroes to ride past, there is also the added attraction of the Tour caravan, a parade of vehicles, plugging various sponsors and giving out free gifts and promotional material to the onlooking watchers.Towns and villages en route make a point of putting out the bunting to show off the best they can offer for the extensive coverage on French and international television.The TV commentary often makes a point of highlighting the gastronomic delights the particular region has to offer, not to mention the variety of wine it is famous for, helping no doubt to boost tourism and local economies.French obsessionWhen the Tour started in 1903 it was for the original aim of boosting the circulation of the newspaper L'Auto, a forerunner to L'Equipe, and was an almost entirely all-French affair, which quickly grew into a national obsession.The host country has provided the winner on a record 36 occasions, with Belgium, boosted by Merckx's efforts next best on 18, but riders from outside traditional European cycling countries have increasingly become a major factor in more recent Tours.The success of British riders, with those six recent wins in Team Sky colors, has proved hard to stomach for many French sports fan and its media, hence the pressure on Bardet and Pinot to break that cycle this year.The other dominant British cyclist has been Mark Cavendish, a specialist in winning the flat stages, which finish in daredevil bunch sprint at speeds of approximately 70 kph (43mph).Cavendish has won 30 stages, four short of the record held by Merckx, but has been surprisingly left out of the Dimension Data squad for this year's Tour, leaving him \"heartbroken\" but vowing to return in the future.4/4 Though I won't be there, as always I'll be supporting my teammates with all I have, wishing them safety and success in France and hoping we can get even more children on bicycles.Thank you all for your support \ud83d\ude4f x pic.twitter.com/mkTbsk8jRo\u2014 Mark Cavendish (@MarkCavendish) July 2, 2019\n\nCavendish and the other sprinters such as Peter Sagan have no chance of winning the overall yellow jersey, but compete instead for the green jersey of points winner, based on placings on every stage and sprints at intermediate points on each stage.Slovakian Sagan has won it six times and few would bet against him, but there are a clutch of other young hungry sprint specialists like Dutchman Dylan Groenewegen (Jumbo-Visma) who will be looking for Tour de France stage glory.Groenewegen will find support from the waves of Orange-clad Dutch fans who make the pilgrimage to the Tour each year, disappointed no doubt by the absence of last year's overall runner-up Tom Dumoulin, who like Froome is sitting out the race due to the after effects of an injury sustained in a crash.The other major category is for the polka dot jersey of best mountain climber, with points awarded for placings at the top of summits.  Another Frenchman, Julian Alaphilippe, who rides for the cycling's most dominant team in terms of race wins, Deceunicnck-QuickStep, is defending his King of the Mountains title this year and will likely challenge for victories on a number of stages.Bastille Day showdownLook for him in particular on Bastille Day, July 14, where a hilly leg finishes in Brioude, the home town of Bardet, who will also be keen to make an impression.Whether Bardet, or another home rider, can break the overall stranglehold of the Team Ineos squad is another question, but that's not to rule out a clutch of other hopefuls, including Dane Jakob Fuglsang, who won the Criterium du Dauphine after Froome's untimely departure. Bernal's more experienced fellow Colombian Nairo Quintana, part of a powerful Movistar squad which includes Mikel Landa and reigning world champion Alejandro Valverde of Spain, is a perennial contender, while British hopes outside of Thomas, rest with Adam Yates (Michelton-Scott), who was fourth in 2016.#VamosEscarabajos Nairo Quintana, Egan Bernal, Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n y Sergio Henao, los colombianos en el Tour de Francia https://t.co/tKmqnu6uVM pic.twitter.com/j6VQk082Nr\u2014 Noticias Caracol (@NoticiasCaracol) July 3, 2019\n\n\"Anything can happen without Froome racing,\" 29-year-old Quintana told a press conference Thursday. \"It's a bit special, more open, it'll be a much different Tour than usual.\"And Yates can launch his sudden attacks, but there are loads of guys who will fancy their chances without Froome around,\" added Quintana.A total of 176 riders, in 22 teams of eight, will begin their quest for glory on Saturday, each with a specific task in the fast-moving and constantly changing peloton, which speeds around France at an average speed of over 40 kph (25 mph) for hour after hour, with just two rest days in over three weeks.\ud83e\udd29 The passion, the intensity, the overwhelming occasion.\ud83d\udc9b 21 stages to make history.\ud83d\udccd Everything will start in Brussels on July 6. #TDF2019 pic.twitter.com/ojoFbJssvk\u2014 Le Tour de France UK (@letour_uk) June 27, 2019\n\nThey will encounter extremes of weather from blistering heat to torrential rain, particularly in the high mountains at over 2,000 meters where the decisive battle for overall honors and the yellow jersey is set to be decided.Despite the suffering and the sacrifice, the riders know that just taking part is a privilege afforded to an elite few and just finishing, whether in the Maillot Jaune or as the Lanterne Rouge, the last-placed rider, is an achievement to savor for their rest of their lives.The next three weeks will see legends born, reputations enhanced or diminished, but like every previous Tour de France is guaranteed to be memorable.",

        "content": "(CNN)Real Madrid suffered a humiliating 7-3 defeat by crosstown rival Atletico Madrid in a pre-season game Friday, with speculation still swirling over Gareth Bale's future.Diego Costa scored three times before the break as Atletico hit five in the opening 45 minutes. Costa added his fourth after the break before receiving a red card for clashing with Real's Dani Carvajal, who was also dismissed in a fiery affair between the two clubs.Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa celebrates after scoring his third goal.Trailing 7-1 with 20 minutes to go, Real scored twice late in the game, easing some of the pain on a chastening evening for head coach Zinedine Zidane.On another disappointing night in the US for Real, further speculation emerged surrounding the fate of Bale, with UK media reporting he is close to joining Chinese club Jiangsu Suning on a contract worth over \u00a31 million-a-week ($1.23 million).Bale's future at Real looked over last week when he was left out of last Sunday's pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich. Zidane told reporters: \"He wasn't included in the squad because the club is working on his departure and that's why he didn't play.\"Read MoreHe went on, \"We'll have to see what happens in the coming days. We'll have to see if it goes through tomorrow. If it does, then all the better. Let's hope, for everyone's sake, that it happens soon. The club is dealing with the club that he'll move to.\"Bale, who plays for the Welsh national team, looks set to leave the club.READ: From dream start to nightmare end, Gareth Bale's Real Madrid career turns sourREAD: Pep Guardiola hits back at claims Man City showed 'utter disrespect' in ChinaRumors about a potential trade for Bale, who did feature in the friendly clash against Arsenal last week and made a substitute appearance against Atletico, have long been in the air.A member of the Welsh national team, Bale, who joined Real in 2013 with what was then a world record contract of \u00a385 million ($105 million), struggled with injuries last season and was booed by the club's fans.Bale, like the team, endured a difficult time with Real finishing 19 points behind archrival and champion Barcelona in third place. It was also knocked out of the Champions League by Ajax in the last 16.The 30-year-old, who still has three years left on his current deal, has won four Champions Leagues, one Spanish title, one Spanish Cup, three Super Cups and three Club World Cups.While Bale may be part of Real's past, the future appears to be fraught with challenges for Zidane.Real Madrid's Croatian midfielder Luka Modric (R) and Atletico Madrid's Spanish midfielder Saul Niguez (L) vie for the bal.New signings Eden Hazard and Luka Jovic started against Atletico but had little answer to coach Diego Simeone's side.Four goals from Costa, plus strikes from Joao Felix, Angel Correa and Vitolo sealed a satisfying victory for Atletico as it ran riot. Red cards for Costa and Carvajal only added to the already-raucous affair. Real Madrid's Dani Carvajal brawls with players from Atletico during the 2019 International Champions Cup clash.\"There was no response from us to change something,\" Zidane told reporters after the match, which was played in New Jersey, a stone's throw from New York City. \"The first part was difficult. We never entered the game. We have lacked everything, especially intensity.\"You don't have to spin it over. It's a pre-season game. They've been better at everything. There is nothing more to talk about. We are preparing a season and being calm.\"Atletico coach Simeone said he knew where Real would be vulnerable and sent his players out to take full advantage.\"Having seen Madrid, we looked for where we could harm them,\" Simeone told reporters. \"We tried to find good places at the exit of the ball and we were very precise. That, in football, it is important.\"",

The Conservative Party politician, who is an Old Etonian and stickler for tradition, has outlined an extensive list of words that his staff are banned from using in correspondences with his constituents and fellow MPs. The style guide was originally revealed by CNN affiliate ITV.Among his maligned lexicon, are the words \"ongoing,\" \"speculate\" and \"meet with.\" Staff are equally obliged to use imperial measurements, and a double space after a full stop is imperative.Yet perhaps most archaically, Rees-Mogg requires all non-titled males to be referred to as \"esquire\" as a sign of respect. Rees-Mogg requires his staff to use imperial measurements at all times, and refer to non-titled males as 'esquire'.Rees-Mogg, who was appointed to his first position in government this week by Britain's new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, has said the rules are by no means a new tradition and have been in regular use by his constituency office during his time as the MP for North East Somerset.   Read More\"They asked how I like my letters done and I said: 'Well I have got a list of how things are done in my office upstairs,\" he said according to the Daily Telegraph, referring to his recent appointment. \"I had it brought down from my House of Commons office.

A sort of style guide. And people must be correctly addressed. I always put esquire to a male constituent.\" Rees-Mogg was appointed Leader of the House of Commons by Britain's new prime minister Boris Johnson.Despite the seemingly antiquated nature of Rees-Mogg's requests, fellow politicians have come to his defense.\"In fairness, these are largely rules I apply,\" fellow Conservative politician Simon Clarke wrote on Twitter. \"Double spacing after full stops. Esq. Avoid the dreaded \"meet with.\" Somewhat sensations coverage of what is in essence good house style.\" Rees-Mogg has garnered the nickname \"Honorable member for the 18th century\" for his use of archaic English and love of double-breasted suits. He once wanted to be king of the world. Now Boris Johnson has his crownHe is an avid history fan and recently published a book paying tribute to his idols of the Victorian age, entitled \"The Victorians: 12 Titans who Forged Britain.\"The new Leader of the Commons is a fervent Brexiteer and played a central role in the downfall of Britain's former prime minister, Theresa May. As chairman of the European Research Group, a body of Brexiteer Conservative politicians, he repeatedly urged MPs to vote against May's Brexit deal.

Thousands of Russians pledged to attend the protest in the capital Saturday, after Russian authorities banned a number of independent and opposition candidates from taking part in municipal elections in September. Authorities stated that the candidates were barred from running because they had failed to obtain a sufficient number of signatures to be put on the ballot paper. Opposition politicians and supporters have rejected this allegation.   The decision has sparked a number of protests across Russia this month, including the largest demonstration in recent years last weekend, when 22,000 people took to the streets. Protesters threatened to hold an even larger demonstration Saturday, which was subsequently declared illegal by the authorities.

All detainees are brought to the territorial police units for investigation,\" the State Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow said in the statement.A number of arrests and raids were also carried out on opposition candidates in the days and hours leading up to the protest. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e: @novaya_gazeta pic.twitter.com/74lanVsib8\u2014 \u041e\u0412\u0414-\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e (@OvdInfo) July 27, 2019\n\nAlexei Navalny, Russia's most outspoken opposition figure, was among those detained during the week, and was later sentenced to 30 days in prison for allegedly violating the country's protest laws by calling for the demonstrations Saturday. Navalny said on Instagram that he was detained as he left his apartment to go on a jog. \"People are right when they say that sport is not always good for your health,\" he quipped. \"I have been detained and am now at a police station wearing shorts like a stupid man.\" Dmitry Gudkov, a fellow disqualified candidate, was also detained hours before Saturday's protest. He had previously claimed that the country's future was at stake due to the barring of opposition candidates.  \"If we lose now, elections will cease to exist as a political instrument,\" he said. \"What we're talking about is whether it's legal to participate in politics today in Russia, we're talking about the country we're going to live in.\" Russian police arrested a number of prominent opposition activists and politicians prior to the protests. Ilya Yashin, an ally of Navalny, reported on Facebook that he had also been detained hours before the demonstration following a raid on his house, and had been taken out of the Russian capital. Other prominent activists to be detained include Kira Yarmysh, Navalyny's spokeswoman, Lyubov Sobo and Ivan Zhdanov. Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, warned on Twitter that police would react decisively to restore public order. \"According to information from law enforcement authorities, serious provocations are being prepared which pose a threat to the safety, lives and health of people,\" he said. \"Attempts at ultimatums, disorder will not lead to anything good.

Still, he has pitched before at the major-league level -- albeit in mop-up duty situations.This was not one of those times.It was getting so late it was getting early -- as Thursday's marathon game against the Los Angeles Angels moved into the early hours of Friday -- and the Orioles were out of pitchers. It was the bottom of the 16th inning when Wilkerson took the mound with his team up 10-8.He made history.Read MorePitching a perfect inning, Wilkerson became the first position player ever in Major League Baseball to record a save. He retired Albert Pujols on a fly ball, ending the game just before 1:30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET) after six hours, 19 minutes.\"I don't think I've wrapped my head around it yet,\" Wilkerson said, according to MLB.com.Good morning to Stevie Wilkerson and Stevie Wilkerson only. pic.twitter.com/fRBttNhioD\u2014 Orioles on MASN (@masnOrioles) July 26, 2019 Earlier in the night, Wilkerson hit a game-tying double the top of the eighth inning, redeeming himself after misplaying a fly ball that had given the Angels the lead in the seventh. The score continued to climb, but neither team could seize control.Around the 13th inning in Anaheim, Wilkerson knew pitching may be a possibility, as he went to get his pitching glove. This was his third career pitching appearance, with his last coming on Saturday against the Boston Red Sox.\"I knew we were running thin on guys,\" the 27-year-old Wilkerson said. \"I knew it was a possibility when the game was getting late.\"In a game where both teams coughed up leads, the Angels had a chance to win in the bottom of the 15th, but David Fletcher was called out at home trying to score on a Mike Trout bases-loaded double. The call stood after review.The Orioles then took the lead in the top of the 16th with a two-run home run from Jonathan Villar, setting up the save opportunity -- which became an official stat in 1969 -- for Wilkerson.\"I was just hoping somehow they would hit three balls at somebody,\" Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde said. \"It's below hitting speed, so that's hard.\"Mission accomplished: Fly out, ground out, fly out.\"Just a great, great baseball game,\" Hyde said. \"A really gutty performance from our guys.

Tens of thousands of people were imprisoned in Turkey after the failed coup.Turkey has accused Kanter of being part of a terror organization because of his ties to US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Erogan has accused of masterminding the coup attempt -- a charge Gulen has denied.Kanter has dismissed the allegations against him as absurd.The consul general repeated those allegations Thursday. \"Enes is not welcome in the Turkish-American community,\" Aktas said. \"Enes Kanter is a member of a terrorist organization and a religious cult. I just want the sports-loving community of Long Island to acknowledge those facts.\"Earlier this year, state news agency Anadolu reported that Turkey submitted an extradition request for Kanter, and requested an Interpol red notice for his arrest.",

        "content": "(CNN)Forget Brexit -- when Queen Elizabeth was snapped in a photo op with Britain's new Prime Minister this week amid record temperatures, all anyone could talk about was her Dyson fan pictured in the background. \"The Queen must be feeling the heat ... I guess there isn't any air con in #BuckinghamPalace,\" one Twitter user wrote, remarking on the silver fan sitting at the foot of the Queen's gilded armchair.And, while there was some speculation that the fan's cameo role might be product placement for prominent Brexiteer James Dyson, the overwhelming reaction was: The Queen, she's just like us -- trying to stay cool.For many in Europe, that has been no easy task, as a scorching heat wave set record temperatures in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands in recent days.Cities aren't designed to copeRead MoreThe reason? Many European cities, including London, are not designed to deal with this sort of heat.  Air conditioning (AC) is uncommon in homes across Europe, which has historically had a temperate climate, nor is it widespread on public transportation systems. An elderly woman shelters from the hot sun with a newspaper, in Milan, Italy.Those infrastructure gaps were all too apparent in London on Thursday, when railway authorities warned that train tracks might buckle in the heat, while passengers braved stifling underground carriages. Photos of a shirtless passenger and another person who brought a plug-in fan on their journey were doing the rounds on social media, underlining the desperate state of affairs. Less than 5% of all European households are air-conditioned, compared with more than 90% in the United States, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). But analysis by the same agency suggests that will change rapidly over the next three decades, with air conditioning set to become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand.And while that shift will benefit the wellbeing and productivity of many around the world, it will bring its own problems:  AC units guzzle electricity and vent hot air, making the outside temperature even higher, and, worse still, refrigerants used in the units contribute to global warming.People enjoy the hot weather at a beach in Bournemouth, UK.With an estimated 1.6 billion electric air conditioning units around the world -- a number expected to triple by 2050 -- cooling technology could release enough\u00a0greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0into the atmosphere to cause temperatures to rise by 0.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, according to Rocky Mountain Institute. Back to the drawing boardThat rapid growth, and its potential to wreak havoc with our environment, is why scientists, architects and urban planners are scrambling to develop other ways to cool buildings, streets and people.Creating more parks, green roofs and vertical gardens is one way to bring some relief. According to the UK House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, the surface temperature in an urban green space can be 15 to 20 degrees Celsius lower than that of the surrounding streets, which makes the air temperature 2 to 8 degrees cooler.Water is another favorite -- mist showers, fountains and reflective pools all bring the temperature down. A boy cools off under a public water spray on the bank of the Seine river in Paris.Awnings, overhangs, porticos and simple shutters can also help offset solar heat gain, by preventing light from getting inside. Covered open-air corridoors, ventilated roofs, fiber-glass insulation, the use of natural materials and the manipulation of a building's orientation can also offer alternative sources of ventilation.And these designs are getting increasingly more inventive. London-based architecture firm Ahr covered a skyscraper in Abu Dhabi in dynamic flower-shaped shutters that change shape depending on the time of day. As the screens fold and unfold in response to the sun's movement, they reflect up to 50% of the light and significantly reduce the need for artificial air conditioning.Bioclimatic architecture, which employs these energy-saving techniques and could make AC units redundant, is nothing new. Before the 20th century, the technique was the norm and is still visible today in vernacular buildings from Spanish farmhouses to traditional Chinese village homes.But with the invention of AC by US engineer Willis Haviland Carrier in 1902, bioclimatic solutions fell out of fashion. Today, cooling systems account for 37% of global building energy consumption, according to the IEA, which predicts that AC use will be the strongest driver for electricity consumption in buildings by mid-century.People cool off next to the fountains at the Louvre Museum in Paris.Climate apartheidMany of these changes will take place in some of the world's least developed countries, which also happen to be among the hottest. Nearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the daily average temperature is more than 25 degrees Celsius (77 Fahrenheit), but less than 10% own an AC unit (that's projected to be 75% by 2050). These are also people who are being hit hardest by the effects of climate change.An alarming report from the United Nations, released last month, suggested that the world is facing a \"climate apartheid\" between the rich, who can protect themselves in the face of rising temperatures, and the poor, who are left behind.\"We risk a 'climate apartheid' scenario where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer,\" said Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.The UN also warned that simply slowing down the rise in temperatures, as outlined by the 2015 Paris Agreement, won't be enough to save the millions who are already suffering.For those across Europe who got a taste of that pain this week, coping with the heat meant trying creative cooling solutions.Authorities activated emergency plans that include setting up public cooling rooms and extending hours at swimming pools and parks. People sunbathe and cool off at the Trocadero Fountains next to the Eiffel Tower in Paris.But in cities like London, many swimming pools couldn't cope with the volume of people -- resulting in long lines with hours-long waits, while others had to shutter completely.Still, there are some signs that countries are getting better at handling heat waves, even without air conditioning.After a 2003 European heat wave killed a staggering 14,000 in France alone, authorities devised a plan to avoid such a loss of life again. Paris implemented a special heat plan, designed to give its inhabitants relief. The city set up public cooling rooms in municipal buildings, put mist showers in the streets and kept parks and swimming pools open longer than usual.\"Since 2003, heat wave plans have improved from year to year with experience of precautionary measures to be taken,\" French Health Minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said Thursday.\"We now have the feeling that, in collective places, prevention messages are well known.\"",

        "content": "London  (CNN)When Boris Johnson's girlfriend Carrie Symonds joined the entourage of staff who gathered outside 10 Downing Street to watch his first speech as British Prime Minister, witnesses reported that photographers went \"bananas.\"Until now, the 31-year-old former Conservative party communications official has done a pretty good job of staying out of the media spotlight -- rarely seen on the campaign trail and steering clear of historic moments like meeting the Queen.Keeping a low profile for the past 18 months as girlfriend of a senior politician is one thing. But doing the same as partner of the Prime Minister will prove more difficult. In recent days, the British media has gone into overdrive. From her living arrangements (will she move into Downing Street?) to her involvement in diplomatic affairs (will she accompany Johnson on foreign trips?), every aspect of Symonds's relationship with Johnson has been the subject of speculation.Boris Johnson delivers his first speech as UK prime minister, watched by Carrie Symonds and staff. Downing Street told CNN it did not know whether Symonds would move in to the famous residence.Read MoreThese are uncharted waters for the British establishment  -- never in living memory has a UK Prime Minister had an unmarried partner while in office.  Unlike US first ladies, UK first partners have no strictly defined role, and it will largely be up to Symonds to shape it.\"It's kind of made up as they go along, so it's very dependent on the personality of the particular person, said Professor Tony Travers, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at the London School of Economics.  Travers pointed to the way former Prime Minister Tony Blair's wife Cherie continued her career as a lawyer and \"was very much her own person with almost nothing to do\" with her husband's job.Meanwhile Theresa May's husband Philip stood by her side as she delivered her final speech as Prime Minister. \"He decided to have a supportive, low profile, and the press pretty much left it at that,\" said Travers. Boris Johnson's father Stanley with Carrie Symonds at an anti-whaling protest outside the Japanese Embassy in London. A powerful political communicator The new Prime Minister is also unusual for having a partner who had a political career -- long before she met Johnson. The daughter of Matthew Symonds, a co-founder of the Independent newspaper, and the paper's lawyer Josephine McCaffee, Symonds had a privileged upbringing in southwest London where she attended a private girls' school.Symonds studied theater studies and art history at the well-respected University of Warwick, before working as a press officer for the Conservative Party in 2010 and quickly rising up its ranks. She was part of the campaign team that helped to get Johnson re-elected as mayor of London in 2012.Then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson with Carrie Symonds at the Conservative Party's fundraising Black and White Ball in 2018. At 29, Symonds became the youngest-ever director of communications at the party, and analysts say she's been crucial in tidying up Johnson's famously disheveled persona during the leadership campaign.\"Since she's come on the scene he's become a much trimmer figure, he's lost weight, he's had his hair cut ... he's definitely  smartened up his appearance,\" said Caroline Wheeler, deputy political editor at the Sunday Times newspaper.  Symonds is a \"very established political communicator,\" Wheeler added. \"She'll know how to keep him on message.\"Throughout the leadership campaign Johnson was \"very careful\" about whom he spoke to, said Wheeler, doing few newspaper interviews and shunning some of the major TV debates. Boris Johnson's first full day as UK Prime Minister\"He's been a lot more disciplined figure and lots of people have credited Carrie with that transformation,\" Wheeler said.Symonds now works as a senior adviser to conservation charity Oceana, and her Twitter feed is filled with stories ranging from overfishing to banning trophy hunting.Some analysts believe she will have the PM's ear on the climate crisis and animal welfare, an issue that Johnson unexpectedly touched on during his inaugural speech.\"She'll influence policies, particularly the environment,\" said LBC radio broadcaster and political commentator Iain Dale. Johnson has been \"talking a lot about climate change during the campaign,\" he said.The 'taxi cab rapist'Symonds has also spoken out about other issues important to her. Barely out of her teens, she spoke publicly about her encounter with John Worboys -- known in the UK as the \"taxi cab rapist\" who is thought to have assaulted at least 100 victims.At 19, Symonds caught a lift with Worboys to her home in west London and during the ride he offered her alcohol -- much like the other spiked drinks he gave his victims. She said that as a result, she does not know what happened afterward. Symonds waived her anonymity in the case, telling a number of British papers about her ordeal. She also helped to launch a judicial review after the parole board decided Worboys was no longer a threat.The review later found Worboys still posed a major risk to the public, and would remain in jail. The justice system had \"let us down,\" Symonds wrote in the Evening Standard. \"Finally we've been proved right.\"Tabloid fodderToday, Symonds is in British newspapers for different reasons. At 55, Johnson is more than two decades older than her. He is still married to his wife of 26 years, Marina Wheeler, with whom he has four children. The couple separated last year and reports of Johnson's alleged extra-marital affairs -- and children out of wedlock -- have long graced the pages of the UK papers.Boris Johnson and ex-wife Marina Wheeler pictured in 2014. Johnson has never publicly addressed the issue of his extra-marital children. CNN contacted Johnson's office for comment but had not received a reply at time of publication. Given Johnson's complicated private life, his relationship with Symonds \"has got all the ingredients for the type of thing tabloid newspapers love,\" said Travers.But their relationship is also a reflection of modern Britain, said Wheeler. \"There are lot of people who choose to live together without being married,\" she said. \"And I think it's important that those who are running the country, reflect what many people in this country are doing.\"The couple's relationship was put under the spotlight like never before during the leadership campaign after police were called to an argument at Symonds's south London flat.

Meaning \"does the prime minister's private life in any way impinge on their capacity to do their job?\"With the UK in the grip of its worst political crisis in decades, Johnson is under huge pressure to deliver Brexit by the October 31 deadline.

        "content": "London (CNN)Perhaps someone should have warned Ireland. If you come at the king, you best not miss. For two days, against the newly crowned world champion at Lord's, Ireland dared to dream. It had embarrassed England's batsmen and given itself a chance in a game few had expected it to challenge.Chris Woakes of England took six wickets as Ireland were dismissed for just 38.But on Friday, as the sun at last faded and the gloomy and murky skies began to engulf London, England's bowlers brought a dark and shattering end to Ireland's hopes. Chasing 182 for victory, Ireland was blown away for just 38 -- the seventh lowest total in the history of Test match cricket and lowest since 1955.For Ireland, which had played some excellent cricket for much of the contest, this was a particularly cruel and painful end.Read MoreChris Woakes claimed six wickets for 17 runs and Stuart Broad picked up four for 19 as Ireland's innings last just 15.4 overs -- the shortest innings in Test cricket for 92 years.The size of Ireland's defeat, 143 runs, was even more remarkable given its magnificent start to the contest -- just the third Test match it has played since being granted status for the long-form version of the sport in 2017.Tim Murtagh salutes the crowd as he leaves the field after taking five wickets .Led by Tim Murtagh, its 37-year-old bowler, Ireland humiliated England's batsmen by dismissing the home side for just 85 -- England's lowest Test total on home soil since 1997.It then inflicted further pain, making 207 in its first innings to take a 122 lead in the contest against an England team that had won the World Cup just 10 days earlier.\"We put ourselves in a position to win the game - that's why we're so gutted up there,\" Ireland captain William Porterfield told Sky Sports after the game.\"We knew it was going to be tough with the lights on and drizzle in the air. But we had to dig deep and get through that. Fair play to the two lads to how they bowled -- they made it difficult.\"If we had managed to get 50 or 70 more in the first innings, that turns it into a different chase today.\"Ireland batsman Tim Murtagh is bowled by Chris Woakes to finish the match.READ: England benefited from 'clear mistake' in World Cup winREAD: World Cup final win offers chance to inspire a generationEngland's second innings, which was parked on 303-9 overnight, was swiftly ended with the opening delivery of Friday's action when Olly Stone was dismissed by Stuart Thompson without scoring.With the weather in London having cooled and gray skies overhead, Ireland's batsmen walked out anticipating a hostile spell of bowling from Woakes and Broad who thrive in such conditions.After losing its first wicket for 11 runs, Ireland collapsed horribly, slumping to 24-6.Having successfully moved past the game's lowest ever score of 26, which New Zealand was dismissed by England in 1955, Ireland made it to 32 before losing its last four wickets for just six runs.England's Jonny Bairstow (C) celebrates catching the ball to take the wicket of Ireland's William Porterfield.\"The bowling performance today was brilliant and we exploited the conditions fantastically well,\" England captain Joe Root told the BBC.\"We put it in good areas and our attack in English conditions are the best in the world.\"On that pitch, it wasn't a fair contest. That's the way I'd like to put it but it was the same for both sides and you've got to find a way to win.\"England, which names its squad for the Ashes on Saturday, will now look ahead to the first Test against Australia at Edgbaston on August 1.",

        "content": "London (CNN)There's a good chance you'll have already heard of Britain's new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Johnson was one of the most prominent pro-Brexit campaigners in 2016, and now he has inherited a political crisis that, when you break it down, still looks a long way from being resolved.But supporters of Johnson believe that his optimism makes him the right man to dig Britain out of its Brexit ditch. And among those supporters is a certain Donald Trump.Much has been made of the similarities between Johnson and Trump. It's a comparison that the United States President seems to like. On Tuesday night, Trump said, \"They're saying Britain Trump. They call him Britain Trump and people are saying that's a good thing. They like me over there. That's what they wanted. That's what they need.\"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump at UN headquarters in New York on September 18, 2017.Overlooking the fact that Johnson was in fact elected by Conservative Party members (0.2% of the population) rather than the country at large --- and that Trump is not in fact widely liked in the UK -- it's not a comparison that Johnson will be pleased about for a number of reasons. Read MoreFirst, it doesn't really stand up. There are plenty of reasons to criticize Johnson. He has said incredibly controversial things in newspaper columns and on public platforms over the years: Highlights include saying that women who wear Islamic face veils look \"like letterboxes\" and using racist terms to describe people from the British Commonwealth.But this doesn't extend to the same sort of anti-immigrant rhetoric that we hear so often from Trump. While Johnson has talked about controlling immigration, he is pro-immigration, just as one might expect from the former mayor of liberal, cosmopolitan London. And the idea he would say that British citizens who happen to be an ethnic minority should \"go back\" if they don't like one of his policies is unthinkable.Boris Johnson under pressure to apologize for burqa comments Johnson, like Trump, favors lowering taxes for the wealthy. But unlike Trump, he is not an economic protectionist. Johnson believes that one of the main advantages of Brexit is that it will open up the UK's economy to the rest of the world. And, as one might expect from a foreign secretary, Johnson is an unashamed internationalist.The final and probably most important way that the two men differ is that Johnson actually needs to unite his country. Whatever you think of the man and his politics, Johnson -- unlike Trump -- cannot survive by only playing to his base. If Johnson wants to pull off Brexit and then win a general election in a nation as divided as Britain, he has to win over people from all over the political spectrum. Given that he has wanted this job since he was a child, it is very unlikely that Johnson would use nationally divisive language in the way that Trump does. There simply isn't anything in it for him. He once wanted to be king of the world. Now Boris Johnson has his crownJohnson critics often point to a poster made by the official Leave campaign, which Johnson led, warning of mass immigration from Turkey. The poster was misleading, implying that Turkey would be joining the EU imminently, when it was not. But the point it was making about EU -- that there is free movement through the bloc -- was not incorrect.  And it shouldn't be forgotten that Johnson himself has Turkish roots. Whatever your view of this, it's a long way from claiming that you are going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Another reason Johnson will not like the Trump comparison is that Trump is genuinely unpopular in the UK, according to almost all polling. So, while the President might think that praising Boris and describing him as a friend is the highest of compliments, it could make British voters that are already uncomfortable about their new prime minister even less happy.A giant balloon depicting US President Donald Trump as an orange baby in London during a demonstration against Trump's visit to the UK on July 13, 2018. The danger for Johnson is that the harder-line Brexiteers who support him believe that a trade deal with America could be the best way to prove to the world that Brexit was a success project. Therefore, the idea that he will have a good relationship with the President is seen among these people as a positive thing.But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that a trade deal with America would make up for the economic damage the UK would suffer if it leaves the EU without a deal. There has been no detail on what that trade deal would be, nor any serious conversations about the fact that Trump is very unlikely to offer an asymmetrical trade deal that floods the UK with dollars.So, is Boris Johnson the British Trump? They have a similar hairstyle. But that's pretty much where it ends.",

It's called the Premier Lacrosse League (PLL).   All-star professional lacrosse player Paul Rabil left the Major League Lacrosse (MLL) that's been around for nearly two decades, to pursue a new vision for the way fans watch professional lacrosse.   Rabil and his brother, entrepreneur Mike Rabil, hooked investors like Creative Artists Agency (CAA), the Raine Group, Joe Tsai Sports, the Chernin Group, and Blum Capital -- plus a broadcasting partnership with NBC Sports.   Read MoreViewers can hear uncensored team huddles and two players per game talk directly to the commentators while they're on the field. There's also live player interviews on the sideline, and more live statistics like shot speed.The league also tweaked some of the traditional rules to make the game a faster-paced viewing experience for at-home viewers, Paul Rabil told CNN Sport.  All the games are broadcast on one of the NBC Sports platforms.   \"For a lacrosse viewer to be able to just hear guys in the background talking about what they are seeing is certainly drawing a lot of attention,\" PLL  All-star midfielder Connor Buczek told CNN Sport.   The PLL is half way through its inaugural summer season, and already seeing record-breaking viewership. Week two of play brought the most-watched outdoor professional lacrosse game in history garnering over 400,000 viewers across all platforms, according a PLL press release.     \"Younger kids seem so much more invested in the PLL because they [NBC Sports] are making it so consumable for people via media,\" PLL player Joe Nardella told CNN Sport.  'Breaking the mold'The PLL hosted its first All-Star game in Los Angeles at the season midpoint on July 21. In addition to the game of two line-ups with top players from every PLL team, players competed individually  for a judges panel  in skills challenges like fastest shot and a goalie challenge. Trevor Baptiste #9 of Team Baptiste carries the ball between Mark Glicini #16 and Jake Frocarro #54 of Team Rambo during the Premier Lacrosse League All-Star game.Many of the top players in the country are leaving the MLL to join Rabil who still plays in the PLL while running the business side.   The draw: higher salaries, medical benefits and a stake in the leagues success with equity options. Historically professional lacrosse players don't make enough to make a career of it, most have full-time jobs to make ends meet.   The PLL is looking to change that, paying a salary during the season in addition to income opportunities like coaching in the PLL academy for youth players.  \"The players believed in our vision, they believed in us,\" Paul Rabil told CNN Sport.  \"They are courageous they are doing something different, they are breaking the mold, and they are building a better future for lacrosse.\"   For readers not familiar with lacrosse, there's 10 players on the field for each team -- three offense, three midfielders, three defense, and one goalie. Offensive and defensive players have to stay in their respective halves of the field, but midfielders can help out all over the field. Lacrosse isn't new -- Native Americans started playing in the 17th century and it's Canada's national sport -- but leaders in the sport have been pushing for growth in recent years.   US Lacrosse reported more than 825,000 active players of all ages in 2017, which is more than triple the players reported in 2001, according to the most recent US Lacrosse participation survey. The youth numbers  suggest an encouraging future for the sport, with more than 447,000 male and female players under high school age.   On the professional level, in November 2018 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially sanctioned lacrosse with provisional recognition.   Premier Lacrosse League player Myles Jones takes a shot on goal. Jones plays for the Chaos, one of six PLL teams.  Unlike traditional team sports leagues like the NFL and NBA, the PLL teams don't have a home city. From June through September,  all six teams travel together to a different city in the US every weekend to play each other, and the top two teams come September play for the championship title.   The touring structure mirrors individual sports competitions like professional golf and tennis that bring tournaments to fans all over the world.    \"Anytime we say you get an opportunity to watch or witness best in the world, it's exciting. And then you kind of wrap in the element of sports and camaraderie and community\" Paul Rabil said.    \"If we were to launch in six markets exclusively we would be confined to only the targeted audience in those six markets.\"    The PLL Championship will be played in Philadelphia at the Talen Energy Stadium on Saturday, September 21 and televised on NBC and streamed on NBC Sports web and mobile platforms.",

It's a dream just to play here in the first place. But to get on the honors board,\" Murtagh, who plays first-class cricket at Lord's for Middlesex, told Sky Sports.\"It's a fantastic first session for us. Everything felt really good today. The ball came out nicely and it did a little bit off the wicket. I should know how to bowl on this ground -- I've been here long enough.\"I didn't think I'd be on the away honors board when I first started playing, but I'll take it. I'm over the moon.\"England batsman Jonny Bairstow is bowled by Tim Murtagh.This was England's lowest Test total on home soil since 1997 where it was bowled out for 77 by Australia at Lord's. Its most recent failure came in January 2019 where it was dismissed for the same score, this time by the West Indies in Bridgetown.Perhaps even more worrying for England, with the Ashes set to start on August 1, is the following statistic. It has now lost all 10 wickets in a session three times in the past three years, having not previously done so since 1938. In fact, it's now happened four times in its past 34 Test matches.The first Ashes Test between England and Australia starts on August 1 at Edgbaston, Birmingham.",

The newly appointed Foreign Secretary was also given the post of First Secretary of State, effectively making him Deputy Prime Minister.Chaotic momentKnown for his tousled shock of blonde hair and brash style, Johnson enters Downing Street at a chaotic moment for the UK, both at home and abroad. Despite his Conservative Party's flimsy majority in Parliament, Johnson has pledged to do in three months what May could not do in three years -- lead Britain out of the EU, \"do or die.\" Official forecasts suggest that the latter scenario -- breaking out of the bloc without any deal in place -- risks triggering a recession and the British pound taking a nosedive.On Wednesday, Johnson said the UK must prepare for the \"remote possibility\" of a no-deal scenario. \"With high hearts and growing confidence,\" Britain will prepare for no deal, Johnson said. Using typically Churchillian rhetoric, he said the banks, the farms and the rest of the country \"will be ready.\"Beyond the political bedlam in Britain, Johnson inherits a mounting crisis with Iran. Tehran's seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker last week has thrust the UK into the middle of a standoff between Tehran and Washington.He once wanted to be king of the world. Now Boris Johnson has his crownAll of this falls in the lap of one of the most divisive politicians of his generation, who has said much on Brexit, Iran and many other topics, but has so far divulged little about any potential plan for his premiership.\"He's made a big pitch of re-energizing the country and bringing back optimism as a way he wants to do things,\" Tim Durrant, a senior researcher at the London-based Institute for Government think tank, told CNN. \"We'll see if he has any details on the actual issues.\"Johnson, a former mayor of London and British foreign secretary, won the race to lead his party with 66% of the votes. The election was triggered after an embattled May was forced to quit after losing the support of her Cabinet, many of whom were exasperated with her inability to secure Brexit.As Prime Minister, Johnson, 55, takes on the same problems that faced May -- a deeply divided Parliament and and a fractured nation -- but under even more pressured circumstances.\"Even though Boris faces the same issues that May was confronted with when she took office ... the context of those issues is much different in terms of the parliamentary arithmetic and timing,\" Durrant said.

He has refused to rule out suspending parliament in order to do so. Johnson promised Wednesday to do a better deal with Brussels in less than 99 days, \"because the British people have had enough of waiting.\" \"I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see... never mind the backstop, the buck stops here,\" Johnson said, referring to an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But, given that the EU says it isn't interested in reopening the Withdrawal Agreement -- the deal that May signed with the bloc in 2018 but has been repeatedly rejected in Parliament, Johnson has his work cut out.CNN's Kara Fox and Rob Picheta contributed to this report.",

Widespread alerts warning of medium or high temperatures have been issued across many countries in Western, Central and even northeastern Europe.Weather forecasters in the UK say the country will sizzle this week in a heat wave that could set a new record for hottest day. Temperatures will peak on Thursday, when the mercury could reach a sweltering 39 Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit), according to the UK's national weather service, the Met Office. The hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK is 38.5 C (101.3 F), recorded in Faversham, south east England, in August 2003, according to the Met Office.It's looking likely that we could reach 39\u00b0C somewhere in southern and eastern England on Thursday.

Read More\"The Met Office must do more to warn people about the dangers of heat waves and should give names to heat waves the way it does for winter storms,\" the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science said Tuesday.Many flocked to the beach to cool down in Brighton, southern England on Tuesday. The institute cited data from Public Health England to highlight an estimated 863 \"excess deaths\" as a result of three heat wave events last summer, which was the hottest on record in England. \"Far more people in the UK have died from recent heat waves than from storms, so it should be uncontroversial to start applying names to both,\" said Bob Ward, the institute's director of policy.He added: \"The Government and its agencies, including the Met Office, must lead the way in communicating the growing dangers of heat waves and other impacts of climate change, so that the British public are better informed and can protect themselves.\"\"If the Government does not lead on this issue, it also risks encouraging the media to continue to underplay these risks in their coverage, and there will continue to be preventable deaths,\" Ward cautioned.

Amid the rising temperatures, London's Metropolitan Police said Wednesday that it had recovered the body of a man who had vanished while swimming with friends in the River Thames in London on Tuesday. Searches were continuing Wednesday for two others who disappeared from sight in other parts of the Thames while swimming Tuesday evening.Over in France, it's set to be even hotter, with meteorologists predicting the heat wave to reach its peak Thursday, with temperatures of 42 C (107.6 F) expected in Paris. On Tuesday, temperatures reached at 41.2 C in the southwestern city of Bordeaux, a record for the city.People sunbathe and cool off in the Trocadero Fountains in Paris on Tuesday.

A red alert -- the highest level -- has been issued in 20 of the divisions; the other 60 are currently on an orange alert -- the second-highest warning level. \"We wanted to alert everyone, and no one is without risk,\" French Minister of Health Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said. \"Common sense must prevail, everyone must feel assured by the red level that this will affect all 20 regions. It is a health alert for all citizens.\"Buzyn said the government is also encouraging businesses to allow staff to work from home during the heat wave.Temperatures of 42 C are expected in Paris on Thursday.French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu earlier called for awareness of the high risk of drowning. More than 40 drowning deaths were registered during the week of the first heatwave peak at the end of June -- an unusually high number \"closely related to heat waves.\"The extreme heat also forced the EDF electricity company to shut down two nuclear reactors in southwest France after they exceeded the heat threshold, according to a company spokesperson.\"We do very thorough studies for the environment and we do not want to damage the fauna and flora. It is a precautionary principle,\" an EDF spokesperson said. \"There are large margins to avoid risk.\"A dry part of the bed of the River Loire at Montjean-sur-Loire, western France on Wednesday.France recorded its highest-ever temperature earlier this year on June 29, with a sweltering 45.9\u00b0C (114.62 F) in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the southern department of Gard.Notre Dame's chief architect told Reuters on Wednesday that the record-breaking heat wave could jeopardize the cathedral's vaulted ceiling, which was ravaged by a fire in April.Meanwhile in Italy, the country's Health Ministry put 15 zones on high alert as Europe battles its second extreme heat wave of the summer.

We expect the heat to remain stable until this Friday and heat is expected to increase a bit,\" a spokesperson from Italy's weather service said, \"(On) Saturday and Sunday it is expected to cool down.\"Further north, Belgium endured its hottest day ever, with temperatures rising to 102\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), the highest ever recorded in the country, according to the national weather service. The record-breaking temperature was reported in Diepenbeek, in the eastern province of Limburg.

        "content": "(CNN)A vicious heat wave has been baking Europe and its timing could not be any worse for riders in the Tour de France. Each summer, the bicycle race takes over the entire country, with nearly 200 cyclists hurtling to the finish line. They ride for 23 days, a brutal affair for even the most prepared athletes. More than 20 teams have to make it through the 21 stages of the race. But the continent is in the midst of a record heat wave that surely only makes it more difficult to bike thousands of miles in what's essentially a sweltering oven. Some cyclists are strapping on ice vests before the start of each race, while others are consuming atypical amounts of water just to stay standing; the risks of heatstroke and other related injuries are high, and the asphalt may as well be the bottom of a frying pan.

The heat is so bad, some riders asked for something to be done. \"I don't think this is healthy. Maybe the organization has to do something when the temperatures are so extremely high,\" the Netherlands' Steven Kruijswijk told VeloNews.Salvation may come in the next few days as the riders cross the mountainous terrain of the Alps. Temperatures are likely to be cooler there, and the competitors may even get a few scattered showers. But as the heat creeps into the mountains, it will probably still be 10 degrees hotter than normal. Add the rocky, steep terrain they'll be cycling through, and the the elevated temperatures may nudge toward unbearable.",

        "content": "(CNN)When Gareth Bale arrived at Real Madrid in September 2013, for a then-world record fee, it looked to be a match made in heaven.The forward was regarded as the next Galactico, the player to help Real through a golden period in the club's history and the man who would eventually fill Cristiano Ronaldo's shoes.Bale has lived up to most of the lofty expectations heaped upon him, winning four Champions Leagues, a La Liga title, and the Copa del Rey.But after six trophy-filled years in Spain, the 30-year-old is now being treated as a costly irritant: booed by his club's own fans and unwanted by his manager. READ: Guardiola hits back at Chinese media criticisms Read MoreREAD: Bale appears close to leaving Real How did it all get so ugly and what next for a winger who was once the world's most expensive player? During his first season in Spain, the Welshman scored the winning goals in the Champions League and Copa del Rey finals, the latter a stunning individual effort that displayed the pace, power and skill that had convinced Real to part with $120 million. In 2018 he scored what is widely regarded as the greatest goal in a Champions League final as he came off the bench to down Liverpool. But fast forward to the present day and Real boss Zinedine Zidane -- back for his second spell in charge -- is having to deny accusations of disrespect from Bale's agent, who took umbrage with the Frenchman saying: \"We hope he leaves soon. It would be best for everyone.\"Bale didn't feature in Sunday's 3-1 pre-season defeat to Bayern Munich, though Zidane says that was the Welshman's decision. The relationship between player and manager appears to have broken down. Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring a stunning solo goal to win the Copa del Rey final.\"I have not disrespected anyone,\" the Real Madrid coach told reporters ahead of Tuesday's match against Arsenal in Washington. \"The club is dealing with his departure. Period.\"The other day [against Bayern], Gareth didn't play because he didn't want to. He said the club was trying to negotiate his departure, and he didn't want to play because of that.\"Bale hasn't asked not to play tomorrow [Wednesday] ... so far. His situation is known by everyone and will not change. The club is going to do what they have to do with him.\"Bale came off the bench against Arsenal and scored to help Real Madrid come back from 2-0 to earn a draw, before missing a penalty in his team's victorious penalty shootout.\"He put in a good performance and I'm pleased for him,\" Zidane said. \"He played today, he wanted to and he did a good job. He wanted to be with us today, he trained normally and played the match. \"I make the decisions and he played one half. We'll have to see what happens. He's still here with us at this stage. \"Nothing has changed, you know the situation,\" he added.Club legend?Had Bale performed as he has done for the past six years at any other club, he would be revered as a legend -- but this is Real Madrid and its fans have earned a reputation.When the going gets tough, the fans stop going -- or start booing.By the end of 2018 -- during the first somewhat barren spell this club had endured in the last seven years -- average attendances at the Bernabeu dwindled to 62,000, leaving almost 20,000 empty seats.Gareth Bale's relationship with manager Zinedine Zidane has reportedly deteriorated.That Bale is set to depart Real to no great eulogy or grand farewell from either fans of manager should perhaps come as no surprise, either. After all, Real fans whistled at goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Madrid born and bred, towards the end of his 25-year association with the club. Casillas had won every trophy there was to win -- three Champions Leagues, five league titles, a World Cup -- he was the club's captain and had made 725 appearances for his boyhood team, but aged 34 he departed with the relationship between him and Real soured. And these are the fans who once whistled at Ronaldo; the club's record goalscorer, the most successful player in the club's history. Bale has also been criticized for his love of golf. Reports emerged in some media outlets last season that the Cardiff-born star plays too much, does not mix with his teammates and goes to bed early. As far as crimes committed by professional athletes go, playing golf and early nights are not exactly up there.But the fans' frustration with his lengthy absences in recent seasons because of injuries is understandable. Muscle complaints have largely prevented Bale from filling the void left by Ronaldo, after the Portugal star departed for Juventus last summer. Indeed, the winger has been injured so much during his time in Spain that last year some members of the Spanish media gave him the moniker \"Mr Glass.\"Though he made 29 league appearances for Real last season, he was mainly on the substitutes' bench towards the end of the campaign and did not join his teammates for the end-of-season lap of honor at the Bernabeu. Gareth Bale came off the bench against Liverpool to score the winning goal in the 2018 Champions League final.Where next?But it's impossible to deny that Bale's time at Real has been anything other than a success. Only Ronaldo has more Champions League titles than the Welshman -- Zidane won the competition once during his illustrious playing career.In his time at the Spanish club, Bale has collected 14 major trophies and his 102 goals and 65 assists in 231 matches -- 0.72 goals or assists every game -- is undeniably impressive. Bale has made more Real appearances and scored more goals for the Spanish giants than Zidane, whose playing career at Real was deemed a huge success. The former Tottenham star has undoubtedly produced for Real on the big occasions -- Alfredo di Stefano, Ferenc Puskas and Ronaldo are the only players to have scored more goals in European Cup finals. No British player has won more major titles or scored more top-flight goals abroad but, despite the statistics and the successes, Bale finds himself at a crossroads. Gareth Bale will likely be playing his football away from the Bernabeu in the new season.The player's agent told Sky Sports News Tuesday that his player will not move on loan. \"There will be no makeshift deals to get him out of the club. Gareth is one of the best players on the planet. I can guarantee you he will not be going on loan to any club,\" said Jonathan Barnett. With three years remaining on his reported $18.7 million per year contract, Europe's top clubs will perhaps be unwilling to take that risk on an injury-prone 30-year-old, which is why he has been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League. The transfer window in China closes next Wednesday and Bale will reportedly have offers of wages totaling more than $1 million per week should he choose to move to Asia. It feels like an undeserving and underwhelming way for the career of a Real legend to peter out, but such is the circle of life at one of the world's most ruthless and successful clubs.",

Turnout was 87.4% with Johnson taking 66% of votes. \"Today the campaign is over and the work begins,\" Johnson said in a speech immediately after the results were announced Tuesday. New Conservative Party leader and incoming Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, addresses party members Tuesday. Turning his attention to Brexit, Johnson said that he read in the Financial Times newspaper that no new leader has ever faced such a daunting set of circumstances. \"Do you feel daunted?\" he asks the crowd. \"You don't look daunted to me.\"Read MoreLeaders reactUS President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Johnson in a tweet, saying: \"He will be great!\"Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He will be great!\u2014 Donald J.

They call him Britain Trump and people are saying that's a good thing. They like me over there. That's what they wanted. That's what they need. He'll get it done. Boris is good. He's gonna do a good job,\" Trump said.The US President then announced that Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was in the audience, saying: \"I know he's going to work well with Boris. They're going to do some tremendous things.\"Johnson's father Stanley told CNN that he thinks his son will get along with Trump -- but warned that the relationship cannot be subservient.\"They have the same hairstyle,\" he said of the leaders.\"We're going to have to be careful not to be too slavishly geared to America,\" Stanley added, insisting that \"building bridges\" with Europe after Brexit will also be crucial.Outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May -- who Johnson has long been a critic of -- tweeted her congratulations to the new party leader, promising him her \"full support.\"Likewise, Johnson said in his acceptance speech that it had been a \"privilege\" to serve in May's cabinet. Johnson also vowed during his speech to defeat Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The opposition leader in turn tweeted that Johnson may have won the support of the Conservative Party, \"but he hasn't won the support of our country.\"Boris Johnson has won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members by promising tax cuts for the richest, presenting himself as the bankers' friend, and pushing for a damaging No Deal Brexit.But he hasn't won the support of our country.\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) July 23, 2019\n\nTop of Johnson's agenda as new prime minister will be resolving the Brexit deadlock, where his predecessor failed. The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted that he was looking forward to \"working constructively\" with the new leader. Johnson inherits divided UKThe leadership vote was triggered after an embattled May was forced into resigning after losing the support of her cabinet, many of whom were fed up with her\u00a0inability to secure the UK's departure from the European Union (EU).As prime minister, Johnson, 55, will inherit the same problems of a deeply divided Parliament -- and nation -- when he assumes the role. Throughout his leadership campaign, Johnson was vocal about his willingness to exit the EU without a deal, pledging to leave \"do or die\" on October 31, the latest deadline for the UK to depart the bloc. Jeremy Hunt (left) congratulates Boris Johnson after the announcement of the result on July 23.He said that he'd be\u00a0willing to force Brexit\u00a0through on that date by suspending Parliament, if he's unable to negotiate a new exit deal with EU officials. The EU has said there is no chance of reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, the deal that May made with the bloc in 2018 but which has failed to satisfy both the Europhile and Euroskeptic wings of both the Tory party and Parliament. While Johnson's stance on Brexit have defined his leadership bid, his incendiary remarks on religion and race have sparked criticism about his character.  Writing in his weekly column in the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph last August, he\u00a0likened Muslim women wearing veils to \"letter boxes\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"bank robbers.\"Boris Johnson, the divisive Brexit-backing populist or the charming liberal metropolitan? UK has no idea which leader it'll getEarlier this month, he faced new accusations of Islamophobia\u00a0after claiming in a newly-unearthed 2007 text that Islam left Muslim countries \"centuries behind\" the Western world.Previously, Johnson called people from the British Commonwealth\u00a0\"flag-waving piccaninnies,\"\u00a0referred to the\u00a0\"watermelon smiles\"\u00a0of people from the Congo, and suggested that former US President Barack Obama\u00a0held an \"ancestral dislike of the British Empire\"\u00a0because he was \"part-Kenyan.\"And, as foreign secretary, erroneous comments he made about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe -- a British-Iranian charity worker who was arrested on spying charges in Iran more than three years ago and remains detained -- could have damaged her case. ResignationsDuring the 2016 campaign for Britain to leave the EU, Johnson was accused of lying to the public by stating that the country's membership of the bloc cost \u00a3350 million ($442 million) a week.That controversial claim was plastered on the side of a bus that toured the UK prior to the vote that resulted in a 52-48% result in favor of Brexit. Johnson's hardline stance led to Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan resigning on Monday -- and it is expected to trigger several more resignations in the coming days. UK will plunge into recession if it leaves Europe without a Brexit deal\"It is tragic that just when we could have been the dominant intellectual and political force throughout Europe, and beyond, we have had to spend every day working beneath the dark cloud of Brexit,\" Duncan said in his resignation letter. Rory Stewart, the UK international development secretary who made a high-profile but unsuccessful bid to lead the Conservative Party, also reiterated on Monday that he would resign rather than serve under Johnson's leadership.And last week, both the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and Justice Secretary David Gauke confirmed they will step down before Johnson becomes prime minister.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson's sister once said that as a child, he wanted to be \"World King\" when he grew up. Now one of the most divisive politicians of his generation has fulfilled one lifelong dream and will become the United Kingdom's prime minister on Wednesday. The governing Conservative party announced the result of its leadership contest Tuesday and -- in what many believed was a foregone conclusion -- his opponent, Jeremy Hunt, failed to turn around the Johnson juggernaut. The crucial question being asked in the UK, at a critical moment in the nation's history, is what exactly drives this man? The best way to answer this is to understand exactly why he is so divisive. Boris Johnson will be UK's new Prime MinisterFirst, there's his personal style. Johnson's chaotic way of doing politics offends as much as it enthralls. He has a history of making seemingly thoughtless comments, such as saying that women who wear Islamic face veils look \"like letterboxes\" or calling people from the British Commonwealth \"flag-waving piccaninnies\" with \"watermelon smiles.\" Read MoreNicky Morgan, a Conservative Member of Parliament and former Cabinet minister, sees how this could be a hindrance for Johnson when he takes office and has to face an electorate beyond his own party. \"I think he recognizes now that what he says causes a reaction,\" says Morgan. \"He will still be asked about comments he's made in the past and he probably wants to move on. But the fact is in today's era, it's hard to move on.\"But he can also be charming and makes great efforts to win people over -- especially in person. Harry Mount, a journalist who used to edit Johnson's columns when he was a star writer at the Daily Telegraph, explains that Johnson is \"great at making you feel good in public.\" Despite not having worked together for more than a decade and never really having been his boss, Mount says that to this day, Johnson \"greets me with a 'cripes, it's my boss,' which is flattering for me as strangers think 'the bald guy must be powerful.'\"Boris Johnson launches his Conservative Party leadership campaign in June 2019.Hero of the BrexiteersThis ability to flatter and make others feel liked goes some way to explaining how Johnson managed to win two terms as mayor in London, where voters historically tilt toward the UK's center-left Labour party. Second, there's his politics -- and his political ambition. Johnson played the decisive role in making Brexit happen. In 2016, under immense pressure from the then-prime minister David Cameron to back the Remain campaign, Johnson broke ranks and backed Brexit at the last minute. This has made him the hero of the Brexiteers. \"Boris has that undefinable quality of leadership. He can persuade people to back him and go in a direction that they may not have initially supported,\" says Jacob Rees-Mogg, a longstanding Euroskeptic and Johnson supporter. \"Only someone with his kind of optimism can get people behind Brexit.\"But others think that Johnson's decision to lead the Brexit campaign was nothing more than a deliberate political move. Morgan, a Remain supporter, explains that the suspicion among some is Johnson \"did this knowing that it would potentially, eventually, burnish his leadership credentials.\"It's no secret that ending up in high office was always Johnson's aim. Mount says \"it was always clear that he saw journalism as a ringside seat for the main contest, which he wanted to star in.\"JUST WATCHEDNew-look Boris Johnson emerges as Tory frontrunnerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew-look Boris Johnson emerges as Tory frontrunner 02:51'Doesn't do boring'It's this naked ambition that brings us to the third and most important reason that Johnson divides opinion: his personal qualities, morality and suitability to do the job. \"The truth about Boris is that he works extremely hard. He gets up at 5 a.m., devours newspapers and would be on the phone by 6:30 a.m. wanting to discuss the day,\" says Guto Harri, who served as Johnson's director of communications while he was London mayor. \"His approach is very much like a journalist. He cuts to the chase very quickly, spotting the relevant detail and seeing the wood from the trees.\"This is not a characterization that Simon Heffer, under whom Johnson worked at the Telegraph, agrees with. \"He's utterly selfish, completely oblivious to the sensitivities and needs of others and entirely unprofessional,\" Heffer recalls. \"We saw this when he was mayor and he needed numerous deputies because either he was too lazy, not capable, or couldn't be bothered with the detail of what was required to do the job properly.\" There are no shortage of stories about Boris Johnson's personal life.Two very different views of the same person. However, it's entirely possible that both are true. \"It's wrong to say he has a short attention span or that he's lazy. Give him a difficult bit of ancient Greek and he's happy as Larry,\" explains Mount. \"It's the important stuff he finds boring and that will be difficult. He's not going to fall over and hit the nuclear button with his arm. But he does get bored and he doesn't do boring.\"That's the chaotic bit; the altogether more troubling question for some is on the moral values of a man on the precipice of power. There's no shortage of stories about Johnson, from lurid allegations about his personal life, including affairs, to being sacked from an early journalism job for fabricating a quote. Perhaps worst of all, a recording exists of Johnson appearing to be complicit in a plot to have a journalist beaten up. The allegations prompted BBC journalist Eddie Mair to accuse Johnson of being a \"nasty piece of work\" to his face in an interview. In the interview with Mair, Johnson brushed off or dismissed the allegations, though was indirect in his responses. During his time as foreign secretary, Johnson's loose words were used as proof by Iran that jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had engaged in \"propaganda against the regime.\" Johnson later publicly apologized in the House of Commons, saying that his comments should have been clearer.Another example of Johnson's questionable decision-making came earlier this week, when he failed to defend Kim Darroch, the UK's ambassador to Washington, following the leak comments in which Darroch was critical of US President Donald Trump. It has since emerged that Johnson's lack of support prompted Darroch to resign.  \"When you look at the appalling response he gave to the Kim Darroch question, you see how lacking in integrity and leadership he is,\" Heffer says. \"To say Johnson's character is deeply flawed is like saying water is slightly wet. If he becomes prime minister he will be the man most deficient in probity ever to hold the post.\" CNN reached out to Johnson's team for comment multiple times but did not receive a reply. How Johnson may winHow can it be then, that a man so divisive is trouncing his rival so spectacularly? One word: Brexit. The UK has been stuck in its Brexit crisis for over three years now. Jacob Rees-Mogg blames this failure on a government that has been dominated by people whom he suspects never really wanted to leave the EU. \"To deliver Brexit needs a Brexiteer,\" Rees-Mogg explains. \"There are two approaches. One is that Brexit is a problem to be managed. Then there's the Boris approach, which is that Brexit is a huge opportunity.\"The single biggest reason Brexit hasn't happened yet is that the UK's political class can't decide what it wants. The Withdrawal Agreement -- commonly called May's Brexit deal -- failed to satisfy both the Europhile and Euroskeptic wings of not only the Conservatives, but across the lawmakers that sit in the UK's House of Commons, who need to ratify any deal with Europe. Given that May has been governing without a parliamentary majority since the 2017 election, this lack of consensus meant that, without a compromise from Brussels or buying off opposition votes, May's deal was always doomed.Boris Johnson and rival Jeremy Hunt during a televised leadership debate.That very same fate could await Johnson. 'Keen young puppy dog'Johnson's pledge to take the UK out of the EU on October 31 \"do or die\" has excited Brexiteers. His pledge to threaten Brussels with walking away without a deal and withhold the nearly $50 billion the UK owes Europe, unless Europe agrees to renegotiate May's deal, is catnip to a certain type of Conservative. His supporters sincerely believe that this approach will work. \"Like Reagan, Boris has a positive view of governing. If you think that things can be achieved then you are likely to try them and you are likely to inspire people that it's worth striving for,\" says Rees-Mogg. \"If you look at the great political leaders, they have always been optimists. The ones who don't work are the gloom buckets like poor old Gordon Brown [the former Labour prime minister, who lost the 2010 election].\"But the problem Johnson faces isn't just uniting people in his own party, nor across the country. There are, of course 27 other EU member states, all of whom have a say on Brexit. \"In Brussels, Boris is seen as the anti-Christ,\" says a European diplomatic source. It's not just because of his pro-Brexit, anti-EU rhetoric. Johnson used to work as a journalist in Brussels, where he made few friends. Bill Newton Dunn, a Liberal who has sat in the European Parliament since 1979, recalls: \"My memory is that he was a very keen young puppy dog, eager to please. He wanted to get stories or embellish them to try to get ahead. He was less bothered with the truth.\"The stories Dunn refers to include such hits as the EU wanting to ban curvy bananas or claims that an EU official was so well remunerated, he could afford to live in a chateau on the outskirts of Brussels. All tremendous fun and all painting a picture of a lavish, interfering European superstate. If only either story were 100% accurate, rather than embellishments on grains of truth. JUST WATCHEDHere's what you need to know about BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHere's what you need to know about Brexit 03:38Jean Quatremer, a French journalist who overlapped with Johnson in Brussels, has written that Johnson invented an entire genre of journalism, commonly referred to as \"euromyths\". The manner in which Johnson campaigned for Brexit was not a million miles from the euromyth style: who can forget the extraordinary -- and false -- claim that the UK was sending \u00a3350 million ($439 million) a week to Brussels?  Ever since May's Brexit deal was voted down for the third and final time on March 29, officials in Brussels have made clear they no longer see the UK as a reliable negotiating partner. That's unlikely to change. Come October, some in Brussels think Johnson will desperately try to avoid no deal and attempt to sell a repackaged Withdrawal Agreement to his hardline Brexiteers. \"Does Boris, a man who has spent his entire career getting ready for this moment, want to be the shortest-serving prime minister in history? Because that's what will happen if he drags the UK off a cliff,\" says one EU source.The futureAll of this raises the most important question for the residents of the UK: what will a Johnson premiership actually look like?He enters office at a time when politics is fluid. It's not just the Brexiteers who have their tails up. People who have been campaigning to scrap Brexit ever since 2016 are more confident than ever that it can now be stopped. JUST WATCHEDTrump: May's probably a better negotiator than meReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump: May's probably a better negotiator than me 00:56When you consider that his own party has mixed views on Johnson, the 48% of people who voted remain are even more worried about PM Johnson.Hugo Dixon, a Remainer who  happens to be one of Johnson's oldest friends, shares this concern. \"Starting with a bit of ambition is fine, but it has to be with the aim of doing something good. And my worry with Boris is that he is heading down a path that is bad for the country.\" Dixon will not be alone in this view, either in the Commons or in the country at large. And if Johnson fails to reconcile both, his days in office could be numbered from day one. One of the great unknowns is which version of Johnson emerge as PM -- the liberal London mayor or the post-Brexit populist. For a man who has for so long lived in the spotlight, we have very little idea of what goes on underneath his blond mop of hair.Who forced the UK ambassador to resign?The reality might be that Johnson's fate, ultimately, is not in his own hands. If he is to take the UK out of the EU on October 31 with a new deal, then he has about two months to convince Brussels it needs to renegotiate something that took two years to agree. If he tries to take the UK out without a deal, he might find that political gravity takes over as parliament does everything it can to stop it. And, should Johnson push hard enough, he might find that members of his own party are willing to bring down his government and force a general election. Whatever happens, it's going to be a steep learning curve for the boy who always wanted the top job. If it goes right, he will be the man who united the country and delivered Brexit. If he gets it wrong, he might be ousted from office in a matter of months, making him an even shorter-serving leader than that poor old \"gloom bucket,\" Gordon Brown.",

Jones fights in the UFC. CNN reached out to UFC, but the organization declined to comment.Read MoreCourt records show a criminal complaint was filed on May 23 and Albuquerque police sent a letter to Jones, but it was returned in June.

The woman said Jones eventually pulled her onto his lap and began kissing her neck, according to the summons.At this point, the summons says the woman \"did not know if Jon Jones was committing a crime by kissing on her neck and did not know what to do.\" The summons says later that night the woman said Jones was waiting for some drinks and put her in a chokehold. The summons goes on to say Jones started \"roughhousing\" with the woman and picked her up, holding her in the air. The summons said the woman \"did not know how to feel, but felt it was like a wrestling match and nothing sexual.\" The woman told the officer she did not like that she was held in the air for a long time. The woman told the officer Jones placed her down by the bar and slapped her in the genital area and continued to touch her until he left the strip club. In the summons, the officer wrote that the woman became frantic in telling the story. \"l just don't want to deal with this person,\" she said. \"The whole situation is so complicated and I'm not really sure what to say and this person gets away with f*g everything.\" 'I'm definitely not in any trouble' Jones reacted to the accusations and charges on social media Monday.\"I'm definitely not in any trouble my friend, don't be so quick to believe everything you read on the Internet,\" he said on Twitter in response to someone saying he was in trouble again.

In 2015, he was stripped of his light-heavyweight championship and suspended indefinitely after turning himself in for a hit-and-run. He later pled guilty to leaving the scene of accident and was sentenced to 18 months probation.That same year in January, Jones tested positive for cocaine in a test administered by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Because the test was done out of competition, the commission could not punish him. The UFC fined him $250,000 and he entered a drug rehabilitation center but left the facility after one day of treatment. In July 2016, Jones was dropped from a headline bout after a \"potential anti-doping violation,\" according to the UFC. He was later suspended by the United States Anti-Doping Agency for one year after it was revealed that he had tested positive for two banned substances. The doping agency conducts the UFC's drug testing program.The anti-doping agency suspended Jones a second time for 15 months between July 2017 and October 2018 after he tested positive for an anabolic steroid. Jones became the youngest UFC champion when he claimed the light-heavyweight title in 2011 at the age of 23. He has since been one of the UFC's biggest stars who helped propel mixed martial arts into the American mainstream.The fighter is 25-1-0 currently, winning his most recent bout on July 6 against Thiago Santos, according to the UFC.CNN's Chris Boyette, Amanda Watts and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)For a brief moment, it felt like time had stopped in the summer of 1999. On a sweltering Californian day, a stadium of over 90,000 fans stood silent and still, rooted by anxiety, as Brandi Chastain prepared to take a penalty kick that could secure the Women's World Cup for her country. The right-footer had been instructed by her coach to strike with her left, even though she had never attempted a penalty kick with her weaker foot. Spectators gasped in unison before breaking into a roar.Chastain scores. The U.S. players stampede towards their goalscoring hero who is embarking on what would become one of the most iconic celebrations in sports history. She rips off her shirt, whips it around and over her head before falling to her knees. It is a fitting conclusion to the final Women's World Cup of the 20th century and, in that moment, the United States Women's National Team (USWNT) realign the stars for women's soccer. Follow @cnnsport\n\nChastain celebrates after scoring in a shoot-out in the final of the Women's World CupRead MoreNever before had a crowd of such size gathered for a women's sporting event and a  better ending could not have been scripted, nor a better cast of pioneers selected, to win the hearts and minds of the estimated 40 million people watching in the US alone.New heights were reached, records broken, and a legacy created. Twenty years on and the impact of the squad fondly referred to as the \"99ers\" can still be felt. Their legacy lives on in the current generation of females playing at all levels around the world.The \"99ers\" made great advances for female athletes around the world and are remembered as one of the best sports teams in history. This is their story. READ: How Bob Marley's daughter saved Jamaican women's soccerREAD: The female footballers fighting for change in South AmericaGreat athletes but not good soccer playersIn the late 1990s, women's soccer was in its formative years, evident through lack of resources and media coverage. Formed in 1985, the national team participated in its first tournament in Italy -- against the host country, England and Denmark -- but the concept of national pride didn't immediately resonate with the players. Michelle Akers, the force in the \"99ers\" midfield, recalls the-then coach yelling at the team, saying: \"You guys don't get it! This is your national team.\"\n\nIf we weren't already the best -- we were going to be the best\nMichelle Akers\n\"I didn't really get it until we got our asses kicked by the other countries ... They'd grown up with the game, obviously it's embedded in their culture,\" Akers, who struggled with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome during the final 10 years of her career, tells CNN Sport. \"We were great athletes, but not necessarily good soccer players.\" In 1986 Anson Dorrance, the head coach of the University of North Carolina, took over as national team coach and instilled a philosophy that the USWNT abides by to this day. \"Anson Dorrance had a dream and a vision that the US could be the best in the world,\" Akers explains. \"He shared that with us and planted that seed in our dreams and vision of what we were trying to achieve and who we could be as a team and as players.\"Michelle Akers-Stahl (C), Julie Foudy (L) and Carin Jennings (R) celebrate winning the first Women's World Cup held in 1991.The next generation needed to be given its chance to develop and blossom together. That's when teenagers Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, and Julie Foudy were invited to a training camp and selected ahead of more experienced players. \"I was with some of the original players, they were really good players, and when they weren't on this next team they were pissed,\" Akers, a two-time World Cup champion and winner of the Golden Boot in 1991, admits. \"It was upsetting ... because they were better than the younger players on that day. But in two years they would be done, and these youngsters would be dominating.\"I was just focusing on us and what we had to do. I always looked at it as if we weren't already the best -- we were going to be the best.\"Visit CNN Sport for more news and videosA team like no other Over the next 10 years the team became a world force, winning the inaugural 1991 Women's World Cup in China and Olympic gold five years later on home soil.A crowd of 76,481 supporters had gathered in Athens, Georgia, for the first women's football gold-medal match in Olympic history -- setting the team's first worldwide attendance record for most spectators to watch a female sporting event. With success came recognition. Eventually. Despite the turnout, none of the team's Olympic matches had been broadcast live on national television. FIFA, the sport's governing body,  took note and decided to harness spectator momentum by marketing the team in a way that attracted sponsors and pushed ticket sales for the 1999 World Cup.  \n\nEverything I did was to make us better and to make our sport better\nMia Hamm\nIn Mia Hamm, the world's leading scorer, the team had a \"reluctant superstar.\" Emphasizing the squad's new-found place in popular culture, the striker was the inspiration behind the 'Soccer Teresa' doll, launched by Mattel for that home World Cup. \"I remember Anson Dorrance always saying every time we stepped on the field we were selling our game. We wanted to win and we wanted to win attractively,\" Hamm says.  Her intensity on the field was matched only by her humility off it, she explains, \"Everything I did was to make us better and to make our sport better.Hamm scored 158 goals in 276 appearances for the U.S. \"But we also wanted to get into a street fight and stand toe-to-toe with the toughest to put the ball in the back of the net. All the things we really felt represent the American spirit, we wanted our team to represent.\"By the start of the 1999 Women's World Cup, strong bonds had been formed. Not only were the \"99ers\" a talented team but a close one, too, and the team's spirit resonated with the country's large female fanbase. \"We had this sense of empowerment and purpose that enabled us to go out there and play freely,\" says Hamm. \"We talked about enjoying not only where we were but the journey to get there.\" Kristine Lilly, the quiet left-footed leader of the pack, regards 1999 as an amazing year \"not just because we won,\" she says, but because of who her teammates were. \"That team was so special because we all knew our role,\" says Lilly. Julie Foudy, the team's energetic co-captain and self-designated videographer, was the embodiment of a selfless leader and echoes Lilly's sentiments. \"We were so lucky with our group,\" Foudy, now an analyst and reporter for ESPN and author of \"Choose to Matter: Being Courageously and Fabulously You,\" states. \"When Mia Hamm is your superstar and she is the most selfless, humble and grounded person that never wants to take credit for anything, it's easy to have an awesome group of women come together.\"Foudy films her teammates at Stanford Stadium. Tisha Venturini, the soul of the sidelines, says her role as substitute was difficult to adapt to but knew that supporting her teammates from the dugout was crucial to the well-being of the team. Deeming herself the \"leader of the bench,\" she kept the reserves positive and motivated. \"It wasn't easy when you don't get to be out there playing the whole time,\" Venturini says. \"But you're still an important piece to the puzzle and you're still a part of the team.\"A lot of times the scorer would run straight over to the bench, which says a lot when Mia scores her first goal and sprints to the sidelines to be with everybody else.\"Pioneers of the gameBoth on and off the pitch, the \"99ers\" showed the world what female athletes were capable of and, by default, what women were capable of. They were selfless, authentic and determined to make a difference. Beating China in the final -- a team which the US had overcome to win gold at the 1996 Olympics -- was about more than winning. With the match scoreless after extra-time, both teams had to endure a nervy penalty shootout before 90,185 fans packed into the Rose Bowl stadium, which remains a record attendance for a women's sporting event.Briana Scurry saved the third penalty kick to give the US the lead. What started as an unwavering desire to win and regain a title the U.S. had last won in 1991, says the goalkeeper, snowballed into something more meaningful, more far-reaching. \"We figured that through the game of soccer and through a victory we could really bring the sport to a whole new level,\" the double Olympic gold medalist says.Scurry (L) stops a penalty kick by Liu Ying in the 1999 final. \"I knew we were going to win after that [third] save. I didn't know how or how dramatic it was going to be, but I knew we were going to win it and that would mean so many things for women's soccer, for women in general and for the game all over the world and the United States.\"The U.S. would win the penalty shootout 5-4, sparking wild celebrations. Among the fans in the stadium was President Bill Clinton, who congratulated the team in their locker room after the game and hosted them the following week at the White House. \"It's going to have a bigger impact than people ever realize, and it will have a far-reaching impact not only in the United States but also in other countries,\" said President Clinton at the time. US President Bill Clinton (L), First Lady Hillary Clinton (C) and daughter Chelsea Clinton with members of the U.S. Women's soccer team in the locker room.Co-captain Foudy admits: \"I would be lying if I said it was never about winning. It was about winning. It mattered if we were on top of the podium of course. We were competitive athletes.\"But there was always this sense of the bigger picture. Could we start a movement to inspire young girls to play? Could we get the world watching women play soccer, and women's sports in general, not just women's soccer? So that bigger picture always loomed.\"Scurry says the greatest gift for her has been people coming up and telling her where they were during that final match. \"To be able to change the trajectory of a complete stranger's life for the better -- I don't think there's any other gift you could actually ask for as a professional athlete,\" Scurry says. \"There's nothing better than that.\" More than a teamWhat do pioneers do after conquering their sport? In truth, more than most. \"I'm a World Cup champion, Olympic gold medalist, former US Women's National Team member, author, and mom?\" Lilly laughs as she struggles to come up with a comprehensive title for herself. \"Oh yeah and co-founder of Team First Soccer Academy.\" In 2010, Lilly, Venturini and Hamm started a youth soccer camp called Team First Soccer Academy. Even in retirement, each member of the team has continued to progress the women's game. \n\nLife is never the same without that group. It's just different now. I miss them\nKristine Lilly\nWith 354 international appearances, Lilly is still the most capped female player in history. During her 23 years in the first team, the former forward experienced at first-hand the various stages of development the national team went through.  She has written a book called \"Powerhouse\" which she hopes, she says, will show people \"the greatness of my teammates and why we were so successful.\"\"Life is never the same without that group. And what we did together was so amazing,\" Lilly says. \"It's just different now. I miss them.\" As well as being one of the first African-American professional female soccer players, Scurry was also one of the first openly gay professional soccer players and has campaigned for gender equality. She has been a voice in the battle over wage-discrimination, and an advocate for brain injury awareness after experiencing career-ending concussion. \"Even though we're not playing anymore, we want to do everything we can to advance the game,\" Scurry says. Lilly is still the most capped female player in history. Akers, meanwhile, runs a horse rescue shelter in Georgia and conducts youth soccer camps where the kids can interact with the animals. \"It's more about the life experience that you're getting from being involved in soccer -- and connecting the kids to the animals changes their lives,\" Akers says. \"What's most important is for them to walk away and know that number one, they matter. Both of them matter.\"Last April, U.S. Soccer hosted its first reunion for the squad. All but two of the \"99ers\" attended and were celebrated during half-time of the women's international match between the US and Belgium in Los Angeles.A video honoring their epic win played on a large screen for the entire stadium to see. Overcome with excitement, the history-makers hugged Chastain when the winning penalty was shown. \"It was so amazing -- we were laughing, making fun of each other, just like we hadn't left,\" Lilly recalls. \"That to me shows how strong a team we were because it's continued through that time even though we've been apart from each other.\" Members of the 1999 Women's World Cup-winning team pose for a photo at halftime of a game between U.S. Women and Belgian Women at Banc of California Stadium on April 07, 2019 in LA. Continuing the fight for equality Current members of the U.S. team have said they are grateful for the vision and leadership the \"99ers\" provided. Though the women's game has grown over the past 20 years, the \"99ers\" all agree it has a way to go before the sport can be deemed truly equal. \"The women right now are very visible in the equal pay for equal play movement -- we've always been visible,\" Scurry says. \"It wasn't called that back then, but we were the ones that started making a stand for equal pay. When the women's national team is making similar to the men's national team, then we'll be where we should be.\"Alex Morgan (left) and Megan Rapinoe are two of the members who filled a lawsuit against US Soccer in March. Twenty-eight members on the current U.S. Women's Team filed a class-action lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation in March of this year, just months before the start of the tournament the U.S. hopes to successfully defend, alleging that the federation imposes gender discrimination by paying the women less than the members of the men's national team.Asked if the women's team today had to deal with the same issues as 20 years ago, Foudy jokes that the travel conditions are a lot better these days at least. \"These women aren't flying middle seats in the coach section all the way down the plane in their matching red sweatshirts. They aren't sitting in front of the smoking section -- because thankfully there are no more smoking sections,\" Foudy says with a chuckle. \"But all these little things they're still fighting for -- it's a different level of course than we had, but they're still fighting for that equality. Marketing support, staffing support -- there's a lot of layers to it.\"Has the progress made been too slow?  \"I think it's come a long way, but it's also taken so long. It's a progression,\" says Lilly. \"We were playing in the early '90s, late '80s when we didn't know we had the opportunity to be paid. Now there's a realization that we should be getting paid and the present team is continuing that fight.\"Carrying the torchMany of the current U.S. squad remember where they were when Chastain scored that penalty kick. Carli Lloyd, the only current player whose career briefly overlapped with a few of the \"99ers,\" described playing with them as a dream come true. \n\nWe owe the \"99ers\" and the other alumni so much. They paved the way for me to get to do this as my job\nSamantha Mewis\n\"They're players I looked up to and had posters of them on my wall and autographs. I watched them play in the '99 World Cup, I watched them all growing up,\" Lloyd says. \"They paved the way. They carved out this path for us and now it's our job to continue to make it better for those that are coming up.\" \"This team is like our babies,\" Foudy says of the current side which is ranked No. 1 in the world. \"We want them to be successful. It wasn't about our success, it was about the sport's success and other girls being inspired by more awesome women.\"Samantha Mewis, one of the newer players on the team, credits the \"99ers\" for the opportunities she has today. \"It means so much to me to be on this team,\" she says. \"We owe the \"99ers\" and the other alumni so much. They paved the way for me to get to do this as my job.\"The \"99 ers\" celebrate their seismic win. The U.S. will compete in its eighth World Cup this summer in France and is aiming to secure a record fourth title. With players such as Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Tobin Heath and others, the team has shown flashes of brilliance and has resembled the tenacity and conviction of the team of 20 years ago. The proverbial torch is in capable hands.",

        "content": "(CNN)An investigation into the Swedish man allegedly involved in a brawl with US rapper A$AP Rocky has been dropped, the man's lawyer, Magnus Stromberg, told CNN on Monday.Stromberg said he had received written confirmation of this from the prosecutor, and while his client is relieved this was not unexpected. \"He has been the subject of an assault, but he has not committed a crime,\" Stromberg added. Slobodan Jovicic, A$AP Rocky's lawyer, talks to media on July 19 following a Stockholm court's decision to extend the rap artist's detention. The Swedish prosecution service also confirmed to CNN that the investigation into the man has been discontinued and he is no longer suspected of any crime. A$AP Rocky was detained on July 3 and is preparing to start his third week behind bars accused of assault after his alleged involvement in the incident in Stockholm on June 30. The rapper's lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, says he was defending himself after being assaulted and that his client is innocent.While Justin Bieber and US President Donald Trump are among the global figures to have called for the release of the 30-year-old rapper, authorities in Sweden say they will not be swayed by international pressure. Read More\"The Swedish judicial system is completely independent and does not take into consideration outside pressure from politicians or others,\" a spokesman for the Swedish prosecution authority told CNN on Sunday. Justin Bieber: I appreciate Trump helping A$AP Rocky, but 'can you also let those kids out of cages?'And, while Trump has offered to personally vouch for the 30-year-old rapper's bail, the bail system does not exist in Sweden.As Dennis Martinsson, a legal expert in Sweden, told CNN: \"If you know the Swedish legal system you know that there is no bail system.\" \"Actually, the Swedish constitution prevents any minister, even the Prime Minister, getting involved, or even saying something about an individual case,\" he added.It will be up to the prosecutor, Daniel Suneson, to decide by 4am ET Thursday whether A$AP Rocky -- whose real name is Rakim Mayers -- should be released, charged or kept in custody for longer. At the heart of the investigation are videos posted by TMZ and others posted by the rapper of the brawl.Celebrities have also weighed in. Justin Bieber said on Twitter late Friday that he appreciated Trump lobbying Swedish authorities on behalf of the rapper.A$AP Rocky latest: Trump weighs in on rapper's jail treatment, Swedish prime minister won't intervene\"I want my friend out,\" Bieber tweeted. \"I appreciate you trying to help him. But while (you're) at it @realDonaldTrump can you also let those kids out of cages?\"Bieber was referencing the ongoing situation at the US-Mexico border, where some migrant children are being kept in detention centers. Trump has not responded to Bieber's tweet. The President's involvement in the case came at the request of celebrities and the First Lady -- the latest incident in which star influence has swayed Trump to make certain decisions.Trump on Friday credited Melania Trump with bringing A$AP Rocky's plight to his attention.The President added: \"Many members of the African American community have called me -- friends of mine -- and said, 'Could you help?'\"Trump also revealed on Twitter that he spoke to Kanye West about the situation. And on Thursday, Kim Kardashian West thanked Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner for their efforts in trying to get A$AP Rocky released.CNN's Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

'Amazing'When Lowry stroked in the winning putt he he was greeted by wife Wendy and his young daughter Iris on the 18th green, before hugs for the rest of his family and friends.\"Wow,\" said Lowry after accepting the Claret Jug. \"To have an Open at Royal Portrush on the island of Ireland is just amazing.\"\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddea\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udfc6@ShaneLowryGolf @TheOpen\u2014 Padraig Harrington (@padraig_h) July 21, 2019 His eyes filled and his voice cracked as he added: \"My mum and dad sacrificed so much for me and I'm just glad I can hand them this trophy tonight.\"He was also hugged by Harrington and Portrush local Graeme McDowell, whose success as the 2010 US Open winner played its part in the Open returning to Northern Ireland for the first time in 68 years. Portrush resident Darren Clarke's 2011 Open win and McIlroy's four majors from 2011-2014 were also instrumental, once the specter of Northern Ireland's Troubles receded. Lowry won his first European Tour event when still an amateur at the Irish Open in 2009 and clinched the last of his four titles in Abu Dhabi in January.On his way to missing the cut at the Open last year, he sat in the car park at Carnoustie and cried.\"Golf wasn't my friend,\" he said. \"What a difference a year makes.\"",

Renowned coach Pete Cowen, mentor now to multiple major champions, was asked down to Dublin to look at the squad and see what he thought.

The US-based Whirlpool said anyone with an affected dryer should unplug it immediately.The problem first came to light in November 2015 when it emerged that the heating elements of some dryers could cause fires when they came into contact with excess lint, but Whirlpool initially chose not to issue a general recall. Instead, it told customers the appliances could be used if they weren't left unattended. Read MoreWhirlpool's vice president apologized to consumers on Monday as the company announced the recall.\"Safety is our top priority and tackling the issue with our tumble dryers has been one of the biggest challenges we have ever faced,\" Jeff Noel said in a statement. \"We value our customers more than anything and we recognise that we let many of you down. You deserved better from us and for this we apologise to you all.\"Customers with affected dryers will be offered a free replacement or modification, or a refund based on the age of the model, the company said. They can also pay to upgrade to a newer model.Britain's Press Association news agency reported that executives from the company told lawmakers the true number of affected units could be 800,000.In recent years, 54 fires have been logged, three of which were in models that had already been modified, PA added.",

According to preliminary results posted Monday by Ukraine's Central Election Commission, Zelensky's Servant of the People party looks poised to win a possible outright majority in parliamentary elections that were held Sunday.According to the CEC, his newly formed party won 42.5% of the party-list vote, well ahead of several other parties that need to pass the 5% threshold to gain seats in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament. And his party also appears to be sweeping up votes in individual constituencies, racking up another 125 seats.Ukraine's next president is already getting tough with Vladimir PutinThe results are not final: As of Monday morning, around 55% of the votes had been counted. But it no longer appears that Zelensky will need to enter into a coalition to form a government.And that represents a stunning turn of events in this fractious post-Soviet republic.Read MoreFor starters, it's a clean slate. Zelensky, a political newcomer, was previously known as the star of a television series in which he played an accidental president.That series -- called Servant of the People, and the inspiration for his party's name -- underscored Ukrainian frustrations with politics as usual. Zelensky played a schoolteacher who vaults to the country's top office after his anti-corruption rant goes viral. If the projected results stand, Zelensky will be the first president since the country's independence in 1991 to be backed by a parliamentary majority. And that gives him a clear mandate when it comes to tackling Ukraine's biggest problems: Corruption, a struggling economy, and a simmering war with pro-Russian separatists in the country's east.Since independence, Ukraine has been beset by kleptocracy and political turmoil. It has seen two major popular revolutions: The pro-democratic Orange Revolution of 2004-2005 and the Maidan Revolution of 2014, which led to the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and set in motion Russia's annexation of Crimea and the separatist conflict in the east.Putin offers Russian citizenship to Ukrainians in separatist-held areasDiscontent with the status quo also propelled another unexpected newcomer into politics: Rock musician Sviatoslav Vakarchuk. His party, Voice, won 6.3% of Sunday's vote, according to preliminary results, enough to win a place in parliament. As president, Zelensky will have to contend with a powerful, nuclear-armed neighbor led by Russian President Vladimir Putin.Putin has made clear that he does not see Ukrainian statehood as something natural or legitimate.In a recent conversation with American film director Oliver Stone -- who has endorsed the Kremlin's view that the Maidan Revolution was in fact a Western-orchestrated coup d'etat -- Putin said that some form of reunification between Russia and Ukraine was inevitable, given the intertwined histories of the two Slavic nations.\"I believe that Russians and Ukrainians are actually one people,\" Putin said.\"One people, two nations?\" Stone asked.\"One nation, in fact,\" Putin replied.Whatever thoughts Putin may have about the legitimacy of Ukrainian statehood, Sunday's parliamentary election appeared to be a firm rebuke. The pro-Russian Opposition Platform party came in a distant second to Zelensky's party, garnering 12.9% of the party-list vote, according to the latest preliminary results.And that gives Zelensky a much more unified front when it comes to negotiating with Putin. Already, the two leaders have discussed a potential prisoner swap, and a resounding parliamentary victory may -- potentially -- give Zelensky a stronger hand when it comes to playing poker with Putin. CNN's Denis Lapin in Kiev contributed to this report.",

No arrests were made, police said.The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) -- a governmental law enforcement organization -- reported that the gold was believed to have originated in Venezuela, from where it was transported to the Cayman Islands on a private jet.

The worker was on sick leave when he traveled to the airport in his uniform and met a drugs courier from Colombia in airport toilets, where he was subsequently arrested by police, the NCA said. He was later sentenced to 13 years in prison.",

        "content": "Bialystok, Poland (CNN)A Polish city celebrated its first-ever LGBTQ equality march on Saturday, but it struck a starkly different tone to the joyous and hedonistic affairs associated with pride parades.Ringed by riot police, around 1,000 pride marchers walked defiantly through the streets of the northeastern city of Bialystok as thousands of nationalist football \"ultra\" fans, far-right groups and others threw flash bombs, rocks and glass bottles.  As counter-protesters yelled \"God, honor and motherland\" and \"Bialystok free of perverts,\" the pride marchers chanted \"Poland free of fascists\" in return. Police said about 4,000 people were involved in demonstrations against the march. Bags of flour and other objects were thrown out of Communist-era housing blocks at the pride marchers, who were moving along a 3-kilometer (1.8 mile) route through the city center.According to Bialystok's police spokesman, Tomasz Krupa, the violence led to the detention of 20 people, four of whom were suspected of committing crimes, including the use of threats and insults against officers. The police kept a protective ring around pride marchers throughout the three-hour march.Read MoreThe city of 298,000 people is located in the conservative region of Podlasie, a stronghold for Poland's ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, known by its acronym PiS. According to anti-racism groups, Bialystok has become a byword for its strong far-right movements. \"Many of the acts of xenophobic aggression have been committed in Podlasie compared to other regions in Poland,\" Rafal Pankowski, from the anti-extremism group Never Again, told CNN.But the hostile atmosphere did not dampen the mood of a multi-generational group of marchers, who described the event as a victory in their fight for more equality -- despite the threats.Magazine to give out 'LGBT-free zone' stickers to readers\"I am trying to see this in a joyful way, but this march is also sad for me because I did not think it would be as dangerous as it is,\" Anna Pietrucha, 26, who came from Warsaw to speak at the march, told CNN.Saturday's march was one of 24 parades scheduled to take place this year in Poland -- a record number that campaigners say is a reaction to the uptick of homophobic and transphobic language by Poland's Catholic leaders and PiS.\"We are in the middle of an ongoing wave of hateful propaganda, which is fueled by both the state and the Catholic Church,\" Hubert Sobecki, co-president of Warsaw-based LGBT+ organization Love Does Not Exclude, told CNN from a cafe in Bialystok. Counter protestsAccording to officials, there were about 32 protests registered for Saturday, the majority in opposition to the pride march.These included a family picnic at Bialystok's Branicki Palace -- organized by Artur Kosicki, the marshal of Podlasie -- and an outdoor prayer vigil next door at the Roman Catholic Bialystok Cathedral.Bialystok's Catholic Archbishop Tadeusz Wojda called on congregants to \"defend Christian values\" by attending the picnic, adding that the LGBTQ march was \"an initiative foreign to\" the region.Ultra-nationalist football hooligans, far right organizations and others took part in counter-protests across the city.The picnic had bouncy castles, folk musicians and the local army regiment exhibiting its artillery. CNN approached Kosicki, who is from PiS, for an interview, but he declined. PiS and the government also ignored repeated requests for comment by CNN. Minutes later, more flash bangs were heard in the near distance, set off by far-right groups outside the complex as they attempted to block pride marchers from proceeding any further.The march ended soon after 5 p.m. local time, after the police deployed stun grenades and pepper spray to clear the far-right protesters.Some pride marchers were seen removing their makeup, hiding their rainbow flags and wiping off glitter; they told CNN it was in an attempt to blend in with the pedestrians and leave the city center safely. Pushback against equalityMany Poles in the country's urban centers are supportive of the push for more LGBTQ rights, with Warsaw hosting its largest pride parade earlier in June.But there has been resistance elsewhere to the community's increasing visibility in a country where same-sex marriage and adoptions are illegal, and anti-LGBTQ attacks are not considered a hate crime by law.In the run-up to October's general election, PiS party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski framed the opposition's support for more equality as an \"attack on the family,\" calling LGBTQ rights a \"threat\" in the devout Catholic country.LGBT Rights Milestones Fast Facts\"I think the way that some politicians of this party spoke publicly about LGBT[Q] issues made other people in Poland less afraid to use hate speech,\" local gay rights activist Joanna Gluszek, 28, who co-organized Bialystok's march told CNN.Critics say the tactic helps rally its more religious and rural base. \"All the signs are showing that Kaczynski will continue with the scapegoat strategy, which goes hand-in-hand with the Polish Catholic church that has made the LGBTQ community its biggest enemy,\" said Miroslawa Makuchowska, head of the political division of the Polish advocacy group Campaign Against Homophobia.Riot police deployed stun grenades and pepper spray to clear far-right protesters.The environment has emboldened right-wing media and far-right organizations. This week, the right-wing weekly publication Gazeta Polska announced plans to distribute stickers proclaiming an \"LGBT-free zone\" to its readers. The stunt drew widespread condemnation in and outside the country.The Warsaw-based nonprofit Campaign Against Homophobia (KPH) told CNN that more than 30 councils had declared themselves free of \"LGBT ideology\" in the past few months -- in response to Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from the opposition Civic Platform (PO), signing a declaration in support of LGBTQ rights.In Bialystok, leaflets anonymously placed around the city ahead of the march said that streets would be \"contaminated with LGBT bacteria\" on Saturday.\"Even though the march faced obstacles ... I hope it's a start of a new mindset here,\" Gluszek said in a text message after the march. \"The [march's] participants, mostly Bialystok citizens, didn't let fear overcome them and showed they are not afraid.\"",

In the first snap, the young prince can be seen donning an England football shirt as he lies playfully in the garden of his London home in Kensington Palace. A second photograph shows George wearing the same shirt, smiling gleefully at the camera.In the third photo, the future king is seen outdoors in front of a leafy backdrop, wearing blue and white striped shorts and a green polo shirt. Kensington Palace confirmed that all the photos were taken by his mother in the gardens of Kensington Palace and while on holiday with family. Prince George Alexander Louis, who was born July 22, 2013 at St. Mary's Hospital in London, is the oldest child of Britain's Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.Read MoreHe made his first appearance in front of the world's media only hours after Catherine gave birth, when she posed for photographs on the steps of the hospital's private Lindo Wing.George is currently third in line to the British throne, behind his father and grandfather, Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales. If he, as expected, one day becomes king, following the reigns of Charles and William, he will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror. Prince George was a page boy at the wedding of Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in October 2018.George was most recently seen playing alongside his siblings, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at the Billingbear Polo Club in Berkshire. It was the first time that the young royals were seen interacting with their newborn cousin, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. George was also seen on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, the official residence of Queen Elizabeth II, for the Trooping the Colour ceremony in June. The military parade is performed by regiments of the British and Commonwealth armies to mark the monarch's official birthday. The young royal was equally given a leading role at the wedding of Princess Eugenie, daughter of Prince Andrew, to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018. He served as a page boy at their nuptials, which took place in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Prince George met President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at Kensington Palace in 2016.Yet the most memorable image of the future king to date was arguably his encounter with President Barack Obama at Kensington Palace in 2016, where he was seen shaking hands with the former American leader while dressed in pajamas and a robe. George currently attends Thomas's Battersea school in south London, where he has just completed year one. In September he will move into year two, the final year of the Lower School before he moves into the Middle School. He will also be joined at the school by his younger sister, Princess Charlotte, in September. Yearly fees at the school amount to 19,287 pounds ($24,113) for a single child, and 18,915 pounds ($23,648) for a second.",

        "content": "(CNN)Morgan Jones was close to starving. It was 1660 and he and his boat crew had been stranded at Oyster Point, in modern-day South Carolina, for almost eight months, running low on food with no hope of rescue. Eventually, Jones and five others set out \"through the wilderness\" for British colonies in the north, but were detained as they passed through the territory of a local indigenous tribe. \"That night they carried us to their town and shut us up close to our no small dread,\" Jones wrote in an account of his journey published years later. Told they were to be executed, Jones cried out in his native language, Welsh: \"Have I escaped so many dangers and must I now be knocked on the head like a dog?\"One of his captors then approached him and said, \"in the British tongue\" that Jones \"should not die.\" Instead, he took him to his home, where Jones happily conversed \"with them familiarly in the British (Welsh) language and did preach to them three times a week in the same language.\" Pages from \"An enquiry into the truth of the tradition concerning the Discovery of America, By Prince Madog ab Owen Gwynedd, about the year, 1170,\" by historian John Williams, published in 1791.Read MoreAfter almost a month, Jones returned to his home in New York and wrote to a fellow clergyman, Thomas Lloyd of Pennsylvania, promising to \"conduct any Welshman\" to the place he had met their American co-linguists. Jones' account reignited interest in a more than half-a-century-old story popular on both sides of the Atlantic that Christopher Columbus had been beaten to the Americas by almost 300 years by a Welsh prince, and that therefore the New World belonged not to the Spanish crown but to the English. The rights of indigenous people who had been there for millennia not deemed worth considering. Proof of this account was purported to be found in existence of Welsh-speaking communities living in America. The hunt for these so-called \"white Indians,\" who looked and spoke like Europeans, was an obsession for many early settlers, including explorers, priests and journalists -- even Thomas Jefferson, the country's third president.At its root was not only a rivalry between England and Spain, but also a deep seated racism that sought alternative explanations for how supposedly primitive indigenous people had conquered the Americas and built grand civilizations throughout, the remnants of which European settlers were finding as they spread throughout the continents.   Madog's missionThe story goes something like this. In 1170, Owain, ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, in what is now north Wales, died. His sons quickly set about contesting the succession and plunged the country into civil war. One of Owain's youngest sons, Madog, was disgusted by the fighting and set off in search of something better. As Humphrey Llwyd put it in his 1584 history, \"Cronica Walliae,\" Madog \"left the land in contention betwixt his brethren, and prepared certaine ships with men and munition, and sought adventures by seas, sailing West, and leaving the coast of Ireland so far north, that he came to a land unknowen, where he saw manie strange things.\" Finding the land lush and plentiful, Madog reportedly left a small number of his crew there to build a settlement and returned to Wales, where he gathered more followers and ships and set off west again, never to return. The land which Madog sailed to, Llwyd wrote, \"must needs be some part of that countrie of which the Spaniardes affirme themselves to be the first finders.\" \"It is manifest, that that countrie was long before by Brytaines discovered, afore either Columbus or Americus Vesputius lead anie Spaniards thither,\" he said, referring to the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, whose Latin moniker gave the continents their modern names.  An extract from Humphrey Llwyd's 1584 history, \"Cronica Walliae,\" which recounts part of the Madog myth. Welsh IndiansDetermined to prove the veracity of the Madog story -- and therefore a claim that pre-dated that made by Columbus in 1492 for the Spanish crown --  early British colonizers, who had begun arriving in the early 1600s, set about looking for evidence of ancient Welsh settlements. As British explorers moved out from the original Jamestown settlement in modern-day Virginia and came into contact with more and more indigenous peoples, word spread that at least one tribe spoke a language similar to Welsh. In 1791, John Williams, a Welsh Presbyterian minister, wrote that \"words in common use on different parts of the continent, which are very near, or undeniably Welsh, in both sound and sense, could not happen by chance, and they could not be derived from any Europeans but from the Ancient Britons.\" While some of these words did appear to have similarities to Welsh -- such as both using \"bara\" for bread and \"croeso\" for welcome -- which Williams said were already used by the Mexicans when their country was discovered by the Spaniards. Williams, and other early historians, ignored that the translation of the vast majority of terms with similarities often didn't make sense. There was much excitement, for example, that penguin sounded like \"pen gwyn\" -- white head, in Welsh -- despite the fact that a penguin's head is black. \"There is extensive literature on travelers discovering American Indians who were fluent in some European or Asiatic language,\" Samuel Eliot Morison wrote in in his history of European settlement of North America. \"Uneducated travelers were apt to regard every Indian language as gibberish, and so compared it with some known language such as Welsh, Basque, Hebrew, or Finnish, that was also gibberish to them.\" A 1606 map of the British colony of Virginia, as described by Captain John Smith.Search for New Wales Jones' story was given the less-than-neutral headline \"The Crown of England's Title to America prior to that of Spain\" when it first appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine, a popular London periodical. It caused a sensation in the UK, emboldening both those who sought to claim the Americas for England, and those who saw any evidence of indigenous advancement as proof of European heritage.Following the American Revolution of 1783, interest in the \"Welsh Indians\" continued among residents of the newly independent States. As the US expanded its territory westward, many assumed they would eventually encounter the tribe of ancient Britons. In an 1804 letter to explorer Meriweather Lewis, then President Thomas Jefferson enclosed a map created by John Evans, who had been employed several years earlier by the Spanish colonial authorities to graph their new territory, \"but whose original object I believe had been to go in search of the Welsh Indians, said to be up the Missouri.\"But while he may have been remembered by Jefferson for his search for the Welsh Indians, Evans was actually among the first to poke a hole in the myth. \"The hunt for the Welsh Indians had moved westward with Anglo-American settlement,\" Elizabeth Fenn writes in \"Encounters at the Heart of the World,\" her history of the Mandan people, an Indian nation long believed to be descended from Europeans. \"By 1794, its focus had narrowed to two Indian peoples: the Apaches of the Southwest and the Mandans of the upper Missouri.\" \n\n\n\n\nA map showing various countries' North American claims around the French and Indian Wars of 1763.\n\nBorn in North Wales near Caernarfon, Evans was an explorer and mapmaker working for the Spanish crown in its American territories. While he carried out his work, however, he was also, according to Fenn, \"hell-bent on ascending the Missouri River to find the Welsh Indians.\"From 1795, Evans spent two years exploring and mapping the northern reaches of the Missouri, looking for a route to the Pacific. But while he did meet the Mandan people, he did not uncover any evidence of European heritage.It was later reported that he had concluded such people did not exist.   The increasing volume of experiences like that of Evans with non-Welsh-speaking indigenous peoples throughout North America, should have been the end of it, but the myth proved surprisingly persistent. Evans' critics claimed that he had lied to protect the territorial claims of his Spanish paymasters, and stories of Madog continued into the 20th century. \"John Evans proved that Madoc is myth, which is an unpopular assumption to make,\" one of his descendants, Gruff Rhys, frontman of Welsh rockband Super Furry Animals, said in 2014.Rhys' album \"American Interior\" focuses on Evans' explorations and his debunking of the Madog tales. \"He's an incredibly brave and romantic figure, who is almost beyond classification. His story is quite unique,\" the musician told the BBC. \"He failed in some ways but it's a glorious failure.\"  American explorer Richard Marsh poses with three \"white Indians\" he discovered in Panama and brought with him to Washington in 1924. White Indians While the Madog myth can seem ridiculous, even comedic, to modern eyes, the sentiments underpinning the hunt for \"White Indians\" were far more pernicious and damaging. \"From the earliest European discoveries, rumors of 'White Indians' have circulated in America,\" McLaird, the historian, wrote in 1988. \"Always to the west of settled areas, there were supposed to be people who possessed advanced customs and technology, unlike the 'uncivilized savages' the frontiersmen had already met and fought. Sometimes these claims were buttressed by 'eyewitness accounts' of meetings with bearded, light-skinned Indians, some of whom possessed Bibles.\"This was true across the Americas. Traipsing through the deep Amazon jungle in the early 1900s in search an advanced civilization he called Z, British explorer Percy Fawcett was sure he would find evidence of Indians who had descended from Western civilization.\"Fawcett could never take the final leap of a modern anthropologist and accept that complex civilizations were capable of springing up independently of each other,\" according to his biographer David Grann. In 1924, Alexander Hamilton Rice, a contemporary and rival of Fawcett's, claimed the \"discovery of a tribe of White Indians at the headwaters of the Parima River in northern Brazil who spoke a language entirely their own and used cocaine as a relish for their diet of wild plantains,\" the New York Times reported at the time.The racial prejudice motivating these types of searches were clear in an article published by another explorer the following year. Writing that he had discovered a number of White Indians in the jungles of Panama who spoke \"a language related to ancient Sanskrit,\" explorer Richard Marsh said they offered hints into \"how white men evolved from the primeval brown race\" and evidence of \"at least two great white-influenced civilizations\" in central and south America. Marsh dragged several of these possible \"descendants of the early Norwegians\" back to Washington with him to be examined by scientists. A photo of them from the time shows that they, like many supposed \"White Indians\" spotted by explorers, were actually indigenous people with albinism. All accounts of supposed European-descended indigenous Americans were based on highly selective use of evidence. Marsh ignored the non-albino relations of his White Indians, while proponents of the Madog myth focused on words in indigenous languages that sounded Welsh while discounting all that did not. Often the evidence presented to the theory was contradictory: \"blue-eyed Indians\" allegedly descended from Welsh settlers overlooked that ethnic Britons tended to have brown eyes. Accounts of tribes believed to be the Welsh Indians which do not mention the Madog myth, such as those of explorers Lewis and Clarke, are also ignored. The assumption that indigenous Americans were \"backward\" or primitive, ignoring accounts of early explorers and archaeological evidence, was used to justify a brutal, often genocidal replacement of indigenous people by European invaders. To this day, stereotypes about Native Americas continue to cause harm, as many indigenous people are marginalized and ignored. Part of the attraction of the Madog myth was the romance inherent in setting off on an amazing journey and settling a new land. But a group of people did do this, and a long time before a mythical 12th century Welsh prince was even born, crossing into North America from Siberia over the Bering Strait. Their descendants spread out across the entire continent, building towns and cities and creating complex societies. They thrived for thousands of years before European invaders, and their infectious diseases, brought widespread death to the Americas, forever shaping their future.",

        "content": "Portrush, Northern Ireland (CNN)The roars for Shane Lowry were just different. Deeper, more throaty, more heartfelt.With no Northern Irishman in contention, the Royal Portrush crowds have taken Ireland's Lowry to heart and how it has inspired him.They roared and chanted and clapped and waved as he walked onto the 18th green Saturday, having left the field trailing in his wake on day three of the 148th Open.It had been a truly masterful display, as the 32-year-old from County Offaly fired a stunning 63 to surge to 16 under and take a four-shot lead into the final day Sunday.The world No.33 will play in the final group alongside English Ryder Cup hero Tommy Fleetwood, who shot 66, with American JB Holmes two further back at 10 under.Read MoreREAD: Emotional McIlroy feels 'love' after epic Open missREAD: Tiger Woods misses Open cut, yearns for 'hot weeks'READ: Why Holywood star McIlroy has always been box officeShane Lowry set a course record for the updated Dunluce course of 63 Saturday.The bearded Lowry has missed the cut in his last four Open Championships, but he has tapped into a special source this week.He grinned and shook his head as the roars punctuated the still Portrush air as he forged clear while the pack shuffled constantly behind him.The Open hasn't been to these parts in 68 years and the local fans were determined to make the most of the occasion. \"That was the most incredible day I've had on a golf course,\" he told reporters with a twinkle in his eyes afterward.\"I just wanted to keep making putts to hear those roars.\" At one stage he told his caddie Brian \"Bo\" Martin, who is from Ardglass, an hour or so to the south, to make the most of it.\"I said to Bo walking off the 17th tee, 'We might never have a day like this on the golf course again. So let's enjoy this next half hour.'\"Shane Lowry was serenaded as he walked on to the 18th green.'Roaring in your face'Lowry was serenaded with the European Ryder Cup chant \"ole, ole, ole\" as he walked up the 18th, and the party songs, with his name added to the lyrics, rang out over the course long after he'd left the arena. The soundtrack was still going as Lowry began his press conference, but he says he won't get rattled by the intensity of the crowd's support Sunday.\"Honestly, walking from the green to the next tee, the people are literally a yard away from you roaring in your face as loud as they can,\" he said. \"I thought I dealt with it very well and hopefully I do the same Sunday.\"Lowry's previous best finish in a major was at the 2016 US Open at Oakmont, when he led by four after three rounds but collapsed on the final day with a 76 to finish behind Dustin Johnson.He was asked about that Friday night, and said he's a \"totally different person now.\"When the same question came Saturday, Lowry laughed. \"I was waiting for that.\"\"I learned a few things that day about playing in the final round of a major with a lead, that you need to just hang in until the very last minute,\" he said. \"You never know what can happen.\"Sunday's weather forecast is for rain and strong winds later, causing Open organizers to move the tee time forward by a couple of hours.Lowry doesn't believe the bad weather gives any of the leaders any particular advantage, and added: \"There's a good leaderboard behind me. \"There's no point in saying to go out and enjoy myself because it's going to be a very stressful and very difficult day. \"So I'm going to take the bad shots on the chin and I'm going to take the good shots and try to capitalize on that.\"'We're not robots'England's Tommy Fleetwood will start Sunday two shots behind Shane Lowry.Later in his relaxed press conference, Lowry was asked how he will prepare Saturday evening at the house he is renting with his family and friends.\"I'd been lying if I said Love Island wasn't on TV,\" he grinned, before adding: \"I'll go to bed thinking about holding the Claret Jug tomorrow evening. \"It's only natural, isn't it? We're human. We're not robots. We can't not think about things. And when you try not to think about something you end up thinking about it more, so you might as well talk about it.\"Looming large -- albeit seven strokes back -- in a tie for fourth is world No.1 Brooks Koepka.The American has won four of his last nine majors and finished second, first, second in majors this year. He is well aware how quickly big leads can vanish after losing a seven-shot advantage before winning the US PGA at Bethpage in May.\"The last time Shane had the lead at Oakmont we saw that,\" he said, bringing up Lowry's misfortune.Fleetwood has also finished second in a US Open -- behind Koepka at Shinnecock Hills in 2018 -- and says he will relish the challenge.\"The atmosphere for us as golfers was just great,\" he said. \"I loved it. For or against you, you can't help but appreciate and love what today was and what Sunday is going to be. it's going to be a very special day.\"",

The race concludes July 28th in Paris, so Alaphilippe isn't getting ahead of himself.  \"I'm happy to profit from this exceptional moment I'm having,\" Alaphilippe, 33rd last year, was quoted as saying by the Tour's website. \"The hard work pays off. \"One more day in yellow, I couldn't ask for anything better.

        "content": "Portrush, Northern Ireland (CNN)He was fighting for his honor. Rory McIlroy had made such a hash of the first day of the Open that even making the cut at Royal Portrush would represent a victory.Now, in the gloaming of Friday evening, the Northern Irishman was inching towards the cut mark, one nail-biting, stomach-churning birdie at a time. Leaders JB Holmes and Shane Lowry had long since finished, setting the halfway mark at eight under to lead by one shot from English duo Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood.But the home crowd sensed the tournament within a tournament was only just heating up.Read MoreREAD: Tiger Woods misses Open cut, yearns for 'hot weeks'READ: Why Holywood star McIlroy has always been box officeRory McIlroy won the last of his four majors in 2014.McIlroy began the first Open in Northern Ireland for 68 years as the sentimental favorite, the local hero set to clinch a fairy tale win.But his quadruple-bogey eight at the very first hole Thursday punctured that balloon, and he dropped a further five shots in the last three holes to finish with a 79 for eight over.Even as a competitor and trying to beat the guy every week, sometimes I have to step back and realize how great @McIlroyRory is for golf. How he handles the spotlight, the highs, the lows, his social life, the fans, his golf, everything.. it's awesome to watch\u2014 Justin Thomas (@JustinThomas34) July 19, 2019 Needing to catch fire Friday, despite teeing off in sluicing rain, the four-time major champion hunkered down to the task. The cut was projected to come at one over, meaning he had to make up seven shots. On a course as formidable as the Dunluce links, in Open Championship set-up, with inclement weather, it was a stiff proposition.But this was McIlroy, Northern Ireland's most famous sporting son, who set the course record of 61 at Royal Portrush as a 16-year-old.He was the one they'd all come to see, the man with a nation's weight on his shoulders.He'd clawed two shots back by the turn, but there was still a mountain to climb. But a run of three straight birdies from the 10th made the impossible dream suddenly appear in touch. A bogey, via a greenside bunker on the short 13th, was like a dagger in the heart -- back to four over and with holes running out.But the star from Holywood, near Belfast has always been box office and he refused to give in, manufacturing another birdie on the 14th. The chase was back on and the feverish fans following him knew it and were willing him on.READ: How Open return to Portrush defied the oddsRory McIlroy had the late crowd on the edge of their seats with his dramatic bid.At the short 16th -- nicknamed \"Calamity Corner\" -- he put his tee shot to 12 feet and drained the putt, sparking the late crowd in the grandstand to rise to their feet, roaring him on.One. More. Birdie.Drama on 17 as his drive caught the right rough, but McIlroy carved it out onto the green. Agonisingly, the lengthy birdie putt stayed out.The task was now simple. McIlroy required a birdie on the 18th, in the advancing dusk, to make it through to the weekend. READ: Tiger Woods 'sore' and 'scraping it around' Royal Portrush Rory McIlroy won the last of his four majors in 2014.'Going to hurt for a bit'From a perfect position in the fairway, Mclroy struck his approach in to the darkening sky, eyeing it up and down as it soared towards the green. But it was a touch left, and the groan from the diehards in the grandstand told you the result. The ball dribbled down a hollow to the left of the green. Holing his chip wasn't impossible but unlikely.McIlroy was roared towards the green as if he were walking up the last as the victor on Sunday and he took off his cap to acknowledge their applause.He stalked the shot, no doubt uttering in his head a line he'd repeated many times as a youngster: \"This...to make the cut in the Open.\" Or maybe not.It was a decent effort. But he took two to get down and it all added up to 65, the best round of the week by one, but still not good enough. How he will rue those wasted shots Thursday. He said in the build up he would probably cry if he won, but he was equally watery-eyed talking to the media afterward.\"Part of me is very disappointed not to be here for the weekend. I'm emotional but happy with how I played,\" he told Sky Sports.\"The support I got out there was incredible. Yesterday gave me a mountain to climb but I dug in and showed good resilience.\"It's going to hurt for a bit. I've been looking forward to this week for a long time.\"I didn't play my part but everyone in Northern Ireland came out to watch me and played theirs.\"He later told reporters: \"I will look back on this day with nothing but fond memories and positivity. I wasn't coming here to produce any sort of symbolism. But to see everyone out there cheering for one cause was pretty special.\"I really felt the love from the crowd, so many of them out there willing me on and wanting me to be there for the weekend.\"McIlroy is consoled by caddie and best friend Harry Diamond.He will have to wait until next year to continue his quest for a first major since 2014 -- and the final leg of the career grand slam at the Masters.McIlroy's countryman Graeme McDowell, the 2010 US Open champion who was born and bred in Portrush, made the cut with no room to spare, but Portrush resident Darren Clarke, the 2011 Open champion, also missed out.Instead, Ireland's Lowry et al. take center stage over the weekend. Lowry has already become something of a crowd favorite at Royal Portrush, a place he knows well.\"It [the reception] was incredible right form the first hole,\" he told reporters Friday. \"You can't but smile, you can't but laugh how it is. There's no point trying to shy away from it. It's an incredible feeling, getting applauded onto every green, tee box. I'm out there giving my best, trying to do my best for everyone, I suppose.\"",

Our understanding is that the child is safe and that the child's ongoing care is being directed and monitored by the Johnson County District Court and the Johnson County Department for Children and Families.\"In conducting our investigation, we have taken great care to ensure that we do not interfere with the county's proceedings or compromise the privacy or welfare of the child in any way.

Local law enforcement authorities have publicly advised that the available evidence does not permit them to determine who caused the child's injuries. \"Similarly, based on the evidence presently available, the NFL cannot conclude that Mr. Hill violated the Personal Conduct Policy.

We are glad to welcome Tyreek back to the team and look forward to the start of training camp next week.\"Hill previously had been banned from team activities since late April, when a partial audio recording was released originally on CNN affiliate KCTV, suggesting that Hill broke his 3-year-old son's arm. The man identified as Hill also is heard on the recording telling his fianc\u00e9e, Crystal Espinal, \"You need to be terrified of me, too, b----.\" A full version of the recording aired on Kansas City station 610 KCSP earlier this month. CNN has not authenticated the recording.In June, the criminal investigation was no longer active, according to Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe.Hill reacted to his reinstatement on Twitter, thanking his family, friends and fans for their support.\"I can assure you that I will continue to work to be the person, player and teammate that you envisioned me to be,\" he wrote.Love you guys !!!\u270c\ud83c\udfff pic.twitter.com/QWKA7ia37i\u2014 Ty Hill (@cheetah) July 19, 2019\n\nIn 2014, Hill was reportedly accused of domestic assault and battery on Espinal when she was pregnant.

After the magnitude of that 15th major title, for a fifth green jacket and first major in 11 years, it seemed the post-surgery twilight Tiger phase would herald yet more glittering moments. And yet it might.But consider this: he missed two cuts in his first 55 majors as a pro. He's now missed two of his last three. That neatly illustrates the new reality, missed in the post-Masters glow. Woods is not a machine rebuilt as good as new. He is a patched-up, ailing, intermittently brilliant, fallible, horses-for-courses, 43-year-old man whose best years are well behind him. There will be good days -- Sunday at Augusta was one, Sunday at the Tour Championship last year another -- and bad days -- think Thursday at Portrush.\"That's one of the hardest things to accept, that as an older athlete you're not going to be as consistent as you were at 23,\" a tired, resigned Woods told the pack of reporters waiting to talk behind the 18th green at Royal Portrush. \"Things are different. I'm going to have my hot weeks, I'm going to be there in contention with the chance to win and I will win tournaments, but there are times when I'm just not going to be there and that wasn't the case 20-something odd years ago when I had a different body and I was able to be a bit more consistent.\"In a way, it's a taste of what his rivals have had to put up with on a consistent basis: nagging, unerring inconsistency. Hot one minute, not the next. Think the mercurial Phil Mickelson, or Rory McIlroy.

The sight of him sitting on his backside to tie his shoelaces Friday morning was an ominous sign for day two.So too, the filming of his swing from various angles and lengthy discussion afterwards with swing advisor Matt Killen and close confidante Rob McNamara. Clearly something needed looking at.Tiger Woods missed the cut in two of his last three majors. But Friday's effort was much improved. Having made some tweaks to his swing set-up, he was able to lean on a big drive on the fifth and lashed another monster way past Patrick Reed's ball on the seventh. He had his chances to inch back towards the cut mark, but he played the six par fives over two days in two over par, which put him on the back foot compared with the field.The left miss still crept in, not least at the 17th which finally punched his early ticket home.\"It's more frustrating than anything else,\" he said. \"This is a major championship and I love playing in these events, I love the atmosphere and enjoy the stress of playing a major.\"JUST WATCHEDTiger Woods completes comeback to win MastersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTiger Woods completes comeback to win Masters 02:09When asked if there were any similarities with the period of aborted comebacks in between back surgeries in 2015 and 2016, he said: \"You can't compare the two.\"Those were some of the lowest times of my life.

        "content": "(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that US President Donald Trump's racist comments about four Democratic Congresswomen \"undermine America's strength\" and that she stands in \"solidarity\" with the women.Speaking at her annual news conference in Berlin, Merkel said: \"I distance myself from this decidedly and stand in solidarity with the women who were attacked.\"Trump said 'many people agree' with his racist tweets. These white supremacists certainly do.She added that from her perspective the \"US's strength lies exactly in the fact that people of very different nationalities contribute to the strength of the American people.\"Trump told the four women of color that they should \"go back\" to the \"crime-infested places\" they came from, even though three of the four were born in America and the fourth is a naturalized citizen.\"Those (President Trump's statements) are sentiments which are very much in opposition to my impressions (about the US) which I strongly believe in and it is something that undermines America's strength,\" Merkel said.Read MoreJUST WATCHEDTrump's racially charged tweets target Dem congresswomenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump's racially charged tweets target Dem congresswomen 02:08Trump has refused to apologize for the comments and continues to insist the tweets are not racist. The President tweeted Tuesday that he did not have a \"racist bone in my body.\"Earlier in the week, a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Theresa May also criticized the comments, describing them as \"completely unacceptable.\" The two candidates in line to replace May as British Prime Minister -- Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt -- joined her in that criticism.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Trump's racist comments undermine America's strength.Doing 'well' after shaking incidentsIn the week of her 65th birthday, Merkel also reiterated that she is fit to carry on as Germany's Chancellor following a series of incidents where she was seen shaking uncontrollably in public.Merkel told reporters that she understands the interest in her health, but reiterated that she is \"doing well.\"The German Chancellor has been seen shaking in public three times in less than a month.Merkel said she knows it's important that she pays attention to her health as she carries out her role as Chancellor.\"I understand I need to be capable of performing these duties, and I can carry out this job,\" she said.JUST WATCHEDAngela Merkel seen shaking for third time in under a monthReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAngela Merkel seen shaking for third time in under a month 01:18The Chancellor previously told reporters that she was \"working through some things ... which do not seem to be over yet,\" adding that she has to \"live with it for a while but I am very well and one does not have to worry.\"Merkel says she's taking care of herself. But what should we know about a leader's health?Merkel was first seen shaking during a June 18 ceremony with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. She was then seen shaking on June 27 when she attended an event with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The most recent episode was when she was seen trembling as she stood next to Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne in Berlin on July 10.Tremors can be caused by a number of conditions, ranging from neurological disorders to less serious issues such as medicinal side effects, stress or caffeine consumption.Merkel announced last year that she would not seek reelection when her term expires in 2021.On Friday she said she hopes there will be \"another life\" after politics and that she will be healthy for it.",

Algeria's goal came from its one and only shot of the game and few would argue that Senegal was the better side for the other 88 minutes of the match.Baghdad Bounedjah's shot deflected off Salif Sane and into the goal.Less than two minutes in -- 79 seconds to be exact -- you got the sense this was just going to be Algeria's night, after the Fennec Foxes took the lead in bizarrely fortuitous circumstances.Bounedjah silkily spun his defender and latched onto Riyad Mahrez's through ball, cutting inside onto his right foot and firing at goal from range.Senegal center-back Salif San\u00e9 got across to make a block and appeared to have done enough, but the ball looped high into the Cairo night -- almost comically high -- and somehow kissed the underside of the crossbar and nestled into net.Midfielder Badou Ndiaye extended his arms in the direction of his goalkeeper Alfred Gomis, inquiring as to why he made no attempt to get back and prevent the goal. Presumably, like thousands of others in the stadium, he thought the ball must have been going behind for a corner.Once in a generationIt was the perfect start for the Algeria fans who had traveled to Egypt in their thousands for this once-in-a-generation chance at making history.Not since 1990 had the Fennec Foxes made it to the AFCON final, beating Nigeria 1-0 on home soil in front of 105,000 fans.Algerian players celebrate with their fans after winning the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.The Algerian government had reportedly subsidized more than 5,000 plane tickets for Algeria supporters to make the four-hour flight to the Egyptian capital.However, hundreds of fans with legitimate tickets -- including local Egyptians as well as Algerians -- were reportedly refused entry and left to wander the perimeter of the stadium, trying to find a way in after being told by officials that some sections were already full.After Algeria's bright start -- Bounedjah almost made it 2-0 just moments later -- Senegal grew into the final and was by a considerable distance the better team for the remainder of the half.But despite their dominance, the Lions of Teranga were unable to produce any clear-cut chances, largely due to Algeria's consistent tactical fouls that prevented Senegal finding any sort of rhythm.The closest they came to opening the scoring was M'Baye Niang's sharp turn and long-range volley that whistled inches over Rais M'Bolhi's crossbar.Led by Liverpool star Sadio Man\u00e9, Senegal was not willing to simply let this opportunity pass it by. Having never previously won the Africa Cup of Nations and only once making it to the final, these players knew they were on the brink of immortality.Algerian players pray as they celebrate after winning the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.This final had been billed as Man\u00e9 vs. Mahrez but so far the Premier League duo had been upstaged by their less illustrious teammates.Senegalese youngster Isma\u00efla Sarr, a skillful winger at Stade Rennais and reportedly on the radar of both Arsenal and Watford, shone the brightest in the first half and was a constant threat down the right.VAR controversyIn the semifinal against Tunisia, Senegal was on the right end of a controversial call that saw VAR overturn a decision to award their opponents a penalty in extra time.As the final entered the second half, Senegal found itself in Tunisia's shoes as referee Alioum awarded it a penalty after Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura was adjudged to have handled in the area.It seemed harsh as the time; Sarr's cross was fired from close range at Guedioura who had both arms behind his back. Alioum briefly consulted the pitch side monitor and overturned his original decision.Though Senegal's players were perplexed at the time, in hindsight they will have few complaints.As the final whistle got ever nearer, Aliou Cisse's side continued to press for an equalizer as Algeria sunk further and further back towards its goalkeeper.Senegal coach Aliou Cisse applauds the traveling fans after the defeat.Mane's sharp turn and shot brought a brilliant, lunging block from Aissa Mandi, before Niang blazed a shot high and wide of an open goal after rounding M'Bolhi.Captain of the last Senegal side to reach the AFCON final in 2002, Cisse felt a familiar sinking feeling as Alioum blew the whistle for full time.Algeria's player ran in the direction of the thousands of fans congregated behind the goal they had been defending resolutely for the last 45 minutes.For those who traveled, for those back in Algeria and the communities around the world, these players will forever have their place in history.",

This is the fruit of a long-time preparation. Those players worked hard for five full years and now we get the fruit of this hard work.\"Football is always charming. This is a game for history. Pressure is a part of the game, it is a part of my work. I played football since I was 12, and had always felt the pressure since then.\"I am not thinking of the final now, I'm just happy that I made Senegal's people happy.\"That final ended in a painful penalty shootout defeat to Cameroon but Cisse is confident his players, with who he has developed a close bond since taking up the job in 2015, can go one better.However, they will have to do so without the leadership of Koulibaly, who misses out on his country's biggest game through suspension.Senegal fans are dreaming of a first ever AFCON triumph.\"I have unlimited trust in my players and I felt they want to achieve something, Cisse said. \"They did all what is needed to win. This generation is better than the 2002 one. My players told me they will be better than us, and they did.\"My relationship with them is like father-sons. When I became their coach in 2015 I told them our target is to reach the FIFA World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations final. That was the way to convince Kalidou Koulibaly to play for Senegal instead of France. Now here we are\".",

An 8 on the first means he's +4 #TheOpen Live coverage \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/V5gkRJCUkC pic.twitter.com/PONXr0mXUT\u2014 The Open (@TheOpen) July 18, 2019 \nFor McIlroy, that certainly wasn't in the script.The local hero was supposed to take the Open by storm at Royal Portrush. Read MoreREAD: Tiger Woods 'sore' and 'scraping it around' Royal Portrush READ: Why Holywood star McIlroy has always been box officeREAD: How Open return to Portrush defied the oddsHe was roared onto the first tee by an adoring public as one of the hot favorites to win as the Open returned to Northern Ireland for the first time in 68 years. What a fairy tale it would be. Except that he made a horror start as he carved his drive left into out-of-bounds and was forced to hit a second tee shot, which found deep rough. The four-time major champion's stomach must have been churning as the cushion of confidence and expectation collapsed from under him.The heaving crowds lining the fairway and packed in around the hilltop green were stunned, too. The weather, blustery but dry, wasn't even to blame.From there, McIlroy hacked up short of the green but found more long grass, from which he had to take a penalty drop. He finally found the green for six and took two putts for an eight -- what's known in golf as a \"snowman.\"McIlroy was wayward again off the second tee and dropped another shot with a fluffed chip at the short third before steadying his ship.Rory McIlroy takes a penalty drop on the first hole during the 148th Open Championship.'I let myself down'Two birdies took him to the turn just three over, but McIlroy dropped five shots in his last three holes to finish the first day  with a 79 for eight over par.\"I would like to punch myself,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I made a couple of stupid mistakes. I was pretty nervous on the first tee and hit a bad shot.\"He continued: \"At the end of the day, I play golf to fulfil my ambitions, not anyone else's, but I wish I could have given the crowd something to cheer about.\"I let myself down more than anyone else and need to pick myself back up.\"By day's end he trailed first-round leader JB Holmes by 13 shots.READ: Tiger Woods laughs off Brooks Koepka snubDavid Duval recorded an eye-watering 20-over-par at Royal Portrush. In a neat link-up, McIlroy met Duval -- playing in the group in front -- when the American hitched a buggy ride back to the tee on the seventh as McIlroy's group waited to play.  The 47-year-old Duval, a former world No.1 and Tiger Woods' chief nemesis for a spell, doesn't play much these days. The last of his 13 Tour titles came with that Open victory at Royal Lytham, and after injuries and a period away from the game he is more accustomed to the TV golf analyst's chair.He may wish he had stayed there.Duval had started with two birdies but made his own eight at the fifth after losing two balls,  and then outdid that in spectacular fashion at the long seventh. He lost his first two balls from the tee and then played a wrong ball from the third ball hit. He discovered the mistake at the green, which meant he had to return to where the wrong ball was played. But he couldn't find the correct ball and had to go back to the tee again -- where he encountered McIlroy, Paul Casey and Gary Woodland. He took six shots to complete the hole with the fourth ball hit, and including a two-shot penalty for playing the wrong ball, his score added up to 14. It was originally recorded as 15, then corrected to 13 on the official leaderboard, before a final statement from Open organizer the R&A settled on 14.    \"Very unique, an awful situation,\" Duval told reporters afterward. \"I'm at fault, I didn't take a close enough look [at the ball.]\"It was fairly unsettling, obviously. I came here with fairly high hopes. I've been playing well.\"The 2001 champion scored 14 on a disastrous seventh hole. READ: The Open: Why a sense of humor and rhino skin are key for caddiesREAD: Woods' 10-year plan to surpass Jack NicklausDuval has been hampered by injuries throughout his career, and admitted the tendonitis in his left arm \"hurts like crap.\"But he was adamant the right thing to do was continue playing. \"You have an obligation as a professional athlete, if you play, you post your score. Is there some, I don't know,  embarrassment to it? I don't know, but I teed off in the Open and I shot 90 [corrected to 91] so put it on the board.\"It was the highest score on an individual hole at the Open since Herman Tissie made 15 at the Postage Stamp eighth at Royal Troon in 1950.The seventh is one of two new holes -- along with the eighth -- at Royal Portrush for the 2019 Open and Duval has written a dramatic first chapter in its history.Things didn't get better for the Duval who finished with a 91 for an astonishing 20 over.",

        "content": "London (CNN)On one day every year, as per tradition, Britain is invaded by swarms of flying ants -- and this year, the insects arrived in such vast numbers they were seen from space. The insects swept into the south of England on Tuesday, in an invasion that -- at first glance -- seems to indicate we are living in the early stages of a disaster movie.So huge were the storms that weather radar mistook them for rain -- a far more common phenomena on the British Isles.BBC Weather presenter and meteorologist Simon King noticed the error, writing on Twitter alongside a video of the radar readings: \"Flying ants!!! Swarms of them flying into the sky in S Eng are being picked up as rain on the radar image this morning...!\"Flying ants!!! Swarms of them flying into the sky in S Eng are being picked up as rain on the radar image this morning...!#flyingantday #flyingants \ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1c#yuk pic.twitter.com/QGOcikqJFq\u2014 Simon King (@SimonOKing) July 17, 2019\n\nBut while the attack may seem unusual, it merely signaled the annual arrival of what has come to be known as Flying Ant Day.Read MoreMobs of the insects descend on locations around Britain on one day every summer. The creatures sweep in and take up residence on streets, green land and in the skies before disappearing hours later.The phenomena occurs because male and queen ants leave their colonies to mate when conditions are just right. And while flying ants are spotted on several days throughout the year, the vast majority pick the exact same moment to head out from their nests.It led to disruption for Britons intending to make the most of the outdoors on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the country was bathing in sunshine and warm temperatures.If you said flying ants \ud83d\udc1c you were correct! \u2714\ufe0fWe know this to be insect clutter (flying ants) based on inspection of raw reflectivity (Zdr and RhoHV) #WednesdayWisdom #FlyingAnts pic.twitter.com/8HejoLB9u5\u2014 Met Office (@metoffice) July 17, 2019\n\nBut the famous British stiff upper lip came in handy and people across the nation kept calm and carried on -- aside from some outbursts of disgust on social media. The event has been known to cause chaos at outdoor events; in recent years, players at the Wimbledon tennis championships struggled to maintain their focus as swarms descended onto Centre Court.According to the Royal Society of Biology (RSB), the vast majority of the creatures all come from the same variety of flying ants -- the black pavement ant Lasius niger.But while the annual attack may be inconvenient, it could be valuable for Britain's ecology. The insects' activity \"allows for more oxygen and water to reach the roots of plants and they can even improve soil fertility and help control pests,\" according to the RSB.",

Nico Rosberg, who won the F1 title for the German giants in 2016, has already warned CNN: \"When Mercedes come, they come to win.\"With the Silver Arrows targeting Formula E success, should the sport be worried its days of open competition will soon be over?Reasons to be fearfulRead MoreMercedes have taken a unique approach to their debut season by sending the HWA Racelab team out on track in Season Five as Formula E guinea pigs. It's not the first time that Mercedes and HWA have worked together, as HWA CEO and team principal Ulrich Fritz explains. \"The A of AMG in Mercedes-AMG is for Hans Werner Aufrecht\" Fritz tells CNN. \"He sold the AMG road car business to Mercedes in 1998 but decided to continue racing, so HWA is the spin-off and the first letters of his name.\"We have a long history with Mercedes and a lot of successes together. We are the most successful ever team in DTM (the German Touring Car Championship) and, with Mercedes, we won a bunch of driver, manufacturer and team titles.JUST WATCHEDWhen Silver Arrows dominated F1ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhen Silver Arrows dominated F1 04:14\"We want to win races and we want to win this championship in the future too.\"Could the strength of the HWA-Mercedes relationship give Mercedes an advantage ahead of their rookie season as a works team?\"Toto Wolff (Mercedes Motorsport CEO) is a very clever guy,\" answers Alejandro Agag, Formula E founder and chairman, before leaving a diplomatic pause to CNN Sport's question.\"Having a team for a year learning the ropes will make them hit the ground running when they start Season Six.\"\"Exchange of ideas\"The two-way relationship between the invincible Mercedes F1 team and Fritz's electric whippersnappers is also a huge advantage when it comes to Season Six prep.Experienced race engineer Tony Ross -- who worked closely with Rosberg in his title-winning F1 campaign in 2016 and more recently with Valtteri Bottas -- has also been parachuted into the Formula E team one year early.\"We understand each other as a big, Mercedes motorsport family and of course we can benefit from each other,\" says Fritz.\"You need to be perfectly prepared, you need a good quality system in place, you need to have a strong group of people who want to extract the most out of the car, the drivers and the team -- and that can be learned from each other.\"On the technical side we benefit from what Brixworth [Mercedes' engine headquarters in England] has learnt in F1, there is a lot of exchange of ideas and a good collaboration.\"\"Very reliable\"If there is one thing likely to be worrying Mercedes' future Formula E rivals, it is the potential of the electric motors and powertrain being built in Brixworth.Mercedes' F1 juggernaut is driven by the absolute dominance of the hybrid engine masterminded ahead of the sport's major technical rule change in 2014. Now, that same team, under the leadership of Andy Cowell, is honing a high performance powertrain for its electric charge. The Season Six car -- officially named the Mercedes-Benz EQ Silver Arrow 01 -- is already up and running, ticking off 218 laps during a test in June. HWA drivers Stoffel Vandoorne and Gary Paffet reported back that the car was \"very reliable\" and \"first impressions were very good.\"Reasons to be cheerful Despite the fluidity between the Mercedes F1 and Formula E teams, there is no getting away from the fact that the two formulas are very different; you could say as distinct as grunting combustion engine motors and purring battery-powered cars.As with most things in life, money, or having less of it, is one of the key differentials.\"F1 is so shrouded in money,\" explains Nicholls. \"Mercedes are spending hundreds of millions [of dollars] in F1.\"Each team has its own brake and acceleration pedals, each team has to build their own wheel guns, it's just a nonsensical wasting of money. That spreads out the field too much in terms of being able to compete.\"But since day one Formula E has been pretty obsessed with keeping costs under control so that teams can exist and not go bust, and that keeps the competition closer.\"READ: \"When Mercedes come they come to win\"It's no surprise that the teams with the biggest budgets in F1 -- Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull -- are the teams consistently at the front of the pack. Mercedes and Ferrari reportedly spent $400m in 2018 with Red Bull dishing out $310 million.They can dedicate more resources into designing and testing new parts for the car to increase its on-track performance.The Formula E rulebook simply doesn't allow for that kind of technical naval-gazing; all the teams race with the same Gen2 cars and batteries and can only customize the car's powertrain and software. FIA regulations also say the cost of a ready-to-race car and powertrain \"shall not exceed\" 817,300 euros ($916,552).JUST WATCHEDFormula E car vs. the fastest animalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormula E car vs. the fastest animal 01:04\"In F1, Mercedes build the engine and the car and the two together are pretty much perfect,\" says Nicholls. \"But the restrictions and regulations in FE are so much tighter that I don't think that same Mercedes' dominance is possible. \"If anything they'll be behind the curve of development as you have manufacturers like Audi who've been there since day one in 2014.\"In Season Five, HWA Racelab ran a car provided by the Venturi team in a deal that is expected to see the latter outfit -- a team run by by Toto Wolff's wife Susie -- use the Mercedes powertrain next season.But HWA inherited some reliability issues and there were operational teething troubles too as the team finished ninth out of eleven teams.\"Zero mistakes\"Fritz identifies \"understanding the product\" and the one day race format as the team's biggest challenges.\"This electrical drive-train, energy management, temperature management and brake by wire are all completely new to us,\" Fritz explains. \"So we need to adapt our operations and engineering to this -- it has been a challenge.\"On the racing side ... with practice, qualifying and the race in one short day you need to be on top of things. Having new drivers and a new team hurts you more. \"You need to operate on zero mistakes in Formula E or otherwise it is incredibly tough to succeed. \"We have really learnt a lot and prepared the team we want to have next year. It's not just about knowledge and pure skill, it is about experience and that is what we're trying to put together.\"It's been a steep learning curve for the HWA Racelab team in Season FiveEven with more experience, it may ultimately be impossible for anyone to completely master Formula E's unique formula of one day racing on ever-evolving city center circuits.And the brains behind the electric racing series are always looking for new ways to make the racing less predictable and the title race even more exciting.\"This season Formula E implemented a new qualifying format that pretty much guarantees that none of the championship leaders start from the front of the grid,\" explains Nicholls. \"They go out first in qualifying so they get the worse track. That is an active sporting decision to try and mix it up and keep it random -- and it works.\"A seesawing Season Five saw Jean-Eric Vergne only defend his Formula E title at the very last race in New York while there were eight different winners in the first eight races. JUST WATCHEDVergne clinches Formula E title in New YorkReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVergne clinches Formula E title in New York 07:10So can Mercedes simply send their Silver Arrows flying into Formula E and kill off the competition?\"I don't think they'll come in and dominate,\" says Nicholls, who commentates on both Formula 1 and Formula E for the BBC.\"I can see them winning a race. It sounds stupid but you haven't actually achieved much if you win in FE -- it's so unpredictable that you can get a pole and a win if things fall into your favor. \"It's the sustained championship fight and the consistency that's important and I don't think Mercedes will be challenging for the championship in their first year.\"And what does the founder of Formula E think will happen when the silver sharks that have gobbled up the F1 competition enters his pond?\"They will struggle to have a big advantage like they have in Formula 1,\" Agag tells CNN.\"The window of technology is a lot smaller, the driver makes a big, big difference and the car is not as decisive.\"No I don't see [Mercedes domination] happening -- and I don't think anyone is particularly worried about it.\"The new Formula E season -- featuring new Mercedes and Porsche teams - begins in the desert heat of Saudi Arabia on 22 November 2019.",

While rumors of a rift between the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex were just that, the palace never claimed the two women were close either.

The royal moms have found more \"in common,\" another royal source tells CNN now, adding that their relationship \"has strengthened.\" The royal moms have found more \"in common,\" a royal source tells CNN.,This was demonstrated by the pictures that emerged recently from a polo match where the families got together to watch Princes William and Harry play. The sisters-in-law appeared again together at the Wimbledon lady's tennis final where they were spotted laughing and chatting in a seemingly natural way. The fact the two women are appearing in public together at all is a statement itself in the context of royal communications. Read MoreThere's clearly an effort underway to dispel any suggestion that the two families don't get along. When the Sussexes moved out of Kensington Palace and established their own office, it was interpreted in some parts of the media as confirmation of a rift. But courtiers said at the time it was as much to do with the Cambridges needing their own household as it was about the Sussexes wanting more independence. Meghan holds Archie as she and Catherine attend a polo match in Wokingham last week.As William and Kate rise up the line of succession and eventually take the throne, they will need their own operation. They will also need to rely more on Harry and Meghan, who will be expected to take on additional official duties, even as they carve out their own public roles. That's why it matters that the two families get on. This isn't just regular family politics, it's about the very stability of the British monarchy.

        "content": "Portrush, Northern Ireland (CNN)He came to Royal Portrush as a kid to watch his Dad play and first played the course himself as a present from his parents on his 10th birthday.Now, Rory McIlroy returns as a four-time major champion with the weight of a nation on his shoulders as his native Northern Ireland welcomes golf's 148th Open Championship for the first time in 68 years because of political strife in the province.The significance runs deep for McIlroy -- he describes it as \"surreal\" -- and his mantra this week will be to \"look around and smell the roses,\" a euphemism for taking it all in and savoring the home support he will receive as he chases a first major title for five years.   McIlroy is equally quick to recognize \"this is bigger than me.\" \"No matter who wins this week, having the Open back here is a massive thing for golf and for the country,\" McIlroy, 29, told a packed news conference at a wet and blustery Portrush Wednesday.Read More\"Sport has an unbelievable ability to bring people together.\"But as the boy who became king in these parts, a second Claret Jug would confer god-like status in Northern Ireland. READ: Tiger Woods laughs off Koepka 'snub'READ: The Open: Why a sense of humor and rhino skin are key for caddiesRory McIlroy practices ahead of the 148th Open Championship at Royal Portrush.Hero worshipMcIlroy was the nine-year-old golfing prodigy who wrote to Tiger Woods telling him he was gunning for him, and who followed through on his promise.He was the youngster from Holywood, near Belfast who won the world Under-10 golf championship. He was the mop-chaired, chubby tyke who went on a popular TV talk show and demonstrated his prowess chipping golf balls into a washing machine.He was also the thrusting young colt in ice-white trousers and shirt who broke the course record with a score of 61 at Portrush when he was just 16.He was the man who reached world No.1 and won four majors before his 25th birthday -- one of only three players to have ever done so -- with career earnings so far north of $60 million.And if he were to triumph at the Masters next year, McIlroy would become only the sixth player ever to have won all four of golf's majors at some point in his career.It's been a meteoric rise, ensuring he's exalted as Northern Ireland's biggest star.On Tuesday evening, as the shadows lengthened past 7 p.m. McIlroy spent more than 20 minutes signing autographs and posing for selfies with a never-diminishing crowd of fans by the side of the 18th green. He is well aware he was one of those hero-worshipping youngsters not so long ago. The logo on his T-shirt Tuesday was of a washing machine in a nod to the \"long winter nights\" he spent appropriating his mom's kitchen appliances for practice.Rory McIlroy set the course record of 61 at Royal Portrush as a 16-year-old.BuzzMcIlroy's legend began early as he learned the game with his father Gerry at the unassuming Holywood Golf Club outside Belfast.Instantly hooked, he'd spend every single waking hour at the club and cry when he was told it was time to go home. Gerry and mom Rosie worked multiple jobs, pouring \"every penny\" into their only child's obsession.His victory in the world Under-10 championship in Florida created the first waves. \"The buzz was going around there was this talented little kid, but it wasn't until he got into his teenage years that you started to think he could be very special,\" said Stephen Watson, who wrote and produced the BBC's \"Road to The Open\" documentary about the journey to bring golf's oldest major back to Northern Ireland for the first time since 1951. Word quickly spread about McIlroy's prodigious talent.\"I'd heard the stories of him playing for Holywood Golf Club, walking onto the first tee to play an Ulster Cup match or a senior cup match for low handicap amateurs, and his opponents saying, 'Who are you caddying for today?' and he'd go, 'No, no, I'm playing,'\" Watson told CNN Sport.JUST WATCHEDRory McIlroy: I will win the Masters ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRory McIlroy: I will win the Masters  02:23 Seeing McIlroy play for the first time at Holywood was all the proof Watson needed to know he was different.\"I just thought, 'Wow,'\" he added. \"He just hit the ball so far for someone so young and his swing was amazing. He absolutely smoked this thing down the first hole and I was like 'Really?' He was very impressive.\"Irishman Shane O'Donoghue, a long-time golf presenter, commentator and host, was equally stunned when he first saw McIlroy in action in 2004.\"He'd just turned 14 and was clearly very different,\" O'Donoghue told CNN Sport. \"He looked like a cherubic little boy but played with an exuberance that was totally different. It was like watching a virtuoso. I very quickly christened him Ireland's Mozart, in golf terms.\"Though McIlroy was well known on the amateur circuit, he came to wider prominence as a chirpy, chubby 18-year-old at the 2007 Open Championship at Carnoustie, where he tied for third after the first round, bettering the then 12-time major champion Woods by one shot. READ: Woods' 10-year plan to surpass Jack NicklausREAD: Koepka sets 'double digit' major target'Rory McIlroy won the last of his four majors in 2014. Joining the paid ranks was like adding a spark to rocket fuel.O'Donoghue has seen him grow from precocious talent into a global superstar, based in Florida with the huge mansion, fast cars and private jet.\"He was a nice, normal kid. He hasn't changed,\" adds O'Donoghue. \"Circumstances have changed phenomenally around him and he's had to deal with all of that but he's still the same Rory. At the heart of it he's still Gerry and Rosie's boy.\"Despite the fame, wealth and celebrity status, the Holywood star is still very grounded with a close coterie of school friends. When he parted company with long-time caddie JP Fitzgerald in 2017, McIlroy turned to best mate Harry Diamond to shoulder the bag. He's had the same coach, former Holywood pro Michael Bannon, since he began the game using cut-down clubs.\"As far as his personality goes, he hasn't changed a bit. He's never forgotten his roots and never forgotten his friends,\" says Watson, who reckons McIlroy has eclipsed the fame of legendary Manchester United footballer George Best.He adds: \"We had George Best, who was a globally world reknowned and very famous sports star and Rory McIlroy is equal if not bigger than that. \"It's hard to describe how popular and famous he is here. He's enormous, there is no bigger.\"McIlroy's major breakthrough came with a record-breaking victory at the 2011 US Open, two months after he infamously blew a four-shot lead with a back-nine collapse at the Masters.\"It was a sensational rebound,\" says O'Donoghue. \"He was approachable, accessible, attractive, CEOs wanted to be around him, kids wanted to be like him, men wanted to be his friend and woman wanted to either mother him or adore him. He just had the X-Factor.\"McIlroy added the US PGA title in 2012 and clinched the Open at Hoylake, near Liverpool, England in 2014.Not only that, but dad Gerry was able to collect on a bet he and three friends had struck back in 2004 at odds of 500-1 that the young Rory would win the Open \"within the next 10 years.\"They each scooped \u00a350,000.A few weeks later McIlroy added a second PGA Championship title and was the hottest property in golf.

In the 2011 Open at Royal St George's, a struggling McIlroy told reporters: \"I'm not a fan of golf tournaments predicted so much by the weather, it's not my sort of golf.\"It was blunt and created a stir. JUST WATCHEDTiger Woods completes comeback to win MastersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTiger Woods completes comeback to win Masters 02:09McIlroy gave another honest assessment of his inner thoughts, describing himself as \"brain dead\" after a disastrous first round at the Open at Muirfield in Scotland in 2013. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm walking around out there and I'm unconscious,\" he said.Then there was the mess-up with his alarm clock that meant he was nearly late for his tee time on the final day of the Ryder Cup and needed a police escort to reach the course. He still won his match against Keegan Bradley as Europe won the \"Miracle of Medinah\" in 2012.\"He's never lost that boyish quality and never lost the quality of just telling it like it is. It gets him into trouble occasionally but the great ones are all a bit dogged in their opinions and views,\" says O'Donoghue. McIlroy is back up to number three in the world and is trending in the right direction to resume his major quest. He's finished in ties for fifth, fourth and second in his last three Opens and in caddie Diamond has a man who as a talented amateur has played even more competitive rounds on the Dunluce course than he has. While they will be competing with a laser focus, McIlroy still plans to savor the experience.\"I'm going to love being out there and having the crowds and having the support.  If that can't help you, then nothing can.\"  He added: \"If I just keep putting one foot in front of the other, hopefully by Sunday that will be good enough.\"",

The writer had been in a critical condition in Rome's Santo Spirito hospital since suffering a cardiac arrest last month. \"The ever-critical conditions of these days have worsened in the last hours, compromising his vital functions,\" the hospital said in a statement to CNN. \"To respect the will of the Master and his family, the funeral will be private.

Now, with the creation of two new holes -- the seventh and eighth -- to beef up the challenge, it will be tackled by the biggest stars in the game such as McIlroy, a resurgent Tiger Woods, and the game's powerful world No.1 Brooks Koepka, whose caddie Ricky Elliott is also from Portrush.\"I don't think when he grew up that he ever thought there would be an Open Championship here,\" said Koepka, who visited Elliott's parents and took in the sights of Portrush and its infamous Harbour Bar after arriving last week. \"It would be cool to see him win.\"READ: Koepka sets 'double digit' major target'Brooks Koepka and caddie Ricky Elliott rest during a practice round at Royal Portrush.Italy's Francesco Molinari is the defending champion, but Americans have won nine of the last 10 majors, albeit four of those have come from Koepka.

        "content": "London (CNN)Theresa May railed against the forces of \"absolutism\" in politics, condemned the rise of populist parties around the world, and lamented her inability to secure Britain's exit from the European Union, in her last major speech as British Prime Minister.In a final attempt to sculpt her own political legacy, May targeted politicians of the far left and urged a softening of political discourse from leaders and the public alike -- suggesting that an entrenchment of extremist positions doomed her repeated attempts to achieve Brexit.She also criticized isolationist worldviews and stressed the importance of protecting the Paris Climate Accord and the Iran Nuclear Deal, in what will widely be seen as a rebuke of US President Donald Trump's foreign policy and his skepticism of international alliances.\"Both domestically and internationally, in substance and in tone, I am worried about the state of politics,\" May said in valedictorian-style remarks at foreign policy think tank Chatham House. \"The values on which all of our successes have been founded cannot be taken for granted.A legacy of failure: Theresa May was a disaster as Prime Minister\"The spirit of compromise in the common interest is also crucial in meeting some of the greatest global challenges of our time,\" she added, attempting to promote for a final time her own mantra of pragmatism and moderation. Read MoreMay will step aside when the winner of the ongoing Conservative leadership contest is announced next week, bringing to an end a three-year tenure that will be defined by her inability to take Britain out of the EU.\"I'm deeply disappointed that I couldn't deliver Brexit... I did everything I could,\" May said. I put my own job on the line in order to do that.\" She added her belief that \"most people across our country had a preference for getting it done with a deal.\" \"The problem was that when it came time for Parliament to ratify the deal, our politics retreated back into its binary pre-referendum positions -- a winner takes all approach to leaving or remaining,\" she reflected. \"When opinions have become polarized -- and driven by ideology - it becomes incredibly hard for a compromise to become a rallying point.\"The outgoing leader again expressed her belief that a no-deal Brexit would be an unfavorable outcome, but refused to cite her likely successor, Boris Johnson, as a partial source of her concerns. Johnson has repeatedly said he would be prepared to pursue a no-deal scenario.She instead kept her criticisms general and wide-ranging, particularly when condemning the hardening of debate that has accompanied her time in power.'Coarsening public debate'\"Today an inability to combine principles with pragmatism and make a compromise when required seems to have driven our whole political discourse down the wrong path,\" she said. \"It has led to what is in effect a form of absolutism -- one which believes that if you simply assert your view loud enough and long enough you will get your way in the end. Or that mobilizing your own faction is more important than bringing others with you.\"\"This is coarsening our public debate,\" May added. \"Some are losing the ability to disagree without demeaning the views of others.\"     She partially acknowledged a role in crafting that state of affairs, admitting when pressed by reporters that language used amid her fiery criticism of lawmakers during the Brexit impasse earlier this year hadn't been \"perfect.\"Boris Johnson, the divisive Brexit-backing populist or the charming liberal metropolitan? UK has no idea which leader it'll getElsewhere, May took the opportunity to criticize the \"once-great\" opposition Labour Party, and took direct aim at Russian President Vladimir Putin's suggestion that liberalism has \"outlived its purpose.\"And May expressed regret over President Trump's decisions to withdraw from international treaties, in particular the nuclear agreement with Iran. \"It took painstaking pragmatism and compromise to strike that deal,\" she said. \"Whether we like it or not a compromise deal remains the best way to get the outcome we all still ultimately seek -- to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and to preserve the stability of the region.\"May has expressed her intention to return to the Conservative backbenches when her eventful and frequently agonizing residence in Downing Street comes to an end.And, quoting Dwight Eisenhower's praise of a \"middle of the road\" approach, she signaled that she will continue to press for moderate policies -- an indication likely to be tested when her successor brings Brexit back atop the political agenda.\"I believe that seeking the common ground and being prepared to make compromises in order to make progress does not entail a rejection of our values and convictions by one iota, rather it is precisely the way to defend them,\" May concluded.",

However local campaign group Halte aux Mar\u00e9e Vertes claims that the victim may have been poisoned by hydrogen sulphide, a toxic gas released as the sea lettuce decomposes, reports CNN affiliate BFMTV.A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office told CNN that there are concerns over the algae and its potential effects, but he will wait until the results of ongoing tests on the victim are released before discussing more specific information.Algae blooms are increasing in size due to climate change, according to one expert.The recent death of a 70-year-old man in Douarnenez Bay raised similar concerns, according to Jean Hascoet, a member of the NGO Eau et Rivi\u00e8res, which has petitioned authorities to investigate both incidents.Record-breaking seaweed bloom stretches from West Africa to MexicoRead MoreHascoet told CNN that authorities need to do more to investigate the cause of death when people die in areas where the sea lettuce, or ulva lactuca, is present.\"There are 600 deaths per year related to swimming, so we don't say that every time it's because of algae, but we're angry because it's a hidden phenomenon,\" he said.\"We ask that every time someone dies, we need an investigation.\"Anniet Laverman, a microbiology researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) explained that more of the plants are observed in areas where there is a lot of human activity, including agriculture and the disposal of waste water in the sea.Sea lettuce, or ulva lactuca, is a growing problem in Brittany. \"Algae when they are alive, they are plants and they do not pose a problem,\" Laverman told CNN. \"But when they are dead, they degrade.\"When the sea lettuce breaks down it releases hydrogen sulphide, or H2S, she explained, a toxic gas with a smell that has been compared to rotten eggs.\"People can smell the smell of H2S but are not aware that it's a very toxic gas smell,\" said Laverman.All 21 of Mississippi's beaches are closed because of toxic algaeInes Leraud, an investigative journalist who recently published a book on the algae problems in Brittany, told BFMTV the problem is worsening due to climate change.Normally dead algae is collected from the beaches every morning but there is so much this year that it's not possible to keep up, she said.Leraud believes that there is a lack of transparency around the issue.\"There are several taboos in this story: there is a taboo on the origins of the algae and there is a taboo on the effects of the algae,\" she said.CNN has attempted to contact the Saint-Brieuc mayor's office for comment.",

More details are expected to be announced Tuesday, Crete police said.Eaton was attending a conference at the Orthodox Academy when she disappeared, apparently during a run.Last Monday, her body was discovered by two locals deep inside a cave, according to Crete's Chief of Police Konstantinos Lagoudakis.Read MoreShe was found around 60 meters (nearly 200 feet) inside the cave, beneath an air shaft that had been covered by a large wooden pallet. The underground caverns had been turned into a bunker by Nazi soldiers during the Second World War.Eaton's family have described her as an \"accomplished woman\" who possessed \"deep sensitive and compassion.\" The police said that Eaton had been asphyxiated. Minor stab wounds were also found on her body, but police said they were not believed to be the cause of her death. The police believe the body was dumped inside the cave, because it was found face down.Lagoudakis told CNN on Thursday that he had never seen a case like this in his four years as police chief.'A truly wonderful person'Tributes from Eaton's relatives -- including her mother, son and siblings -- were released by Eaton's employer, the Max Planck Institute at Dresden University in Germany. Eaton was the wife of British scientist Tony Hyman and mother of two sons, according to the institute.Eaton's sister described her as an \"accomplished woman\" of \"insatiable curiosity,\" and praised her achievements.  \"She took great pleasure in preparing exquisite meals and had an exotic fashion sense. She loved perfume. She taught and practiced Tae Kwon Do as a second-degree black belt. She finished crossword puzzles way too quickly, played concertos, and read extensively. She fit Jane Austen's strictest description of an 'accomplished woman' while maintaining a natural humility and 'insatiable curiosity',\" her sister wrote.Her sister added that Eaton would often worry about not giving her family enough time as well as devoting herself to science.She continued, \"But anyone who read of her accomplishments in the field of molecular and developmental biology, or who witnessed her joy in tutoring, comforting, and inspiring her children, or sharing with, and loving her husband, would not have suspected. With a deep sensitivity and compassion, she somehow made us all a priority.\"In a statement, the Max\u00a0Planck Institute said Eaton was \"an outstanding and inspiring scientist, a loving spouse and mother, an athlete as well as a truly wonderful person beloved to us all.\"The details surrounding Eaton's death have shocked locals, some of whom first thought she could have died in a hiking accident.

There were 327 votes against her and 22 abstentions. After being elected by a narrow margin of just nine votes over the required 374, von der Leyen called for a \"united and strong Europe.\"The 60-year-old outgoing German defense minister and multilingual mother of seven will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker, who has served as president since 2014 and will step down on October 31. She will be tasked with leading the EU's executive body and providing political guidance to the Commission, which proposes new laws, manages the EU budget and is responsible for enforcing EU law.Read MoreEurope's likely next president may need far-right votes to win. Some see that as a 'catastrophic sign'Prior to the vote, von der Leyen made a series of promises to attract the support of parliament members from across the political spectrum. Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, she said that she wanted Europe to be the first \"climate-neutral continent\" in the world, proposing a new \"green deal\" to make the EU carbon  neutral by 2050. Von der Leyen also spoke on gender equality, and said that she would propose to add violence against women to the list of EU crimes.In a letter on Monday addressed to the parliament's Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, von der Leyen had also said that she would propose a \"new pact on migration and asylum,\" that would establish a \"new way of burden sharing,\" and would plan to bring the EU's border force Frontex to 10,000 staff by 2024.'A huge challenge'Von der Leyen was congratulated by leaders across the 28-country bloc.In a message posted to Twitter, Junker congratulated von der Leyen for being the first woman to lead the commission and said: \"This job is a huge responsibility and a challenge. I am sure you will make a great president. Welcome home!\" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a Twitter post: \"Congratulations to @vonderleyen. She campaigned for a united and strong EU, now we want to work on this together. The world doesn't wait for Europe.\"Von der Leyen will assume her position on November 1, one day after Britain's current scheduled withdrawal from the EU. In a press conference after her election, Ursula von der Leyen spoke on Brexit, saying she will work in a \"constructive way\" with any new UK leader ahead of the October 31 deadline. She declined to say if she would rather see Boris Johnson or UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the frontrunners for the Conservative leadership contest to become Britain's new Prime Minister.Asked about winning the vote in a slim majority, von der Leyen said she will work with pro-European parties for \"stable majorities.\"\"I don't know who voted for me, I know it was very difficult to achieve a majority,\" she said. A controversial nominationSome German media outlets say it's \"good news\" for the military that von der Leyen is leaving her position as defense minister.\nVon der Leyen is a long-time ally to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and is the only minister to have served in Merkel's cabinet since she came to power back in 2005. In a statement, Merkel congratulated her, saying she looked forward to \"good cooperation\" with von der Leyen as \"a new partner\" in Brussels. \"After over 50 years, a German will be at the top of the European executive,\" she noted.Von der Leyen's nomination to replace Juncker was unexpected since von der Leyen wasn't even a candidate. Some have described her nomination as a backroom deal in Brussels.Ahead of the vote, von der Leyen faced a lot of criticism, particularly from Merkel's coalition partners -- the Social Democrats (SPD) -- who were upset that EU leaders ignored the top candidates after days of horse-trading. European leaders nominated von der Leyen to lead the Commission after they failed to agree on any of the nominees put forward by European political parties ahead of the EU elections. Von der Leyen beat the original frontrunner for the role, Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans.Domestically von der Leyen has been a divisive figure, with some German media outlets recently reporting that it's \"good news\" for the military that von der Leyen is leaving her position as defense minister.

Victims were housed in appalling, slum-like conditions. They were given little food and almost no pay.

Threats and violence ensured victims stayed quiet and worked hard.Inside a fire-damaged home where some of the victims had to live.'Beaten up while they slept' Police believe it was a hugely successful enterprise, making millions of pounds through trafficking and enslaving hundreds of people.

They shuffled victims around properties, and at each location they made sure there was someone to watch the slaves. \"In every house the traffickers would put someone we call the alpha male or female,\" he says. \"This person would inform the traffickers about anything suspicious.

The charity Salvation Army provides outreach and accommodation for trafficking survivors, and supported some of the victims in this case. Emilie Martin, of the group's anti-trafficking and modern slavery unit, tells CNN that this case reflects some of the broader trends she has seen in the UK. \"Some of the examples that came out in the court hearing are very typical of this type of modern slavery,\" she says. \"Things such as the conditions that the individuals were living in, the kind of hours that they work. It's very common that slave masters and traffickers will open up a bank account in their victims' names.What is modern slavery? \"It is just one of those crimes that is very much underground, and where there is a way for someone to be exploited, traffickers will abuse that.\" Peter hopes people take one thing away from their success against the Polish gang \u2014 that they've only scratched the surface. \"So often when we explain the tragic fact that slavery still exists today here in the UK, in our towns, in our cities, people seem to be surprised,\" he says.

Whether playing the role of little brother, big brother, son, or best friend,\" said Gallardo\"From a young age, I shared him with the world because I knew he was bigger than me, bigger than our mother-son bond. He fiercely pursued his passions with my full blessing and complete support. \"He was never reckless in action or deed. I trusted him implicitly. Many years ago, he evolved beyond me. \"The funny thing is, Carlin never thought of himself as a 'big deal.' I did, but I was 'just the Mom.' He still did his own laundry, picked up Sonny's dog poop. He always said, 'please' and 'thank you.'\"The Pikes Peak International Hill Climb is an annual automobile and motorcycle hillclimb to the summit.Public supportFollowing Dunne's death there has been outpouring of support for Gallardo.A GoFundMe campaign was started by Ducati North America and Pikes Peak to support her and has already raised nearly $100,000. The PPIHC Board of Directors donated $932 to represent Carlin's estimated time of 9:32 had he crossed the finish line -- that would have been a new motorcycle course record, beating the current mark by 12 seconds. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"I would like to give a massive worldwide thank you to all of Carlin's extended family and friends near and far!\" said Gallardo.\"Our family is humbled beyond words. All of your love, support, stories, videos, and pictures without a doubt have helped me -- and continue to help me. \"I am truly touched by your love and the ways in which you honor my son.

        "content": "London  (CNN)Britain has a love-hate relationship with its railways. The Victorians pioneered the country's modern rail system, which has inspired children's stories from Paddington Bear to Thomas the Tank Engine, and the beloved InterCity 125 train holds the world speed record for a passenger-carrying diesel.But the current setup is plagued by high fares, delays and overcrowding, and it's getting harder to find private companies who want to bid for the right to run services.So bad was the disruption caused by changes to last summer's timetable, that the government was prompted to launch a major review of the UK railway system.Rain, steam, speed: The beautiful railways that are part of the British landscapeOn Tuesday, the man tasked with drawing up a blueprint to overhaul the railways -- former British Airways chief executive, Keith Williams -- said the network needed someone at the helm who was independent from the government.\"Someone needs to be accountable to the public,\" Williams told the BBC in an interview. Read MoreThe British media was quick to evoke the image of the \"Fat Controller\" -- the portly character in long-running children's series Thomas the Tank Engine who single-handedly manages the railways.Tracking Europe's trainsBut just how bad is the United Kingdom's train service, compared to the rest of Europe? A 2017 study by research firm Boston Consulting Group put the UK in the middle tier of rankings of European Union countries, coming in eighth.     The study rated nations' railway systems according to punctuality, fares and accidents. Topping the list was Switzerland, which had an overall score of 7.2 out of 10. It was followed by Denmark, Finland and Germany. At the bottom of the list was Bulgaria, which the authors said offered \"relatively low value for money.\"Britain had an \"excellent\" safety rating, said the report. But its quality of service was deemed \"poor\" due to \"high fares and the relatively low punctuality of regional trains.\" The country scored 5.4 out of 10 overall.Time to rethink 90s system?Britain's railway system is the oldest in the world and Williams admitted that \"creating a railway fit for the demands of the 21st century is not going to be easy,\" in an article for the Financial Times on Tuesday.He wrote that the UK needed to \"rethink the franchising model\" that was introduced in the 1990s. \"What worked 20 years ago is now preventing innovation, long-term decision-making and stopping the railway working as a system,\" Williams said.Stunning photos of trains in the American WestBritain's rail industry was privatized in 1997 -- meaning that private franchises now operate the trains, while the state-owned Network Rail maintains the tracks. The UK government awards franchises, but in recent years that system has begun to fray, with private companies failing to make sufficient profits. Some have given up their franchises early, and others have retreated from the railway business.Williams, who has spent the last 10 months speaking to passengers, industry workers and investors across the country, said big change was required.\"We need a different relationship between the public and private sector,\" he wrote. \"One that allows train operators to get on with running services in the interests of passengers. And where ministers take far fewer decisions.\"Williams is due to present the full findings of his report in the fall.",

Monti, 42, and Bernardi, 51, were arrested for allegedly possessing and trying to selling a French-made Matra air-to-air missile, while Bergiolo, 60, was arrested for allegedly acting as an intermediary to sell weapons, a Turin police statement said.The stockpile was discovered by police who were investigating Italians \"with extremist ideology\" who had fought alongside Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass, eastern Ukraine, last July, according to the police statement.Police said the extensive arsenal found in Bergiolo's home included included nine war rifles, a Scorpion war machine gun, seven other guns, three hunting rifles, 20 bayonets, 306 firearm parts and 831 pieces of ammunition. Read MoreThe investigation relied on the help of an arms expert who contacted the suspects about purchasing the Matra missile on behalf of a third party, police said.A cache of guns and ammunition was among the haul seized by police.Throughout the course of the investigation, police used phone and data interception to view photos of the missile, which were exchanged via WhatsApp, they said.The probe brought authorities to the home of Del Bergiolo, where an array of military-grade weapons and illegally held guns were found, according to police.Del Bergiolo's house allegedly also contained Nazi swastikas and references to the Nazi military Waffen-SS unit.Investigations are ongoing to determine how the French-made Matra missile, which appeared to have once belonged to the Qatari armed forces, arrived in Italy.The political party Forza Nuova has denied any current connection with Del Bergiolo.\"If one of the arrested was a candidate of Forza Nuova way back in 2001 (18 years ago!), we affirm that on the contrary none of the people involved have been militants of Forza Nuova - which has nothing to do with the search this morning,\" a press officer for Forza Nuova told CNN. Del Bergiolo's lawyer, Fausto Moscatelli told CNN his client is a \"weapons enthusiast.\"\"My client is a collector and they sequestered weapons that were in his home. These weapons were not registered, but they were not connected to terrorism,\" Moscatelli said.\"There was a misunderstanding with the Nazi paraphernalia, he also had fascist and USSR paraphernalia, but they (the police) only took things with swastikas,\" he added.Monti and Bernardi's lawyer Alberto Minasi della Rocca told CNN that his clients \"present, in a firm, clear and categorical manner, that they have nothing to do with extreme right-wing or ultra-nationalist circles\" and are \"light years away from that world.\"This story has been updated to correct the date the suspects were arrested.CNN's Rob Picheta contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Portrush, Northern Ireland (CNN)Everything's a bit slower and more methodical with Tiger Woods these days. The walk, the practice range sessions, even the delivery in his press conferences. Where once burned a prickly intensity, he now faces his inquisitors with something akin to rapprochement.Where once he gave nothing away, Woods seems more open to letting us in. Or at least, now and again. Perhaps he's tiring of the fight, or maybe just relieved to be still of interest.Ahead of the 148th Open Championship at Royal Portrush Tuesday, a relaxed, more reflective Woods was asked whether he had tapped into any of the local knowledge of the likes of Portrush local Graeme McDowell or Northern Ireland natives Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke. Or even Ricky Elliott, caddie to world No.1 Brooks Koepka, and another born and bred in the seaside town on Northern Ireland's north coast. Read More\"Tell you a funny story,\" said Woods, explaining how he had texted Koepka to congratulate him on another good finish at the US Open. \"And I said, 'hey dude, do you mind if I tag along and play a practice round [at Portrush].

Mmm, mmm.\"    Woods described Royal Portrush as \"wonderful\" and an \"unbelievable golf course,\" adding it was \"amazing\" the Open hasn't been played here since 1951. He either missed or glossed over the fact that political and social strife -- the infamous \"Troubles,\" which many hope are a thing of the past since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement -- are the reason the province has been overlooked for golf's oldest major for so long.  Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosCut off from KoepkaWoods chewed gum and occasionally stooped slowly to drink from a cup during his leisurely morning range session among the dunes of Portrush's dramatic linksland.A three-time champion, Woods won his last Open title at Hoylake near Liverpool in England in 2006, but he sent shockwaves around Carnoustie last summer as he briefly took the lead haflway through the final round during his comeback year from spinal fusion surgery.We are sure to see some drama on the 18th hole at Royal Portrush \u26f3\ufe0f #TheOpen pic.twitter.com/qkgLLiFGC1\u2014 The Open (@TheOpen) July 15, 2019 \nHis remarkable Masters victory in April, a first major for 11 years and 15th in all, was final confirmation the 43-year-old's career is somewhat back on track.  Woods struggled in the ensuing PGA Championship and US Open, revealing Tuesday the Masters took a lot out of him -- \"that golf course puts so much stress on the system\" --  and admitted it's \"hard to believe I pulled it off.\"READ: Koepka sets 'double digit' major target' But Koepka's phone silence speaks volumes.The impressive Koepka has won four of his last nine majors and has been second in two more this season, including behind Woods at Augusta. So he knows only too well that on the right course, in the right week, Woods can be a major threat.Woods, however, has an eye on the changeable weather forecast this week. Colder temperatures inhibit his back, saved from the brink by spinal fusion surgery two years ago.  He's also undercooked on the golf course, having recently spent time in Thailand with his family.\"It's not quite as sharp as I'd like to have it right now,\" said Woods, sporting a white tape on the second finger of his right hand and a red, white and blue beaded bracelet next to his silver watch on the left.Brooks Koepka and caddie Ricky Elliott, a Portrush native, ahead of the Open Championship. 'Art to playing links golf'At least Woods is not the only one who can't be accused of overdoing things.Koepka admitted the only time he practices is before major tournaments. \"Regular tournaments, I don't practice,\" he said, displaying a sparkle most golf fans would like to see more of. \"If you've seen me on TV, that's when I play golf.\"He did add, ominously, that coming second in two of the year's three majors was not good enough. \"Finishing second sucks,\" he said. He won't like this stat then -- since 1986 only Woods has won the Open as world No.1. But despite his advancing years and physical frailties, Woods takes comfort in the feats of Tom Watson, who went so close to winning the Open at Turnberry at 59, or Greg Norman, who was 53 when he tied for third at Royal Birkdale in 2008.\"There is an art to playing links golf,\" said Woods, referring to the type of undulating, seaside courses among sand dunes used to host the Open championship. \"It allows players who don't hit the ball very far to run the golf ball out there. Being able to control the ball in the air to control it on the ground allows the older players to have a chance to do well in the Open Championship.\"Tiger Woods talks to reporters ahead of The Open at Royal Portrush.Woods revealed in the build-up to the Open he has been getting up at 1 a.m. back home in Florida to acclimatize for coming over to Portrush.The body clock might be rewired, but Woods knows the clock is ticking on his career. But where once a question such as, \"how are you going to celebrate if you win the Claret Jug?\" might have been shot down, the questioner perhaps treated to a death stare, the latest Woods model just laughed along.\"I've got a few days to work on that part,\" he chuckled. \"Let's take it one step at a time.\"",

He became a bagman full-time when given voluntary redundancy from his job in the printing industry. At the time, he planned to do it for six months to a year and then find what he called \"a proper job\".So what does the job entail? \"It's hard to define but a caddie is a little bit of everything really,\" he said. \"First, it's our job to understand the golf course, it's a bit like the navigator to a rally driver. You're there as a support system, knowing the wind, how a shot is playing, where you need to land it and what it's going to do.\"But there's the psychology side. The conversations when a player's five over or five under are very different but you need to get the best out of any situation, to turn a 76 into a 74 or a 66 into a 64. You need to know when you need to speak up and, more importantly, you have to know when to shut up.\"READ: Woods' Masters win has Nicklaus 'shaking in my boots' Tiger Woods celebrates with caddie Joe LaCava after winning the 2019 Masters at Augusta. At 52, Mundy still loves the job -- \"apart from being a sports person, it's the next best thing\" -- although his body has felt its impact with three herniated discs in his back causing him to take time away in recent years.He has known caddies who have not liked their employers, but still click on the course. But his friendship with Poulter has been the secret to their success, he says.\"Like everyone else, I think I thought he'd be brash, cocky and arrogant,\" said Mundy, looking back at their first pairing.\"I had the same perception as everyone else but that's just his on-course persona. We have the odd giggle and he's a great family man. I knew within half an hour of working with him that we'd be good. I think of him as a great mate and our friendship has helped the longevity.\"When he began, Mundy was scrabbling to break even as a caddie, sharing a room with three others at tournaments to keep down costs. There are still times when caddies feel treated like second-class citizen, he says.\"You still get some things that happen and you think, 'You cannot be serious,' when you can't get food or a place to even stand inside when the weather's dire and play's been abandoned,\" he said. \"But we're looked after better and better each year.\"READ: How Tony Jacklin hijacked CNN anchor's parents' weddingREAD: Using CBD a 'no-brainer,' says Bubba WatsonMundy (left) wearing Augusta's traditional jumpsuit while working for Ian Poulter at the Masters. Mundy and McNeilly have earned an impressive living from their craft, but caddies are often at the whim of their employers. Some golfers are often quick to blame their bag men and part ways with a caddie.\"It's never a nice feeling if you get the sense you're going to lose your job,\" said McNeilly. \"It's a fickle game and I've been fortunate. I've been lucky with the players I've worked with. I work hard and I like the players I work for to work hard, too. And I'm always learning in a non-stop business. Once you think you know it all you're in trouble. My job is still to get the best out of my player.\"While most people of his age are in retirement, the Northern Irishman has no plans to hang up his caddie bib. The one thing missing from his resume is a major win, and he believes he can achieve that with Wallace before retiring.\"The reason I caddie is to have fun,\" said McNeilly. \"But it's also to contend in the majors.\" As for Mundy, he thought an elusive major might finally come his way in the latter stages of the Masters in April, only for Poulter's challenge to falter late on as Woods came through to clinch his 15th major title. Both remain reliant on their employers to shine in order to earn a living, but with both players earning in excess of $1 million already on the PGA Tour alone this season, neither McNeilly or Mundy are likely to have to resort to the room shares of their early years.",

When the crowd is chanting 'Roger,' I hear 'Novak.' It sounds silly but it is like that.

He drew jeers on one occasion after tamely striking his racket against a courtside microphone near the umpire's stanchion in the fifth set. The only other time, he fist pumped -- quietly -- after winning a 23-shot rally in the third-set tiebreak. A muted Djokovic perhaps could have been a factor into why his performance dipped alarmingly at times.Why so restrained? In his semifinal win over Roberto Bautista Agut, Djokovic pointed to his ear to ask the crowd to show him more love after winning an even longer rally, 45 strokes, the longest in recorded Wimbledon history.Winning the extended exchange fired him up and he proceeded to cruise for the majority of the last two sets.     But the reaction against Bautista Agut counted against him among traditionalists. For Djokovic's critics, it was just another reason to castigate him. Indeed that he asks for the crowd to get behind him -- and it wasn't the first time -- seems to displease many. That behavior is fairly routine in team sports but in the eyes of some, tennis is a different, more polite sport where such emotion shouldn't be tolerated.Djokovic's peer Nick Kyrgios said this about him in May: \"I just feel like he has a sick obsession with wanting to be liked,\" the brash Australian uttered in a podcast with tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg. \"Like he wants to be like Roger (Federer). I just can't stand him. This whole celebration thing he does after matches, it's so cringeworthy,\" he added, referring to Djokovic's gesture that's been described as \"boob throwing\" online. \"If I play him and I beat him, I'm doing his celebration in front of him,\" added Kyrgios. \"That would be hilarious.\"Djokovic celebrates match point against David Goffin.READ: Djokovic saves match points to beat Federer in historic finalREAD: Coco Gauff: How do you protect a 15-year-old tennis prodigy?An uphill battleKyrgios is no saint, mind you.  And it's worth noting he gets along with Federer and Andy Murray, so would only have good things to say about them. Conversely, he isn't close with Djokovic or Rafael Nadal. But even when Djokovic lets his tennis do the talking, he still plays third fiddle to Federer and Nadal. On Sunday, a huge chunk of fans inside the stadium cheered his errors, including double faults. The atmosphere, however, was relatively tame compared to when Djokovic lost to Federer at the French Open in 2011. That day it was like Federer played for France in a Davis Cup final at home in a decisive fifth match. To be fair to the French supporters, they got behind Djokovic in 2016 as he completed his grand slam collection at Roland Garros.

Retiring from matches when younger, his occasional brash talk -- he thought he had the better of Nadal at the 2006 French Open despite being down two sets, then retiring -- and imitating players' serves could be lingering in the minds of fans with long memories.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosGo back to the 2007 US Open when Djokovic copied the serves of Nadal and Maria Sharapova after a win and it sure seemed like the fans in New York loved it. Don't forget that Federer threw plenty of rackets in his younger days while Murray chirped at his box and didn't win any contests for body language. Their behavior changed and Federer in particular has a following like no other in tennis. Once Federer and Nadal retire, it is likely Djokovic will become a sentimental favorite and all his achievements -- by that time, he could have taken over the men's grand slam lead while also having winning records against the duo -- will be appreciated. He won't be begrudged for taking away grand slam titles from the sensational pair who came before him.  So even if he may never be as popular as Federer or Nadal, getting beyond their grand slam hauls could be big enough consolation for the Serb.",

        "content": "(CNN)Germany's Ursula von der Leyen is on the verge of succeeding Jean-Claude Juncker to become the European Commission's first female president on Tuesday -- if leaders of the 28 EU member states have their way.A long-time ally to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the only minister to have served in Merkel's cabinet since she came to power back in 2005, von der Leyen's nomination to replace Juncker was unexpected since she wasn't even a candidate.\"She didn't campaign, she never came out, she didn't take part in any debate,\" explains Anna Nadibaidze from the policy think tank, Open Europe.Von der Leyen has long been an ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her longest-serving minister.European leaders nominated the German defense minister to lead the Commission after they failed to agree on any of the \"Spitzenkandidat\" nominees -- who are put forward by European political parties ahead of the EU elections. Von der Leyen beat the original frontrunner for the role -- Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans.And while her nomination was supported by a majority of EU leaders, it's unclear if she'll receive the same support when 751 Members of the European Parliament vote to approve the appointment on Tuesday.Read MoreNomination seen as a 'backroom' deal Von der Leyen, 60, may not receive the majority she requires from parliament, due to critics branding her nomination a \"backroom\" deal. \"Her nomination is mostly seen as a French-German deal that was done behind closed doors and some people call it a stitch-up,\" Nadibaidze told CNN.New-look Europe is having a nightmare first week\"That's the danger -- that she might not get accepted specifically because of the process.\"Domestically, Nadibaidze says, von der Leyen has faced a lot of criticism, particularly from Merkel's coalition partners -- the Social Democrats (SPD), who are upset that EU leaders ignored the top candidates after days of horse-trading.\"They think she's one of the weakest ministers (and) that she couldn't command the army,\" Nadibaidze explains. \"There was also an article in the German press saying that how the German army is happy to get rid of her.\"Some German media outlets say it's \"good news\" for the military that von der Leyen is leaving her position as defense minister.Born in Brussels and multilingual, there's no denying von der Leyen has a European background -- something, Nadibaidze says, the German has been using to her advantage \"when she tries to convince MEPs to vote for her.\"She has also followed in the footsteps of her father, Ernst Albrecht, who was a Christian Democratic Union (CDU) politician and a senior European civil servant.Ursula von der Leyen is pictured with her  husband Heiko von der Leyen and their seven children.When von der Leyen was grilled by MEPs last Wednesday, as she made her pitch on why lawmakers should vote for her, she switched between German, French and English.She said it was vital to improve the \"competitiveness\" of the EU's economy, that Europeans want a \"united, strong, open-minded\" EU and that the bloc needed to \"become more assertive\" towards the US.Von der Leyen also told MEPs that she was fully committed to the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, but in order to do so the EU needed to be \"more ambitious and more bold.\"Left-leaning groups 'deeply unhappy'As a member of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), von der Leyen can rely on the support of allied MEPs from the largest political group in parliament -- the European People's Party (EPP).Von der Leyen's colleague from the CDU, Gunther Krichbaum, says he's known her for many years, and told CNN he was convinced she would be an excellent president.\"She has always been extremely competent, assertive and reliable, but also always conciliatory,\" he added.Von der Leyen told MEPs last Wednesday that it was vital to improve the \"competitiveness\" of the EU's economy.But when it comes to support from the EU's left-leaning groups -- it's a different story.The EU's second largest political group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D) -- which has 154 seats in parliament -- has said it is \"deeply unhappy\" about von der Leyen's nomination, believing Timmermans \"was by far the best-qualified candidate and was the person to deliver the change Europe needs.\"The S&D added that \"large questions remain\" following von der Leyen's grilling last week, and that it was awaiting a reply to a letter outlining that party's key demands before deciding whether it will vote in favor for her or not.Europe's old guard is punished by voters demanding changeMeanwhile, both the Greens/European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group and the Confederal Group of the European United Left -- Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) have announced that they would not be supporting her because of her policy vagueness.Greens/EFA MEP Sven Giegold called von der Leyen \"unspecific\" on where she stands, with \"largely evasive\" responses, \"rather than clear attitudes and positions.\"\"The next EU Commission must act harder, not softer, against the breach of European values,\" Giegold told CNN. Both groups also said despite von der Leyen telling lawmakers last Wednesday that she supports the EU going carbon neutral by 2050, it was not enough.Greens/EFA President Ska Keller said in a statement that the group does not see \"how change will be possible\" with a candidate like her. Presidency 'might be compromised' If von der Leyen's nomination is approved by MEPs in a secret ballot on Tuesday evening, she'll lead the EU's executive body and provide political guidance to the Commission -- which proposes new laws, manages the EU budget and is responsible for enforcing EU law. 8 key takeaways from the European election 2019 resultsHowever, if she commands a majority by relying on nationalists in eastern Europe, her presidency \"might be compromised,\" right from the start, Nadibaidze says.To secure a majority, von der Leyen will likely need the support of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) -- which is largely made up of MEPs from Poland's populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, and the right-wing Identity and Democracy group -- formed by Matteo Salvini's Italian Northern League and Marine Le Pen's French National Rally.\"If they support her and the Greens don't, that's going to be very strange to see,\" Nadibaidze told CNN.\"She's going to have a lot of trouble because the Greens are an important group -- they're the fourth largest, they're pro-EU, they've been growing in the last years and I just don't see it lasting so long without their support in Parliament, especially if euroskeptic parties and even the far-right support her.\"Outgoing EU Council President Donald Tusk (right) called the likely appointments of von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde as ECB chief \"a perfect gender balance.\"Greens/EFA MEP Giegold told CNN that von der Leyen \"should now avoid forming a majority with the votes of the right-wing populists in parliament.\"\"If von der Leyen was to take office from the enemies of Europe, that would be a catastrophic sign,\" he added.If on Tuesday MEPs reject von der Leyen's presidency, European leaders will need to head back to the drawing board.",

I said we had the rub of the green,\" added the England captain.Moeen Ali of England and Adil Rashid of England parade the World Cup trophy.\"It actually epitomizes our team. It has quite diverse backgrounds and cultures, guys growing up in different countries and are at the stage in their career where they actually find humor in the situation we were in at the time was pretty cool.\"Rashid and Moeen Ali, both of Pakistani heritage are at the very heart of this England squad. Nowhere is that better illustrated than the respect shown towards the pair by their teammates upon winning the World Cup. Aware that both men are observant Muslims and do not drink alcohol, the squad celebrated without champagne before allowing the pair to walk away before the traditional uncorking ceremonial splash down.Ben Stokes produced a heroic innings to fire England to World Cup glory.Much of this England victory was owed to those born outside of the country who have made this their home.Ben Stokes, born in New Zealand before moving to the UK as a 12-year-old, will no doubt go down in history for his performance in helping England snatch victory from all but certain defeat. Stokes' Dad has even joked that he's now the most hated father in New Zealand.The 28-year-old Stokes' unbeaten 84, which included that hugely controversial moment when a fielder's throw hit his bat before racing to the boundary, will be played over and over again for years to come.England's Jofra Archer celebrates after victory in the 2019 Cricket World Cup final So too will the contribution of Jofra Archer, the 24-year-old fast bowler born in Barbados, now playing for his father's country of birth. Archer, one of the most exciting exponents of fast bowling of the game, has the potential to be one of the best England has ever had.He, like Stokes, is a player that makes you want to pick up a bat and ball, walk to the park, and pretend, at least for five minutes, that you can be a world beater too.READ: Inside the world's first LGBT cricket teamREAD: New Zealand stuns India in World Cup semifinalJason Roy, who will no doubt also inspire many a young child in the playground with his powerful batting at the top of the order, was born in Durban, South Africa, before moving to the UK as a child. Like many workplaces, this England set up is a truly international one, reaching beyond the cultural divide. Led by an Australian coach in Trevor Bayliss, it arguably provides a reminder of the benefits of inclusion.Though on Twitter, in the aftermath of England's victory, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer, tweeted that the victory meant, \"we clearly don't need Europe to win.\"That tweet was widely criticized for misjudging the national mood.LegacyBefore a ball had been bowled, before a bat had been raised, Morgan had been clear about what he hoped his team would achieve at the World Cup.Yes, he wanted England to win. Of course, that was obvious. England had never in 44 years of the competition managed to win the Cricket World Cup. It had not reached a final for 27 years. But Morgan, was also keen to stress that this was not just solely about winning. It was about inspiring the next generation.Turn on the radio, open a newspaper or just scroll through social media, and it becomes instantly obvious that Morgan and his side has achieved just that.Radio phone-ins were besieged with parents retelling stories of how their children, who had never watched cricket before, ran around the house in celebration while chanting the names of Stokes and  Archer.England's Ben Stokes, (L)  Jofra Archer (C) and Adil Rashid played a key role in winning the World Cup.One caller to the BBC retold the story of how he watched the game unfold with his son and when England finally secured victory, his boy turned to him and said: \"I want Ben Stokes to be my dad.\"Online, the demand for cricket was insatiable. According to the BBC, its live blog for the Cricket World Cup final received an astonishing 39.7 million views, the highest the website has received across news and sport this year.In print, the coverage was as one would expect on such occasion.Now that's a wrap ... @thetimes pic.twitter.com/3J7khVzyB4\u2014 Jeremy Griffin (@jgriffintimes) July 14, 2019\n\nThe faces of the England players adorned the front and back pages.

And I'm sure people who had never even watched cricket before, when they heard something called a super over was going may have even switched on.\"Switched on and turned on at the prospect of an Ashes series, the great Test cricket rivalry between England and Australia to come next month, the British public will now expect more success.For England, and for cricket, the time is now. Another legacy awaits. It will never have a better opportunity to inspire the next generation",

        "content": "(CNN)History was made at Wimbledon on Saturday but if you were rooting for Serena Williams, it wasn't what you hoped for. Simona Halep became the first Romanian to win Wimbledon when she stunned the American 6-2 6-2 in what had to be one of the finest performances in a final in the tournament's recent history. Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"She really played out of her mind,\" Williams told the crowd.  Petra Kvitova's 6-3 6-0 victory over Eugenie Bouchard in 2014 sprung to mind as another glittering display. Halep needed only one more minute than the Czech, 56, to see off the 37-year-old Williams. Carved into #Wimbledon history...How does it feel, @Simona_Halep? \u263a\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/B7bZXhiFKh\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 13, 2019\n\nRead MoreHer three unforced errors were the fewest in a Wimbledon final since records were kept in 1998. \"I've always been intimidated a little bit when I faced Serena,\" Halep, who struck 13 winners, told reporters. \"She's an inspiration for everyone and the model for everyone. \"Today I decided before the match that I'm going to focus on myself and on the final of a grand slam, not on her. That's why I was able to play my best, to be relaxed, and to be able to be positive and confident against her.\" Defeating AzarenkaHalep claimed her second major after the 2018 French Open. Losing in the quarterfinals last month to unseeded US teen Amanda Anisimova as the defending champion provided extra motivation for Wimbledon, according to her grand slam winning manager Virginia Ruzici. And once Halep beat twice grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka in the third round, Ruzici predicted she would go on and win the tournament. Williams, meanwhile, fell in a third straight grand slam final for the first time in her record-breaking career.

Osaka's response brought her to tearsAll have been on her comeback after becoming a mom in September 2017. \"For me any loss is not easy,\" said Williams. \"When someone plays lights out, there's really not much you can do. You just have to understand that was their day today. \"Hopefully I can raise the level of my game sometimes.\"Simona Halep of Romania was winning her second grand slam title after a comprehensive 6-2 6-2 beating of Serena Williams in the Wimbledon women's singles final.She has been short of matches due to a knee injury this season that hindered her French Open. \"Seems like every grand slam final I'm in recently has been an unbelievable effort to get there,\" Williams added. \"It would be interesting to see how it would be under different circumstances.\"Perhaps the US Open is where Williams will tie Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 majors. Royal watchersWatching Saturday from the Royal Box were Williams' friend, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, whom Halep met afterward. \"She's very kind, very nice,\" said Halep, who also reveled in becoming a member of the All England Club after winning the title. Halep is a different type of player to the attacking Kvitova, a superb counterpuncher. And unlike Kvitova, grass has never been her favorite surface. Rather it has been the clay. But Halep was so good in her first Wimbledon final it took her until the seventh game to make one unforced error. A lovely day for some tennis, amirite? Kate and Meghan arrive at the #Wimbledon Women's Singles Final today where Meghan's good friend #SerenaWilliams is playing. \ud83c\udfbe pic.twitter.com/7hUxWOrDEZ\u2014 InStyle (@InStyle) July 13, 2019\n\n\"When you think you play Serena who has so much power and has all the shots in the game and is such a complete player and immense champion, to win in two sets, it's even a double performance,\" Ruzici told a small group of reporters.Halep's athleticism and retrieving seemed to destabilized Williams -- and early -- contributing to the top server women's tennis has ever seen hitting a mere two aces.\"Everybody told me, be careful, because Serena will all the time start with 3-0 or something like this,\" Halep's coach Daniel Dobre told a small group of reporters as Halep sat at a table nearby and celebrated with friends and family. Instead \"it was 0-3 with two breaks, so it was unbelievable,\" he continued. Halep may own a 2-9 record against Williams but both her wins have been resounding, the other being a 6-0 6-2 result at the WTA finals in Singapore in 2014 that gave her a boost of confidence. \"Today I just went for it like in Singapore,\" said Halep. \"I had that image in my head. I really believed there is the chance to do the same thing.\" The world No. 7 said she had a few butterflies before the encounter yet it didn't show. She broke Williams in the first game, part of a run where she claimed seven consecutive points. Sublime backhandHalep showed why she's one of the best movers around when she chased a ball in her forehand corner, then finished with a sublime backhand cross court near the net. Williams knew all about Halep but in case she needed another reminder, that was it. Halep got some luck in the third game, seeing her ball off the net cord stay inside the court while Williams' reply clipped the tape and landed on her side. Also one of tennis' fiercest returners, Halep earned a double break advantage with a backhand return winner down the line. There were few moments for Serena Williams to celebrate during a comprehensive defeat.It was all working for Halep as she struck an ace to get to 4-0. Williams -- who led the event in aces and had hit the fastest serve so far -- didn't hit an ace until set two. Halep's first unforced error incredibly came at 5-1, 15-0 -- a forehand into the net -- but it certainly didn't put her off. Two points later summarized the opener.  Williams crushed a backhand cross court. Maybe not expecting it to come back, even from the speedy Halep, it did, and Williams' backhand reply landed in the net for one of her 26 unforced errors. Williams was 2-8 in grand slam finals when dropping the opener -- her last win came in 2005 -- so it spelled trouble for the seven-time champion. Flawless tennisIn the first five games in the second set, Halep made just one unforced error. Yes, she continued to be stingy. Halep dug out from 15-30 at 0-1, then broke for 3-2 when Williams put a backhand long. A seemingly simple point for some with Halep out of position, but the 27-year-old's tenacity throughout could have prompted the miss. \"I think I was over-hitting, trying to go for too much,\" said Williams. \"She was just getting a tremendous amount of balls back.\" Simona Halep kept up the pressure with a display of flawless tennis in a 56-minute final.Halep then saved the next game from 15-30 to get to 4-2 and broke again for 5-2. Williams' serve finally clicked to prolong that game but when they were embroiled in baseline rallies, Halep won the majority of the points, mirroring the match. And a first Wimbledon title was officially hers when Williams' forehand landed in the net. Halep sunk to her knees and took it all in for a second. \"You just feel light, you feel everything it's beautiful,\" said Halep. Her display was one for the ages.",

There are times where the unpredictable nature of sport can do the most incredible things to the human body.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThis sporting contest, this rollercoaster of emotions, this cricket match. How do you sum up one of the most ridiculously dramatic matches the game has ever seen?For 27 years, England has dreamed of the day it would have another opportunity to play in a Cricket World Cup final. Perhaps, after the most astonishing of finales to a final the game has ever witnessed, it was worth the wait. England's Ben Stokes hit an unbeaten 84 to inspire his side to victory.That this game was shown free-to-air on UK television, the first live men's England international to be broadcast on terrestrial since 2005, may prove a masterstroke. Read MoreWho wouldn't, after watching this, be inspired to pick up a bat and hit out like Ben Stokes? Or grab a ball and race towards the crease like Jofra Archer? England triumphed over New Zealand at Lord's Sunday after coming out on top in a pulsating Super Over after the scores were tied after 50 overs. Not only did it win, it did so in a way that will be remembered for a generation to come.After both teams reached 241, England doing so off the final ball of its innings, it was the host nation that came out on top in the most dramatic of circumstances.A Super Over, six extra deliveries for each side, is cricket's answer to the penalty shootout. That New Zealand should equal England's total of 15 and still lose because of its opponents higher boundary rate in the original 50 overs, will rankle.England will not care too much, though. England's captain Eoin Morgan celebrates with the World Cup trophy.For England, a first men's World Cup title in its first final for 27 years. This victory, in front of a capacity crowd at Lord's will be remembered for a team's stubborn refusal to yield when all odds seemed against it and an incredible test of nerve under the fiercest of pressure.And yet, it is impossible to not feel for this New Zealand side, one of the most talented and underrated teams in world cricket, captained by the hugely impressive Kane Williamson.Four years ago New Zealand was blown away by Australia in the World Cup final, this time, it came within a millimeter of winning the tournament for the very first time.That the entire contest should have been turned on its head by a single incident involving a man born in New Zealand, wearing England blue, will not be lost on those in black.READ: New Zealand stuns India in semifinalREAD: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says RichardsREAD: Inside the world's first LGBT cricket teamBen Stokes, born in Christchurch but moved to England at the age of 12, has been one of the team's outstanding players for many a year. And typically, in this contest, against the country of his birth, it was his contribution that swung the final.With three balls of England's innings remaining, and his team requiring nine for victory, Stokes hit the ball towards the boundary and set off to claim two quick runs. Racing back for the second against the fielder's throw, Stokes dived into his crease with bat outstretched to make his ground, unwittingly diverting the oncoming thrown ball past the wicketkeeper and to the boundary for four. It was a total fluke. Nobody, least of all Stokes, could quite believe what had happened. New Zealand's Henry Nicholls celebrates after scoring a half-century.For Stokes, who made an unbeaten 84 in his side's run chase, it was just another moment in an extraordinary contest in front of a capacity crowd held hostage by the drama.At the heart of the dram was Stokes, without whom New Zealand would surely be celebrating its first-ever World Cup title.For so long it appeared that Kane Williamson, the New Zealand captain, had pulled off yet another masterclass.After posting 242, his bowlers set about strangling England's top order with some inspired bowling.New Zealand's Colin de Grandhomme celebrates taking the wicket of England's Joe Root.At 86-4 the game looked New Zealand's. But there is a reason that England, the pre-tournament favorite, is the world's No.1 ranked team.In Buttler and Stokes it had two players perfect for the occasion. Buttler's 59 off 60 took England to within touching distance before Stokes led England if not quite home, to the driveway at the very least.When Mark Wood was run out attempting to win the tie off the final ball, Stokes was left all alone unbeaten on 84 and with one eye firmly fixed on a Super Over.With the crowd on its feet, most in disbelief, Stokes appeared to remain the calmest man inside Lord's.England's Jos Buttler celebrates on the pitch.Both he and Buttler strode back out for the Super Over, hitting 15 off six deliveries to leave New Zealand requiring 16 to win.Such a total appeared quite modest once Jimmy Neesham had taken aim at England's Jofra Archer, leaving his side requiring two off the final ball for victory.Martin Guptill, the man charged with hitting the winning shot, smashed the ball as hard as he could as he set off on a quick run.But as he turned to race back, the ball arrowed towards the stumps from the arm of Jason Roy towards Buttler, who broke the stumps and New Zealand hearts.\"It's coming home, it's coming home, cricket's coming home,\" sang the England fans.Cricket may indeed have come home, but a sneaking suspicion says their heroes may not be home until the early hours of the morning after this truly remarkable triumph.",

Match points came and wentDjokovic had earlier saved the two match points at 7-8 in the fifth. One came via a gutsy forehand pass. It was a hat-trick of woe in that respect for the eight-time champion, who also saw Djokovic save match points against him in successive US Open semifinals in 2010 and 2011. Furthermore, Federer lost in the quarterfinals 12 months ago after holding a match point against Anderson.

Indeed he led the first tiebreak 5-3 and had a set point in the third prior to the tiebreak. \"He could have won in straight sets, in four, but big credit to Novak who mentally was strong out there,\" Jonas Bjorkman, a former top five player in singles and doubles, told a pair of reporters. \"He looked down, he still managed to come back and fight and that match point pass. \"Okay maybe it was not the best Federer approach but still at that time it was a great move to come forward and put on the pressure and Djokovic delivered.\"Federer struck an incredible 94 winners coupled with 62 unforced errors while Djokovic tallied 54 and 52, respectively. Federer also won 14 more points overall. \"I just feel like it's an incredible opportunity missed,\" he told reporters. \"I can't believe it.\"Federer lost the previous longest final at Wimbledon to Nadal 9-7 in the fifth set in 2008, a battle considered the greatest tennis match ever. \"This one is more straightforward maybe in some ways because we didn't have rain delays, we didn't have night coming in and all that stuff,\" Federer said, comparing the two. \"But sure, epic ending, so close, so many moments. I'm sure there's similarities. \"I'm the loser both times, so that's the only similarity I see.\" For parts of the contest, Djokovic looked out of sorts, though Federer's attacking onslaught surely contributed.But he played the tiebreaks better, despite the overwhelming majority of the 15,000 on center court rooting for his opponent.

I was defending. He was dictating the play. \"I just tried to fight and find a way when it mattered the most, which is what happened.\" His 16 majors have pulled the world No. 1 to within four of the Swiss for the first time ever.  No. 17 soon?The top of the list in this Big Three era reads like this: Federer on 20, Nadal on 18 and Djokovic on 16. Federer has edged Nadal for years, with Djokovic moving into sole possession of third ahead of Pete Sampras by virtue of his title at the Australian Open in January. Next year could see an even more seismic shift, especially if Djokovic gets to 17 at the US Open in September where he will be -- as it currently stands -- the substantial favorite. \"It's gonna be a tight race,\" Bjorkman, beaten by Federer in the 2006 semifinals, said. \"I think this was a massive loss for Roger in those terms because he's not going to maybe have too many opportunities and I think the other two will have more chances than him purely because of age.\"JUST WATCHEDDuchesses Meghan and Kate seen at WimbledonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDuchesses Meghan and Kate seen at Wimbledon 00:36At 32, Djokovic is five years younger than Federer and one year junior to Nadal. \"It seems like I'm getting closer, but also they're winning slams,\" said Djokovic. \"We're kind of complementing each other. We're making each other grow and evolve and still be in this game.\"The fact that they made history of this sport motivates me as well, inspires me to try to do what they have done, what they've achieved, and even more.\"Whether I'm going to be able to do it or not, I don't know. I'm not really looking at age as a restriction of any kind for me, at least.\"It just depends how long I'm going to play...it depends not only on myself, it depends on circumstances in life.\"Djokovic hadn't faced a top-20 player at Wimbledon this fortnight until Federer but ultimately handled the step up in quality to deprive the soon-to-be 38-year-old of a ninth title at Wimbledon to tie Martina Navratilova. Federer last downed Djokovic at a grand slam in 2012 and fell in their two other final duels at Wimbledon. Showing his class, Djokovic additionally hasn't lost to Nadal at a grand slam -- outside the Spaniard's stronghold of Roland Garros -- since 2013. He may not be as popular as Federer and Nadal -- not getting as much love from fans does irk Djokovic -- but he is beating them regularly when it counts. JUST WATCHEDTearful Roger Federer remembers late coachReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTearful Roger Federer remembers late coach 03:21The first set certainly counted Sunday in slightly chilly, overcast conditions.First set keyDjokovic held a 21-1 record against Federer when winning the opening set, the lone reverse coming in the Swiss' second home of Dubai. You could also call Wimbledon Federer's home given all his success at SW19 but there was no comeback on this occasion. Djokovic's 3-1 lead in the first tiebreak evaporated, with Federer storming back for a 5-3 advantage. He did virtually all of the dictating, often neutralizing Djokovic with a backhand slice before letting rip on both his forehand and backhand. But two forehand errors made it 5-5 and Djokovic's excellent approach shot forced a passing error for 6-5. A backhand wide sealed the set. Roger Federer sits in his chair after losing a heartbreaker to Novak Djokovic in the men's final at Wimbledon. Instead of ripping through Federer, a sloppy Djokovic was broken to start the second after a slip on the grass. The second set disappeared in 25 minutes, just what Federer wanted following the 58-minute opener -- and playing three hours against Nadal in the semifinals. A lethargic looking Djokovic somehow hung on in the third -- barely -- even in missing serves by yards and seeing his serve percentage drop. With Djokovic serving at 4-5, 30-all, Federer produced a stunning drop volley to earn a set point, only for it to be erased thanks to a fine Djokovic serve. Another tiebreak victoryDjokovic almost let slip a 5-1 edge in the ensuing tiebreak. Federer pulled to within 4-5 but could he have chosen a better shot on that pivotal point instead of a backhand drop shot early in the rally that went wide? Djokovic quietly fist pumped in winning a 23-shot rally in the tiebreak though didn't celebrate when the set ended. He knew it was a pro-Federer crowd. \"That was one thing that I promised myself coming on to the court today, that I need to stay calm and composed, because I knew that the atmosphere will be as it was,\" said Djokovic. So how did he do it? \"I like to trans-mutate it in a way. When the crowd is chanting 'Roger' I hear 'Novak,'\" he smiled. \"It sounds silly, but it is like that. I try to convince myself that it's like that.\"Novak Djokovic lifts the trophy as a crowd assembles at Wimbledon. If you were expecting Djokovic to finally take control in the fourth, it didn't happen, though he manufactured his first break chances and converted at 2-5. Djokovic created the first break chances of the fifth at 2-1, only to see Federer withstand the pressure. Dramatic endHe broke through for 4-2 yet conceded serve straight away. Djokovic dived like his former coach Boris Becker to help him hold for 6-5, with the Serb later asking chair umpire Damian Steiner when the tiebreak would arrive. Djokovic dropped serve from 30-0 to trail 8-7 and looked out of it when Federer led 40-15. The fans were off their feet in anticipation. But Djokovic forced a forehand miss then came up with that forehand pass to disappoint them. \"It was kind of a flashback of the US Open when I saved the two match points against him,\" said Djokovic. A Federer forehand into the net on break point led to groans. On to the tiebreak it went after Djokovic saved two break points at 11-11 -- when he led 40-0 -- and he played a flawless final tiebreak to seal victory, the epic ending on a Federer forehand mishit that rocketed into the sky.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)It was a warm afternoon in March. David Breidenstein says he looked on as some of the more radical yellow vest protesters set fire to Le Fouquet's, not just a restaurant but a symbol of wealth and power in France.  As the flames spread licking at the famous red awning, Breidenstein quickly turned on his feet hoping to distance himself from the blaze, fearful of getting caught up in the violence he says he wasn't fueling. A few seconds later he stopped, lit a cigarette, and as he looked back towards the riot police he felt the full force of a golf-ball-size rubber bullet strike his left eye. \"It felt like a lump of concrete. I fell to the ground and thought 'I've lost my eye, it's gone.'\" David Breidenstein says one of his great regrets is that his eye injury has kept him from protesting. He will be back on the streets on Bastille Day.Violent clashes across FranceRead MoreBreidenstein is one of at least 24 people who have lost an eye since the \"gilets jaunes,\" or Yellow Vest, protests began in November 2018, according to Desarmons-Les, a support group for those maimed on the streets of French cities. What began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government. Scenes of violent clashes erupted across France. Protesters hurled petrol bombs and bricks while the riot police used water cannons, stun grenades and tear gas as they attempted to contain the anger. In March France's interior ministry put the number of Yellow Vests injured at 2,200 and put the number of police officers hurt in the clashes at 1,500. The ministry would not give CNN the number of people who  sustained eye injuries. Macron pledges tax cuts in effort to assuage Yellow VestsBreidenstein says it took him two months to be able to open his window shutters once more. He felt better in the dark. The father of two says one of his great regrets is that his eye injury has kept him from protesting. He hasn't taken to the streets since March 16. But on Sunday, Breidenstein was planning to make the two-hour journey to Paris from his home in Troyes, in the northeast of France, to return to the place where he lost his eye -- the Champs-Elysees, the same avenue where Le Fouquet just reopened its doors for the first time since the fire that gutted it.He was going to join the Yellow Vests as they protested for the 35th week in a row. The revolt has dwindled over the past several months with less than 100 protesters showing up in the capital each Saturday. However, the Yellow Vests hoped once again to make their voices heard on Bastille Day -- a national holiday commemorating the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789 at the start of the French Revolution.

Rodrigues was live-streaming a rally in January at the Place de la Bastille when he sustained his injury. Protesters were playing cat and mouse with police while bricks and tear gas flew through the air. A dispersal grenade landed next to his left foot and a rubber bullet struck his right eye.  The 39-year-old construction worker was knocked sideways. \"I thought 'S*! They got me, they finally got me!\" \"Sometimes I get startled by people who magically appear at my side,\" says Jerome Rodrigues. \"This is my life now.\"  After receiving 17 stitches to his eyeball and four stitches to his eyelid Rodrigues says that basic daily activities have become difficult.  \"I have to hold both the glass and the bottle when I'm pouring myself some water,\" he laments. \"I'm constantly craning my neck to see what's happening on the right and sometimes I get startled by people who magically appear at my side. This is my life now.\" Another injured protester is Olivier Fostier, who has taken to wearing dark glasses in a bid to hide the right eye he lost in a cloud of tear gas, as shrapnel tore into his socket. The former military man and police officer says the riot police used excessive force that day. He says he was a regular demonstrator, not a \"casseur,\" or hooligan, not a \"black bloc,\" a masked and hooded anarchist. Fostier says the protest had all but come to an end when tear gas and stun grenades were launched. Both the United Nations and the European Parliament have condemned the French police for the apparent use of excessive force during the yellow vest rallies. And the IGPN -- the body that investigates police abuses -- has launched 220 investigations into the conduct of French police officers. France's interior minister Christophe Castaner has repeatedly defended the way in which the riot police have behaved at rallies but in June he ordered a review of police methods used to control protesters. CNN put in repeated calls and emails to the interior ministry, which speaks for the police department, asking for a response to the accusations of police abuses. The ministry referred CNN back to previous comments made by Castaner. Olivier Fostier says he was a regular demonstrator, not a  hooligan or a masked and hooded anarchist. 'Nothing is at it was'Fostier says he shies away from social gatherings and prefers going outside when it's dark. \"People stare at you. They see you either as a victim or as a trouble-maker.\" The father of three says it's not just a psychological trauma but it's an aesthetic one too. \"It's put a strain on my relationship with my wife. Until now, my son had never seen me cry before. Nothing is at it was.\" Gwendal Leroy says he only realized something terrible had happened when he felt a rush of hot blood coming from his left eye.Gwendal Leroy is unemployed and believes his eye injury will be used against him when applying for jobs. \"Have I lost my eye? Have I lost my eye?\" He anxiously yelled at medics and friends who came to his aid. It took him several weeks to accept his new handicap from the rubber bullet that hit him. Now he says he feels \"la haine,\" or hatred, towards the government. \"They've branded me for life!\" the 27-year-old says forcefully. \"I don't regret being a yellow vest but I'm ashamed at being marked by the police in this way. People recognize me now and make assumptions about me.\"Leroy is unemployed and believes his eye injury will be used against him when applying for jobs. \"It's not about which job I can get, it's about who will want me. There are bosses who are anti-yellow vest, who do you think they'll pick? Me? Or the other guy?\"All four men have filed legal action against the government claiming there was a disproportionate use of force by the police. The government is yet to respond.",

One was 27 years old and the other was 30. Two more people were injured on Sunday, but the hospital did not say how.Traditionally, the bull run was used as a way of getting the bulls from the city outskirts to the bull ring.After two rockets are launched, the bulls charge behind amateur daredevils -- many dressed in traditional white attire with splashes of red -- for 825 meters, which is the distance between the corral and the bull ring, according to the festival website.",

        "content": "(CNN)Two years ago, Turkey declared it would buy Russia's S-400 missile defense system because the United States had dragged its feet in selling an American alternative. But the deal, worth about $2 billion and consummated this week, has consequences far beyond the cost to Ankara's defense budget.It calls into question the decades-long strategic relationship between Turkey and the US, and even Turkey's credentials as a NATO member. It probably nullifies a massive contract for Turkey to buy US F-35 combat aircraft -- a plane the S-400 is designed to shoot down.The deal also solidifies a deepening relationship between Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin -- two leaders with little time for dissent at home and who need each other in Syria. And it provides the Turkish armed forces with an advanced weapon capable of covering most of Syria and their old adversary Greece (also a NATO member.) The S-400 can shoot down aircraft at a distance of up to 150 miles (240 km) and intercept ballistic missiles up to 38 miles away.Read MoreIn essence it is a destabilizing purchase in a region that could do without any more destabilizing. It is also an assertion by Turkey of its independence as a major regional power.The US has warned Turkey it may face economic sanctions for purchasing the S-400 defense sytems.Tension between Turkey and USErdogan and the United States have been at odds for years. The Turkish President said the US had protected Fethullah Gulen, the cleric (and Pennsylvania resident) he blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Erdogan declared: \"The coup plotter is in your country. You are nurturing him there. It's out in the open.\" He has demanded Gulen's extradition countless times, but there's no sign US authorities will accede.  Erdogan and other senior members of his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) have often played to anti-American sentiment among the party's conservative, nationalist base.Erdogan was also infuriated by the US alliance with the Kurdish militia in Syria -- the YPG -- in the campaign to defeat ISIS. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group affiliated with the PKK, which has fought the Turkish state for more than three decades. When the US considered training a mainly Kurdish contingent to guard the Turkish border last year, Erdogan tweeted: \"The US has now acknowledged that it has established a terror army along our borders.\" The tension persists. The two sides can't agree on the establishment of a safe zone for refugees inside northern Syria. And this week, CNN reported that US military intelligence is observing a buildup of Turkish armored units that may be planning cross-border combat operations -- amid growing concerns that US troops operating in northern Syria will be caught in the middle.\"There are some indications\" that Turkey is preparing for an \"incursion\" into Syria, but the intelligence is not yet definitive, one official said.Trump says he is 'extremely angry' about Khashoggi murder, but defends MBS relationshipFor its part Washington has been exasperated by prison sentences handed to US citizens in Turkey (Pastor Andrew Brunson being the most prominent example) and Turkish staff working at the US Embassy -- seeing them as politically motivated. The Trump administration retaliated by imposing sanctions on senior Turkish ministers. There was also tension over the Saudi response to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- and over what was perceived as an ambivalent approach in Ankara to confronting ISIS, especially in 2015-16.  Sporadic threats by Turkey to close the US airbase at Incirlik have been another irritant. But all these difficulties pale in comparison to the fallout from the S-400 deal. Even before the first deliveries, the US warned that Turkey would be suspended from the F-35 combat jet program and stopped training its pilots.  Erdogan has said that excluding Turkey from the F-35 program would be \"robbery,\" since Ankara has already invested more than $1 billion in the consortium building it. Altogether it planned to buy 116 planes.The US also threatened new sanctions should Turkey complete the S-400 contract, prompting Erdogan to claim on the sidelines of the G-20 summit: \"It is out of question between two strategic partners. I think it should not happen.\"US President Donald Trump has suggested the sanctions could be diluted, but many in Congress are determined Turkey should be penalized. According to a US federal law (the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act), the administration must levy at least five different penalties against Turkey. Just how punitive they will be is yet to be seen.NATO is also concerned that the S-400 deal will affect Turkey's ability to cooperate with other alliance members. \"Interoperability of our armed forces is fundamental to NATO for the conduct of our operations and missions,\" said one official. Military vehicles and equipment, including parts of the S-400 air defense systems, are unloaded from a Russian transport aircraft in Ankara on Friday, July 12, 2019.Putin stirs up troubleRussia is of course delighted that it has not only sold its S-400 to a member of NATO but helped drive a deeper wedge between Turkey and the US. The Turkish purchase is also a great shop window for the Russian defense industry. India is expected to be the next customer for the S-400. And then there's Syria. President Vladimir Putin seduced Turkey into joining the \"Astana\" process with Russia and Iran on the future of Syria, essentially sidelining the United Nations and the US. Now, Erdogan needs Russian support to prevent an offensive by the Assad regime against the rebel-held province of Idlib, where Turkey has peacekeeping troops but also backs several rebel factions.If Turkey wants to have any sway on the future shape of Syria, it has to engage with Russia. Buying the S-400 helped cement a necessary if not necessarily warm relationship.Above all, the arrival of the first batch of S-400 equipment in Ankara on Friday is the most dramatic instance of a trend that stretches back to the Arab Spring. Erdogan, already in power for more than 15 years, wants to fashion Turkey as an independent and influential power in the region, no longer beholden to the United States and no longer in need of the American nuclear umbrella that protected it for decades. Russian President Vladimir Putin is delighted to have helped to drive a deeper wedge between Turkey and the US.Holding out an olive branch Friday, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkey was still considering buying US Patriot missiles \"to cover our need for a long-range air and missile defense system.\" He also said the purchase of the S-400 \"does not in any way mean a change of [Turkey's] strategic orientation.\"But the course of Turkey's strategy seems set. As Aaron Stein puts it in Foreign Affairs, Erdogan and the AKP \"don't think their relationship with Washington is nearly as valuable as Washington seems to think it is.\" Taking up the thread, Steven A. Cook, a longtime Turkey watcher, says Ankara \"is not the partner it used to be. In the future, U.S. policy should be based on the fact that while Turkey is not an enemy of the United States, it is also not a friend.\" And you don't share your best jets with countries that are not your friends.",

The likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze, Nikita Parris and Steph Houghton, have been on the front and back pages of the newspapers, their names bandied around in the pubs and bars, while radio phone-ins have been besieged by people who have been inspired by their achievements.England's Jonny Bairstow has enjoyed a stellar Cricket World Cup.And yet, away from the limelight, another England team has been forging its very own path toward global domination.England's male cricketers will take to the field at Lord's on Sunday to face New Zealand in its first Cricket World Cup final for 27 years.It is a remarkable achievement for a side that four years ago was embarrassed and humiliated at the 2015 World Cup.England has never won the tournament, though it has reached the final on three separate occasions, the last in 1992 when it was beaten by Pakistan.Its semifinal victory over defending champion Australia was brutal and brilliant, placing it front and center of the news and sporting world, on the front and back pages of the newspapers and breathing new life in to the English summer.READ: New Zealand stuns India in semifinalREAD: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says RichardsREAD: Inside the world's first LGBT cricket team'Public consciousness'Finally, after six weeks and 48 games, the country awoke to a competition that had been happening in its very own backyard. Finally, it left the sphere of cricket, and made the jump into the public consciousness. England's Jason Roy has been a stand out star at the Cricket World Cup.Almost immediately it was announced the final would be shown on free-to-air television -- the first time an England international will have been shown on UK terrestrial television in 14 years.Since the end of the 2005 Ashes series, one of the most exciting and enduring contests between England and Australia, cricket has been shown on Sky TV in the UK.For many English sports fans, the 2005 series remains one of the greatest examples of sporting rivalry. It was a series that stopped the country, a contest that inspired the next generation of cricket players and supporters, a seminal moment in the country's sporting history.That England team was paraded through the streets of London on an open-top bus with thousands lining up for a glimpse of the players who had toyed with their emotions during an emotional summer of sport.England's cricket team rides in an open top double decker bus after winning the 2005 Ashes.Those players, the likes of Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Pietersen and Steve Harmison, have gone down in folklore. Michael Vaughan, the England captain in 2005, speaks for many when he says that series inspired a generation of children. It was a defining moment.And here England stands again. On the brink of glory, of sporting immortality. Yet for many who are not familiar with cricket, the names of Jason Roy, one of the most explosive batsmen in world cricket, and Jofra Archer, a wonderfully talented bowler, may not be at all familiar.For the most part, those not able to watch Sky or stay awake for the highlights on terrestrial television, have been watching clips online and listening to BBC Test Match Special's radio broadcast, a staple of the English summer for cricket fans.Jofra Archer of England celebrates taking the wicket of Aaron Finch of Australia during the semifinal.According to the International Cricket Council, the World Cup has reached a unique audience of 20 million people in the UK through Sky's coverage and highlights shown on Channel 4.Statistics provided by the ICC show that England's win over Edgbaston was the most watched cricket match within the UK across any format since 2006. A unique audience of 3.45 million was reached on Sky Sports with the audience peaking at 1.8 million during India's second innings run chase.\"We are absolutely delighted that the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 has become one of the most watched sporting events in the world across TV and digital platforms,\" ICC chief executive Manu Sawhney said in a statement Friday.\"These quite extraordinary numbers demonstrate how viewership habits are changing and the smart way cricket has adapted to deliver what fans today expect.\"READ: Bees stop play at Cricket World CupREAD: Virat Kohli's fan club -- 103 million and Viv RichardsDigital dominatesNowhere is the way fans consume their media coverage more evident than in the ICC's own statistics with cellphones, tablets, in-game highlights and YouTube all playing a key role in transporting the tournament to the world.On Friday, the International Cricket Council announced it had recorded  an \"unprecedented\" 2.6 billion video views across its digital and social platforms.The official tournament social channels have added 12 million new followers in the past six weeks and attracted 386 million engagements.England's Joe Root celebrates as Eoin Morgan scores the winning runs to secure a place in the final.The appetite for cricket online could not be clearer with the tournament's official website having registered 65 million unique users worldwide, and has had more than 250 million page views during the past six weeks.As of Friday, the highlights of England's semifinal clash with Australia had almost 9 million views on the ICC's official YouTube channel. The YouTube highlights from India's win over Pakistan had attracted over 21 million.Even the dead rubber game between Afghanistan and West Indies managed over six million views. 'Really important for cricket'But though the digital statistics and broadcasting figures outside the UK are impressive, the clamor for the final to be shown free-to-air hints at a frustration.After 27 years of waiting, can cricket afford to waste such a precious opportunity to influence the next generation? And on a day when the men's final at Wimbledon and British Grand Prix are both freely available for sports fans to watch for free, can cricket just sit back behind the pay TV barrier? The answer, from both a current and former England captain, is no.\"It's cool, it's great that everyone gets the chance to see it,\" Eoin Morgan, the current England captain told reporters after the semifinal win over Australia.\"The 2005 Ashes was the moment for me when cricket became cool. That whole summer it was on all the front and back pages, everywhere.\"I don't think we will understand the impact until after the tournament when the guys go home. We will be recognized more than before.\"England's captain Eoin Morgan hits the winning runs as he celebrates victory against Australia.Alastair Cook, the former England captain, agreed. He said it was a \"fantastic move\" on the part of Sky to allow the final to be show free-to-air.\"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for these players to play in a home World Cup and to have this opportunity to put it on free-to-air, so hopefully many more millions of people can watch it and hopefully see an England win. It can inspire the next generation,\" Cook told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"If they win the World Cup, the first 50-over tournament England have ever won, it can only be a good thing for cricket.\"And then amazingly, a week-and-a-half later, we start an Ashes series so it could be a very, very special eight or nine weeks for English cricket.\"England's Chris Woakes celebrates taking the wicket of David Warner of Australia.Cook, one of England's most decorated players, is well placed to make such a call.As England's all-time leading run scorer in Test cricket, his name will surely remain in the record books for many decades to come.But he, like so many of England's most successful players, never came close to winning a World Cup.Now, in front of an expectant country, with the game broadcast far and wide, England's cricketers have the opportunity to inspire and transcend sport, just like the Lionesses did weeks ago.For cricket, for the players, for England, the time is now. Another 27 years is a long time to wait.",

        "content": "(CNN)Tony Jacklin is a hero. I think every golf fan in Europe would agree with that. He's a two-time major winner, the first man ever to hold both the Open Championship and the US Open at the same time and before Tony came along, the Ryder Cup was a biennial reminder of America's golfing supremacy. Everything changed, though, when he helped expand the Britain and Ireland team to become European, first captaining them in 1983. He inspired them to challenge the USA, establishing a winning mentality that has continued -- almost uninterrupted -- ever since.Before his captaincy, the Americans had won it on 20 occasions out of 24; since then, Europe has won or tied it a dozen times out of 18. As a result, the Ryder Cup is one of my favorite sports events, but I am just a little conflicted.

The stories around the family dinner table specifically revolved around his victory at The Open Championship in 1969. Fifty years ago, on July 12, Jacklin won the Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes and it was a really big deal for British golf. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosThat same day was also a big deal for my family; some 200 miles further north, Norman Riddell and Leila White said \"I do\" at the Murrayfield Parish Church in Edinburgh. Since it was a day that would change all of their lives, I can only imagine the excitement they would have been feeling that morning. Jacklin told me, \"in our business, major championships are it. I knew as a young man that if I won a major championship then I'd never be forgotten.\"Ryder Cup European team captain Tony Jacklin (right) celebrates with Seve Ballesteros (left) and Sam Torrance (centre).These days, major championships are settled on Sunday afternoons, but in 1969 the Open still finished on Saturday. Jacklin teed off in his final round with a two-stroke lead. \"I was pretty tough mentally,\" he recalled.\"I'd won in Jacksonville the previous year, playing on the last day with Arnold Palmer. His fans were known as 'Arnie's Army' and they didn't care much about anybody except him.\"Jacklin says that experience stood him in good stead. \"There was a real sense of expectation in the UK that summer.\"The 1968 Open champion concurred. Gary Player told me that \"Britain was starving for a major championship winner, the last one had been Max Faulkner in 1951, a gap of 18 years. Tony's win gave British golf such a spurt.\"By the 18th hole, Jacklin says all that anticipation had turned into celebration. \"What a corker!\" cried the television commentator Henry Longhurst, describing Jacklin's final tee shot. As he marched up the fairway, Jacklin even lost his shoe in the rush of fans surging forward to congratulate him. READ: Tiger Woods: From highs to lowsHappy coupleBy then, my young parents had already walked up and back down the aisle and were enjoying their reception at the Ellersly House Hotel. Norman and Leila Riddell on their wedding day.I should point out that this was all happening at one of the most momentous periods in human history; just four days later, Apollo 11 would blast off from The Kennedy Space Center and the following Sunday, Neil Armstrong was taking one small, but historic, step. Despite that extraordinary feat of technological innovation, watching a sports event on television was very difficult. Cabling golf courses for broadcast was so expensive that Jacklin would often play events where only the last three holes were televised -- in fact, that's how he became the first golfer ever to score a televised hole-in-one. He aced the 16th at the 1967 Dunlop Masters. My Uncle Jim White, one of the biggest sports fans in the family, reminded me that in 1969 there were no smart phones, no Internet and no video recorders to record pictures that were only just being televised in color. As my uncle put it, \"the color was so badly represented that I thought for a number of years big Jack Nicklaus had an orange face!\"So, he hadn't seen any of the golf in the first three rounds; the best he could do was follow the action via the \"stop press\" margin of the Edinburgh Evening News on the bus home from work. READ: McIlroy 'excited' to play for Ireland at Tokyo 2020 OlympicsFor all the sports fans at the reception that afternoon, it must have been irresistible; the magnetic pull of an historic sports moment, even if it was only being shown on a small, grainy, black and white screen. By all accounts, the male guests packed into the room while the bride and her friends were left to chat among themselves in an adjacent room. It was, apparently, like the parting of the Red Sea. My mum isn't much of a sports fan, and she has no recollection of Jacklin's big moment -- her only view was a gallery of male backs and people leaping about, trying to get a better sight of the tiny screen. That is a vivid memory however, I've heard about it often!British golfer Tony Jacklin on 14th April 1968.Overshadowing the big dayHalf a century later, my parents still disagree about Jacklin's '69 achievement. To my father, his triumph was \"a feature of the wedding.\" When I told my Mum that I'd spoken to Jacklin about this article, she texted \"Has he apologized?\" I don't think she was joking either, lamenting later \"It was disappointing. That's not quite how I imagined my wedding day would have turned out.\" I'm sure that her story is not unique and in fact, the advent of technology has almost certainly made sport and wedding conflicts even more problematic in the intervening years. And whilst many people might have sympathy with her, professional golfers do not. Player laughed when I mentioned it, \"I think golf does ruin a lot of days, whether it's a funeral or the birth of a child.\" Player still regrets that he missed the birth of his first daughter.Norman and Leila Riddell with the rest of their family on their wedding day.I suppose it was a less than auspicious start to their married life and unfortunately things didn't improve much on their honeymoon. The Scottish weather was unseasonable for July (it was scorching) and the newlyweds got so badly sunburnt on Loch Faskally that they couldn't bear to be touched for a week. Jacklin also had a stressful 'honeymoon.\"  He told me that he wanted to take a break in order to \"contemplate the changes in my life. I wasn't just 'a golfer' anymore.\"But his agent had other plans, instructing him that the next tournament was the biggest prize in golf, the Westchester Classic and he \"couldn't miss it.\" What should have been a joyous time for Jacklin was anything but; he missed the next four cuts and was brought crashing down to earth. \"He ran me ragged, I was a pioneer in many respects; I was flying by the seat of my pants.\"His agent was Mark McCormack and these were the early days of IMG. \"I came to realize it wasn't about me, it was all about him.\"Tony Jacklin made just \u00a34,250 pounds ($5,386) for winning the Open in 1969; he scoffs as he accurately recalls the exact amount.These days, the winner is handed a cheque for almost $2 million. In 1969, my parents' wedding reception cost 149 pounds, 14 shillings and 8 pence; The Scotsman newspaper reported this year that the average cost of a wedding in Scotland is more than $45,000. How times have changed.READ: 'It was a no brainer': Bubba Watson on using CBD products in golfHappy memoriesThis month, all are reflecting fondly on a day they will never forget, from half a century ago. The following summer, Jacklin went on to win the US Open at Hazeltine and for a span of 84 years, he was the only European player to have won it. He was arguably defined by his glory years in the Ryder Cup and his legacy is a golf course that he built with Nicklaus in Florida.\"The Concession\" memorializes a crucial putt that Nicklaus conceded to Jacklin in the 1969 Ryder Cup. It was a sporting gesture that halved not only the hole, but their match and the cup itself. As they shook hands, Nicklaus famously said \"I knew you wouldn't have missed, but I didn't want to give you the chance.\"I mentioned my parents' story to Nicklaus recently; \"I hope they have a nice 50th and celebrate right along and have a glass of champagne with Tony,\" he said, warmly. Norman and Leila Riddell were successful in their own way, raising three sons with five grandchildren. Whilst I wasn't there to see it, I'll never think of their wedding day as tarnished or spoiled or ruined, or anything remotely negative -- although it has been a fun story and my privilege to tell. How could it have been bad when so much good has come from it? Norman and Leila Riddell cut the cake on their wedding day.Marriage isn't easy and until now I've only ever personally known two couples which have successfully made it to fifty years. I'm very proud of them. Jacklin says that whilst he has one or two regrets, he's very content with his life's work; but he isn't quite as excited by my story as I am. \"I've had lots of people tell me over the years that it was a memorable day to them because of a wedding or the birth of a child. It's kind of nice to be remembered for that.\"So this particular wedding wasn't special to Tony Jacklin, but my Uncle -- who gave my mum away that day, disagrees: \"Leila and Norman have had their golden years, but, like Tony, they've had to work hard. That day spun magic for all of us.\"",

That source added that a third delivery, carrying over \"120 anti-aircraft missiles of various types\" will be delivered \"tentatively at the end of the summer, by sea.\"TASS also quoted the source saying that Turkish S-400 operators will travel to Russia for training in July and August. About 20 Turkish servicemen underwent training at a Russian training center in May and June, according to the source. Parts of the S-400 air defense systems are unloaded from a Russian transport aircraft at Murted military airport in Ankara on Friday.Turkey's decision to purchase the equipment solidifies ties that have been developed between Russia's President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and is just the latest setback to US-Turkish relations which have seen the two NATO allies at odds over issues such as Syria.Read MoreThe US has long warned that Turkey risked being blocked from receiving the advanced F-35\u00a0stealth jet due to Ankara's insistence on acquiring the Russian missiles -- a system US officials fear could be used to analyze and collect intelligence on the F-35.An US official said the administration was \"aware of reports\" that Turkey had taken delivery of the S-400 in a statement.  \"As the President said at the G20 ahead of meeting with Erdogan, 'It's a problem, there's no question about it,' \" the official added.A NATO official told CNN on Friday, \"It is up to allies to decide what military equipment they buy. However, we are concerned about the potential consequences of Turkey's decision to acquire the S-400 system.\"The official added that, \"interoperability of our armed forces is fundamental to NATO for the conduct of our operations and missions.\"A Russian cargo plane transporting parts of the S-400 air defence system lands at Murted Airfield on Friday.How the US could reactOn Friday, acting US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was planning to call his Turkish counterpart, Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, to discuss Turkey's receipt of the Russian missile system, according to a US defense official.  The Pentagon could formally\u00a0suspend Turkey from participation in the F-35 program altogether.Touted as the future of military aviation, the F-35 jet -- which is the most expensive weapons system in history -- is a lethal and versatile aircraft that combines stealth capabilities, supersonic speed, extreme agility and sensor fusion technology, according to its primary contractor Lockheed Martin.The plane, which maintains stealth capabilities making it harder for enemy radars to detect, has been a favorite of President Donald Trump, who has lauded the F-35 several times for being \"invisible.\"The US\u00a0had consistently\u00a0told\u00a0Turkey that the S-400 was\u00a0incompatible with NATO systems.The S-400 surface-to-air missile launcher is seen at the ARMY-2019 International Military and Technical Forum' in Moscow in June. During a visit to NATO headquarters in Belgium late last month, Esper said: \"If Turkey accepts delivery of the S-400, they will not receive the F-35.\u00a0It's that simple.\"Turkish F-35 students, maintenance\u00a0personnel\u00a0and instructor pilots that had been training\u00a0in the US could also be sent home. Yet despite those warnings, senior\u00a0Turkish officials had long expressed optimism that the Trump administration\u00a0would not follow through on its threat to expel Turkey from the jet program, saying that the US President had promised to resolve the issue while also pledging not to integrate the S-400 with any NATO systems.US defense officials\u00a0last\u00a0month said the US was still determining what to do about the four F-35 aircraft\u00a0earmarked for Turkey that had remained in the US to facilitate the training of Turkish pilots at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.The Russian AN-124 cargo plane lands in Ankara on July 12 carrying parts of the S-400 system.Sanctions expectedThe US is expected to level sanctions against Turkey over its acquisition of the Russian system,penalties\u00a0mandated by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)\u00a0which penalizes countries that purchase military equipment from blacklisted firms.Ellen\u00a0Lord, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment,\u00a0told reporters at the Pentagon last month that \"there is strong bipartisan US congressional determination to see CAATSA sanctions imposed on Turkey if Turkey acquires the S-400.\" Sanctions could severely hurt Turkey's economy, which is suffering from the fallout of Erdogan's recent\u00a0move to sack the governor of the Turkish\u00a0Central Bank.\u00a0The Pentagon had already begun suspending Turkey from some aspects of the F-35 program and\u00a0announced last month\u00a0that Ankara had\u00a0until July 31\u00a0to reach a mutual agreement with the US over the purchase of the Russian system, but said that the suspension could come in advance of that if Turkey were to take delivery of the missile system before then.Pence warns Turkey over its purchase of Russian missile systemIf the US ejects Turkey from the program, Ankara will not only be prevented\u00a0from fulfilling its plans to acquire\u00a0some\u00a0100 aircraft but Turkish companies and component manufacturers, which have been involved in the plane's development will lose out on significant business opportunities.In April, Vice President Mike\u00a0Pence warned that the expulsion of Turkey from the joint F-35 program \"will harm not just Turkey's defense capacity, but it may cripple many of the Turkish component manufacturers that supply that program.\"Turkish Foreign Minister\u00a0Mevlut\u00a0\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said in April that Turkey had already invested \"$1.2 billion and another $2.3 billion is on the way and we have actually fulfilled all our obligations as one of the countries which is in the (F-35) program.\"The first batch of the S-400 missile defense system is unloaded.The US Defense Department has\u00a0said that more than 900 of the jets parts, including elements of the landing gear and center fuselage, are produced by Turkish industries with \"a little over 400 of them\" being \"sole-sourced.\"Lord said the Pentagon is actively working\u00a0\"with Lockheed Martin on the aircraft side, with Pratt & Whitney on the engine side, to find alternate sources\" for the Turkish produced parts.She also said the program could rely on alternate depots in Europe to make up for the loss of a Turkey-based parts depot that was meant to support the aircraft's sustainment.\u00a0\u00a0What does it mean for Turkey's standing in NATO?Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced last week that Russia's S-400 missiles were being prepared to be flown to Turkey. Turkey's purchase of the S-400 missile system opens up wider questions concerning Turkey's diplomatic path, as this sale marks another edge towards autocratic regimes like Russia. Erdogan's jailing of journalists has already clashed with key tenants of NATO's membership, which carries with it obligations of democracy and human rights. But, more importantly, NATO's mission since inception is to defend other member states from Russian encroachment.\u00a0So a key NATO member, with Turkey possessing the second largest standing army and being its only Muslim member, actually courting Russian hardware could be beyond the pale for many NATO members .But it appears that Erdogan seems to think the payoff from playing Moscow against Brussels and Washington is greater than potentially being cast out of the world's largest military alliance.How has the Kremlin responded? Russia has said that the deal is only commercial and that it is fulfilling their obligations under the contract.The Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation confirmed the start of deliveries of the S-400 to Turkey on Friday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there will be partial transfer of technology.The Kremlin has largely stood back from Friday's drama, however, watching a wedge being driven in this important Western institution.\u00a0CNN's Matthew Chance contributed to this report.",

Paleontologists named the new dinosaur Notatesseraeraptor frickensis, a reference to the town of Frick, Switzerland, where the skeleton was unearthed in 2006. But it wasn't until this week that the results of a phylogenetic analysis (like a map of the dino's evolutionary tree) were published, revealing its traits were unlike any other. \"We realized that it was something important,\" the study's author Marion Zahner told CNN, adding that the skull first tipped her off to the dinosaur's unique characteristics. \"The skull is very interesting from an evolutionary standpoint.\"The species is also the first theropod, a group of flesh-eating dinosaurs that walk on two supportive hind legs (think of a T. Rex with strong legs and stubby arms), found in Switzerland. Read More\"Frick is very famous for dinosaur bones,\" said Zahner, who is a PhD candidate at the University of Zurich. \"For about 30 years they have been digging there, but most of the time they only find the bones of the Plateosaurus.\"According to the research paper, the unearthed skeleton \"includes a nearly complete skull, two articulated forelimbs and stomach contents.\"Researchers were even able to determine that the dinosaur's last meal was a small lizard called a Clevosaurus through an analysis of the leftovers in its stomach. The skull is still sitting in Zahner's office, only measuring about 9 inches. But a full replica and model skeleton can be found at the dinosaur museum in Frick. Zahner hopes the dinosaur model will teach visitors, students and future paleontologists about how species' traits evolve over thousands of years. For example, she explains that dinosaurs are ancestors of birds we see today.     \"I just think every fossil is very special and it's important the whole tree of life to understand past present and future,\" said Zahner.",

Not that anyone had been counting of course.On that occasion, in 1992, England reached the final, though English fans will hope this particular final chapter has a far happier ending.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThis eight-wicket victory, which secured England's place in Sunday's final against New Zealand at Lord's, will long be remembered for the way that the host nation dismantled its greatest rival in its customary swashbuckling style.Jason Roy hits a six off the bowling of Steve Smith during England's reply.Chasing 224 to win, England eased home courtesy of Jason Roy's electric innings of 85 from 65 deliveries as he and fellow opener Jonny Bairstow put on 124 for the first wicket.Read MoreFrom there, not even England, at least not this England, could fluff its lines.It was not just the victory itself that will have thrilled England's long-suffering cricket fans, but the way it was achieved. It was, to all intents and purposes, beautifully constructed.The sight of Roy launching three consecutive sixes off the bowling of Australian pantomime villain Steve Smith will be played over and over again on television and on social media for years to come.For so long, England's one day team was an analogue player in a digital world -- a world where England had seemingly been left behind having failed to reach a World Cup final since 1992.England's Jofra Archer claimed two wickets in another impressive display.The intervening 27 years have brought embarrassments, humiliations, root and branch reviews, and more abject failure. In the same period, Australia has won four of the six World Cups.But this England team looks different. Cast your mind back four years to the 2015 World Cup, a tournament in which England crashed out at the group stage.It was thrashed by both eventual winner Australia and runner-up New Zealand in merciless fashion, two defeats that left English one day cricket in crisis.Four years later, England's fortunes have been transformed.Favorite tagEngland arrived at this tournament as the No.1 ranked team, as favorite to win its first ever World Cup, and with a team full of world class talent.England fans 'The Barmy Army' show their support during the semifinal clash.True the team's passage to the last four was not without discomfort. Three defeats in the group stage, including one by Australia at Lord's, placed England under far more pressure than it should have ever had to negotiate.That it handled the pressure so impressively with victories over India and finalist New Zealand, underlined the character and resilience of this England team.Still, this was Australia. Australia the five-time world champion. Australia the seven-time World Cup semifinalist that had never lost a last four clash. The Australia that had each of its past four World Cup games against England.But this felt different. England expected. England was ready. That Australia stood in the way of a place in the final only heightened the anticipation.Joe Root  celebrates as Eoin Morgan of England scores the winning runs to secure victory.READ: India crashes out at semifinal stageREAD: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says RichardsEarlier in the tournament, Eoin Morgan, the England captain, opined that the rivalry between the two sides had perhaps lost its edge given the frequency with which they face one another.Such a view is not unreasonable, given the two teams played a one-day series in England last summer and will face each other in an Ashes series next month.The contest at Lord's last month, which Australia won by 63 runs, was a largely uneventful affair. The crowd appeared subdued, the normal edge to an England vs. Australia clash was missing.But this was completely different. This felt raw, almost visceral. Edgbaston helps. One of the more boisterous and riotous cricket arenas on these shores has proved a happy home for England in recent times.No doubt it played some part in rattling the Australians as Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes left the Australians bloodied and bruised when the team batted.Bloodied and bruisedAlex Carey was left with a bleeding gash on his chin after being struck by a ferocious delivery by Archer as Australia recovered from a disastrous start to finish 223 all out after winning the toss and electing to bat.Australia's Alex Carey reacts after being hit by a bouncer from England's Jofra Archer.Wicketkeeper Carey entered the action with Australia having lost its first three wickets for just 14 runs as the defending champion's top order was blown away by the England pace duo of Archer and Chris Woakes.It was Archer's delivery that drew gasps from the crowd, as the ball rose up to knock off Carey's helmet before hitting the chin and drawing blood.As the blood started to trickle down Carey's chin, the team doctors raced onto the field to apply dressing to the wound and wrapped the player's chin with a bandage which was woven around his head.There was no malice in Archer's delivery, which knocked against the grille of Carey's helmet, sending it hurtling into the air before the batsman caught it and ensured his stumps remained intact.Alex Carey receives further medical treatment following a cut to the chin.For someone playing in only their 29th one day international, Carey showed remarkable poise and courage after the incident, hitting 46 in a partnership of 103 with Steve Smith, before having his wound stitched up after leaving the field.Smith, a lightning rod for abuse from England supporters, endured his now customary hostile reception, as he walked out to bat. Few England supporters have forgotten Smith's transgression. He along with fellow Australian David Warner received a 12-month ban from all forms of cricket last year after being found guilty of ball tampering.But while there is some comic nature to booing and jeers aimed at Smith, there is also grudging respect.One of the world's most talented batsmen, Smith fought hard for his 85 as Australia rallied after a disastrous start to its innings.DisasterArcher, one of the stand out bowlers of the tournament so far, removed Australia captain Aaron Finch for none before Woakes had Warner caught behind to leave Australia 10-2.Steve Smith made 85 during his innings for Australia.Peter Handscomb, drafted into the team without having been part of the original squad, made just four before Woakes rearranged his stumps with a beautiful delivery.At 14-3, Australia was creaking, but as so often has been the case, Smith took control.  Alongside Carey, the duo added 103 to nudge their side to within grasp of a respectable total.Carey, in particular, looked in good touch. His contribution of 46 off 70 deliveries was even more impressive given the knock to the face he took earlier in the innings.England's Adil Rashid appeals successfully for the wicket of Marcus Stoinis.But once Carey had departed, caught on the boundary off the bowling of spinner Adil Rashid, England attempted to press home its advantage.Marcus Stoinis was dismissed without scoring while the dangerous Glenn Maxwell made a quickfire 22 off 23 deliveries before Archer struck once again.Rashid then had Pat Cummins, his third victim of the day, caught at slip by Joe Root for six to leave Australia on 166-7, which brought Mitchell Starc to the crease.The new batting pair adding 50 between them before Smith was wonderfully run out by Jos Buttler for 85,Starc followed the very next ball, edging Woakes behind to Buttler for 29 as Australia finished on 223.Chris Woakes of England celebrates taking the wicket of David Warner.Such a total was always unlikely to trouble an England side fired by two of the most in-form batsmen in the tournament.Roy and Bairstow blew Australia's opening bowlers away with an opening partnership of 124 before the latter was dismissed for 34.Roy played beautifully for his 85 before being given out caught behind, though replays showed he had not touched the ball.Unfortunately for Roy, England had already used up its review, leaving captain Eoin Morgan and Joe Root to finish the first part of the job and get the party started.After 27 years of waiting, England is desperate to make up for lost time. Lord's awaits.",

        "content": "(CNN)Roger Federer remains on course for a ninth Wimbledon title after beating Rafael Nadal in an enthralling encounter to reach his 12th final at the All England Club.It took more than three tense, nerve-shredding hours of the highest quality tennis for the Swiss to wrap up a 7-6 1-6 6-3 6-4 victory.Federer will now face Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final after the Serb beat Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 4-6 6-3 6-2 earlier Friday.There was so much anticipation ahead of the showdown as two of the greatest to ever play the sport were meeting for the first time at Wimbledon since their epic 2008 final -- considered by many to be the greatest tennis match of all time.That Nadal and Federer -- aged 33 and 37, respectively -- are not only still at the top of their own games, but also at the top of the sport more than a decade later is a testament to both their skill and dedication.Read MoreREAD: Chasing a 24th grand slam title, Serena Williams targets 'calm' spaceREAD: Serena Williams to face Simona Halep in Wimbledon final\"I'm exhausted,\" Federer told the BBC after the match. \"It was tough at the end. Rafa played some unbelievable shots to stay in the match. The match was played at a very high level.\"The biggest points in the match went my way. There were tight ones and long rallies. That first set was huge to get the lead and try to protect it. He came back very strongly in the second set. It was a joy to play today.\"Turning back the clockBoth players began the match by rattling off service games with very little trouble and it took until the eighth game, with Nadal serving at 3-4, before either player conjured up a break point.It came and went in the blink of an eye as Nadal bludgeoned a forehand that Federer had no hope of returning.With no breaks of serve the set went to a tiebreak and the first point immediately drew the mind back to that final 11 years ago. Rafael Nadal was at times unable to match Roger Federer's quality.The pair exchanged stunning groundstrokes, before Nadal improbably tracked down Federer's exquisite drop volley and prodded the ball past him down the line.But, just as he did twice back in 2008, Federer came from behind to take the tiebreak, playing four points of unanswerable quality to take the first set.While the first set was a tight, tense affair, the second was anything but. Both men were made to save break points in their opening service games and while Nadal held his concentration, Federer lost his.The Swiss' shots became wild and loose, unable to withstand Nadal's relentless power. Two breaks of serve followed and the set quickly ran away from Federer, with Nadal wrapping it up with a straightforward hold to love.With both players in the twilight of their illustrious careers, neither know how many more opportunities like these they will have to get into grand slam finals.At the start of the third set, Federer and Nadal began to play the tennis their great rivalry has become known for over the years and both players would have been proud of in their prime.Nadal's shots seemed to have more bite to them and Federer all of a sudden had an extra spring in his step.It was Federer who elevated his game to another level, breaking Nadal's serve and then going on to save two break points on his own the following game.Roger Federer was at times at his magical best against Rafael Nadal.It was to be the turning point in the set and Federer knew it. Usually so calm and collected on court, he let out a loud \"come on\" and pumped his fist in the direction of his box.He held serve on two more occasions to edge ahead in what was quickly becoming another special evening on Wimbledon's Center Court.The momentum was now well and truly with Federer and he seemed to be getting the better of Nadal, who began to cut a frustrated figure and starting to look powerless to stop the magic his opponent was wielding with his racket.An early break of serve in the fourth set compounded the Spaniard's misery and from there Federer never once looked like relinquishing the lead.Nadal did save two match points in stunning fashion when serving at 3-5 down but, in the end, it was only delaying the inevitable.Incredibly, the pair saved their very best tennis until last. Federer was forced to save one break point when serving for a place in the final and Nadal a match point with some of the most breathless tennis Center Court is likely to witness.When Nadal hit the decisive backhand long past the baseline, the crowd rose to their feet and gave the two players a raucous standing ovation that went on for several minutes.It might not have been 2008, but at times it wasn't far off.Djokovic dumps Bautista AgutDefending champion Djokovic recovered from a second-set wobble against Bautista Agut as he targets a fifth Wimbledon title and 16th grand slam overall.  The Serb looked to be at his very best for long periods of the match but Bautista Agut, not at all overawed by the occasion in his first grand slam semifinal, matched his opponent's brilliance at times.But the unrelenting Djokovic was too strong for the 23rd seed and will meet the winner of Federer vs.Nadal in their first clash at Wimbledon since the epic 2008 final.Facing Djokovic was described as like playing against a \"wall\" by his quarterfinal opponent David Goffin, and Bautista Agut quickly discovered what the Belgian was talking about.There has arguably never been a better returner of serve in the history of the game as Djokovic and few can match his speed, athleticism and flexibility on a tennis court.In the opening exchanges, Bautista Agut seemed to be feeling the pressure of needing to hit two or three extra shots before finding a way through Djokovic's defense.Four nervous errors on his forehand -- his favored side and by quite some distance his most effective shot -- allowed Djokovic to break in his first service game.Novak Djokovic reacts after winning a titanic 45-shot rally.When playing against the world No. 1, every shot needs to be executed to near-perfection and too many of Bautista Agut's were far from perfect.Forehands were too short or too wide and attempted drop shots were sitting up nicely for Djokovic in the middle of the court.In the blink of eye, the Spaniard was two breaks of serve down and after 35 minutes the first set belonged to Djokovic.Second set shockIt felt as though this semifinal would flash past Bautista Agut before he would even have the chance to start playing but as Djokovic's level dropped at the start of the second set, the Spaniard pounced.Perhaps the tennis gods were smiling down on Bautista Agut, too, as a string broke on Djokovic's racket when serving at 15-30 to gift his opponent two break points.Bautista Agut capitalized and, despite squandering two more break points in Djokovic's next service game, held firm and saw out the remainder of the set in confident fashion to level the match.Novak Djokovic became frustrated as errors crept into his game.By the time the third set was well under way, signs of frustration were beginning to creep into Djokovic's demeanor.After a lazy volley at 2-2, he mistakenly let Bautista Agut's forehand sail past him and looked back to see it land well inside the baseline.Djokovic shrugged his shoulders and raised his arms, glaring in the direction of his supporters' box.But what makes Djokovic such a nightmare for opponents is his ability to raise his game when it matters. Just a game later he broke Bautista Agut to make it 4-2 with an emphatic overhead smash and pumped his fist into the air.Djokovic was forced to saved two straight break points in his next service game, the second coming with the 45th shot of a brutally long rally -- by far the longest of the match -- crunching a stunning backhand down the line.Roberto Bautista Agut took the second set in impressive fashion against Novak Djokovic.He held serve two points later and let out a bellowing, cathartic roar that reverberated around Centre Court.That, you felt, was that. With the third set on a knife edge, Djokovic came out on top and Bautista Agut looked deflated.The Serb raced into a 5-1 lead in the fourth, before eventually booking his place in Sunday's showpiece final with his third match point.",

Serena Williams -- remember her? -- is accelerating toward a 24th major title to tie her with Margaret Court for the most all time, but standing in her way is a formidable foe in Simona Halep.These final few matches at Wimbledon will be must-see TV. But there's more. There will be a new world champion in men's cricket. And if you want extra speed, it's available in the form of horsepower and some furious pedaling.Here's your guide to the weekend's biggest sports events: Read MoreWimbledonSpain's Roberto Bautista Agut was supposed to be in Ibiza for his bachelor party this weekend, but instead has the pleasure of playing against the world No. 1 and reigning Wimbledon champion Djokovic in the semifinals.\"We had everything organized already,\" the No. 23 seed, in his first major semifinal at age 31, said earlier this week. \"My friends, six of them, are all there. It feels better to be here in London.\" Instead, he said, he thinks they'll be flying to London on Friday.Following that match is Fedal XL -- one of the biggest rivalries in all of sports. It's their first grass court match against each other since the epic 2008 final, which Nadal won. In the previous 39 meetings, Nadal, now 33 years old, has bested Federer 24 times, but the 37-year-old Federer has dominated the grass court and is going for a record ninth Wimbledon title.Federer has the most major singles titles of any man, with 20.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)After 36 years of looking for his missing sister, Pietro Orlandi had hoped to finally get an answer on Thursday when the Vatican exhumed two tombs nestled in the shadow of Saint Peter's Basilica.Instead, it took just a few hours for his hopes to be dashed. The tombs were empty. There were no human remains, no funeral urns, and certainly no clue as to how his 15-year-old sister Emanuela Orlandi disappeared on her way home from a music lesson one summer's evening in 1983.The operation to open the tombs in the Teutonic Cemetery involved over a dozen Vatican workers, and came after an anonymous tip-off to the family to \"look where the angel is pointing\" -- apparently referring to an angel sculpture in the small graveyard that is reserved for German-speaking Catholic burials.Emanuela's brother Pietro Orlandi arrives at the Vatican ahead of the exhumation.The first tomb -- which belonged to Princess Sophie Von Hohenlohe -- was \"completely empty,\" according to Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti.Read MoreLikewise, the second tomb -- of Princess Carlotta Federica di Mecklemburgo -- was also opened and \"no human remains were found,\" Gisotti added.Relatives of the two princesses have been informed of the result of the search, Gisotti said.'I could have expected everything -- except empty graves'The empty graves only deepen the mystery surrounding missing teenager Emanuela, who was the daughter of a prominent Vatican employee and lived inside the holy city's walls with her family.\"I could have expected everything -- except empty graves,\" her brother Pietro told CNN at the exhumation site.The Teutonic Cemetery in Vatican City where two tombs were exhumed Thursday.\"On one hand I felt a sense of relief, on the other I know that this is not the end. Emanuela deserves the truth and justice,\" he said.\"I thought that today we could finally make a step forward, even if painful. Instead we are at a starting point.\"Under the tomb belonging to Von Hohenlohe, workers found a chamber measuring 4 x 3.7 meters. But according to the Orlandi family's forensic expert, Giorgio Portera, the structure of the chamber was made with cement, which is \"not compatible with a 19th-century grave.\"\"It appears strange to me that there are no documents that tells us why there graves are empty,\" he told CNN.Shortly after the exhumations, the Vatican said that a further investigation is now underway into documents to \"verify structural works that took place in the Teutonic Cemetery at the beginning of the 1800s, and also during the 1960s and 1970s.\"Pope John Paul II with Emanuela Orlandi (pink sweater, center), and (from right) her brother Pietro, father Ercole, and mother Maria.A dark page in Italian history The girl's disappearance has gripped Italians for more than three decades, inspiring conspiracy theories involving everyone from mobsters to international terrorists and the highest echelons of the Vatican.Emanuela's mother Maria lives just a few hundred meters from the graveyard where the exhumations took place. Following the opening, the Vatican said in a statement that it \"wants to reiterate that it has always expressed attention and closeness to the suffering of the Orlandi family, especially Emanuela's mother.\"She disappeared at 15. A cryptic tip-off in the Vatican could hold the key to her case Emanuela went missing on July 22, 1983 after attending a flute lesson in the grounds of Sant'Apollinare basilica in central Rome.Her father Ercole worked as a clerk in the pontiff's household and over the years there have been various investigations into her disappearance, all of which have proved inconclusive.The Orlandi family lawyer, Laura Sgro, said that after 36 years the family and Italians \"deserve the truth.\"\"The case of Emanuela Is related to too many dark pages of this country,\" she said.",

It's just quite interesting.\"And while winning will be hugely important to both this Friday, still playing and at such a high level should supercede the outcome.

Federer sat out the last six months of 2016 after undergoing knee surgery and few thought Nadal -- given his physical style of play -- would still be around.  With Nadal also missing the end of 2016 with a wrist injury and suffering constant knee problems throughout his career, it made their absorbing contest in the 2017 Australian Open final all the more remarkable. Nadal and Federer embrace after their match at the 2019 French Open.Indeed, instead of the pair dwelling on the importance of winning following their quarterfinal victories, they made it clear they were simply pleased to get another chance to battle at Wimbledon 11 years after the match many consider to be tennis' greatest ever. It even inspired the book, \"Strokes of Genius,\" by best selling author Jon Wertheim, which turned into a documentary that was aired last year to mark the 10-year anniversary of the epic.\"Excited about this match, excited about this opportunity to be again in the semifinals, against him,\" said the 33-year-old Nadal after downing Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals. \"Always I say the same. Of course the opportunities to play against each other every time are less, but we're still here. \"(On Friday) we are going to have another chance.\" Federer, who beat Kei Nishikori, acknowledged Nadal's longevity. \"It's impressive to see how sort of healthy he's stayed,\" the nearly 38-year-old Federer said. \"We're still here. So it's nice to play each other again.\" READ: Serena Williams fined $10,000 for damaging court Federer and Nadal greet each other at the net after their marathon 2008 Wimbledon final.A momentous occasionThe 2008 final was certainly better for Nadal. He ended Federer's five-year reign at Wimbledon and banished memories of the 2007 final when he lost in five sets and wept in the locker room. The 2008 win was his first Wimbledon title. Among the key moments, after grabbing a two-set lead, Nadal missed out on two championship points in an enthralling fourth-set tiebreak -- Federer saved one with an outstanding backhand down the line -- but eventually won the decider at around 9.15pm as evening turned to night. Rain delays pushed back the finishing time, as did the match duration of four hours, 48 minutes. Federer's 65-match winning streak on grass dissipated, despite a sizzling differential of 89 winners and 52 unforced errors. Nadal countered with 60 winners and 27 unforced errors.      Nadal famously climbed into his player box to celebrate, applauded by Federer's camp and congratulated by Spanish royalty that was in attendance. \"We played a lot of good matches,\" said Nadal. \"Here in this tournament we played especially two great matches, 2007 and 2008. (They) have been two emotional matches.\"Personally, 2008 was a little bit more emotional for me. But I appreciate the fact that I was part of 2007, too. Then we played a lot of matches all around. Only in New York we didn't play. That's the only bad news,\" he added, referring to the unfortunate, in that respect, US Open. READ: 'You're being quite disrespectful and you're patronizing me': tennis star hits back at reporterREAD: The Borg identity: Following in the footsteps of a famous fatherDifferent contestNadal didn't know whether his win at the French Open earlier this year -- which snapped a five-match losing run against Federer and bettered his overall record against the Swiss to 24-15 -- would have any bearing on the upcoming duel. \"I tell you in two days,\" he said. \"Probably is better to have that victory than have defeat, of course. But on the other hand, is completely different situation, no? Play on grass or play on clay is probably the biggest change in the world of tennis.\"Federer felt the French Open result wasn't especially relevant, although it did pave the way for Nadal to close to within two of Federer's record of 20 grand slam titles.      \"I feel like conditions were slightly different,\" he said. \"It was so windy. It was just insane. I haven't heard it was going to be the same [on Friday], so I hope not, even though that would be funny again.\"It's about how has he played so far, how have I played so far.\" 'Advantage...?'Nadal has had the more difficult draw, paired against the big-serving trio of Nick Kyrgios in the second round, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third and Querrey in the quarterfinals. But they've both impressed Hall of Famer, Kim Clijsters. \"Rafa playing Nick, and Tsonga and Sam now, it's a tough draw,\" Clijsters told CNN.  \"Just great to see what he was capable of after the clay court season, just adjust to the grass courts so quickly. Federer celebrates victory after beating Kei Nishikori.\"And to see Roger doing it, it's incredible. I think everybody can't wait to watch it in a couple of days.\"Who is Clijsters tipping? The Belgian paused, before giving Nadal the slight advantage. Whoever prevails will probably have the unenviable task of facing defending champion Novak Djokovic, who faces Roberto Bautista Agut on Friday, in the final. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"The intensity Rafa is putting into the match is so high,\" she said. \"He serves extremely well on break points down. Just very much ready to go. I think Roger is going to have to do everything well and move well and play aggressively and serve well and just hang in there. \"So I think, Rafa might be able to get it this time.\" This could be the last time they ever meet at Wimbledon, no less a grand slam, so we should all sit back and enjoy it.",

Eaton's body was found on Monday, the institute said. Eaton, who worked as a biologist, had been attending a conference at the Orthodox Academy in northwest Crete when she is believed to have disappeared during a run on July 2.\"There is an ongoing homicide investigation being led by the police in Crete, which has taken comprehensive measures to ensure that the responsible party(ies) will be brought to justice,\" the institute said in a statement.The institute offered its condolences to Eaton's family.

        "content": "(CNN)A minor adjustment from Serena Williams that had nothing to do with her racket or footwork made all the difference, she noted, in her gripping victory in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Locked in battle with fellow American Alison Riske on a blustery day in southwest London, Williams took action in the tense decider when her hair was \"getting in the way.\"\"I was missing a shot because it's in my face,\" Williams told reporters. \"I was like, 'This is not happening.'

And  she saved her best for last, striking more aces, winners and tallying her tidiest winners-to-unforced errors ratio in the third set against the conqueror of world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty to reach a 12th Wimbledon semifinal. Awaiting the 37-year-old Thursday as she continues her quest for a 24th major is Barbora Strycova, a grass court-loving 33-year-old, who became the oldest first-time women's grand slam semifinalist in the Open Era in what could be her farewell appearance at Wimbledon.

Strycova -- the most experienced of seven Czechs in the top 100 -- hasn't ruled out retiring come the end of 2019. The other semifinal pits former London resident Elina Svitolina -- her own semifinal drought at grand slams is now a thing of the past -- against Simona Halep in a battle of speedy baseliners who seem to have overcome their grass-court foibles. Williams, by contrast, has won Wimbledon seven times, and if she can maintain Tuesday's stellar form, number eight figures to be on the way. 'All the confidence in the world'According to Riske's coach, it was one of the finest performances from Williams on her comeback after becoming a mom in September 2017.   \"I watched a lot of tape before this match, I watched a lot of Serena kind of in the last couple of years to see what she has been like,\" Billy Heiser told CNN, adding he didn't go further back because Williams was \"basically unbelievable.\"\"Honestly, I felt this was the best match she's played in quite some time. Definitely all year. And I thought Ali brought that out of her and made her play and dig really deep. \"Serena should have all the confidence in the world.

        "content": "(CNN)Two years after the Australian government rejected a landmark plan to officially recognize indigenous people in the country's Constitution, a top official said he will move forward with a national referendum on the issue. \"I'm prepared to walk with people on all sides ... and reach a point on which we can agree,\" Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt said in a speech Wednesday, pledging to find a consensus option that could be taken to a national poll within three years. Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Islander peoples have long campaigned to be formally recognized in the Constitution. Wyatt -- the first indigenous Australian to hold his position -- said he would not bring the matter to a referendum if he didn't think it could pass, adding that he believes most Australians would support the move. Changing the country's constitution is no easy matter, however, and even relatively small opposition could derail it. Per section 128 of Australia's constitution, any law seeking to change it must pass with an absolute majority in both houses of parliament and in a referendum of each state and territory of the nation.  Indigenous people make up just 2% of Australia's population, and while most non-indigenous Australians would be likely to support the change, resistance is expected to come from right wing groups who disapprove of creating special categories for indigenous people and from conservatives unwilling to amend the constitution. Read MoreThe Indigenous Flag is seen flying during a march on July 5 to mark National Aboriginal and Islanders Day Observance Committee week.Wyatt, who has not made clear what precisely the eventual referendum will decide, raised eyebrows in referencing Pauline Hanson, the notorious far-right politician, as an example of those whose views needed to be respected in the referendum process. Hanson has previously claimed to be \"indigenous\" herself, as she was born in Australia, comments which attracted widespread criticism and ridicule. \"I admire Pauline for what she does and I have good meetings with her,\" Wyatt said, according to the Guardian Australia. \"We don't always see eye to eye on things, but I will certainly be involving Pauline in discussions that we have, as we move forward into the future.\"Asked about racist statements by Hanson and others about indigenous people, Wyatt said \"we as Australians have to call them out, collectively.\" Failed processUntil 1967, the constitution of Australia held that \"aboriginal natives shall not be counted\" towards population numbers, essentially stripping them of citizenship rights. Australia swears in its first aboriginal ministerThat was overturned by a referendum, and indigenous communities have been working to get official recognition within the text and a say in laws which affect them. In 2016 and 2017, the government agreed to meet with indigenous community leaders for a National Constitutional Convention aimed at proposing a change to the constitution to recognize indigenous people and land use rights. After months of consultations, the Uluru Statement from the Heart called in May 2017 \"for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution.\" \"In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard,\" the statement said. \"We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.\" The coalition government at the time under Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull rejected the proposals -- which also included creating an elected Makarrata Commission which could supervise agreements between government and indigenous people -- saying they would create a \"third chamber of parliament.\" His refusal was described as a \"kick in the guts\" for indigenous groups, after years of work. A general view of Uluru, in Australia's Northern Territory. The ancient monument gave its name to a key indigenous rights statement. 'Significant day'Reacting to Wyatt's statement Wednesday, Megan Davis, a vice-chancellor at the University of New South Wales who co-authored the 2017 Uluru statement, said it was a \"really significant day in the nation's history.\" \"What we're asking for is simply an enhanced role in our democratic decision making and as you know, successive polls have shown lots of Aussies understand the logic of that, that we will have better quality policies, better quality laws and we will have a really significant impact upon disadvantage and closing the gap if we're at the table,\" Davis told CNN affiliate ABC Radio. Dean Parkin, another consultant on the Uluru statement, told the broadcaster it had a \"very clear mandate\" and its recommendations should be what is put to the constitutional vote.  \"Proportionally, it was the most significant engagement process of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around this question of constitutional and structural reform ever held,\" he said. \"I'm not pre-empting the process that will come from here. I'm hoping that the process will confirm ... that this was indeed a worthwhile and compelling constitutional change to pursue, the voice to Parliament, that this process undertaken by the minister and the government will come to the same conclusion.\"Closing the gapIndigenous people continue to suffer from severe discrepancies in terms of health, education and employment outcomes compared to white Australians. For decades, indigenous people suffered from legalized discrimination and abuse, with thousands of children of the \"lost generation\" seized from their parents and put in white-run care homes. Indigenous language and culture has also suffered greatly since Europeans invaded the continent in 1788. Protests occur every year as the country marks Australia Day on the date of the First Fleet's arrival in the country, which indigenous people view as the start of a prolonged and violent campaign of replacement against their ancestors. Progress has been slow but the pace is picking up. In 2008, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued an official apology to the country's indigenous people, saying it \"the time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.\" Some indigenous lands and monuments, including the world famous Uluru, have been returned to their original owners, though major issues remain. This week saw hordes of tourists scrambling to climb on the ancient rock before its traditional owners close it on October 26, after years of attempting to prevent what they regard as disrespectful use of a sacred object.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)On a sweltering summer's evening in 1983, a 15-year-old girl packed her flute and walked out of her family home inside the vast walls of Vatican City.Emanuela Orlandi had made this journey, from her apartment to a music lesson in central Rome, countless times before.The daughter of a prominent Vatican employee -- her father Ercole worked as a clerk in the pontiff's household -- Emanuela would take the bus outside the holy city to classes at Sant'Apollinare basilica.Her older brother Pietro remembers theirs as a charmed childhood: the Vatican's spectacular gardens were their playground, and Pope John Paul II would stop by and talk to the youngsters having fun on the manicured lawn.\"We thought we were in the safest place in the world,\" he said, explaining that the city was more like a village, inhabited by a closely-knit group of around six families.Emanuela Orlandi disappeared in 1983 on her way home from a flute lesson. Read MoreBut on this particular day, June 22, Emanuela never returned home from her music lesson.What followed is a mystery that has gripped Italians for more than three decades, inspiring conspiracy theories involving everyone from mobsters to international terrorists and the highest echelons of the Vatican.Pietro Orlandi, today in his 60s and with a shock of white hair, has relentlessly pursued each lead in a 36-year campaign to reveal what happened to his beloved sister.Now he hopes to find the answer in a small graveyard, just a few hundred meters from where their mother Maria still lives, inside the city walls.Pope John Paul II with Emanuela Orlandi (pink sweater, center), and (from right) her brother Pietro, father Ercole, and mother Maria.Look where the angel is pointing On Thursday the Vatican began an operation exhuming two tombs inside the Teutonic Cemetery, a pretty courtyard adjacent to the grand Saint Peter's Basilica, which is reserved for the burials of German-speaking Catholics.Like so much of the Vatican and its institutions, the graveyard is largely hidden from the public, tucked in behind high walls and glimpsed only through ornate metal gates.The Teutonic Cemetery in Vatican City where two tombs will be exhumed Thursday.  In summer last year, the Orlandi family received the latest in a long list of anonymous tipoffs: A photo of an angel sculpture, and an instruction to \"look where the angel is pointing.\" The message led the family to two tombs inside the Teutonic Cemetery.After campaigning from the Orlandis, the Vatican announced earlier this month it would exhume the contents of those tombs.\"Until I don't find Emanuela's body, for me it's a duty to look for her alive,\" Orlandi told CNN, ahead of the exhumation.If his sister's remains are there, it is \"at least part of the truth,\" he added. \"Then I would like to know the reasons why.\"\"Even if nothing was to be found, it cannot be the end of the story,\" he said.The operation is a complex one, involving Vatican security forces, construction workers and machinery, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said last week.Any bones found during the search would have to undergo laborious DNA analysis, which could take weeks, he added.Pietro Orlandi, the brother of missing teenager Emanuela Orlandi.Turning point in investigation Over the years, the wider investigation into Emanuela's disappearance has been handled by Italian authorities. But the Vatican has said it will handle those parts of the probe that concern its territory -- such as Thursday's exhumations.The search at the Teutonic Cemetery signals an important turning point in the Vatican's investigation, Orlandi said: \"The Vatican has never collaborated with the investigators, with us family members.\"\"They have always denied the possibility that there may be responsibilities within the Vatican, have always said that they gave everything they had and hid nothing.\"Emanuela Orlandi, pictured as a child.CNN reached out to the Vatican for comment but had not received an answer at the time of publication.Shortly after Pope Francis assumed the papacy in 2013, Orlandi said he briefly met the new pontiff, who told him: \"Emanuela is in heaven.\"His words \"froze my blood,\" said Pietro, \"to hear a Pope say Emanuela is dead.\"But he also hoped for the first time there was a \"will to collaborate and get to the truth.\" Orlandi said he had since made numerous requests to meet with the pontiff and get a further explanation, but that his attempts came to nothing.Pietro Orlandi meeting with Pope John Paul II before Emanuela went missing.Fiorenza Sarzanini, a journalist with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, who has followed the case closely for decades, had a different take on the Vatican's apparent change of heart.\"I fear that the Vatican has decided to open the tombs because they know that there is nothing inside,\" she said. \"And this will definitively put an end to the claims of the Orlandi family.\"To satisfy this request by the family -- and in such a public way, with a press release from the Vatican press office -- serves to deflect the suspicious that the Vatican State secretary knows more about the case.\"All roads lead to the Vatican Over the years there have been countless theories about what happened to Emanuela, none of which has ever been proven.One witness reported seeing a girl who fitted her description getting into a dark green BMW near the music school on the evening she disappeared. The lead was never corroborated.In the days after Emanuela disappeared, her parents received anonymous phone calls from someone promising her safe return if the Vatican released Mehmet Ali Agca -- a Turkish national who had shot Pope John Paul II in an assassination attempt two years earlier. Again, this lead came to nothing.Demonstrators gather around Pietro Orlandi during a commemoration ceremony in 2013 marking the 30th anniversary of his sister's disappearance.Then in 2012 authorities searched the tomb of mobster Enrico \"Renatino\" De Pedis, who was buried in Sant'Apollinare basilica -- near to where Emanuela was last seen -- after a tip-off suggested it held a clue to her disappearance. No evidence was found, but questions remain.\"The most incredible thing is that the Vatican has never explained why the mobster, Renatino De Pedis, was buried inside the church of Sant'Apollinare ... an important church in the center of Rome, \" said Sanzanini.Of all the different investigations, there is one \"common thread,\" said Orlandi: \"The Vatican.\"\"Every type of clue has always led to the Vatican,\" he said.But \"they have always asked the Italian authorities to investigate because according to them (the abduction) happened on Italian soil.\"Despite years of fighting for the truth, the Vatican still has a unique place in Orlandi's heart.\"For me it has always been, and perhaps still is, part of my family.\"This story has been updated to correct the date the family received the tipoff about the Vatican tombs.",

But Hamilton is chasing his numbers hard, already eclipsing the German great's total number of pole positions and most front row starts, among many others. \"In terms of raw numbers, only Schumacher can be mentioned in the same breath as Hamilton,\" US-based motorsport statistician Sean Kelly tells CNN.\"Hamilton is the only driver to have won races in every season in which he has competed, and just as with Schumacher in his pomp, Hamilton seems to reach a new milestone at every grand prix. Read More\"He's very likely to be the first driver ever to win 100 grands prix and/or take 100 pole positions -- and that's almost 10% of all F1 races ever run.\"This weekend Hamilton returns to the Silverstone circuit, less than 60 miles from where he grew up, with his sights set on a record sixth British Grand Prix. JUST WATCHEDSilverstone: The heart of British Formula OneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSilverstone: The heart of British Formula One 23:15A victory at his home track would also nudge the 34-year-old one step closer to a sixth world title this season and tantalizingly close to Schumacher's world record haul.Many fans and Formula 1 insiders thought the German's landmark would never be bettered, not even by the all-conquering hero himself when Schumacher made a shock return to the sport with Mercedes in 2010.When the legendary German chose to step away from F1 for a second time, Hamilton inherited Schumacher's race seat in 2013 and now, with the merciless Mercedes at his fingertips, he is plotting a course to surpass all of Schumacher's statistical landmarks. But could factors on and off track put the brakes on Hamilton's golden era?Rise of the Young GunsThe last race in Austria was a blockbuster reminder that the 'next generation stars' are emerging as a threat to Hamilton's current era of dominance.With the Briton hampered by a grid penalty and then front wing damage, the race to the flag was between talented 21-year-olds Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc.READ: Verstappen gets controversional win after late passAfter a breathless duel, Verstappen,-- who had fallen back to seventh at the start -- muscled his Red Bull past the Ferrari for the win, ending Mercedes' winning streak at 10 consecutive races.\"We know that Verstappen is a great talent,\" says Ben Edwards, F1 commentator for Channel 4's UK broadcasts. \"He is really going to be in prime form over the next couple of years. \"Verstappen has picked up his game as team leader at Red Bull and they're working around what he wants. If he and Red Bull really get their act together next year that could be a major threat for Hamilton and Mercedes.Rising stars: Verstappen and Leclerc could threaten Hamilton's era of dominanceThe F1 rumor mill was also churning in Austria with talk of a break clause in Verstappen's Red Bull contract, which currently ties him to the team until the end of 2020. There is even speculation that Verstappen could replace Valtteri Bottas at Mercedes next year which would give the Dutch dynamo exactly the same machinery to take the title fight to Hamilton and stop his run into the record books.\"Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff probably wouldn't want to put Verstappen alongside Hamilton from a team harmony point of view,\" says Edwards.  \"But he'd probably want him to stop him going anywhere else as he's going to be a threat wherever he is. \"Hamilton would be up for it, as he has said, as he's always ready to take down anybody. It might mean Mercedes dominate but that would be awesome, an incredible mix.\"'Too many errors' Ferrari drivers Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel should, in theory, also be able to throw a spanner in the works of Hamilton's record-breaking ambitions, after all they started the 2019 season as favorites after impressing in testing.But the Italian team, who Schumacher spurred on to five straight team and driver titles between 2000 and 2004, just haven't had the luck so far this season, with both Leclerc and Vettel losing out on race wins.READ: Ferrari loses bid to appeal Vettel penalty\"Leclerc has the potential to be a real star of the future,\" says Edwards. \"He has already shown us he has what it takes and his mental attitude is fantastic.\"JUST WATCHEDVettel: 'Rather have Kimi' than Lewis on teamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVettel: 'Rather have Kimi' than Lewis on team 02:53For the last 13 years either Hamilton or Vettel, who both made their F1 debuts in 2007, has been at the heart of the title fight, often sparring against each other.\"It's still possible that Vettel could put a world championship-winning season together,\" adds Edwards. \"But it's a crucial time in his career right now.\"He's made too many errors and in this turbo-hybrid era I don't think he's ever had a car that totally talks to him in the way that the Red Bull did.\"Vettel is still a potential threat -- but I don't see it happening this year.\"Intense battleThe only driver to halt Hamilton in his golden era, which stretches back to 2014, has been his former teammate Nico Rosberg. In 2016, the German delivered an epic campaign to deny Hamilton what would have then been a fourth world title. But it was a bruising physical and psychological battle that saw Rosberg quit F1, unwilling to go head-to-head with his old friend again. His successor, Bottas, is arguably in the best position to stop Hamilton racing away to a sixth world title this season but after a brilliant start to 2019, winning in Australia and Azerbaijan, the Finn's challenge seems to be faltering.\"The problem for Bottas is sustaining that level you need to beat Hamilton,\" adds Edwards. \"As we saw with Rosberg, it's so intense trying to take on and beat Hamilton and keeping it up all year long.\"I've been impressed with Bottas this year and I don't think his challenge has completely vanished. But he's definitely going through a rocky patch and this is the stage in the season where Hamilton traditionally starts to come on really strong.\"Dethroning MercedesIt's not only rival drivers, however, that can turn purple patches into a dose of the blues. \"F1 history is littered with examples of dominant drivers seeing their reign come to a sudden end,\" explains Kelly.\"Right now it seems like Mercedes and Hamilton will go on dominating forever, but when Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010-13 he then failed to win a race in 2014.\"Schumacher himself won five consecutive championships with Ferrari and then just a single race in 2005.\"Both Schumacher and Vettel were halted not by drivers, but by changes to the F1 rulebook.In 2005 it was tires and in 2014 major new rules on engines effectively ended the Red Bull era and laid the foundations for Hamilton's four world titles thanks to the dominant Mercedes hybrid V6 engine.The wheels came off Michael Schumacher's dominance when changes to the rules on tires were introduced in 2005With a regulation shake-up planned for 2021 -- potentially the season Hamilton goes for a record eighth title -- should he be worried?\"For 2021 there are going to be fairly major changes,\" explains Edwards. \"The aerodynamic design of the cars will be quite a major shift. It's not quite like a blank sheet of paper but it will certainly be a big step change.\"That could open the door more widely for any of the top teams to come up with a winning package.\"Kelly agrees: \"The changes coming in 2021 present an opportunity for other teams to depose Mercedes.\"Alongside the proposed new technical regulations, the FIA and Liberty Media, who bought F1 for $8 billion in 2017, also want to introduce a budget cap of around $175 million to help level the playing field among the teams.Getting stuck inHamilton is also the master of his own destiny. How long Hamilton, who divides his time between Monaco and his homes in the US, wants to keep jetting around the world for the day job remains to be seen. On his weekend off before the British Grand Prix, he was photographed partying with his celebrity circle of friends in Los Angeles. The British racer has spoken before about life outside F1 and even mooted a second career in fashion, music or acting. Hamilton's current contract with Mercedes ends at the end of 2020 -- conveniently giving him time to match Schumacher's seven world titles. But would he want to go on?JUST WATCHEDLewis Hamilton wins first F1 world title in 2008ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLewis Hamilton wins first F1 world title in 2008 01:03\"He's a difficult guy to read,\" says Edwards, who has commentated on motorsport for more than 25 years. \"But I get the feeling that he's really enjoying himself and relishing the challenge of the young stars coming along. He kind of wants to get stuck in and have a go with them. \"When a driver gets to the more mature years he has to maintain that motivation.\"Hamilton is doing that fantastically well at the moment. Somebody close to the circle working with him said to me he thinks Lewis is working harder this year than he has in the past on the technical understanding of the car and working with the team.\"So, I don't see him stopping imminently. I see him battling on next year -- and then he'll be intrigued by the new rules. If he gets his seventh title next year then you would think he would want to carry on to see if he can get that extra one.\"A perfect 10Kelly adds: \"At the current rate, Hamilton should overhaul Schumacher's 91 wins and 155 podium finishes at some stage in 2020, and he could also equal his seven world titles if he wins the championship in 2019 and 2020.\"He'd still only be 35 by then.  Kimi Raikkonen was a race winner last year just shy of 39 years old, so Hamilton would have time to pile on even more numbers.\"Speaking to David Letterman on an episode of his Netflix show My Guest Needs No Introduction recorded at the end of 2018, Hamilton said: \"Michael retired when he was 38. I'm 33. I can definitely do five years.\"Imagine that, five more years would take Hamilton to a potential perfect 10 world titles.But ask any driver in the F1 paddock and they will tell you they simply take it one race at a time because as legendary F1 commentator Murray Walker famously said: \"Anything can happen in Grand Prix racing... and it usually does.\"",

Fame can change people, and not just the players, but those around them.Luckily for Gauff, who will soar from No. 313 to No. 139 in the rankings, she can rely on some of the most experienced people in the business.When you finally have time to scroll thru twitter\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffe #idol https://t.co/Ma3PiPjg3c\u2014 Coco Gauff (@CocoGauff) July 9, 2019\n\nThe young American has been guided by Patrick Mouratoglou, the coach of her idol Serena Williams, since she was 11 years old. At 13, she signed with Team8, the agency started by 20-time major champion Roger Federer and his long-time agent, Tony Godsick.In an interview with CNN Sport at Wimbledon, Godsick said he had been \"completely\" inundated with requests from both the media and potential endorsers for Gauff in the past week. He's treading carefully, though.\"There is no rush in selling her to corporates,\" said Godsick, who started his career at management company IMG, where he guided former world No. 1 Monica Seles, former Wimbledon winner Lindsay Davenport and Anna Kournikova, who were all teenage tennis stars.\"I've been around long enough to know that that's actually not the most important thing.\" A US Open junior finalist at 13, and a junior grand slam winner at Roland-Garros at 14, Gauff has already signed three deals in the past year: with racket maker Head, pasta maker Barilla and sports clothing company New Balance. The endorsements are estimated to be worth a combined $1 million, according to Forbes.\"She is a special talent, and she has been identified as that,\" said Godsick, adding there may be room for \"one additional partner right now.\"READ: Serena Williams fined $10,000 for damaging court READ: Roger Federer: The power and presence of the $120 million manREAD: The Borg identity: Following in the footsteps of a famous fatherJUST WATCHEDCori 'Coco' Gauff on the Williams sistersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCori 'Coco' Gauff on the Williams sisters 01:51The importance of supportThe weight of expectation can be a burden, even for players who are much older than Gauff.Take Japan's Naomi Osaka, who became a global star after she won back-to-back majors at the US Open and the Australian Open. One of Japan's most popular athletes, and one of the world's best-paid female athletes with a host of lucrative endorsements, the 21-year-old left Wimbledon in tears, cutting short her press conference after a first-round exit to Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan.\"I just hope that -- I'm sure she has a good team around her, and that her parents are smart people to keep her with her feet on the ground, and not let her go into this crazy lifestyle, that kind of is thrown at her a little bit now,\" former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters told CNN Sport at Wimbledon.Gauff comes from a close-knit and sporty family. Her father, Corey Gauff, is a former college basketball player, while her mother, Candi, excelled in both gymnastics and track and field.Gauff's parents, Corey and Candi,   and members of her team including Patrick Mouratoglou.\"If you know the family, you know the structure of the family, you know her parents, you know her grandparents and you know her brothers, and you know her, she will be OK,\" said Godsick, who has two children with Mary Joe Fernandez, a former teenage tennis prodigy. \"That's not something that I am worried about.\"In the past, I have worried about other athletes, male and female, where I said 'OK, this one might be a bit tricky.'\"With them, I don't see it, because they are grounded.

Monica Seles won the first of nine grand slams at 16, while Steffi Graf, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova opened their major accounts at 17 and went on to become huge stars. But unlike Godsick's wife Fernandez, a former world No. 4 who also played her first Wimbledon at the age of 15, Gauff won't be allowed to play a full schedule for another three years.The No.1 Court crowd rises to acknowledge all the excitement @CocoGauff has given us \ud83e\udd17And remember - this is just the beginning... #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/UBiOYSxPeU\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 8, 2019\n\nThat's because of the so-called \"Age eligibility rule,\" which was implemented by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) in 1995 to prevent early-age burnout among young players, following high-profile cases including Jennifer Capriati and Andrea Jaeger.Under the rule, which has been reviewed over the years to reward outstanding players who excel with additional tournament entries, Gauff can play as many as 14 professional events until her 16th birthday on March 13, 2020. As Wimbledon was her seventh pro event, she will be allowed to play seven more, according to the WTA. She will try to qualify for next month's US Open, as she did at Wimbledon, but otherwise will have to hope for a wildcard. The rule has come under scrutiny in the past week, with Gauff's father and Swiss great Federer among those calling for changes, suggesting that by curbing the number of events a player can enter, pressure will be ramped up when they do compete.But Rafael Nadal, the last teenage male grand slam winner, disagrees.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"When you are that young, when you have her level of tennis, of course you follow the normal tour and you believe that you can manage very well, no?,\" said the Spaniard, who won the 2005 French Open at the age of 19. \"But is true that your body is still under development. Sometimes can be little bit dangerous for the injuries in the future.\"According to the WTA, young players going through various stages of adolescence should not be playing full-time on what it calls the \"high-stakes, high-performance environment,\" of the women's tour.\"At the very core of the rule is that these are children competing in an adult work place, full stop,\" Ashley Keber, WTA vice president, member relations, told CNN Sport last year.Gauff celebrates after her victory against Polona Hercog.Although Godsick said he agreed with the rule on principle, he would like it to be changed so exceptional talents like Gauff can play more.\"She is going to be a transformative personality on the women's tour and in tennis, and they are going to want to see her,\" said Godsick. \"The question is, how do you do it?\" Gauff, who is still in high school and intends to take online college courses, isn't too bothered about her limited schedule.\"Even if the restrictions weren't there, I still think I wouldn't play as much as...the older players do, just because I'm still trying to develop my game and I'm still trying to train,\" she said. \"I feel like I would obviously play more than the rules state, but I think I wouldn't try to overdo it because I'm still 15. My game isn't nearly as good as I want it to be. Taking more time to train.\"There are no guarantees, but the evidence suggests we'll be seeing plenty more of Coco Gauff.",

Of course, the opportunities to play against each other every time are less, but we are still here.\"This is turning out to be a spectacular European grand slam season for fans of the rivalry, since the duo also met at the French Open last month for the first time since 2011. Nadal won in hurricane like winds in the semifinals on the surface he owns and proceeded to land a 12th French Open crown and 18th major \u2014 now only two shy of the 37-year-old Federer. Despite falling in the 2008 final in five hours and fading light, Federer owns a men's record eight Wimbledon titles and 2-1 advantage over his left-handed foe on grass. \"Haven't played each other on this surface in a long, long time,\" said Federer. \"It's impressive to see how healthy he's stayed.

There has been no rain this fortnight at a sometimes wet Wimbledon but even if it does come in the ensuing days, a roof over Center Court has things covered. The outsider trying to upend the world No. 1 is the dogged Roberto Bautista Agut, who ended Guido Pella's breakthrough grand slam 7-5 6-4 3-6 6-3 to clinch a maiden semifinal berth at a major. Bautista Agut was meant to be on his bachelor party in Ibiza ahead of his wedding in the fall but will happily reschedule. His friends will instead watch him against 15-time major winner Djokovic in person.  Nishikori, Querrey and Goffin all won their last encounters against Wednesday's opponents but they discovered -- like countless others over the past decade -- that replicating the feat at a grand slam is a completely different proposition.

Nishikori's lasers earned the seventh seed a quick 2-0 advantage and Federer escaped from 0-40 to avoid a 3-0 hole. If, however, the first set was all about the pressure Nishikori created on Federer's serve, it was the opposite in the last three. Federer manufactured 13 break points to Nishikori's one. Nishikori indeed couldn't maintain his early momentum and perhaps the turning point was Nishikori getting broken in his opening service game of the second. The set quickly vanished and Nishikori was always hanging on thereafter. Federer netted his 100th win at Wimbledon, the first man to reach a century at a single major.

Break or set points surfaced in the next five games, with Querrey saving two of three set points at 3-5 with aces. Nadal dropped serve for 5-5 but restored his break superiority by converting on a fourth chance and saved three break points to hold for 7-5.  The unseeded Querrey never recovered.

But he is sure to garner more attention now given the way he routed Goffin to close on a second straight Wimbledon title and fifth overall.  Once the Serbian overturned a break deficit of 4-3, 30-0 in the first, a ninth semifinal at SW19 was a formality. That milestone ties Djokovic with his influential former coach Boris Becker.\"I've been playing best tennis in this tournament in the last two rounds, fourth round and today,\" said Djokovic. \"Especially today second set and third set against Goffin, who was in form, I felt like I managed to dismantle his game and find always the right shots.\"Bautista Agut is 2-0 against Djokovic in 2019 but it will take some effort by the 23rd seed to do what Goffin couldn't and oust him at a major. For all the spotlight on the contest between Federer and Nadal, Djokovic might be the beneficiary if he, as expected, makes Sunday's final \u2014 especially if Nadal and Federer play another marathon in their long awaited Wimbledon rematch.",

And I hope the house will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles \u2014 particularly when they are under pressure.\"In response to Darroch's letter, McDonald said he accepted the ambassador's resignation \"with deep personal regret.\"\"Over the last few difficult days you have behaved as you have always behaved over a long and distinguished career, with dignity, professionalism and class,\" McDonald wrote. \"The Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary and whole of the public service have stood with you: you were the target of a malicious leak; you were simply doing your job.\"Trump called the UK envoy a 'very stupid guy' and the timing couldn't be worse for BritainBritish officials spent the weekend in damage control mode after the messages were leaked, as their White House counterparts downplayed Darroch's comments.Speaking after Darroch's resignation, Johnson said he hoped whoever had leaked the cables \"is run down, caught and eviscerated.\"\"It is not right that advice to ministers -- that civil servants must be able to make in a spirit of freedom -- should be leaked,\" Johnson told Sky News.Meanwhile shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry from the UK's main opposition party said Trump's \"tantrums\" and Johnson's \"pathetic lick-spittle response,\" is something that \"shames our country.\"Who forced the UK ambassador to resign?\"It makes a laughing stock out of our government and tells everyone of Britain's brilliant representatives abroad that the next Tory prime minister will not stand up for them, even when they are simply telling the truth and doing their job,\" Thornberry said in a Labour Party statement Wednesday, which was shared with CNN. \"Sir Kim Darroch should hold his head high for the wonderful job he has done representing our country, while Boris Johnson should go and hang his head in shame,\" she added.Trump's Twitter attack on DarrochIn a series of tweets on Tuesday, Trump branded Darroch a \"wacky\" and \"very stupid guy.\"\"The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy,\" the President wrote. He also took aim at May, describing the Prime Minister's handling of Brexit as \"a disaster!\"...handled. I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military  anywhere in the World, by far...\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2019\n\nFollowing the leak, Darroch was dis-invited from a dinner with Trump, the Emir of Qatar and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday night. The ambassador also pulled out of a meeting between Ivanka Trump and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox on Tuesday.UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is standing against Boris Johnson for the leadership of the Conservative party, tweeted Wednesday that he \"profoundly\" regretted how an \"outrageous leak\" had caused Darroch's resignation.On Tuesday Hunt called Trump's comments hypocritical and said he would keep Darroch in his post if he became Britain's leader.\"Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our Prime Minister and my country. Your diplomats give their private opinions to [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo] and so do ours!\" Hunt tweeted.CNN's Luke McGee, Flo Davey-Attlee, Duarte Mendonca, Zahid Mahmood, Steve Forrest and Sarah Dean contributed reporting.",

All five suspects are Bulgarian, police added.A police spokesman told CNN that one 14-year-old had appeared before an investigating judge, and is known to police for two previous sex offenses.As children under 14 cannot be prosecuted under German judicial law, the teenager was too young to be brought to justice, the spokesman added.Essen Police described the alleged incident as a \"serious\" sex offense, which took place at around 10:15 p.m. local time on Friday. Local dogwalkers first noticed the nervousness of their pets and they eventually found the young woman with two men in a park behind their garden.Read MoreThe two males ran away, police said, but were found a short time later with three others -- who are now all being investigated. The victim, who is a German national, was taken to hospital, police added.Authorities confirmed that the two boys aged 12 cannot be criminally punished if they're found to be guilty.The five suspects under investigation are all Bulgarian, police say.Rainer Wendt, Chairman of the German Police Union, told CNN that for many years his organization has tried to lower the age of responsibility of young offenders.Wendt says those under 14 should not necessarily be incarcerated, but should be punished by being barred from specific places or people, or be registered to a youth worker whom they need to check in with on a regular basis.The German Association of Judges told CNN they were not in a position to comment about the investigation.England, Wales and Northern Ireland has the lowest age of criminal responsibility in Europe, which currently stands at 10 years old. Scotland raised the age to 12 earlier this year, after it was previously set at eight years old.However a report posted on the UK Parliament site says the age \"contravenes international juvenile justice standards,\" and that research shows that children aged 10 \"are immature in terms of moral and brain development.\"In 2007 the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) said it was not \"internationally acceptable\" to set the minimum age of criminal responsibility below the age of 12.",

        "content": "(CNN)Amid a summer packed full of major sporting events, the Netball World Cup has somewhat flown under the radar.Over time, such a position has become the game's default, at least until recently. As the global narrative surrounding women's sport has undergone overdue reform, netball has found itself at a quiet forefront.There was, perhaps, a perception -- an unjust school of thought -- that followed netball around; the idea that it was a slow, static, unwatchable discipline. The opposite of a spectator sport.In the UK, nationwide fascination came with Commonwealth gold. If sport is about moments, then Helen Housby's last-gasp penalty shot to give England a 52-51 win over Australia -- the host and favorite -- could scarcely have been more significant. It gave the tournament an unexpected winner and, ahead of July's World Cup in Liverpool, it has opened the game up to a wider imagination.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MoreNetball's die-hard followers will argue that little has changed within its sport. Yet, it is in expanding the game externally where Team England -- the Vitality Roses, as they are known -- has prospered.\"In the last two years, we have moved incredibly fast,\" reflects Tracey Neville, the national side's head coach. \"I think that win at the Commonwealth Games has added so much value for our sport.Tracey Neville cuts an animated figure during the Vitality Netball International Series match against New Zealand.\"What we have done really well is expose that and capitalize on that, because when you're winning you have to make the most of it.\"\"We want this sport to become a lot more inclusive, a lot more diverse. Winning after winning is going to be tough -- particularly on home soil. But I think, from our point of view, we are on a wave and we want that wave to continue.\"Nike has come on board as the team's kit supplier, while insurance firm Vitality has long since been a major backer. They are the perks that come with winning. In the year since the dramatic victory -- a game watched by more than 1.5 million people in the UK despite its nighttime airing, more than 130,000 people have taken up the sport in England.They are encouraging figures for Neville, who is stepping down following the World Cup after four years at the helm, as steps on a journey that shows no signs of abating. The ultimate dream, however, remains in a distant future.\"The icon of men's sport is probably 30 or 40 years above us,\" she explains. \"However, I think we are moving forward very quickly. Now, with male sportspeople speaking out about women's sport and huge companies coming on board that have an impact on so many people, I actually think it will move at a quicker rate than what we expect. There is more work to be done.\"I would like us to get to the point where it's not called 'women's sport' anymore and it's just called 'sport.' That is where I'd like to see it move to. The way we brand it is really important and it becomes a stigma.\"Neville speaks with more authority on the subject than most, having seen firsthand the value of positive sporting role models. Her brothers, Gary and Phil, made more than 600 appearances between them for Manchester United. Phil, meanwhile, has been in the spotlight recently as the head coach of England's women's football team that finished fourth at the World Cup.Phil Neville consoles England captain Steph Houghton after the Lionesses' Women's World Cup semifinal defeat.\"I actually don't look at us like that [as a successful sporting family],\" stresses Tracey, who is Phil's twin.\"We work hard. We love sport. We enjoy it and we're passionate about it. If you go to work every day and you love your job, you never really feel like you're having to work.\"Sport, for us, is like eating three meals per day. It isn't a dinner table conversation for us because it's everyday conversation for us. It's nothing unique.\"We love sport and want to be part of it. We want to give back to it, having retired from playing. From an outsider's point of view, we're successful. But from our point of view, it's like a journalist writing their best article. It is what you strive for.\"In a family as governed by competitive sport as the Neville clan, there must have been a starting point, a reason, a motivation. While Tracey and Phil have become major influences in the face of women's sport in their country, Gary -- a former manager of La Liga club Valencia and a highly-regarded pundit -- also regularly champions his support for his sister's exploits via Twitter.Neville represented England for 15 years until 2008. \"My mum was my role model,\" Tracey states of her mother, a keen netball player herself. \"She was for all three of us. She's actually the only family member who's still playing sport competitively on a weekly basis.\"She was the one who drove my interest in sport and made sure that we had a lot of opportunities to go out and do it. That's the main priority for me. You need role models. It doesn't necessarily need to be your mum; it could be your dad, a family friend, your auntie. You need ambassadors to be able to get yourself involved in that.\"As women's sport continues to grow, so too does the importance of breaking down barriers increase. Neville's focus is on simplicity: she wishes not to reinvent the wheel, but to make improvements where change is the obvious answer.She speaks of extensions on physical education lesson times at schools, arguing that it would give girls the chance to get changed and put makeup on. She suggests making changing rooms better equipped -- with hairdryers and straighteners -- to deal with a new generation of female athletes and empowered youngsters.\"Society has moved on about the expectation,\" she explains. \"I look at our England girls. They have fake tan, lashes, they do their hair. They want to win, but you don't just want to play well. You want to look good while you're doing it.\"That is where women's sport is moving to. It is about making an effort and having a brand you are really proud of. From my point of view, the obstacles in place are easily overcome without much money being spent on it.\"JUST WATCHEDCheck out England's biggest female sportReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCheck out England's biggest female sport 03:03As a smaller sport by virtue of its fairly uncommon position, Neville's thought process is just as well. Without male counterpart teams or, indeed, male players, the sport comes with a ceiling of sorts. Financially, it is more difficult; in the UK, the sport's professional program is funded by the game's national governing body. Given the sport's budget, it makes completely professionalizing English netball a difficult task.\"If you look at women's football, Chelsea can bring out \u00a32 million and put it into the women's team,\" Neville explains. \"We haven't got anyone who is willing to do that across the whole program. That is where it is a little bit of a negative -- we just don't have that easy access to funds. It would speed the process up. We would love to move towards a more professional version of the game.\"Despite the situation, Neville remains an intensely positive voice. \"I don't think it's a frustration,\" she says of the financial disparity between her own sport and that of her siblings.\"Me, Gary and Phil have actually grown up with very similar career paths. But the external rewards have been so different. From my point of view, I have never seen it as a frustration because I have just taken every opportunity that I can. You have to live to your means. If you get frustrated about it, that is when you find negativity.\"And, perhaps, it is for this reason that netball is thriving so greatly. The upcoming World Cup is a global event in every sense of the term; if there is skepticism around the makeup of certain world championship competitions, then this summer's extravaganza of netball cannot be tainted with the same brush.England players in action against Scotland at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. While the ongoing Cricket World Cup featured ten sides -- five of which are from the subcontinent and only one from Europe -- Liverpool will play host to a veritable range of nations. Australia and England, Jamaica and South Africa, Malawi and Samoa, Sri Lanka and Uganda, Scotland and Barbados. It is a World Cup featuring the entire world.It is a tournament that highlights a rare diversity, a characteristic that -- at least in some way -- has is roots in the game's simplicity.As Neville points out: \"All you need is a ball, two posts and an outdoor playing area. If you're not playing at the top level, it is a very cheap sport to play. It is a bit like football in Brazil -- all you need is a ball and a street.\"I have been out to countries where they play in bare feet. It is so rewarding to watch, and it reminds me of how fortunate we are here.\"Teams [in the UK] are attracting players from Africa, Australia, the Caribbean. There are also some Fijians and Samoans in our league. Just to include their cultures, you learn so much.\"The stories that these athletes come with and the hardships some of them have experienced make you realize that sport can be so rewarding. It gives them a better life, it creates opportunities for them and it helps them to support their families back home.\"",

Even the most ardent of New Zealand supporters must have feared the worst after watching its side limp to 239-8 off its 50 overs.That it contrived to lose by 18 runs after a thrilling contest should finally extinguish the aura of this Indian side.A disappointing result, but good to see #TeamIndia's fighting spirit till the very end.India batted, bowled, fielded well throughout the tournament, of which we are very proud.

For New Zealand, this was the kind of scenario it has thrived on. Consistently overlooked, consistently underestimated, and consistently capable of making everyone else look foolish, the Black Caps did what it does best once again.New Zealand's captain Kane Williamson scored 67 in his innings.\"It's a different feeling to last time,\" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson told Sky Sports after making a second successive World Cup final.\"We've had to skin it over the round robin, so it's been quite different. A lot of heart has been shown by the guys so far but we're keeping our feet on the ground. It was a great semifinal and we're happy to be on the right side of it.\"This was one day cricket at its absolute best. Its ability to leave you breathless and exhausted while thrilling in equal capacity could scarcely have been better showcased by this contest. The statistics would have told you that New Zealand had no right to win this contest. It had lost its three previous group games and had only qualified for the last four by virtue of having a superior run rate to Pakistan.JUST WATCHEDViv Richards: Virat Kohli reminds me of myselfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHViv Richards: Virat Kohli reminds me of myself 02:06The statistics would also have told you that in its seven previous World Cup semifinals, it has only won once. And perhaps the most tangible statistic was provided by the score predictor, which signaled that New Zealand was facing a 98% chance of defeat.Perhaps nobody quite took note of the other two percent.For within the opening minutes of India's innings, this tie was not only turned on its head, it had turned the entire cricket world on its very axis.India, a team full of world superstars and one of the most vaunted batting line-ups in the game, was blown away by a New Zealand side desperate for redemption and another crack at glory after losing out in the 2015 final.READ: Virat Kohli's fan club -- 103 million followers and Viv RichardsREAD: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says RichardsJimmy Neesham catches Dinesh Kartik as New Zealand takes control at Old Trafford.The task was formidable. Sharma, came into the contest with five centuries to his name, a record for a single tournament. And yet it was he, one of India's most assured players, who became the first victim in what was an absolutely manic opening period to the innings.Matt Henry, who had previously managed to take just three wickets at a cost of 239 runs in his previous five innings, produced an inspired spell to claim  3-15, including the wicket of Sharma, in five spellbinding overs.Henry had Sharma caught behind for just one before fellow strike bowler Trent Boult struck to dismiss India captain Kohli for the same score. Henry added then added the wicket of KL Rahul to leave India reeling on 5-3 -- its worst ever start to a World Cup match.It was the first time in all international cricket, both men's and women's, that the top three have all been dismissed for one. When Henry claimed his third wicket, that of Dinesh Karthik, India was 24-4 and facing total humiliation. Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya attempted to stage some sort of recovery, taking India to 71 before Pant was caught off the bowling of Mitchell Santner by Colin de Grandhomme for 32.MS Dhoni provided some stability for India during the run chase.Pant's dismissal brought Mahendra Singh Dhoni to the crease, the 38-year-old playing in his 350th one day international contest. It was Dhoni, after Pandya was dismissed for 32, who began to attempt a salvage operation alongside Ravindra Jadeja as India slumped to 92-6.Slowly but surely, the two began to fightback and give India a chance with 62 required from the final six overs after reaching 178-6.Suddenly, one partnership had begun to swing the tie. New Zealand, so dominant in the early stages of the Indian innings, began to look anxious as Jadeja took aim at the bowlers.Having already hit a half-century, Jadeja continued to hit out, scoring at will as Indian made further inroads into the New Zealand total.But just as the impossible was beginning to appear possible, New Zealand made the crucial breakthrough with Boult removing Jadeja for 77 off 59 deliveries.Ravindra Jadeja hit 77 off 59 deliveries to give India a fighting chance.With Jadeja's dismissal, India's hopes rested on the experienced shoulders of Dhoni.Playing in what could be his final World Cup match, Dhoni set about the task in hand, blasting Lockie Ferguson for six to spark celebrations among the Indian fans in the stands.But as those Indian fans dared to dream, New Zealand once again snatched away any semblance of hope as Martin Guptil produced an outstanding piece of fielding to run Dhoni out for 49.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosDhoni, clearly emotional, left the field of play to a standing ovation. An icon of Indian cricket, a man at the heart of the 2011 World Cup triumph, his departure signalled the end for this current team of hopefuls.Bhuvneshwar Kumar, the new batsman, was dismissed without scoring after being bowled by Ferguson to leave India needing 23 off the final over with just one wicket in hand.And when Yuzvendra Chahal edged a Jimmy Neesham delivery behind, India's World Cup dream was finally extinguished.Virat Kohli walks back to the changing room after losing the semifinal.\"It's tough -- 45 minutes of bad cricket put you out of the tournament,\" Kohli told Sky Sports after the game.\"It's hard to come to terms with but New Zealand deserve it -- they put us under pressure and came through in the key moments.\"Our shot selection could've been better but otherwise we played a good brand of cricket and I'm proud of the way we played.\"Come the knockouts it is anyone's game and New Zealand showed more composure and were braver and they deserve to go through to the semifinals.\"",

She believed she owed Osaka an apology, Williams revealed in an essay published Tuesday in Harper's BAZAAR.While a then-20-year-old Osaka prevailed against her idol 6-2, 6-4 in New York to win her first major, it was overshadowed by controversy, with Williams clashing with chair umpire Carlos Ramos, culminating when he docked her a game for calling him a \"thief.\"Serena Williams reaches Wimbledon semifinalsAfter the match, while Osaka accepted the trophy, boos rang around Arthur Ashe Stadium. Osaka wept.\"Not only was a game taken from me but a defining, triumphant moment was taken from another player, something she should remember as one of the happiest memories in her long and successful career,\" the 37-year-old Williams wrote. \"My heart broke.\"As the days passed, Williams said in the essay, she started seeing a therapist and wasn't ready to pick up a tennis racket. She decided to write to Osaka, and here is what she said:Read MoreCori 'Coco' Gauff, 15, eyes US Open win after 'crazy' Wimbledon run \"As I said on the court, I am so proud of you and I am truly sorry. I thought I was doing the right thing in sticking up for myself. But I had no idea the media would pit us against each other. I would love the chance to live that moment over again. I am, was, and will always be happy for you and supportive of you. I would never, ever want the light to shine away from another female, specifically another black female athlete. I can't wait for your future, and believe me I will always be watching as a big fan! I wish you only success today and in the future. Once again, I am so proud of you. All my love and your fan, Serena.\"When Williams received Osaka's response, the 23-time major champion said tears rolled down her face.\"People can misunderstand anger for strength because they can't differentiate between the two,\" Osaka replied, according to Williams. \"No one has stood up for themselves the way you have and you need to continue trailblazing.\"Naomi Osaka on setbacks, role models and inspiring othersWilliams went on to write in the essay: \"It was in this moment that I realized the real reason the US Open was so hard for me to get over: It wasn't because of the backlash I faced but rather because of what had happened to the young woman who deserved so much more in her special moment. I had felt that it was my fault and that I should have kept my mouth closed. But now, seeing her text putting everything in perspective, I realized she was right.\"On the same day the essay was released, Williams defeated American compatriot Alison Riske to advance to the Wimbledon semifinals. Should Williams win the tournament, she would tie Margaret Court with 24 major singles titles, the most of all time. She's also bidding to become the fourth mother to win a major singles title in the Open Era, following Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Kim Clijsters.\"Ultimately, my daughter is the reason I use my voice, the reason I picked up a racket again,\" Williams wrote.",

Eaton usually ran for 30 minutes every day and was a regular face at the conference, according to the Facebook page. Her family believe she went missing during a run within 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) of the academy complex. \"Due to the rough terrain and extreme heat, we believe the most likely possibility is that Suzanne may have either become overheated and looked for shade or that she may have fallen,\" said a Facebook post.While Eaton's employer acknowledged in an earlier statement that the \"most likely\" scenario was that she had gone for a run, it added: \"There are many observations that challenge such a theory, including the heat of the day suggesting that a swim would have been more attractive.\"\"As well as being a leading scientist in her field, Suzanne is a strong athlete, runner and senior black belt in Tae Kwon Do,\" the statement added. \"If anyone can find her way out of a difficult situation it is Suzanne.\"CNN's Elinda Labropoulou in Athens, Arnaud Siad and Sarah Dean in London contributed to this report",

The gang is thought to have made more than \u00a32 million ($2.5 million) from trafficking its victims from Poland.   Five men and three women, all originally from Poland, were sentenced for a total of more than 55 years. Some had been sentenced in February, but reporting restrictions on the case prevented them being named until last Friday.Read MorePolice believe there were up to 400 victims in all. Aged from 17 to their 60s, they were promised jobs and accommodation in the UK, but were forced to work at farms and waste recycling centers in the West Midlands, and had most of their salaries taken by traffickers. Some worked for just 50p (63 cents) an hour.CNN Freedom Project: More on modern slavery They were made to live in cramped housing, some without working toilets or heating. Some victims said they were forced to wash in canal water and fed out-of-date food; some were beaten.A property where some of the victims lived.Treated as 'commodities' Police began investigating in February 2015, after two victims escaped their captors and were helped by slavery charity Hope for Justice. They escaped ISIS. Then they got sucked into Baghdad's sex trafficking underworld Detective chief inspector Nick Dale, senior investigating officer, said the gang treated its victims as \"commodities purely for their own greed.\"He said that if victims objected to their treatment, they were beaten or threatened with violence and were told family members in Poland would be attacked. Some were told they would be taken to the woods to dig their own graves, Dale said.\"Most felt powerless to escape, with no knowledge of the area, little or no English language skills, and no-one to turn to for help,\" Dale added. \"Their lives were reduced to misery and they all have the physical and psychological scars of their exploitation.\"'A growing problem'The charity Salvation Army provides outreach and accommodation for traffickineg survivors, and supported some of the victims in this case. Emilie Martin, of the group's anti-trafficking and modern slavery unit, told CNN that labor trafficking is a growing problem in the UK.\"It used to be that our referrals were predominantly for female exploitation and forced prostitution, but with awareness training people are starting to notice different kinds of exploitation and police are realizing labor exploitation is very much on the increase,\" she said.Report claims thousands of North Korean women sold into sex slavery in ChinaShe added that exploitation of Eastern Europeans was increasing.In 2017, 6,837 potential slavery victims were identified in the UK, according to the 2018 UK Annual Report on Modern Slavery.

Romania and Poland were also among the 10 most common origin countries.Labor exploitation was the most reported, followed by sexual exploitation.Read: US adds Saudi Arabia and Cuba to worst human traffickers listIn May 2018, a report by a group of UK lawmakers said that sex trafficking was taking place on what one lawmaker called an \"industrial scale\" across England and Wales, with huge numbers of women, predominantly from Eastern Europe, being trafficked into \"pop-up\" brothels. More than a third of potential victims were Romanian.It also noted that organized crime groups \"increasingly dominate the sexual exploitation of women.\"In 2015 the UK introduced the Modern Slavery Act, which gave crime agencies new tools for tackling trafficking, including a maximum life sentence for perpetrators. In an independent review published earlier this year, a lawmaker described the act as \"world leading,\" but said there were still too few convictions.Martin said labor trafficking victims weren't always vulnerable people, but simply job seekers who were being tricked by deceitful traffickers into going to the UK, and then exploited.\"Some people are very educated, well qualified individuals applying for what looks like a genuine role only to find themselves in a situation of exploitation,\" she said.",

Patients gradually lose control of muscle movement, affecting their ability to speak, walk, eat and ultimately breathe.It is, in Falivena's words, \"a devastating diagnosis.\" But it is one he, and so many others touched by the disease, are determined to put an end to.\"If my time is truly limited, I want to use it the best way possible,\" Falivena said to CNN. \"So, the two thoughts in my head were: I want to do something with my family, and I want to do something that's going to have an impact against ALS.\"He and his family hit the road this summer, with the plan of Falivena seeing a game at every MLB ballpark over a three-month span. Falivena, his wife Shana and their two sons, Quinn, 14, and Piersen, 12, have traded the comfort of their home in Apex, North Carolina, for life in a 26-foot RV. Read MoreFalivena's journey began May 30. It continues Tuesday to Progressive Field -- his 13th stadium -- for the MLB All-Star Game in Cleveland, Ohio. \"People with this disease, they're not quitters,\" Falivena said. \"They get up and they fight.\"Game #10 Comerica Park. Tigers beat the Nationals, and a great game in the hot sun! pic.twitter.com/bLxWKpk9z3\u2014 Larry Falivena (@lfchallengeals) July 1, 2019\nAccepting the challengeIn 2014, ALS resurfaced in the national and international consciousness via a viral sensation known as the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Millions of people, including Falivena and his family, took the plunge and uploaded videos to social media, leading to a spike in awareness, research and over $115 million in donations to the ALS Association.Guess where I am? pic.twitter.com/1uNY74w5kd\u2014 Larry Falivena (@lfchallengeals) June 22, 2019\n\n\"To be honest, at the time I really didn't know exactly what this was,\" Falivena said. \"But when you get the diagnosis, the first thing you read is there's no cure, it's terminal and you have two to five years.\"This year the ALS Association issued the \"Challenge Me\" campaign to reignite the fight against ALS. Falivena proudly accepted. \"The theme has been positivity and hope,\" Falivena said. \"And it started with Lou Gehrig 80 years ago.\" Great time in Cooperstown yesterday. You'll never see so much baseball in one place. Also a nice little town. pic.twitter.com/ALmRrKIeJU\u2014 Larry Falivena (@lfchallengeals) June 25, 2019\nA nod to \"Iron Horse\" Lou GehrigIn February, Larry and Shana Falivena met with the CEO of the ALS Association, Calaneet Balas. Out of those talks, Falivena's Iron Horse Tour was born.While this summer marks the fifth anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge, it also marks the 80th anniversary of Gehrig's address at Yankee Stadium. Gehrig, dubbed the \"Iron Horse\" for playing 2,130 consecutive games, retired from baseball in 1939 after being diagnosed with ALS. From home plate he famously told the crowd, \"For the past two weeks, you have been reading about a bad break. Yet today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.\"Amazing night at Yankee Stadium. Thank you to @dcone36 for hosting me and my family, and helping in the fight against ALS! pic.twitter.com/QT2TOhAeEd\u2014 Larry Falivena (@lfchallengeals) June 18, 2019\nThe Iron Horse Tour is a clear acknowledgment to Gehrig. But it's also a nod to the unwavering positivity and courage that Falivena and his family have encountered when meeting people whose lives have also been touched by ALS. \"This mission is more important than being comfortable and safe and protected in our own little bubble in Apex,\" Shana Falivena said to CNN. \"We want to be out there in the world making a difference and making an impact on this disease.\"The 30th and final ballpark stop will be in AtlantaThe trip is a challenge in every sense. For Shana, figuring out how to navigate an RV through the remainder of several major cities is far from her norm. For Larry, the ballpark experience he fell in love with as a kid now includes a frustrating and exhausting journey to his seat. Their two boys, unlike in years past, will spend more time helping out and less time hanging out with their dad. Made it to Cincinnati today! Reds vs. Indians tomorrow night. Looking forward to sitting in The Great American Ballpark. pic.twitter.com/aUarJ13GDN\u2014 Larry Falivena (@lfchallengeals) July 5, 2019\nBut the Falivenas are used to accepting -- and conquering -- the challenges that this cruel disease puts in front of them every day. And they will keep moving. Their trip will conclude in Atlanta on September 8, where Falivena will watch his childhood team, the Atlanta Braves, take on the Washington Nationals.\"Visiting the 30 ballparks is great and it's amazing, but it's really the vehicle that allowed me to raise awareness, to raise money for research, raise money for the ALS Association, and at the same time be able to tell stories of all these other people who are facing ALS,\" Falivena said.

        "content": "(CNN)MotoE, the new all-electric motorcycle racing series, made its debut this weekend at Germany's iconic Sachsenring circuit. As the bikes assembled on the grid for the first ever race, it was easy to forget the astonishing story behind their journey there.At 11:45pm on March 13 this year, MotoE director Nicolas Goubert was in Jerez, Spain, after a day of testing. He recalls the night he was in bed when his phone rang. \"I picked it up and a friend of mine said: 'You'd better get down to the paddock,'\" he tells CNN. \"I replied: 'Oh come on, I'm about to go to sleep.'  My friend said: 'No, you need to get down here.'\"'Nothing remained'When Goubert arrived at the track he could scarcely believe his eyes. The entire MotoE paddock -- bikes, equipment, even the riders' leathers -- was in flames.  Read MoreThe blaze, started by a short circuit in a piece of charging equipment, had torn through the tent in which everything was housed. By the morning, all was lost.Giampiero Testoni, Chief Technology Officer of Energica -- the small Italian company that manufactures the racing bikes for MotoE -- was also in Jerez that night.

Having all the bikes ready, painted, the testing having gone so well, and then this shock, it was very hard,\" he says.Having staked so much on the championship, the Energica team was desperate to recover the situation. MotoGP administrator, Dorna, along with MotoE sponsor Enel, concurred, and an action plan was quickly put in place to start again, with the aim of getting everything rebuilt and ready to race by the summer.JUST WATCHEDAirspeeder is the F1 of the skiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAirspeeder is the F1 of the skies 01:29Livia Cevolini, Energica's CEO, told CNN she didn't have time to think. \"I just reacted,\" she said. \"I was straight on the phone. It was a hard two or three days calling all our suppliers, asking them to basically rebuild everything.\"And it really was everything. \"The most damaging thing for us was the fact that all our R&D equipment was lost,\" Testoni explains. \"We had taken everything there from the factory and all of it, even our tools, was gone.  We got back to the factory and the R&D area was literally empty.\"SolidarityHelp, however, came from all quarters. \"We had a lot of solidarity,\" the Italian continues. \"Teams offered to send us mechanics, our suppliers really wanted to help. It was incredible.\"With a background in manufacturing high tech parts for Formula One and the space industry, Energica was used to working on demanding projects, but this was an exceptionally hard slog.\"Even just building a battery pack takes almost a week,\" Testoni explains. \"We have had to work day and night to get everything finished, testing, everything.\"JUST WATCHEDThe Volocopter revolutionizes green travelReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Volocopter revolutionizes green travel 01:03Goubert is full of admiration for Energica. \"I think people were very impressed with them, they won a lot of people's respect with what they achieved.\"Herv\u00e9 Poncharal, Team Principal of Tech3, one of a number of MotoGP teams to commit to the new MotoE series, agrees. \"They did a great job, and it's not easy,\" he says. \"The worst thing in the world would have been to not have a race in 2019. Dorna, Enel, Energica, they were all committed to making sure it went ahead, and everybody responded really well.\"Overcoming such a catastrophic setback was not the only worry ahead of the championship.SmilingPoncharal says that one of his concerns was how the riders would react to the new bikes. \"We thought they were going to come out of their first run with long faces. Honestly, everybody had a smile on their face, saying it's much better than we expected.  \"The bike is heavy, but the power is good, the torque is unbelievable, they all said it is fun to ride.\"Energica CEO Livia Cevolini and CFO Andrea Vezzani.Despite the completely different power source, Poncharal says that his team engineers had a fairly simple task switching over from traditional bikes. \"For the mechanics it's not such a big challenge -- there are a lot of common features from petrol bikes. It's more of a challenge for the riders.\"Goubert says the simplicity is deliberate. \"The engineers cannot do a lot with the bike, suspension and gearing are really the only areas, but we wanted to keep it simple. It would be difficult for the riders to get used to, they have so much that is new already.\"Focus on the fightMotoE has a different philosophy to its four-wheeled cousin, Goubert says: \"Formula E has a different approach -- if the battery has a capacity of 100 laps, they make the race 105, to test how the teams can develop a strategy to finish the race. \"I respect that, but car racing for me is perhaps more a competition between engineers than drivers. Motorcycle racing is 90% rider, 10% engineers and MotoGP wants to keep it that way.

You will always have the old traditional people, who want the world to be how it was in 1960, but this is the future.\"Established talentThe MotoE grid on Sunday was packed with established talent, from legendary veterans like Sete Gibernau, Mike Di Meglio and Randy De Puniet, to established MotoGP names like Bradley Smith and Moto2 talent such as Hector Garzo.  There was also a female rider, in former Moto3 racer Maria Herrera.Niki Tuuli, the Finnish rider who joined the Ajo MotoE team from the Supersport category, was on pole after a dominant qualifying display in which he seemed to steal a significant march on his competitors.Maria Herrera, the only female racer in MotoE, lining up on the grid.The race got off to a frenetic start, as the bikes whirred off the line in front of a curious Sachsenring crowd. For the first five laps, Smith, Di Meglio, Garzo and Tuuli switched places in a battle that lived up to the promise of close racing.Red flagBut just as the fight for the win began in earnest, things came to a sudden and unexpected end. Lorenzo Savadori, riding for the Trentino Gresini team, slid out.  His bike tumbled into an air fence, cutting it open. Under MotoGP's strict safety rules, the deflated barrier meant an immediate red flag for the race.Tuuli, the leader at the end of lap 5, was declared the winner. Smith was second, Di Meglio third. Garzo cut a frustrated figure in fourth.Tuuli was delighted to be crowned the inaugural race victor.  \"We have many things to improve, and unfortunately today we had a really short race. But in the end we were first all weekend so it's a good start to the year,\" he told reporters.Hector Garzo was frustrated but philosophical about his fourth place.Fourth place Garzo was philosophical. \"The lap before the red flag I tried to overtake Mike, and I thought: 'Wait one more lap,'\" the smiling Tech3 rider told CNN. \"I was keeping my tires in good condition for the last lap, but you never know when there is going to be a red flag. I'm happy because the four riders in the front group finished together, I was not on the podium, but for me it's okay.\"The real victoryIn a way, simply staging a race at all was the real victory in Germany. \"I don't have words to describe the feeling of walking out onto the grid.

        "content": "London (CNN)Monika Neall was standing outside an abortion clinic in Manchester when she saw a woman in her mid-20s dart out the doors. The woman moved towards a parked car, then suddenly froze.On the ground nearby lay plastic fetus models, candles and images of mothers gazing adoringly at babies. Panicking, she caught Neall's eye. \"That's my car,\" she said, her voice starting to crack.  Most Saturday mornings, Neall puts on a pink vest and joins a small group of women from the volunteer organization Sister Supporter. They stand outside the Marie Stopes clinic in the northern English city to oppose the anti-abortion protests that are held there weekly.On this particular weekend, Neall said, the anti-abortion protesters had blocked in the woman's car with their signs. \"She was quite distressed and just clearly had no idea what to do about it at all,\" she told CNN.Neall said she made sure that the protesters removed their placards, so the woman could get to her vehicle without being approached. Read More\"We will be a physical buffer zone between the protesters on the front door of the clinic, so that if women need support, or even if they just need to see that somebody else is there, countering the message,\" Neall said. Anti-abortion activists have been holding \"vigils\" outside clinics in several UK cities.According to activists, women trying to access reproductive health services in Manchester face some of the worst anti-abortion harassment ever seen in the UK.  \"Over the past 14 years, anti-abortion gatherings outside the (Manchester) center, in particular, have been escalating in frequency and size and there has been an escalation in the harassing behavior as well,\" Franki Appleton, advocacy and public affairs adviser for Marie Stopes UK, told CNN. \"We've seen an increase in, I suppose you could describe it as Americanized tactics,\" she added.The methods used by protesters vary. \"There was a woman who used to sit on the front step of the clinic and just breastfeed her baby as a form of intimidation,\" Sister Supporter volunteer Beth Redmond told CNN.Appleton said that the protests can include so-called \"pavement counseling,\" when the demonstrators intercept people trying to enter the clinic and try to dissuade them from attending appointments.Michael Freeley, a local representative from international anti-abortion group 40 Days for Life, told CNN that the group's main focus in its Manchester protests was \"quietly praying outside the clinic for the mothers and the children and for the staff.\"\"Sometimes, some volunteers might approach someone going into the clinic and offer them a leaflet with some information on helplines where they could get help on adoption or just help with the pregnancy ... to provide other options,\" he added.The group 40 Days for Life was originally started in Texas in 2004, but it now organizes \"vigils\" in countries in Europe, Africa and South America.Freeley insisted that members of his group did not harass women outside the clinics.Exclusion zonesAbortion has been legal in England, Wales and Scotland since 1967, but some groups still oppose the procedure. While some of the protests are associated with international anti-abortion movements, other groups are locally run, many of them linked to churches nearby. To counter the protests, Sister Supporter is campaigning for an exclusion zone -- a public spaces protection order (PSPO) -- around the clinic. On June 20, a Manchester City Council committee supported the petition and recommended a formal consultation over the introduction of a PSPO.The council found that \"many protesters use deliberately disturbing and graphic images and models, including those purporting to be of dismembered fetuses\" and that leaflets including \"misleading information\" had been distributed. The committee also noted that protesters often follow, record and question women as they enter or leave abortion centers in the city. Anti-abortion activists hold a rally outside the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston on June 17, 2019.The next stage of the process, the council said, will be to work with all the concerned parties and hold a public consultation. \"The use of a PSPO is a serious matter, and it is our responsibility to ensure it would be used fairly and legally,\" they added. Protests at the center occur throughout the year but intensify around the Christian holiday of Lent, where groups including 40 Days for Life gather around clinics every day.Robert Colquhoun, director of international campaigns for 40 Days for Life, denied that members of his group harass women seeking abortions, telling CNN via email: \"40 Days for Life local volunteers have organized peaceful, prayerful and legal vigils outside the Manchester Marie Stopes abortion center for 10 years now.\"\"During that time we have not seen a single substantiated case of harassment from any of our volunteers from any location in the United Kingdom.\"Turning a 'private decision into a public spectacle'Pam Lowe, a lecturer in sociology who researches women's reproductive health at the UK's Aston University, told CNN: \"Very aggressive or violent incidents are extremely rare. But that doesn't mean to say that there isn't harassment, intimidation.\"The behavior of most anti-abortion protesters amounts to \"street harassment,\" she added. \"They're drawing attention to the clinic, and this is deliberate, they specifically call themselves public witnesses, they want the public to be noticing the women going into the clinic,\" Lowe told CNN. \"What it does is it makes this private decision into a public spectacle,\" she added.Lowe told CNN that it is difficult to measure the level of clinic protests because of the different groups involved and the varying and unpredictable tactics used.  Indeed, the nature of the anti-abortion protests is drawing some women to join the counter demonstrations.After becoming involved in abortion rights campaigning before the Irish abortion referendum in 2018, Sister Supporter volunteer Shanna Lennon said she was shocked to discover that women seeking abortions faced harassment in her home city of Manchester.Ireland's yes voters celebrate a 'leap forward' in landmark vote on abortion\"I was totally shocked that it's happening so close to where I live,\" she said. \"I very much thought it was something that only happened in America.\"Abigail Sheldon was 19 when she got pregnant and decided to have an abortion. She initially wanted to have the procedure at the Manchester Marie Stopes center, located a few minutes from her house, but after some research discovered that a 40 Days For Life protest was taking place at the clinic.  \"I asked my boyfriend to go down and just see what it was like, (to) see if it was intimidating,\" Sheldon told CNN. \"He came back and was just like, 'we'll go to the hospital instead, I just don't want to put you through extra stress, not on a day that is already obviously going to be very difficult and hard.'\" After the procedure, Sheldon volunteered with Sister Supporter outside the clinic. Seeing the anti-abortion protesters outside makes her angry, she said. \"It's trying to make girls think that they haven't thought this through. Nobody goes into this situation, thinking that this is an easy decision. Nobody ever wants to have an abortion ... it's already a really devastating choice you have to make, it's already one of the hardest things you'll probably have to do in your lifetime,\" she said.Campaigners are calling for more \"buffer zones\" around abortion clinics in the UK. A nationwide debateIn 2018, 200,608 women living in England and Wales had abortions, and another 4,687 non-residents underwent the procedure here, according to government data. Every year, thousands of Irish women also travel to northern English cities, such as Manchester and Liverpool, for the procedure. While abortion was legalized in the Republic of Ireland last year, it remains illegal -- even in cases of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormality -- in Northern Ireland, where a restrictive law dating back to 1861 remains in place.In September 2018, British Home Secretary Sajid Javid rejected calls to introduce national buffer zones to all abortion facilities in England and Wales.In a written statement, Javid acknowledged that \"protest activities can involve handing out model fetuses, displaying graphic images, following people, blocking their paths and even assaulting them,\" but concluded \"that these activities are not the norm,\" with most anti-abortion activities being \"more passive in nature.\" Vatican cancels football match with Vienna over anti-abortion protestsAccording to reproductive health clinics and abortion providers, however, the events in Manchester are not isolated incidents.The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) reported protest activity at 47 clinics, healthcare centers or hospitals in the UK since 2017 -- in both towns and large cities, including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Oxford and Brighton. Adele Warton, treatment unit manager for a BPAS clinic in Bournemouth, told CNN that protests happen outside her clinic every week.\"Some of our protesters have been coming here for years. We've got a little old lady who knits little booties and puts them in the bush outside,\" she said. \"They'll often be outside with big placards of fetuses post-abortion. It's very visually grim.\"\"The protesters will also speak to the staff -- one followed a staff member to her car with a dictaphone asking her how she feels about murdering babies. We've had damage done to cars ... we've had nails in tires. They have ... thrown what they call holy water on the entrance of our buildings.\"The protests, Warton says, pose a risk to women's health.\"We've had instances where some clients are so distressed by protesters that they are too distressed to go ahead with their treatment and have postponed treatment to the next week. It's impacting the risk factor because further into the pregnancy, the risks become higher,\" Warton said.Anti-abortion protesters hold a demonstration outside the Marie Stopes clinic in London in 2017.Several British councils have already taken steps to stop such protests -- in April 2018, the West London borough of Ealing approved the introduction of the country's first PSPO around a Marie Stopes facility that provides abortion services. In March 2019, a PSPO was also introduced around a BPAS clinic in Richmond, London.The presence of protests relating to abortion had a \"detrimental impact on those accessing the clinic, working in the clinic and those living in, working in and passing through the area,\" a spokeswoman for Ealing council told CNN.The Ealing PSPO is subject to an appeal made by the Good Counsel Network, an anti-abortion group which had coordinated some of the protests in the area, the council spokeswoman said.Clare McCullough, a member of the Good Counsel Network, told CNN that the group did not harass women at abortion centers. \"We have had a witness in Ealing for 24 years now. No warnings, cautions or arrests in that time says our behavior is not harassment,\" she said via email. McCullough said her group offers alternatives to women considering abortion, as well as practical assistance and support, and that its members distribute leaflets detailing this outside abortion centers.Missouri judge's order allows Planned Parenthood to provide abortions through Friday Alithea Williams, a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion group Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) told CNN: \"SPUC does not hold or organize prayer vigils outside abortion clinics, but we support the right of pro-lifers to witness and peacefully offer help to women in need.\"\"Bans like this are bad news for free speech, and, more importantly bad news for women, who will be denied help they do not get anywhere else,\" she said.The women in Manchester disagree. Lennon told CNN: \"Ideally, there would be nobody outside that clinic -- that is the dream. We all want our Saturday mornings back, you know, we'd love not to be there.\"",

Even though the 15-year-old's historic Wimbledon concluded on \"Manic Monday,\" it's no stretch to say she has now become an idol herself. Indeed, the world fell in love with the precocious American and that continued even in a 6-3 6-3 defeat to Simona Halep on the same court where her transformative fortnight began with a victory over one of her tennis idols, Venus Williams.  Visit CNN Sport for more news and videos\"I really did feel like I was probably playing in New York somewhere,\" Gauff told reporters. \"It was really surprising because you don't really expect this kind of support when you're in another country.\" Read MoreTV figures from host broadcaster BBC showed that her nail biting win over Polona Hercog in the third round drew the highest peak Wimbledon audience in Britain of the first five days. In house she was cheered on by the throngs occupying the green Henman Hill. And back home in Delray Beach, dad Corey's bar was packed with locals who watched her become the youngest winner at Wimbledon since Jennifer Capriati in 1991. The likes of former first lady Obama and artist Jaden Smith sent congratulatory messages on social media, which Gauff certainly took note of. \"It definitely feels like everything happened so quickly,\" said Gauff. \"These two weeks have been amazing.\"READ: Coco Gauff's mom on starlet's meteoric riseREAD: Meghan watches Serena as defending champ crashes outCori Gauff struggled to find the form which cemented her as a fan favorite at Wimbledon.

But powerhouse agent Tony Godsick says they won't be rushing into deals.  \"A lot of the sponsor inquiries are from companies that want to be part of this quick success and we are only looking for long-term partners,\" Godsick, who founded Team 8 with longtime client Roger Federer, told CNN. \"Once the event is over we will sort through the opportunities and come up with a strategic plan that makes sense for where she is in her development. \"There definitely will be an emphasis on quality as opposed to quantity.\"READ: Roger Federer: The power and presence of $120 million manREAD: Naomi Osaka: An icon of the new JapanREAD: Serena 'must focus' to break records, says Billie Jean King JUST WATCHEDCori 'Coco' Gauff on the Williams sistersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCori 'Coco' Gauff on the Williams sisters 01:51Age restrictions In the next chapter, quantity is something Gauff wants as it relates to her tournaments for the rest of the season.

It's that maturity that led her coach, Frenchman Jean-Christophe Faurel, to say Gauff could handle more tournaments.  For a start, Gauff was convinced she would play at the year's next major, the US Open in August. Her ranking is now expected to move inside the top 150, but she will probably still need a wildcard to go straight into the main draw \u2014 which seems a formality \u2014 otherwise another qualifying week is on the cards. \"I think every case is different but I know Coco, I know her family, she has great parents, a great environment, she has two little brothers, and everything is very sane around her,\" Faurel told a pair of reporters in the players' garden bathed in sunshine. He added that Gauff wouldn't be thrown off by all the attention she has received. \"I think she likes it. She's programmed for that,\" he added, perhaps referring to her tennis upbringing that saw Gauff reach world No. 1 in the juniors, make the US Open junior final aged 13 and develop a big entourage. \"So I think she's ready for that. Everybody is talking about her age but the first time I talked about her age to her father he told me, 'You know what? Fifteen is just a number.' So yeah, I'm sure she will handle everything and after I want to help her.\"Steve Simon, head of the WTA, said Gauff's success at Wimbledon wouldn't lead to an abrupt revamp of the rules. \"We're not going to make one decision on one athlete and one tournament,\" Simon told CNN. \"She's got a tremendous future. We will look at things for sure and address things but our first priority is to make sure she's healthy and has a long career.\"READ: Bernard Tomic fined $56,100 for lack of effort in Wimbledon defeatSimona Halep surged to victory to progress into the quarterfinals. 'I learned a lot'No matter how much she plays in the short term, Hall of Famer Jim Courier backed Gauff to get the best out of her ability in the long run. \"She's already a terrific talent but it needs to be nurtured and with her coach and the team they've built around her and with the management group which has established that they take the long view with their players, I think she's well positioned to eventually maximize her obviously tremendous talents,\" Courier told CNN.On Monday, Gauff said her health let her down against former world No. 1 Halep, who wasn't keen on losing to another American teen after her French Open title defense ended at the hands of 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova. The trainer and doctor visited Gauff at 1-2 in the second set and she was given medication. Gauff didn't know exactly what the issue was but her extended sojourn at Wimbledon \u2014 her first grand slam, remember, and via qualifying \u2014 possibly contributed.  \"I learned a lot,\" she said, summing up her Wimbledon experience. \"I learned how to play in front of a big crowd. I learned what it was like to be under pressure. I learned a lot and I'm really thankful for this experience.\" Those who watched Wimbledon are thankful to Gauff for making it so memorable already.",

        "content": "Lyon, France (CNN)In the aftermath of World Cup final victory, USWNT coach Jill Ellis, part of her face hidden by a white cap with a USA badge on the front, was alone on a podium facing a puzzled media. Her captain was not by her side, as is usually the custom in post-match press conferences.When it was revealed that Megan Rapinoe had been picked for a doping test, the room deflated in unison. Such has been Rapinoe's pull these last few weeks that posing questions to the first coach to win the Women's World Cup twice did not have quite the allure as talking to the 34-year-old who now transcends her sport.Follow @cnnsport\n\nBut towards the end of the press conference Rapinoe emerged, to the warm applause of some in the room.\"I just killed doping,\" the ebullient forward told reporters, smiling as broadly as a World Cup winner should.Ever since Rapinoe agitated US President Donald Trump during the World Cup by saying that she would not attend the White House should the US win the competition, the forward has been the center of attention in France.Read MoreBut her performances on the pitch have elevated her to another level of stardom, too. She was the match winner in both the last-16 and the quarterfinal and also scored the opening goal in the final, helping secure a 2-0 win over the Netherlands.After the match, the forward spoke as passionately and as eloquently as she always does. Rapinoe takes a penalty awarded in the second half for a foul on Alex Morgan. READ: US Women's team crowned world championREAD: Jill Ellis -- US Soccer's record-breaking head coach'A little public shame never hurt anybody'Asked about her thoughts to the crowd's booing of FIFA president Gianni Infantino as he walked towards the presentation stage and the chorus of \"equal pay\" which rippled around the Groupama Stadium in Lyon as the USWNT prepared to lift the coveted World Cup trophy, Rapinoe said: \"I'm down with the boos.\"\"I think everyone is ready for this conversation to move to the next step,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\"I think we're done with 'are we worth it, should we have equal pay, is the markets the same, yadda, yadda.' Fans are done with that, players are done with that and, in a lot of ways, I think sponsors and everyone's done with that.\"Let's get to the next point. How do we support women's federations and women's programs around the world?\"What can FIFA do, what can we do to support the leagues around the world?\"We put on as players -- every player at this World Cup put on the most incredible show that you can ever ask for and we can't do anything more to impress more, to be better ambassadors, to take on more, to play better.\"It's time to move that conversation forward to the next step and a little public shame never hurt anybody, right.\"On Saturday Infantino described France 2019 as the \"best Women's World Cup ever.\"He also said that he wants to expand the Women's World Cup to 32 teams and double the current prize money of $30 million for the next tournament, setting out a five-point plan to make sure the sport \"seizes this opportunity.\"READ: Social media becomes ode to Rose LavelleRapinoe celebrates after scoring against the Netherlands. But even if FIFA were to double the prize money for 2023, it would still mean participants at the Women's World Cup would be receiving significantly less than men's teams. For last year's men's World Cup, the overall prize fund was $400 million, with winners France taking home $38 million.The USWNT is also fighting its own equal pay battle with the squad announcing earlier this year that they were taking legal action against their own federation, alleging \"institutional gender discrimination.\"\"It is time for the Federation to correct this disparity once and for all,\" said Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the US Women's National Team Players Association, in a statement published after the victory which gave the USWNT its fourth World Cup, a remarkable feat as there has only been eight editions of the tournament.

For the past four, five years I've seen what she's capable of. The bigger the spotlight, the more she shines. For Megan, it highlights who she is.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Greek authorities are hunting for an American scientist who has gone missing on the island of Crete and was last seen six days ago.Suzanne Eaton, a 59-year-old biologist at the Max Planck Institute at Dresden University in Germany, was attending a conference at the Orthodox Academy in northwest Crete, where she was seen on July 2. She is believed to have gone for a run when she went missing, according to a Facebook page called \"Searching for Suzanne,\" which was set up by her family. All of Eaton's belongings remain in her room, including her passport, wallet, phone, cash and cycling shoes. However, her running shoes are missing, according to the page.\"Due to the rough terrain and extreme heat, we believe the most likely possibility is that Suzanne may have either become overheated and looked for shade or that she may have fallen,\" a post on the Facebook page says.Read MoreEaton is a mother of two sons and the wife of British scientist Tony Hyman.Her employer, the Max Planck Institute, reiterated in a statement online that all theories were \"speculative\" and that the only known fact is that Eaton was last seen at the conference on Tuesday afternoon. While it acknowledged that the \"most likely\" scenario was that she had gone for a run, the institute added: \"There are many observations that challenge such a theory, including the heat of the day suggesting that a swim would have been more attractive.\"\"As well as being a leading scientist in her field, Suzanne is a strong athlete, runner and senior black belt in Tae Kwon Do,\" the statement added. \"If anyone can find her way out of a difficult situation it is Suzanne.\"Max Planck Institute said in a post on Facebook that Eaton's friends have offered a \u20ac50,000 ($56,000) reward for anyone who can provide any information about her disappearance.By Monday afternoon, the Searching for Suzanne campaign had raised more than $30,000 to pay for further search and rescue teams in Crete. The campaign is also asking Facebook users to scour through online images in order to help locate the missing scientist.",

        "content": "(CNN)As chants of \"equal pay\" erupted during the US Women's National Team's World Cup win, one thing was clear: Despite their trophy, their fight isn't over yet. In March, 28 USWNT players sued the US Soccer Federation, claiming that it is discriminating against the women's team by paying them less than members of the men's team. \"Despite the fact that these female and male players are called upon to perform the same job responsibilities on their teams and participate in international competitions for their single common employer, the USSF, the female players have been consistently paid less money than their male counterparts,\" the lawsuit reads. \"This is true even though their performance has been superior to that of the male players -- with the female players, in contrast to male players, becoming world champions.\"The money is a significant piece of the lawsuit, but it's not the only thing the women are demanding. The lawsuit also claims that the federation has denied them equal playing, training and travel conditions, as well as equal promotion, support and development for their games. Many have protested the demands, claiming that the men's sport is more difficult and more competitive because not as many countries have invested heavily in their women's teams. And so comparing the two, they say, is like comparing apples and oranges. Read MoreBut, as the USWNT mentions in the lawsuit, the conditions they play in can also be much worse. Megan Rapinoe celebrates after scoring the opening goal in Sunday's gameStar Megan Rapinoe tore a ligament in her right knee during training in Hawaii in 2015, while the team was on a victory tour after winning the Women's World Cup. Her injury came while playing on turf, artificial grass that is cheaper to maintain than real grass surfaces. Turf can lead to abrupt stops because of the way it makes contact with the studs on soccer cleats.All the games in the 2015 Women's World Cup were on turf, despite a lawsuit brought by the players. The men's tournament, meanwhile, has always been held on real grass. Here's a by-the-numbers comparison of the two teams.USWNT vs. USMNT, in numbers4: The number of World Cup wins the women's team has, in only eight tournaments.0: The number of World Cup wins the men's team has won. The last time the men's team placed was in 1930, when they finished third.4: The number of Olympic gold medals in women's soccer that the team has won, in six tournaments. 0: The number of Olympic golds the men's team has won. The men's team hasn't won an Olympic medal  in more than a century.$900,000: How much more revenue the women's team generated than the men's team from fiscal year 2016 to 2018, according to the Washington Post. $3,662,480: The amount spent on development for women's teams (under-14 teams to under-23 teams) in fiscal year 2016, according to the proposed fiscal year 2018 budget.$7,438,159: The amount spent on development for men's teams in fiscal year 2016.$11,400,000: The total projected revenue of the women's events (such as friendlies and tournament play) in fiscal year 2018. After expenses, the team made the US Soccer Federation money, with a surplus of just over $2 million, according to the proposed fiscal year 2018 budget.$10,325,000: The total projected revenue of the men's events in fiscal year 2018. After expenses, the team had a deficit of just over $3.5 million.$240,019: Carli Lloyd's salary in 2015, after winning the World Cup, according FiveThirtyEight.$428,022: Clint Dempsey's salary in 2014, after losing in the round of 16 in the World Cup, according to FiveThirtyEight.$4,950: The maximum amount per game the women's team would earn if they played 20 friendlies and won them all, according to the lawsuit, for a maximum total of $99,000.$13,166: The average amount per game the men's team would earn if they played 20 friendlies and won them all, according to the lawsuit, for a total of $263,320.These numbers represent an agreement the USWNT had with the US Soccer Federation that ended in December 2016. The Washington Post reported that, under the latest agreement, the women's team would still earn about $28,333 less than the men's team in the same scenario. If both teams lost all 20 games, the two teams would make the same amount.",

        "content": "(CNN)One English police department is trying a new, creative way to tackle isolation and loneliness among elderly people. Starting with a simple bench. The Avon and Somerset Police Department set up \"chat benches\" in two local parks in southwest England meant to spark conversation between residents. The benches feature a friendly sign that reads, \"Sit here if you don't mind someone stopping to say hello!\"According to the police department, 17% of elderly adults in the United Kingdom speak with friends, family and neighbors less than once a week. The police say infrequent contact with friendly faces can leave them more vulnerable to crimes targeting older people, like doorstep crime, fraud and online or telephone scams.\"The sign simply helps to break down the invisible social barriers that exists between strangers who find themselves sharing a common place,\" said Police Community Support Officer Tracey Grobbeler in a statement.\"Simply stopping to say 'hello' to someone at the Chat Bench could make a huge difference to the vulnerable people in our communities and help to make life a little better for them.\"Read MorePolice in England work to help the elderly surmount \"social barriers\"The police department launched the chat benches last month to show support for the United Nations' World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, which aims to reduce abuse against older people -- one of the least investigated types of violence, according to the UN.The UN reports that about 1 in 6 older people experience some form of abuse, which is predicted to increase as many countries face rapidly aging populations.\"Any form of abuse is completely unacceptable and it fills me with sadness to think that this cruelty happens to members of our elderly community,\" said Avon and Somerset Police Commissioner Sue Mountstevens in a statement.To help tackle these issues, Mountstevens encourages the community to spark conversations with older people beyond the park benches as well.\"The Chat Bench is [a] fantastic new initiative that I hope encourages those of all ages to start many more conversations in the future,\" Mountstevens said.\"If you think an elderly friend, neighbour or relative is vulnerable or at risk of loneliness, I encourage you to stop by and say 'hello.' It really could make a huge difference to that person.\"",

        "content": "Lyon, France (CNN)When a novice is faced with a foe as experienced and ruthless as the USWNT at the Women's World Cup, the outcome is almost inevitable and so it was on a muggy early evening in Lyon when the reigning world champion defended its title with a comfortable 2-0 win over the Netherlands.Competing in its first World Cup final, few gave the Dutch hope. The reigning European champion it may be, but it had not yet come up against the best team in the world, the dominant force of its generation.The Netherlands held on for over an hour but two goals within eight minutes sealed the underdog's fate. This was the tournament where Megan Rapinoe transcended her sport, and so it was perhaps apt that the 34-year-old opened the scoring, coolly drilling home a penalty before a Rose Lavelle thunderbolt made sure of a second successive title, and a fourth in eight editions.  READ: US Soccer's record-breaking head coachRapinoe celebrates scoring the opening goal in the 61st minute.Read MoreMuch has been written during this tournament about the European teams in rapid pursuit of the USWNT, posing a threat to a soccer dynasty. That it was both Lavelle and Rapinoe, representing the team's youth and experience respectively, who scored was a perfect way to illustrates that the US possess the personnel to see off challengers for some time to come.Leading the chase are those European countries whose men's national teams have traditionally been superpowers of the beautiful game.The Dutch, English and French football federations have started to invest heavily in women's football. But, in France at least, all have been vanquished. Thailand, Chile, Sweden, Spain, France, England and now the Netherlands have been swept aside by a team unbeaten in 17 World Cup matches.\"The level around the world is going exponentially every year,\" Jill Ellis, the first coach to win the Women's World Cup twice, told reporters after the match. \"Four years on, this was incredibly difficult because the opponent is better The teams that we had to come through are some of the best teams in the world. In terms of the path and the level, this was pretty challenging.\"READ: Rapinoe doesn't think FIFA respects women as much as men\n\n\n\n\nThe Netherlands soaked up the US pressure in the first half. There were white shirts coming at them from every direction, aiming crosses from wide, from deep, attempting cute through-balls to catch the first-time finalists off their guard.Those in orange needed to summon up the concentration levels of a chess grand master, but that's what it's like facing a team with an unceasing desire to win. They are always in motion; keeping possession, positioning themselves high up the pitch, never resting. Opponents are left to backpedal, to organize and resist when under intense stress, but the grandest of sporting stages are always as much a mental battle as physical.And then there was the predominantly American crowd raising the decibels; moving towards the edge of their seats in anticipation of that killer through ball, roaring at every shot that seems to be flying towards goal, making it impossible to forget that this is a match like no other. Grand masters, at least, have the privilege of focusing in silence.Penalty after VAR reviewThat the Netherlands withstood the US until the hour mark was admirable. It is the only team in this tournament which the USWNT has been unable to breach within the opening 12 minutes.Much of the credit will be heaped on the acrobatic Dutch goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal. First, she saved a Julie Ertz volley, then the woodwork assisted her gather of the first of two Alex Morgan attempts. It was pure instinct which saw her deny Morgan for the second time before the break.Alex Morgan and Allie Long celebrate winning the US' fourth world title. Had the Netherlands maintained its composure in the final third then history could have come to regard this as the match where the emerging force knocked the USWNT off its perch. The Netherlands did cause the USWNT a moment of worry. Alyssa Naeher had to sprint off her line at the sight of Lineth Beerensteyn charging towards goal with the score goalless. It was a move which highlighted the US defense's occasional vulnerability to be cut open with a clever pass.READ: Dutch rise was decades in the makingBut after the break the USWNT cut loose. When French referee Stephanie Frappart opted to bring VAR into play, showing Stefanie van der Gragt to have felled Morgan, it felt almost certain that the penalty would be awarded.Rapinoe stepped up to score her sixth goal of the tournament and celebrated with arms outstretched in a pose which became iconic when she celebrated in the same way in scoring against France just days after irking US President Donald Trump.Her teammates engulfed her near the corner flag, with even the substitutes sprinting half the length of the pitch to join the celebrations. Given the doggedness of Dutch resistance, the relief of the US team was tangible.The penalty secured Rapinoe the Golden Boot, beating teammate Morgan -- who also ended the tournament with six goals and three assists -- courtesy of minutes per goal. Rapinoe, only the second player in history to start in three World Cup finals, was also awarded the Golden Ball, given to the tournament's best player. It was only after going 1-0 down that the Netherlands attack, its most potent weapon, seemed to feel at ease in its surroundings, but teams who fall behind to the USWNT rarely recover. And so it proved as Lavelle, who watched the 2015 final in a pizza shop, struck quickly to double the advantage. Gathering the ball in the center circle, Lavelle surged forward -- the 24-year-old's mastery of the ball at pace making it impossible for her opponents to thwart her. With a swivel of the hips, she evaded two oncoming Dutch defenders before hitting the bottom-right corner.Were it not for Van Veenendaal -- who wears boots a size too small out of superstition -- the score could have been higher. The 29-year-old stopped Morgan, Tobin Heath and Crystal Dunn from making it three.\"We'd have loved to have win this final but we didn't, our opponent was better today,\" said Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman. \"We're second in the world and I'm very proud of that, I'm proud of the team and proud of the staff. And I think we can still improve.\"",

The players compete in pairs in a three-round, single-elimination bracket.MLB All-Star Game Fast FactsLast year, the total prize pool for the home run derby was only $525,000, with the winner taking home $125,000. This year, nearly $2 million was added to the pot. With $1 million of the $2.5 million prize pool going to the winner, expect the competition to be more fierce with significantly more money on the line.Eight players are participating in the derby: Josh Bell, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Joc Pederson, Pete Alonso, Carlos Santana, Matt Chapman, Alex Bregman and Ronald Acuna.Read MoreChristian Yelich, the current leader for home runs halfway through the 2019 MLB season, had to pull out of the competition with a back issue and was replaced by Chapman.This guy hasn't played in the MLB since 2001. But one team is paying him $1.2 million a year until 2035 Of those eight players, five of them will make less than $1 million in salary for the 2019 season. Acuna already makes $1 million. If any of those players win, it will at least double their earnings for the year. Even better for them is that they'll have made that money in only a few short hours, compared to the hundreds of hours they potentially have to play throughout the season.By increasing the prize pool, the league will be in a better position to attract some of the game's top stars to compete in the future. Some notable MLB superstars such as Mike Trout have never participated in the competition, but that could change moving forward.",

        "content": "Lyon, France (CNN)A few hours before Sunday's Women's World Cup final, John Ellis will seat himself at his organ and play \"You'll Never Walk Alone,\" Liverpool Football Club's stirring anthem. A Royal Marine commando who became a football coach, the 80-year-old is no vocalist, but nevertheless he will warmly sing the words and glance at a framed photograph of his daughter, Jill. It is a ritual the Englishman goes through every time the United States plays.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe picture John Ellis has above his organ is one taken during a jubilant time for the family and its adopted country, when Jill guided the United States to World Cup victory in 2015. There may be another photo to be put above the instrument Jill bought her father some years ago when he decided to learn to play because the USWNT head coach is a match away from retaining the title and making history. \"That song says it all,\" he tells CNN Sport over the phone from his Florida retirement home. \"When you're the head coach, you're the one on the line and that's why I sing that song to her, so she knows her mum, her dad, her brother are always here for her. I know it sounds stupid, but that's what I do.\"When you see your daughter out there, and the expectation and the pressure on her ... America is a wonderful country to live in, but don't lose. You've got to get it done.\"Ellis speaks to defender Abby Dahlkemper during the semi-final against England.Read MoreShould the US triumph over the Netherlands in Lyon Sunday, the 52-year-old, described by her father as a strong but gentle soul, will become the first coach to win the biggest prize in women's football twice. In the history of the game, Vittorio Pozzo is the only coach to win two World Cup titles, leading Italy to victory in 1934 and 1938. Her record is phenomenal: In 126 games as US head coach, she has won 101 and lost just seven. She has never lost a World Cup match. But like most of sport's elite coaches, Ellis divides opinion. Her team has yet to lose a match in France; it recorded the biggest win in World Cup history by trouncing Thailand 13-0, and emerged from the group stages with a goal difference no team in the competition's history has achieved.The USWNT has beaten an emerging force in Spain, and the No.3 and No. 4 team in the world in England and France respectively. Yet Ellis has still been criticized: for her substitutions, for being too defensive, for being too adventurous, for not being a true leader. \"When you take these big jobs, you understand that you have to be able to deal with that side of it,\" says her father, himself a former USWNT assistant coach. \"Reading the newspapers, some people just don't like her, but the ironic thing is they don't know her.\"Ellis celebrates with goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher after the semifinal against England.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosA football awakeningEngland in the 1970s was not a country where young girls could harbor ambitions of becoming footballers. It was only in 1971 that the English Football Association ended the decree which banned women's matches from being played on the grounds of its member clubs. Eager to encourage his daughter's enthusiasm for sport but knowing that there was no future in football for girls in his homeland, John Ellis would take her to a running track near the family's home in Portsmouth, a port city on the English south coast. Often, he would stand near the bend before the home straight and watch Jill grit her teeth as she sprinted by.JUST WATCHEDThe American Outlaws: Team USA's super supportReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe American Outlaws: Team USA's super support 02:32\"I could tell she had this spirit,\" he says, \"this drive to win. That's when I first saw it in her, on the running track. She was a little girl and I never tried to develop it. I've never tried to develop her. These things just came together.\"An invitation for John Ellis to coach Annandale Boys Club in Virginia resulted in the family moving to America in 1981, which proved to be Jill's soccer awakening.The lifelong Manchester United fan had grown up playing soccer on the streets with her brother and his friends, but had never been part of a team. That changed when the then-teenager joined Braddock Road Bluebells. \"There was just something about soccer,\" Ellis has said. \"I don't think I would have had that opportunity until a lot later in England, and I probably wouldn't have pursued a career.\"READ: The match that changed women's footballMeanwhile, at the family home, Jill was surrounded by soccer. With her father having set up a soccer academy, she would absorb information almost through osmosis. Former English professionals would visit the home and she would regularly attend her dad's training camps.\"There were no American coaches who knew anything about soccer back in the 1980s, so I'd bring in coaches from Britain, like Alan Kelly, a former goalkeeper who coached the Republic of Ireland, and those players used to live in my house, Jill was around them and they were like uncles,\" John Ellis, credited by his daughter for helping her learn how to \"connect with people,\" says. But soccer was still not a serious career option for the shy but determined kid who would become the first member of her family to attend university. READ: Megan Rapinoe, US Soccer's 'walking protest'Turning her back on a lucrative careerThe 1980s is nearing conclusion and a 23-year-old Jill Ellis has an undergraduate degree in English from the College of William & Mary, a master's degree in technical communications from North Carolina State and has chosen to earn a living in corporate America, but it is a grind. Not even the annual wage of $30,000 is succor for the daily monotony of working alone writing manuals for a telecommunications company in North Carolina. \n\n\n\n\n\"I thought she was going to go on and make a million,\" says John Ellis, \"but one day I'm talking to her and she says, 'you know dad, I just sit in a fricking cubicle all day and all you've got is the computer and I hate that.'\"A call from April Heinrichs, assistant coach at William and Mary where Ellis had earned third-team All-America status, was a turning point. Heinrichs, mentored by John Ellis at his academy, had become head coach at the University of Maryland and wanted Jill to be her assistant. But there was a snag: there was little money to be made. She turned to her father for guidance, as she has throughout her career, and the man who knew how short life could be because of his time in the Navy told his daughter to follower her dreams. Breaking out into a chuckle, John Ellis remembers: \"The soccer job was going to be $6,000 a year. My wife says, 'you've got to be kidding me,' you've got all this education and you want to go to a job for $8,000 a year?' \"But money doesn't make anyone happy. It's what you achieve and the people you meet.\" Ellis was named the 2015 FIFA World Coach of the Year.READ: Why Megan Rapinoe was benched against EnglandJill made a leap of faith thanks to her optimistic dad, but not even he could have imagined what she would go on to accomplish in the sport she fell in love with because of him. \"How can you ever see anything like that happening? You can't,\" he says. Heinrichs and Ellis coached at Maryland for three seasons before moving to the University of Virginia in 1996. A year later, the University of Illinois came calling, offering Ellis an opportunity to build a women's soccer program from scratch. Ellis had such an impact in Illinois -- the women's team reached the NCAA finals under her leadership -- UCLA offered her the job as head coach. She asked her father whether she was good enough, and once again her old man told her to live life on the edge.Joe Mallia was part of Ellis' coaching team at UCLA for two years and remembers a passionate and competitive woman who instilled in the students the strength to persevere through difficult times.

Sometimes you push a kid too hard, but plenty of times you get it right and you get a player to realize they can do more than they think they can do. \"Players really appreciated Jill's passion for the game, and passion to make them better and drive to make them better. Not necessarily everyone benefited from that, but there were players she coached at the collegiate level who went on to play at the World Cup.\"People can criticize her all they want but, at the end of the day, her teams have won.\"Over 11 seasons, she led the Bruins to eight NCAA Final Fours. By the 2011 World Cup, Ellis had coached the USWNT's Under-20s and Under-21s and assisted Pia Sundhage with the senior team for the 2008 Olympics. \"She just seems to have that in her blood,\" says John Ellis, explaining his daughter's remarkable ability to win. Educated, courageous, dividing opinionThere are those who argue that anyone would be able to guide a squad as gifted as the US to glory, but football history is filled with tales of underachieving talented teams. Within a year of becoming US head coach, America's English-born coach won the World Cup, but there were those who argued that the tactical switch of moving Carli Lloyd further up the pitch -- which would prove to be a defining one when she scored a hat-trick in the final -- came by accident because of suspensions to Megan Rapinoe and Lauren Holiday. The US soccer team celebrates its 2015 Women's World Cup victory with a ticker-tape parade in New York City. The following year was a disastrous one, as the US was knocked out in the Olympic quarterfinals on penalties after being shackled for 120 minutes by Sweden. According to Sports Illustrated, in 2017 a group of veteran players told then-federation president Sunil Gulati that they wanted a new coach unless their concerns with the direction of the team were addressed. But Ellis kept her job, was given time and consequently shifted the direction of the team and put long-term plans in place. Gulati, speaking to CNN Sport at an Equal Playing Field summit in France, said that he stuck with the head coach he had appointed because of her vision for the program.

She's pushed this team a lot and she has really high expectations for us and that's an exciting thing for her and for the team.\"Former international Abby Wambach has described this as the greatest USWNT team in history, while England boss Phil Neville said Ellis was the best coach at the World Cup. Not everyone sees it that way, but it is not a head coach's job to be universally liked. READ: Hope Solo -- Fighting for equality in a 'lonely world'\"She's not the leader I wish her to be,\" Hope Solo has said in her role as a pundit for the BBC in this tournament -- but the former US goalkeeper's criticisms of Ellis may not come as a surprise. Ellis was head coach when US Soccer terminated Solo's contract after she called Sweden's players \"cowards\" for their defensive tactics at the Olympics. \"She relies heavily on her assistant coaches,\" Solo has said, but so do many great managers. Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp has, in the past, said that accepting his personal limitations and surrounding himself with people with \"better knowledge in different departments\" has been key to his success. \"She gets good staff and good coaches and she gets staff that are knowledgeable and trustworthy and get the job done,\" says John Ellis, who believes that it is his daughter's inquisitiveness which drives her to further success. \"She has this instinct to be a motivator and inspire and that's why she's a winner.\"Ellis is one of nine female head coaches at France 2019.The USWNT squad is made up of highly-educated players. Of the 23-player squad, 21 have University degrees. Stanford graduate Tierna Davidson intended to become an astronaut, for example, before soccer took the 20-year-old onto a different trajectory.\"You can't bulls*it them,\" says John Ellis of the team. \"You've got to be accurate, you've got to be detailed because they have the ability to really understand and to challenge you. \"That puts a demand on Jillian because she and her staff have to have really good management skills. It's not easy. You've got to have personality and a humor that can deal with that.\"READ: Morgan's tea-drinking celebration brews up stormWith hope in your heart ...On Sunday, John Ellis will have planted American flags in flower pots dotted around the front lawn and passers-by will not fail to notice a 2015 World Cup banner hanging in the garden. His son, Paul, his grandchildren and Ellis' wife Betsy will be in Lyon, watching the match unfold at the city's Olympic Stadium. But John will be in Florida, wearing the lucky red shirt he has owned for over a decade, and watching the team his daughter has assembled on television with his wife Margaret. He knows it will be an exhausting experience because he has gone through it over a hundred times. \"When she wins a game, we think, 'Thank God for that, she'll keep her job.' America is so win, win orientated, and if you don't win they'll fire you and that's the way of life and she understands that,\" he says. The records broken along the way to the final would be no balm should the US lose to a Netherlands team competing in its first World Cup final. Anything other than victory would be a disaster, and the finger of blame would no doubt point in the direction of the head coach.  But football is a sport of extremes. While disaster is a possibility, so too is triumph and greatness. Her dad will have hope in his heart. \"Sometimes in life the stars just line up and when that happens it  happens,\" he says.Additional reporting by Jaide Garcia, CNN",

        "content": "Athens, Greece (CNN)With 75% of the vote counted, the center-right New Democracy party was on track to win the first national elections since Greece exited a bailout regime a year ago, signaling a clean break with years of firebrand populism and a return to mainstream politics. Initial results give New Democracy 39.6% of the vote, a strong mandate in a country governed for a decade by fragile coalitions. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras conceded defeat in a live TV broadcast, saying, \"The result has been determined ... but we will be back.\" Kyriakos Mitsotakis of New Democracy thanked the Greek people in a victory speech, saying, \"I know the difficulties lying ahead. ... I don't request a grace period because we don't have time for it.\" He added, \"Transparency and meritocracy will return to Greece and our country's voice will be heard in Europe.\"Mitsotakis will be sworn in as prime minister at 1 p.m. Monday (6 a.m. ET).Read MoreThe results suggest a complete reversal of fortunes in Greece, with a return to a party that has been a pillar of Greece's pre-bailout establishment. Initial projections for the ruling Syriza, Coalition of the Radical Left party, give it 31.6% of the vote. In May, Syriza  called a snap election after suffering a major blow in European Parliament elections.Mitsotakis is the scion of a Greek political dynasty whose father also served as leader under the same party. After studying at Harvard and Stanford, Mitsotakis worked in the banking sector before launching his political career, which saw him serve as minister of administrative reform between 2013 and 2015. Kyriakos Mitsotakis has pledged to rebrand Greece and change its image as Europe's problem child.A liberal reformist, Mitsotakis promises to rebrand the country and change its image as Europe's problem child in the wake of an eight-year depression that saw its economy slashed by 25% -- the worst contraction in a developed economy since the end of World War II. Mitsotakis says his priority is to reignite the economy by slashing taxes and regulations, while attracting investment. Greece's economic recovery is underway, although still weak and only forecast to grow by about 2% annually for the next three years. Mitsotakis' plan is to implement rapid changes, such as privatization, and transform Greece into a more business-friendly country. He will then go to the country's lenders in a bid to negotiate a new deal. \"I believe I can negotiate with the Europeans more fiscal space and the markets are showing that they are quite excited about us coming into power,\" he has said. Much of his success depends on clinching this deal.Old guard But for all his reform plans, Mitsotakis comes from the same political establishment that plunged Greece into the crisis in the first place, and which voters rejected in 2015. The vote for the markets-friendly old guard is equally a protest vote against a government that over-promised and failed to deliver; a message to populists worldwide that things can change and then change back.   In hindsight, Mitsotakis' strategy now feels like a winning recipe to Greeks. In January 2015, after two bailout programs and years of cuts and violent protests, Greece sailed into uncharted waters, rejecting old-style politics and a tough belt-tightening course under the then center-right New Democracy government. People voted for radical change promised by Syriza and its leader Tsipras, a charismatic speaker. The little-known party was elected on an anti-bailout platform promising to confront the country's lenders and put an end to austerity, but without much success. Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party was elected on an anti-bailout platform and a pledge to end austerity. Greece's populism odyssey resulted in bank runs and talk of Grexit, the country's exit from Europe's monetary union. Negotiations went to the brink. Banks shut for days and capital controls were imposed. At the last minute, facing chaos after a referendum that could have led Greece out of the EU, Syriza made a U-turn and signed a third bailout agreement followed by a snap election. A tamer second Syriza government was re-elected in September 2015, bringing in further austerity and tax hikes in order to meet fiscal targets.The events of summer 2015 signified for many Greeks the end to the illusion that it would be possible to resist change. Like Tsipras then, Greeks are now making a U-turn. \"Greece already has first-hand experience of economic populism and is now rejecting it, making a turn towards pragmatism,\" says George Pagoulatos, a professor at the Athens University of Economics. \"The vote in 2015 was one of hope, of desperation. Then the idealism collapsed. Now people are focusing on who they believe can deliver.\" Greek voters delivered a U-turn, rejecting economic populism and turning towards pragmatism. Greek tragedy  In other parts of Europe that watched Greece's downfall from what may have seemed like a safe distance, the legacy of the \"Greek tragedy\" continues to serve as a rallying cry for Brexiteers and a cautionary tale for right-wing populists. It has also exposed some of the deepest rifts in the European Union, with far-right nationalists making big gains in May's European Parliament elections.In Greece itself, support for extremism is declining. Greece was one of the first European countries to bring an extreme right, anti-migrant party into parliament in 2012. Support for the Golden Dawn party was fueled by desperate economic conditions and a refugee crisis that in 2015-2016 saw around 1 million refugees enter Europe through Greece's shores.  Election results show a big drop for Golden Dawn, and although nationalism has played a determining role in this election, it has carried a softer tone. Tsipras nevertheless ignited strong national sentiment within Greece and bore a heavy political cost for his hugely unpopular decision to ratify an accord to end a decades-long name dispute with its neighbor, the newly renamed Republic of North Macedonia.Nepotism, corruption scandals, and accusations of interference in the justice system have also taken their their toll. And Tsipras' anticipated moment of glory, when Greece exited its final bailout program in summer 2018, was drastically overshadowed by the deadly wildfires which left over a hundred people dead in Greater Athens. Instead of planned fireworks, Tsipras was left to deal with a huge public outcry over his handling of the tragedy.  New Democracy supporters waved Greek flags at a rally for Mitsotakis in Athens.Populism coming to an end?Greece was the first country in the last decade to bring grand scale populism to the mainstream European arena. Now it is the first to firmly reject it, in an election result that may signal the beginning of the end for extreme populism in Europe. \"Greece's first-hand experience of populism and the extreme right has enabled the country to exit from the biggest crisis in the eurozone with greater maturity,\" says Nick Malkoutzis, the political editor of MacroPolis. \"It feels like a cycle is ending and the country is returning to political normality.\" What Greeks crave more than anything after so many years of living in constant crisis is stability, he adds. In Greece's new age of pragmatism, Mitsotakis personifies the country's proactive, comprehensive reform plan that will lead the country out of the economic labyrinth. He will be judged, however, by a country no longer easily wooed by empty promises.",

        "content": "(CNN)The rescue vessel Alex docked Saturday in the Italian port of Lampedusa, carrying more than 40 shipwrecked migrants despite being banned by Matteo Salvini, the country's far-right Interior Minister.The Italilan-flagged boat, operated by Mediterranea, a pro-migrant NGO, was greeted at the port by a line of police officers deployed by Salvini.Later, Salvini said via Twitter the migrants were off the boat following the legal seizure of the vessel. He also announced an investigation against the crew members for allegedly aiding illegal immigration. Mediterranea said it was pleased the rescued migrants were finally receiving medical attention after several hours waiting in port, but called the investigation \"baseless.\"Earier in the day, Salvini asked the Alex to abandon Italy's waters and sail for Malta's capital, Valletta, where officials had agreed to let them through. Read MoreBut Mediterranea argued that sailing to Malta would mean \"putting the health and safety of people on board of Alex at serious risk.\"Italy's Public Television (RAI) reported that the Alex ran out of water and was overcrowded. The vessel has a legal capacity for 18 people, but was hosting 41 migrants and several crew members. We are waiting in int. waters off the island of Lampedusa. The Guardia di Finanza came by in person to deliver Salvini's decree:The port is closed.In Germany, however, more than 70 cities are willing to welcome the rescued persons.We urgently need a safe port. #AlanKurdi pic.twitter.com/VlSBYSCW6x\u2014 sea-eye (@seaeyeorg) July 6, 2019\n\nRAI also showed images of the migrants wearing orange life vests while trying to hide from the sun using rags and blankets.The German charity Sea-Eye's vessel, the Alan Kurdi, carrying dozens of rescued migrants, was near Lampedusa Saturday but changed course and headed to Malta. The ship was named in honor of the Syrian boy whose body washed ashore in Turkey during the 2015 migrant crisis. \"We cannot wait until the state of emergency prevails,\" Sea-Eye said on Twitter.  \"Now it has to be proven whether the European governments stand by Italy's attitude. Human lives are not a bargaining chip,\" the group said.The NGO reported the vessel picked up 65 people in an inflatable boat about 34 miles off the Libyan coast Friday morning.The Sea-Watch 3 migrant rescue ship landed on Lampedusa last week, defying an order from the Italian authorities.The Alex was the second migrant boat to arrive in Lampedusa in recent days. Last week, a migrant boat belonging to Sea-Eye entered Italian waters in defiance of the ban applied by Italian authorities. The ship's captain, Carola Rackete, was arrested.Rakete was facing a desperate situation after the ship had been stranded in the Mediterranean for two weeks.  An Italian judge ordered her release this week. Since her arrest, nearly $1 million has been raised for her legal defense.Salvini has accused NGOs of aiding smugglers and said, \"I do not authorize any disembarkation of those who do not care about Italian laws and instead help smugglers.\"Speaking on Facebook Live Saturday night, Salvini said, \"If someone was used to considering Italy as the arrival point for all and a dumping site for all the problems Europe pretend not to see, that's enough.\" Migrant ship captain arrested after entering Italian port, ending weeks-long standoffSalvini raised a formal complaint against the government of Germany after receiving a letter from his German counterpart. \"The German government asks me to open Italian ports to boats? Absolutely not. We ask [Angela] Merkel's government to take the German flag off boats that help traffickers, and to repatriate their citizens that ignore the Italian law,\" he said.Germany is ready to welcome some of the migrants who are on board the two German NGO ships, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. \"Both, in the case of Alan Kurdi and in the case of Alex, we are ready, as part of a European solidarity solution, to take some of the people rescued,\" he said.CNN's Kay Guerrero and Radina Gigova in Atlanta, Duarte Mendonca in London and Valentina DiDonato in Rome contributed to this report.",

It's the third time that Sweden has secured bronze after winning the third-place playoff games in 1991 and 2011.The bright start from Sweden, who had lost to the Netherlands in Wednesday's semifinal, capitalized on England's sluggish opening as Peter Gerhardsson's team raced into a two-goal lead in the first half.Sweden got off to a flying start thanks to an early goal from Kosovare Asllani's (right).Kosovare Asllani pounced on Alex Greenwood's miscued clearance to put Sweden ahead on 11 minutes. England goalkeeper Carly Telford got a hand to Asllani's shot but was unable to keep it out.The marauding Sofia Jakobsson was outstanding for Sweden and after hitting the post, the Montpellier forward did find the net, curling an exquisite shot past Telford.Read MoreSofia Jakobsson  celebrates with teammates after scoring Sweden's second goal.READ: The shy girl from England who became US Soccer's record-breaking head coachEngland had lost to the US Women's National Soccer Team in the other semifinal and on a baking day in Nice struggled to find their rhythm in the face of Sweden's blistering opening.But after Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 went off with an injury -- she was replaced by Lina Hurtig -- Fran Kirby rejuvenated England with a fine finish, streaking down the wing before cutting inside and leaving Sweden goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl stranded with a curling shot.Ellen White scored one goal, but had another ruled out following a VAR decision.READ: A meteoric rise?

With 15 minutes to go, Chelsea forward Karen Carney came on to make her 144th -- and final -- appearance for England who came desperately close to equalizing late in the game.A fierce volley from Lucy Bronze, who has been one of this World Cup's outstanding players, looked to be heading for the net, only for Nilla Fischer to superbly head clear.'Nonsense game'\"I think it was a carry on from the semifinal,\" England coach Phil Neville told BBC Sport, referring to England's slow start after the disappointment of losing the semifinal to the USWNT on Tuesday.\"It's a nonsense game,\" added Neville as he reflected on the tradition of teams playing the third-place playoff. \"We came to this tournament to win it, not to finish third or fourth.\"Sweden's players celebrate with their third place medals.White pointed to Sweden's two early goals as the key reason behind England's defeat.\"We showed our resilience and a lot of character after those goals and in the second half.

        "content": "(CNN)Nick Kyrgios continues to delight and frustrate in equal measure. Tennis' modern-day bad boy took on bitter rival Rafael Nadal in a heated second-round clash at Wimbledon Thursday and it was another classic in the Kyrgios canon.There were stare downs, underarm serves, code violations and a deliberate forehand blast straight at Nadal's chest. The match, won by an ecstatic Nadal, was gripping and gladiatorial in equal measure. Not just for the level of play, but for the history between the two and the antics of the Australian. Love him or hate him,  Kyrgios is the stuff of water-cooler conversations.So the simple question is -- is Nick Kyrgios good for tennis? Is he a larrikin (Aussie slang for boisterous troublemaker) or liability?Read MoreFirstly, let's not deny it. When Kyrgios plays, we all watch. \"He moves the needle,\" said Roger Rasheed, who has been around professional tennis for decades as a TV analyst, coach and past member of the ATP board. READ: Kyrgios on Nadal: 'I wanted to hit him square on the chest' READ: Coco Gauff's mom on starlet's meteoric riseREAD: Will Nadal surpass great rival Federer?READ: Roger Federer: The power and presence of the $120 million manNick Kyrgios (left) and Rafael Nadal shake hands after their heated clash at Wimbledon.'Box-office' In this age of Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, Kyrgios is right up the street of the younger population \u2014 which tennis is trying to attract, by the way. They don't necessarily want to dwell on forehands and backhands for hours, just like Kyrgios doesn't have any interest in hitting those forehands and backhands for hours.Respect.#Wimbledon | @RafaelNadal | @NickKyrgios pic.twitter.com/VPEXttuRfo\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2019 \nThe \"box office\" tag often associated with Kyrgios is wholly appropriate. Even when he is not trying to amuse, he still does \u2014 like when he sneezed three times in a row in an incident that had everyone in hysterics Thursday. Sitting on Centre Court, the yells of \"Come on, Nick\" or \"Come on, Kyrgios\" couldn't be overlooked, and they seemed to come largely from that younger audience.  If he didn't edge the match in terms of support, Kyrgios certainly wasn't far off against one of tennis' greatest ever players renowned and respected for his commitment and intensity. Kyrgios went too far when he called chair umpire Damien Dumusois a \"disgrace\" for not cracking down on the time Nadal took between points, but he was correct in his assessment that the Frenchman was too lenient. Nadal appeared to play on Kyrgios' lingering beef about his slow play, be it waiting a fraction longer to leave his chair when the chair umpire called \"time\" or making the 24-year-old wait while he received serve. Tennis authorities are trying to speed up the game, remember, which is why a shot clock is now regularly used at events around the world. READ: Coco Gauff, 15, extends remarkable run at WimbledonREAD: Bernard Tomic fined $56,100 for lack of effort in Wimbledon defeatNick Kyrgios fires a forehand against Rafael Nadal on Centre Court.  Underarm or underhand?Much was made about Kyrgios being spotted at a local watering hole Wednesday evening. He admitted as much in his post-match press conference, and according to reports, Kyrgios was in a perfectly presentable condition when he left the pub. But was this any way to prepare for a big match?Put other athletes in his position and they'd be affectionately termed \"one of the gang.\" And hey, even though he partied all week and went jet skiing before the final in Acapulco in March, Kyrgios still won the tournament. So what's the problem? When Centre Court met the underarm ace...We all knew this was coming, didn't we?#Wimbledon | @NickKyrgios pic.twitter.com/0gzovjH4bp\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2019 \nWhen it comes to his actual tennis game, Kyrgios' shot-making can be astoundingly good.  He has beaten Nadal three times, which tells you he's not all flash and no substance. The serve is one of the biggest ever in tennis and his backhand gives Nadal the same type of issues that Novak Djokovic's does. Djokovic has been Nadal's toughest ever opponent. As for those underarm serves, many players \u2014 including Roger Federer \u2014 say there's nothing wrong with it. It offers the element of surprise, like the drop shot. Indeed, think of an underarm serve as a drop shot to start the point. With Nadal often standing miles behind the baseline to help his return game, it's a viable option. Kyrgios won both points when he used the underarm serve on Thursday, with the first classified an ace because Nadal didn't touch the ball. Even Nadal smiled. Good tactics, then. In a few years the Big Three of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic will all be retired. The networks, especially, will be looking for someone to pick up the (ratings) slack and Kyrgios is one of the main candidates.  Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosKyrgios combines power with a deft touch.Then again...On the other hand, though entertaining, Kyrgios often goes too far. His list of indiscretions is lengthy and still open ended.  Hey, even the best of them have uttered bad language on court. Federer, in the 2009 US Open final against Juan Martin del Potro, for starters.But that was a rare blemish from the Swiss master aimed at the chair umpire, while Kyrgios is a serial offender who has targeted umpires and fans with greater vitriol. With microphones picking up anything and everything nowadays, that clearly isn't the example to present to kids who often view athletes as role models and place them on the highest of pedestals. Nor is throwing a chair on court, tanking (not trying) or sledging (trash talking), as Kyrgios did to Stan Wawrinka at the Canadian Masters in 2015. Tennis just doesn't do that. At a time when prize money is a hot topic on the men's player council, would sponsors \u2014 who drive prize money \u2014 want to get involved with Kyrgios doing all that? It's not the image they'd want to project. Nick Kyrgios had words with umpire Damien Dumusois in his match against Rafael Nadal.Nadal had it 100% correct when he said in February the Australian doesn't respect opponents, the crowd or himself. Examples constantly bear that out. His own time-wasting tactics Tuesday against compatriot Jordan Thompson \u2014 throwing himself to the ground at least twice after points ended \u2014 received little attention probably only because his sometime Davis Cup teammate didn't make a fuss. Putting in a 19-minute set as he did against Thompson in set four is something, sadly, we've come to expect from Kyrgios. If he was on a basketball court \u2014 basketball is the sport he loves, not tennis \u2014 he'd never go through the motions. Still, tennis is his job and he owes it to stakeholders to deliver a good shift. Goodness knows, he's earning enough to do so. Krygios pulled out the 'tweener' trick shot against Nadal.According to Britain's four-time Wimbledon semi finalist Tim Henman, Kyrgios has the skill, if not the temperament currently, to reach the very top.\"Rafa is just phenomenal,\" Henman explained to CNN. \"His intensity, the quality, the level he plays day in day out. \"And that's what I think a lot of people hope that Nick can apply himself to do because you can see the enormous tennis talent he has but physically and mentally, day in day out, he's too inconsistent.\"Trying \u2014 and erring \u2014 on shot a between the legs on a big point against Thompson when the simpler option was to hit a routine forehand rubs it in the face of the opponent, like a footballer attempting a nutmeg with his side leading by three or four goals. It's not necessarily a good look. Nick Krygios relaxes ahead of practice at Wimbledon.And what of Kyrgios' time at the pub Wednesday? Tennis has moved on from the 1970s and 80s, when such a soiree wouldn't have been as newsworthy.  Things are much more professional nowadays. Having alcohol \u2014 if he did have some, and we don't know \u2014 isn't something you would see Nadal, Federer or others consume the evening before a match. Not the hydration they'd be looking for. At least Kyrgios was honest enough to admit post-match that he was currently too unprofessional to contend for a grand slam. JUST WATCHEDWimbledon: The original grand slamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWimbledon: The original grand slam 01:40Those Kyrgios press conferences can be prickly, flippant, but often amusing affairs, too -- cringe-making for the traditionalists, box-office for others. When it was put to him Nadal didn't look too pleased with his shot into the Spaniard's chest, he simply replied: \"And?\" It seems like in every Kyrgios match, he crunches at least a couple of forehands and doesn't care where they land. One of these days, one of his misdirected rockets could hit an umpire, lines person or fan. One forehand almost hit a lines person Thursday, in fact.Then the tale of Kyrgios would ascend to another, sad tier.  Five years after he announced himself to the tennis world by beating Nadal at Wimbledon, there's still no real sign that Kyrgios is intent on being the professional that would see him turn the table and win multiple grand slams. But is he good for tennis? Let the debate continue.",

It was an upbringing which gave former Netherlands coach Pauw, who in 2009 guided her country to its first major tournament, the vision to create the blueprint which serves as the foundation for the current success of the Dutch women's national team, the reigning champions of Europe and, possibly by Sunday, the world.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe speed with which the Netherlands has caught up with the established powers of the women's game has been impressive. Competing in a World Cup for only the second time, the Orange Lionesses have reached their first final and will attempt to topple the United States, the defending champion, the world's top-ranked team and the dominant force in the game. But the Netherlands' rise should not be regarded as a story of sudden success because it has been decades in the making, the trigger being Pauw, who successfully fought for the country's most talented girls and boys to be allowed to play with and against each other until the age of 19. \"Step-by-step we developed a structure in which girls and women could find their own place so it's not true that this success is coming out of the clouds,\" Pauw, named Knight of the Royal Dutch Football Association in 2017, tells CNN Sport.\n\n\n\n\nRead MoreBacked by research from the University of Utrecht, which she herself helped kick start, Pauw eventually persuaded the powers that be in 1996 to create mixed youth leagues. \"I felt that equality between girls and boys, equality of chances and opportunity to develop, is a human right and I felt that because I'm a triplet with two brothers,\" says the 56-year-old, the first Dutch female footballer to play abroad and the first woman to earn a professional coaching diploma. \"The demands on me were the same as on my brothers. I was challenged the same way as my brothers, and that's what (women's football in the Netherlands) was missing, and what girls in general are missing in the new world.\"Giving girls a regional pathway drove up standards and a pyramid structure ensured that future prospects were surrounded by excellence. Over a decade later, with Pauw again the driving force, the Women's Eredivisie was established as the country's top professional league, propelling the women's game in the country which produced the likes of Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit, further forward. \"That was a fluid pathway with no place for luck to be involved, no place for luck that somebody would see you,\" Pauw explains.\"Every single girl in the Netherlands could play close to home and every girl who wanted to play football got this opportunity and that's the base for current performances.\" Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosVera Pauw and George Foreman  at the Houston Sports Awards in 2018Pauw led the Netherlands to the semifinals of the 2009 European Championship on its tournament debut with the youngest team in the competition. So surprising was the team's journey to the last four that Dutch journalists reportedly made last ditch trips to Finland to cover them.Euro 2009 also gave the national team players their first experience of acclaim in their homeland with fans turning up at the airport to welcome them on their return. An appearance on one of the country's most popular TV programs followed. But the Netherlands hasn't always had deep affection for its female players. Like in most traditional powerhouses of the men's game, women have had to deal with deep-seated prejudices and in the Netherlands female football was repeatedly banned in the last century. READ: The shy English girl who became the USWNT's record-breaking coachMuch has changed. Women's football is the fastest-growing sport in the Netherlands. The Dutch federation, KNVB, and the country's top football clubs are putting resources into it. To Pauw's annoyance, the federation has altered the model she put in place. She argues that encouraging established men's teams to take over youth development will lower the quality of players.\"Things need to be restored to have the Netherlands still be successful in 2025,\" she says. But most are focusing on the present because a World Cup final looms. Four years ago, the Netherlands competed in its first World Cup, making it to the last 16. In 2017, it won the European Championship on home soil and captured hearts.Largely as a result of Euro 2017, thousands of Netherlands fans have followed the team around France, their colorful and noisy marches before games becoming a highlight of the tournament. The Orange Lionesses have been well supported back home, too. READ: The match which changed women's footballNetherlands fans have travelled to France in the thousands. The semifinal against Sweden was watched by five million viewers on Dutch TV channel NPO 3, while over 80% of the people watching TV in the Netherlands at the time were tuned into the country's quarterfinal against Italy. \"The whole country will be watching,\" former Netherlands player Lucienne Reichardt tells CNN Sport of the final. \"It's still not like with the men, where all the streets are orange and all restaurants are filled with people watching the game. The game needs to grow and the US is already much further ahead than the Netherlands. We are not there yet.\"But 10-15 years ago parents weren't happy for girls to play football, and now they see big clubs starting with women's football and they see it's more normal and the prizes that the national team is getting also promotes other girls.\"READ: The US' 'walking protest' who irked Donald TrumpA street is decorated with banners of orange flags in Deventer, Netherlands. Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman, the first woman to play more than 100 times for the Oranje, told reporters this week that the formation of the professional league in 2007 has been key to the country's development. Though the league briefly gave way to a combined Belgian-Dutch competition in 2012, only to become an all-Dutch division again three years later, it helped create a more professional environment.\"The potential has been in the Netherlands for a longer period of time. But the facilities weren't there,\" said Wiegman, playing her part in making Sunday's duel in Lyon the first World Cup final since 2003 to be contested by two female coaches. \"Since 2007 players got better facilities and could train more. The players developed so much. And then when you are at big tournaments like European Championships and World Cups, they develop even more.\"READ: USWNT advances to World Cup finalMartens was named FIFA Women's Player of the Year in 2017.Five members of the squad play in the country's top division, but many of the best players have followed the well-trodden path from the Women's Eredivisie to Europe's top leagues. Goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal, midfielders Danielle van de Donk and Jill Roord, and Vivianne Miedema, widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world, all play for Arsenal in the Women's Super League in England. Stefanie van der Gragt and Lieke Martens, who were named FIFA's Women's Player of the Year in 2017, are with Barcelona.

But recent years haven't been an unbroken upward trajectory for the Orange Lionesses. Had FIFA, the sport's governing body, not expanded the number of participants in this year's tournament, the US would be preparing to face another opponent Sunday because the European champion struggled to qualify, doing so via the play-offs. And, for World Cup pedigree, there is no comparison between the two finalists. The US is aiming for a fourth title and is competing in a third successive final with a squad filled with players who already experienced glory in 2015. \"For the first time this tournament, we'll go into a game as the underdog,\" Van de Donk has admitted. The biggest question over the team is whether the defense, regarded as its weakness, will be able to hold firm against the likes of Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, should she recover from a hamstring strain, and Tobin Heath. The US has scored within the first 12 minutes of every match in this tournament, so the Netherlands will likely have to withstand early waves of attack. But the woman whose passion helped create these heady Dutch days believes her compatriots can knock the US of its perch.\"I think the Netherlands will win. I'm the only one in the world probably,\" she says, laughing. \"It's a team for the last minutes. If they manage to stay in the game, towards the end when the pressure is off you can see that the Netherlands will dominate possession and positional play the best.\"Additional reporting by Jaide Garcia, CNN",

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex have only been parents for a matter of months but they're already being accused of being over-protective.Criticism over the pair's decision to keep baby Archie out of the spotlight has been mounting for months. And recent revelations -- that British taxpayers footed a \u00a32.4 million (about $3 million) bill for home renovation, and plans to keep his christening private -- have done little to silence critics.It's worth noting that royal baptisms have traditionally been private affairs. However in recent years cameras have been allowed to capture the arrivals of the family and their guests. That was certainly the case for all three Cambridge children -- George, Charlotte and Louis -- although they are higher in the line of succession.This Saturday, Harry and Meghan have arranged a completely private ceremony for Archie led by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a chapel inside Windsor Castle. The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall along with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the christening ceremony, Buckingham Palace announced. The palace won't officially confirm who else is attending, though a royal source told CNN that fewer than 25 family and friends were invited.

The official photographs will be taken in the Green Drawing Room, Buckingham Palace said. Archie will be wearing a handmade replica of the royal christening robe, the palace added. The original gown was made in 1841 and used for all royal christenings, including that of the Queen herself, until 2008 when the replica was used for the first time for the christening of the youngest of the Queen's eight grandchildren, James, Viscount Severn, and subsequently for all her great-grandchildren.The Queen commissioned her dressmaker, Angela Kelly, to make the handmade replica of the gown in order to preserve the original. It is made of Honiton lace and lined with white satin.   A silver baptismal font commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert will also be used for the christening. The Lily Font, as it is known, was commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1840 and has been used in every royal christening since then.   Members of the St. George's Chapel Choir will be singing at the ceremony, Buckingham Palace said.Meghan and Harry are expected to release an official photograph from baby Archie's christening ceremony, taken by their personal photographer, Chris Allerton. Meghan and Harry's decision to keep baby Archie's christening private has nevertheless drawn criticism from the public and British media. \"Meghan can't demand privacy for baby Archie while asking the public to fund her family's lifestyle,\" complained the Daily Telegraph. The Sunday Times quoted royal biographer Penny Junor as saying: \"They can't have it both ways. Either they are totally private, pay for their own house and disappear out of view, or play the game the way it is played.\"Even politicians have weighed into the row. Labour Member of Parliament Luke Pollard told CNN the royal couple's recent behavior raises questions.\"When you're still taking millions of pounds worth of public money -- money that could be spent in schools and hospitals -- to upgrade and refurbish what is, you know, luxury palaces, you've got to ask yourself: what are the public getting in return?\"Meghan and Harry to visit South Africa, Angola and MalawiPollard said he saw no problem with critics questioning how public money was being spent, and expressed concern that Harry and Meghan were \"trying to have their cake and eat it.\"He explained: \"They're trying to get the public money for their lifestyle but not do the public duties that go along with it and that's a question that is rightly being asked and debated here.\"I don't think the overall family will be overthrown here. I think this is a chance to look at: Is the behavior of the royal family the right way forward? And at a time when there's not a lot of money for our public services, is every penny they're spending being spent well?\" Pollard said.JUST WATCHEDMeghan and Harry spent $3M of taxpayers' money on homeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeghan and Harry spent $3M of taxpayers' money on home 01:23This type of critique infuriates the #SussexSquad -- a vociferous army of online supporters, particularly of Meghan. On stories like the christening, those devoted to the duchess enlist the help of an unlikely defender: a US law professor.Goldburn P. Maynard Jr at the University of Louisville describes himself as an \"ally\" of the squad who steps in online to \"amplify\" the voices of #SussexSquad and call out cases of what he calls \"misogynoir.\"  \"I don't see any kind of contradiction between there being taxpayer funding or public funding and the royals asking for some privacy,\" he told CNN. \"Here, in the United States, we very much have a lot of public servants but we very well know their children are off limits and are able to have a private life and we are OK with that.\"Meghan at Trooping the Colour in first royal engagement since giving birthFor Maynard, it's interesting how the christening plays into a wider narrative about the duchess.\"The default when it comes to Meghan -- because she is a foreigner and she's not royal, from this society, etc. -- is that when she does something, she is doing something that's wrong. Women of color are actually really used to that narrative,\" he explained. \"What a lot of us are seeing is that she is being held to a higher standard despite the fact that, in many ways, she's hit the ground running.\"He continued: \"She put out the book and she's made all of this money for charity and she's brought all of this attention. And yet there are all of these critiques on these niggling things that shouldn't matter very much.\"Maynard views criticism of Meghan through the prism of criticism of women of color generally.\"So, women of color are uncouth, women of color are undeserving, women of color are angry, etc. And so, what all this coverage has done is to reinforce all those kinds of narratives and biases when it comes to who is today the most prominent woman in the world. So, it is reinforcing those narratives on a worldwide scale, so that's why I think it's really harmful.\"Related: Racist online abuse of Meghan has put royal staff on high alertMeghan and Harry's baby Archie won't cure racism in UK -- but marks progressBut Pollard argues that publicly funded royal should be put under appropriate scrutiny: \"It's so important that actually in defending Meghan and Harry's decisions, we need to be clear that when they get it wrong we can offer a criticism which is fair and justified without any loading of hate that some other folks are trying to use.\"For many royal fans, Archie's christening is simply a chance to see how he's grown. With just the one photocall shortly after his birth and a couple of carefully snapped Instagram posts, the world still has yet to see his little face properly.For his parents, it's simple too. They've clearly made the decision to bring him up as a private citizen, which also explains why they aren't using a title for him and why they feel they have a right to refuse media access to an event that is primarily about him.",

Already tennis' newest favorite, Gauff earned cries of \"we love you\" on her debut on the most famous court in the world as she engineered an electrifying rally to keep her historic Wimbledon run going. If you didn't know better, you'd think Gauff played for Britain instead of the US.  \"The support has been outstanding,\" her affable father Corey told a small group of reporters. \"Every match they're calling her name. I sit there and go, like, 'What in the world is going on?'\"A lot went on Friday.

Corey and wife Candi are near celebrities now, with fans taking selfies with the duo. But spare a thought for the Slovenian, whose lone support from her box came from coach and husband Zeljko Krajan. There was a cast of 17, meanwhile, next door in Gauff's box. \"I'm sure I will be thinking about the match in the next days, but hopefully as little as possible,\" Hercog told reporters.Before play even started, Gauff was the fourth favorite according to some British oddsmakers despite only ever winning one top-level encounter prior to Wimbledon. READ: Coco Gauff, 15 declares -- I want to be the greatestREAD: Is Nick Kygrios good for tennis?Cori Gauff staged an incredible comeback to beat Polona Hercog.Life changingAfter beating Venus Williams in the first round \u2014 bridging a 25-year age gap \u2014 to become the youngest player to win a match here since Jennifer Capriati in 1991, sweeping past 2017 semifinalist Magdalena Rybarikova and then coming back against Hercog, she might be pushed up even further. Her life won't ever be the same. And all this after being a wildcard \u2014 in qualifying.  \"It's just crazy,\" Gauff, the youngest ever qualifier to land in Wimbledon's main draw, told reporters. \"I remember before I played Venus, when you walk to leave the practice courts, there are people waiting. One little kid asked me for a picture. \"Then after the next day, after I played Venus, everybody was screaming my name. It was pretty surreal how life changes in a matter of seconds.\" Gauff had celebrities direct messaging her after her second-round tussle and said Friday that Beyonce's mom Tina, posted her on Instagram. \"I was, like, screaming,\" she said. Her winning displays, combined with the massive support she is receiving and her pedigree as a junior, presumably earned Gauff a place on Center Court instead of former world No. 1s Caroline Wozniacki \u2014 who lost earlier \u2014 and Karolina Pliskova. Such is her pull already. On Thursday, host broadcaster the BBC noted that its highest peak Wimbledon audience was Gauff's victory over Rybarikova on Court 1. She earned a clash with another former No. 1 Monday in Simona Halep, and that will likely be on one of the two biggest courts.

Wimbledon is the lone major where there is no play on the middle Sunday. Capriati made the semifinals here as a 15-year-old 28 years ago and if Gauff defeats Halep, it would be a brave individual to bet against her matching that achievement. The 60th-ranked Hercog stood on the cusp of history herself, having never made a grand slam fourth round. As gutsy as Gauff was in rallying from a set and 5-2 deficit, Hercog will lament not putting her younger opponent away. The American saved the first match point with a backhand slice that caught the line and kick start her comeback. The complexion changed.  If there was little Hercog could do then, it was quite the opposite on the second match point at 40-30 in the ensuing game.

The tension was there for all to see as Hercog double faulted. Prior to getting broken at 5-3, she hadn't even faced a break point. What if for Hercog\"Especially the first two sets I don't think she had any chances,\" said Hercog. \"If I made that serve or something, it would just be 6-3 6-3.\"After her wicked slice neutralized the Gauff backhand that had done so much damage in the first two rounds and ripping forehands, her errors increased. And Gauff adjusted. Instead of trying to attack those slices, she countered with her own. \"I thought that Coco tactically changed her game, which is very encouraging to me,\" multiple grand slam winner Mats Wilander told CNN. \"She didn't hit her way through Hercog so to speak, she was slicing the ball back and giving Hercog no pace suddenly. That's for me the biggest sign of something special in Coco. \"I don't buy the, 'Oh she deals with pressure.' There's no pressure, she's 15, she's completely unafraid. She's a freak athlete but the tactical part to me is pretty incredible. \"That I can't relate to at all. There's no way a 15-year-old should be able to understand, 'I need to do this now.'\" To relieve the tension in the tiebreak, a bird landed on Gauff's side at 2-2 before being chased away by a ball kid. It was soon flying high, just like Gauff is now. Gauff faced two match points in the second set. READ: Will Nadal surpass great rival Federer?Marathon match Leading 5-3, two forehand misses arose from Hercog as the Slovenian's difficulty in closing out proceedings resurfaced.  Gauff took her third set point following a marathon rally that featured the duo trading backhand slices prior to the American ripping a backhand cross court to open the court. A swinging volley forced a third set. Hercog called for the trainer for a buttocks injury and Gauff left for a bathroom break. The pause didn't alter the momentum as Gauff led 4-1 in the third, only for Hercog to get to 4-4 despite leg cramps surfacing. But showing incredible poise, Gauff responded with big serves to get to 5-4. \"I could see in her eyes she was feeling the pressure, but she came out and served amazing at 4-4,\" said Corey. Her opponent then paid for not capitalizing on a game point at 5-6, with Gauff leaping and dropping her racket after Hercog's lob went long 13 minutes shy of the three-hour mark. \"I just closed my eyes,\" said Corey. \"I wished ball to go out.\"It did but his popular daughter still remains at Wimbledon.",

The snaps were taken by fashion photographer Chris Allerton in the Green Drawing Room at Windsor, the same room where Harry and Meghan took some of their wedding pictures last year.One of the photos shows Archie with his parents, his grandfather the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, and two sisters of Princess Diana, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes.A second, black and white photo, pictured just Archie, Meghan and Harry in the Rose Garden at the castle.Read MoreHarry and Meghan were criticized by some for keeping Archie out of the spotlight, especially after it emerged recently that British taxpayers footed a \u00a32.4 million (about $3 million) bill for their home renovation.         View this post on Instagram           This morning, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was christened in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle at an intimate service officiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are so happy to share the joy of this day with members of the public who have been incredibly supportive since the birth of their son. They thank you for your kindness in welcoming their first born and celebrating this special moment. Their Royal Highnesses feel fortunate to have enjoyed this day with family and the godparents of Archie. Their son, Archie, was baptised wearing the handmade replica of the royal christening gown which has been worn by royal infants for the last 11 years. The original\u00a0Royal Christening Robe,\u00a0made of fine Honiton lace lined with white satin, was\u00a0commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1841 and first worn by her eldest daughter. It was subsequently worn for generations of Royal christenings, including The Queen, her children and her grandchildren until 2004, when The Queen commissioned this handmade replica, in order for the fragile historic outfit to be preserved, and for the tradition to continue.

        "content": "London (CNN)The legendary horse-racing broadcaster John McCririck, who was famed for his outlandish dress sense, has died at the age of 79, his family has announced.  McCririck made his name as the face of British horse racing coverage, reporting from the betting ring for nearly three decades, first for ITV and then for Channel 4. He was perhaps best known for his distinctive style, regularly sporting a large deerstalker hat, sideburns and colorful suits, often with a fat cigar in hand. McCririck's family confirmed in a statement that the veteran broadcaster died in a London hospital Friday. McCririck was renowned for his distinctive style, which regularly included a deerstalker hat, colorful suits and sideburns.\"His flamboyant broadcasting style from the heart of the betting ring proved extremely popular with racing fans and beyond,\" McCririck's family said. \"Despite suffering ill health in recent months, John continued to make several TV and radio appearances.Read More\"John's interest in horse racing and betting began at Harrow where he was the school bookie. On leaving he worked for an illegal street bookmaker then legally on-course where he learned the art of tic-tac, clerking bets and making a book,\" they added. Jockeys and racing experts have paid tribute to McCririck. Tony McCoy, a 20-time Champion Jockey, described him as \"one of the most recognizable faces from the world of horse racing.\" He added that McCririck was \"great at promoting our sport.\"McCririck said he was depressed after he was sacked by Channel 4 in 2012.Ascot Racecourse said it was \"deeply saddened\" at the news. \"He was an unmistakable presence in racing, and one of the most impactful broadcasters of his generation,\" the racecourse wrote on Twitter.  Broadcaster Piers Morgan described McCririck as a \"great British character.\" \"He spoke his mind, loved to ruffle feathers, was as funny as he was outrageous, and had such a deep knowledge of and tremendous passion for horse-racing,\" Morgan wrote on Twitter. McCririck shocked the public in recent years with dramatic weight loss, which he said was the result of a severe bout of flu and the complications from a chest infection. He also caused concern by stating that he had \"no purpose in life\" after his regular broadcasting work for Channel 4 came to an abrupt end in 2012.  McCririck blamed his sacking on ageism and took Channel 4 to an employment tribunal, but his case was rejected.\"Ever since I was sacked in 2012 by Channel 4 racing, you feel depressed, you lose a purpose in life. I wake up now in the morning, and what do I have to do?\" he told ITV in 2018. McCririck blamed his sacking on ageism and took Channel 4 to an employment tribunal, but his case was rejected. The tribunal ruled that McCririck's \"pantomime persona\" and \"self-described bigoted and male chauvinist viewers\" were \"unpalatable to a wider potential audience.\" McCririck is survived by his wife, Jenny, whom he married in 1971 and often referred to by the nickname of \"The Booby.\"",

But at the moment, CNN is unable to verify either her whereabouts or those reports.The princess is a well-known international figure, being close friends with the heir to the British throne, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.The case is being heard in London, at the Family Division of the High Court, and the next hearings will be on July 30 and July 31.When contacted by CNN, the Royal Courts of Justice confirmed the court dates, but not the identity of the two parties.Read More\"The case was last heard on the 22 May 2019 before Mr Justice Moor and the case is next listed before the President on the 30th July 2019,\" reads the statement from the court.CNN has separately confirmed both the dates and the parties involved in the legal case.Sheikh Al Maktoum will be represented by Lady Helen Ward of Stewarts, a high-profile law firm in London, CNN has also learned.

        "content": "(CNN)In a city known for its vibrant theater life, the best place in London Thursday had to be Center Court at Wimbledon for Rafael Nadal's emotional 6-3 3-6 7-6 (5) 7-6 (3) victory against Nick Kyrgios in a second-round blockbuster that overflowed with activity. It was one night only with an encore sadly having to wait until the next time the bitter rivals happen to be paired together at a tournament. Respect.#Wimbledon | @RafaelNadal | @NickKyrgios pic.twitter.com/VPEXttuRfo\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2019 \n\"I thought it was great entertainment,\" Roger Rasheed, the former coach of Lleyton Hewitt and Gael Monfils, told CNN. \"It had a bit of everything.\"\"It was interesting in more ways than one,\" former Wimbledon favorite Tim Henman added to CNN. Often cast as the villain, Kyrgios certainly played the part in the three-hour thriller when he labeled chair umpire Damien Dumusois a \"disgrace\" for the way he officiated Nadal's unhurried play, earned an unsportsmanlike conduct warning for his constant chatter with the Frenchman and lashed a forehand at Nadal that left the world No. 2 seething.Read More\"Yeah I was going for him,\" Kyrgios admitted in a mostly light-hearted session with reporters where you wouldn't have guessed he lost a heartbreaker on the most famous tennis court in the world. \"I wanted to hit him square in his chest.\" Nadal regularly whipped up the crowd, desperately urging them to get behind him, particularly in the third set. Oh, and there was great tennis, too. Fine numbersThe duo combined for 102 winners and 43 unforced errors and neither faced a break chance in the last two sets. Kyrgios slammed 29 aces yet paid the price for a lethargic start.  \"Nick offers such a strong product that Rafa is on high alert and you can see that and I thought that brought out a lot of good qualities in Rafa,\" said Rasheed, an analyst with Fox Sports Australia. \"I enjoyed the match. Everyone who watched it should have gotten a lot out of it.\"Nadal could very well return to the grandest stage in the sport Saturday against the charismatic Jo-Wilfried Tsonga as he continues his quest for a first Wimbledon crown in nine years. READ: Meghan watches Serena as defending champ crashes outREAD: Kyrgios on Nadal -- 'We wouldn't go to the pub for a drink'Nick Kyrgios (left) and Rafael Nadal played out a thriller.Confidence boostDowning the dangerous Kyrgios figures to be a massive boost for his confidence going forward this fortnight five years after he was upended by the then teenager at the same venue. \"Is true that it was a tough draw, a tough opponent for a second round, maybe the one that you want to face less in a second round like this, especially here,\" Nadal told reporters. \"It's an important victory for me.\" For Kyrgios, don't be surprised to find him at the pub about a 15-minute walk away from center court he is helping to make famous -- the Dog & Fox -- having spent some of his evening there Wednesday ahead of the grudge match.No, it's not your typical match preparation but Kyrgios is not your typical player, either.

When Centre Court met the underarm ace...We all knew this was coming, didn't we?#Wimbledon | @NickKyrgios pic.twitter.com/0gzovjH4bp\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2019 \nHis lack of motivation for playing professional tennis has often been highlighted -- he loves basketball -- and Kyrgios said he can't contend for a major now because he is too unprofessional.  But he desperately wanted to beat the 18-time grand slam winner who he called \"super salty\" in May. Those remarks came after Nadal said the Australian didn't respect his opponents, the crowd -- and himself -- in the wake of blowing three match points in their heated Acapulco clash in February. Kyrgios authored an underarm serve in Acapulco, and after hitting an underarm ace Thursday he then crushed a 143-mile per hour second serve to demonstrate his unpredictable genius. READ: Kyrgios in fan altercation at Miami OpenNadal smileEven the ever intense Nadal smiled following the slower serve.

There were even more laughs when Kyrgios sneezed three times in succession but they vanished when the world No. 43 ripped a laser forehand pass at Nadal at 4-4 in the third. The volley was too hot to handle for Nadal, who glared at Kyrgios as he returned to his baseline. Kyrgios didn't see it as his back was toward his foe and never did apologize. \"Why would I apologize? The dude has got how many slams, how much money in the bank account? I think he can handle a ball to the chest,\" he said.    Kyrgios' antics left one fan who has been coming to Wimbledon since the 1950s to tell CNN: \"He annoys me.\"Nadal would share her opinion.  Yet he claimed he wasn't offended by the bulls-eye shot, more concerned about someone else on court being struck. \"When he hit the ball like this, it's dangerous,\" said Nadal. \"It's not dangerous for me, it's dangerous for a line referee, dangerous for a crowd. When you hit the ball like this, you don't know where the ball goes.\"Sure enough, another forehand from Kyrgios after a point ended almost struck a linesperson. But the cries of \"come on, Nick\" or \"come on Kyrgios\" certainly matched -- or maybe surpassed -- the encouragement for his more accomplished opponent. One could even say the loudest roar came when Kyrgios ripped a forehand winner to break for 2-0 in the second. An eruption of sound filled the air, with Kyrgios' box quickly out of their seats in joy.  JUST WATCHEDWill Nadal pass Federer for grand slam wins?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWill Nadal pass Federer for grand slam wins? 03:52 Nadal affectedNadal got back on serve but claimed he was put off by Kyrgios' conversation with Dumusois readying to serve at 3-4 that earned the Canberra native the warning. Throughout the four sets, Nadal waited in his chair when \"time\" was called by Dumusois and took his time to serve and receive, which all irked Kyrgios. \"The umpire today was horrendous,\" said Kyrgios. Nadal was duly broken to trail 5-3 and the set was done. As can be the case on grass, small pockets of points can decide matters. It happened in both the tiebreaks. Rafael Nadal had reason to smile after beating Nick Kyrgios at Wimbledon. Nadal opened up mini-break advantages of 3-1 and 3-0, respectively. The quality of the first tiebreak exceeded that of the cagey second, and Nadal leaped in joy when sealing the third with a big forehand.  \"In the two tiebreaks, I thought Rafa was exceptional,\" said Rasheed. \"He elevated his game, found his serve. Found a lot of returns and was fierce with his ball striking.\"Kyrgios conversely immediately handed over the initiative in the fourth-set tiebreak by erring on a put away at the net. A brief handshake followed and Nadal's finger wag -- a gesture that seemed to indicate \"Not this time\" -- evoked memories of Roger Federer doing the same thing after ending Novak Djokovic's roughly five-month winning streak in 2011 at the French Open. Kyrgios quickly put on his basketball shoes and threw his towels into the stands. They signed autographs side by side, but don't expect them to be in close proximity outside the court anytime soon.",

Gibraltar port and law enforcement agencies, aided by the British marines, detained the Grace 1 super tanker early Thursday morning, the territory's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, said in a statement. Grace 1 was boarded by Royal British Marines and Gibraltarian authorities.Spain's acting foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said the United States had asked the UK to intercept the ship. \"We have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria,\" Picardo said. \"That refinery is the property of an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria.\"The EU imposed a number of financial, trade and transport sanctions against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011 in response to \"the continuing brutal campaign\" against its own people.The super tanker is currently anchored off the coast of Gibraltar.Read MoreIran demands the tanker's releaseA spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Abbas Mousavi, tweeted that the British ambassador to Tehran had been summoned over the \"illegal\" seizure of the oil tanker. A senior Iranian Foreign Ministry official condemned the operation by the Royal Marines, calling it \"piracy,\" according to a report from the semi-official Tasnim news agency on Friday.The official said the UK does not have the right to implement its or the EU's unilateral sanctions against other nations \"in an extraterritorial manner\" and called for the vessel to be released immediately after it had been seized \"at the behest of the US.\"The vessel was suspected of carrying oil to Syria, breaching European Union sanctions.Mousavi said Thursday that the \"destructive\" seizure of the oil tanker by the UK could increase tensions in the Persian Gulf, the state-run Press TV reported, citing a statement from Mousavi. Iranian state news agency IRNA said Royal Marines boarded the 300,000-ton carrying capacity ship early Thursday morning.  The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Iran. Earlier this week, Iran announced it would stop complying with several parts of the 2015 nuclear deal that the Trump administration withdrew from last year. The Syrian government has not yet responded to the incident.Grace 1 is anchored off the coast of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on the edge of southern Spain.The UK's Ministry of Defense (MOD) welcomed what it called \"firm action by the Gibraltarian authorities, acting to enforce the EU Syria sanctions regime.\"On Thursday Picardo thanked \"the brave men and women of the Royal Marines, the Royal Gibraltar Police, Her Majesty's Customs Gibraltar and the Gibraltar Port Authority for detaining the vessel and its cargo.\"\"Be assured that Gibraltar remains safe, secure and committed to the international, rules-based, legal order,\" he added.John Bolton, national security adviser to US President Donald Trump, also chimed in with a tweet. \"America & our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran & Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade,\" he wrote.Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace I laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions. America & our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran & Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade.\u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) July 4, 2019\n\nTanker 'loaded Iranian oil months ago'In mid-April, the Grace 1 loaded up with Iranian oil and turned off its tracking signals to avoid detection before sailing around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa to the Strait of Gibraltar, according to an article published in maritime publication Lloyds List earlier this week.\"Any tanker with Iranian crude follows a similar pattern of behavior: they do that by turning off their AIS transponder, turning it on and off in order to circumvent being tracked,\" Michelle Wiese Bockmann, the author of the article, told CNN on Thursday. \"This vessel has spent most of its time in the Middle East Gulf, including protracted periods in Iranian waters at specific special mooring buoys,\" Bockmann said. \"They have deliberately taken measures to circumvent identifying the ship's destination, location and cargo origin.\"The Grace 1 is anchored near a Royal Marine patrol vessel in the British territory of Gibraltar.Samir Madani, co-founder of Tanker Trackers -- which monitors vessels through satellite and maritime data -- told CNN that the Grace 1's journey around Africa took 2.5 months, a month longer than usual.\"The vessel sailed at a fairly slow speed as it was in no rush,\" Madani said, adding that Tanker Trackers does not believe the vessel was carrying crude oil, but instead fuel oil from Iran's Abadan Refinery.\"We can also see that she is heavily laden in the water. Her hull is 22.5 meters deep, meaning that she is carrying 2 million barrels of a very heavy liquid. Heavier than crude oil,\" he said. \"Not only that, but her previous assignments were transfers of fuel oil in Umm Qasr (Iraq) and Khor Fakkan (UAE).\"Based on all the imagery we spent weeks reviewing, we could not see her loading crude oil. She has a history of handling STS transfers of FUEL OIL. We believe she was due to do the same in Syria's waters. Fuel oil powers vessel engines. It's heavier than crude oil. She is heavy.\u2014 TankerTrackers.com, Inc.\u2693\ufe0f\ud83d\udee2 (@TankerTrackers) July 4, 2019\n\nMadani said he did not believe Syria's Baniyas Refinery was the ship's destination as the waters would be too shallow for it to enter. \"Instead, we believe that the fuel oil was intended for ship-to-ship transfers to other vessels within Syria's maritime borders,\" Madani said. According to several shipping trackers online, the Grace 1 was built in 1997 and is sailing under the flag of Panama.CNN's Ruchi Patel, Sarah Dean, Laura Perez Maestro and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed reporting.",

Four years later, Bjorn Borg won the first of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. He  also clinched six straight French Open championships on clay, before his shock retirement in 1981, at the age of 26.His rivalry with American John McEnroe was legendary: the ice-cool Swede against the bad boy American. Their epic 1980 Wimbledon final clash - won by Borg in five sets - is often cited as one of tennis' greatest matches, alongside the 2008 final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. The resemblance between Leo and his dad, both in playing style and appearance, is striking. Just like his famous father, Borg junior is a strong athlete, with wide, muscular shoulders. Leo hits his backhand double-handed, almost the same way as his father, who modeled the stroke on the slap shot in ice hockey, which he played as a child.

A year ago, Leo Borg signed a sponsorship contract with Fila, an Italian sports brand that reached iconic status in the 1970s thanks to his father, who famously wore the brand's headband to keep his long hair in check.

        "content": "(CNN)Hundreds of thousands of children are estimated to go missing every year in the US alone and now one leading European football team has decided to use the power of its social media accounts to help publicize the search for some of those kids.Followed by millions of people across the world on social media, Italian club AS Roma wants to use the \"viral nature\" of social media for \"social good.\"Inspired by US rock band Soul Asylum -- who used the music video for \"Runaway Train\" to promote the search of 36 missing children -- the Serie A team has partnered with charities National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Telefono Azzurro, Missing People and Missing Child Kenya.And with every transfer announcement Roma makes this summer, the club will share two videos of missing children  -- one from the US and one from Italy initially.READ: Villarreal gives midfielder Santi Cazorla a magical welcomeREAD: Inside the world's first professional FIFA houseAS Roma launched initiative to help find missing children.\nRead More'Not for self-promotion'Due to the lack of a concrete definition and unreliable statistics, it's not known how many kids go missing every year worldwide but estimations suggest over one million cases are reported annually. Roma's posts will show the faces of just some of the missing children and will include details of the search which has been provided to the club by the respective charities.\"It's not about Roma trying to be original or to get a pat on the back, it's actually more about how we can do as much as possible to try raise awareness,\"  Head of Strategy at AS Roma Paul Rogers told CNN Sport.\"If we can help in any small way in maybe finding someone who has a piece of information that might result in someone getting back in contact with one of the charities, then it would be a great thing.\"Official: Leonardo Spinazzola is now a Roma player.

From Hollywood style videos to purposely bad photoshop, no idea has been too weird or strange to welcome new players to the club.It's official Twitter account has nearly two million followers, while the Italian team's English handle has another 445,000 followers.\"There's a lot of self promotion and we've certainly done that sort of stuff in the past,\" added Rogers, who said there was no real hesitation in changing tone. \"But we thought this year, why don't we try and do something that had a bit more meaning to it than just promoting ourselves.\"The current campaign was launched on Sunday with the signing of Leonardo Spinazzola. The video has had over six thousand retweets on its English language channel and was viewed over one million times in the first 24 hours.Rodgers admits the campaign has been more popular than the club thought and has been buoyed by the positive response. It's yet another demonstration of the influence sports clubs can have on the wider community, he says. \"I definitely think it can grow bigger than this,\" said Rogers, who confirmed the club was interested in talking to a number of other charities around the world. \"If another organization or sports team decided to do something similar. I think that would be great success.\"READ: Atletico Madrid signs teenager in fifth richest transferRoma wants other sports team to join in the campaign. 'It absolutely can find missing children'According to the American-based NCMEC, the initiative has already had an impact on the amount of traffic coming to its site -- it recorded an increase of 600 followers on their social media accounts after the first video was posted.The charity has been working to help missing children and their families for 35 years but have never entered a partnership quite like this one.\"I think it absolutely can find missing children,\" Rebecca Kovar, Senior Communications Program Manager at NCMEC, told CNN Sport. \"It takes one person to see an image of a missing child and come forward with information. The more people that can see the image, the greater that chance is.\" The charity worked closely with Roma to select children who would benefit most from the international exposure, namely critical cases where the children are thought to have left the country. Having initially been a little cautious about partnering with a football team, the charity has praised the support it has received from the Italian outfit. \"This is very unique to us, and really quite an amazing chance for exposure to bring these kids home,\" added Kovar.",

        "content": "(CNN)On an overcast evening, with the 2019 Women's World Cup a day old, Megan Rapinoe and her teammates are exploring the city of Reims, the unofficial capital of France's Champagne region. Hosting the defending champions' opening match of the tournament, the northeastern city where French kings were crowned is home to America's finest soccer players for the next few days. The footballers, smartly dressed with no team badges on display to hint at their occupations, come to a halt near a tram stop. Huddled and moving in semicircles to the command of a blue dot on a smartphone, the group looks lost. But no one is taking notice. Locals are patiently waiting for a tram to arrive, unaware that a few steps away are Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, Olympic champions, world champions, household names in their homeland. Follow @cnnsport\n\nWith her lavender hair, the flamboyant Rapinoe has been easy to recognize in France. But after the past few days, even the inhabitants of Reims would now probably glance twice if they were to find the 33-year-old in their midst again. Being in the eye of a Twitter storm with the President of the United States tends to increase a person's profile. \n\n\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise that Rapinoe, who has described herself as a \"walking protest,\" has irked Trump. What is perhaps more startling is that it has taken the US President this long to take notice of America's World Cup-winning activist. Over the years, the Californian has called him \"sexist,\" \"misogynistic,\" \"racist\" \"small-minded\" and a \"jerk but entertaining.\" Read MoreBut we're now in the middle of the Women's World Cup, a tournament in which viewing figures are shattering records across continents, a competition that the United States is favorite to win for the record fourth time, and so the world is paying attention to whatever Rapinoe says. And, of course, when fire is blown in Trump's direction, he usually reaches for his flamethrower: Twitter.  Last week, the soccer magazine Eight by Eight released a 39-second clip of Rapinoe talking to its reporter during a photo shoot in January. Asked whether she was excited to go to the White House if her team wins the World Cup, the United States' co-captain retorts, \"Pfft, I'm not going to the f*ing White House.\"Trump responded and needed more than 280 characters to do so. In a series of tweets that were heavy on exclamation marks, the US President told Rapinoe that she should \"WIN first before she talks!\" and should not disrespect her country or its flag and \"Finish the job!\"Rapinoe has since told reporters that she stands by the comments \"with the exception of the expletive; my mom would be very upset about that.\" \"I don't think that I would want to go, and I would encourage my teammates to think hard about lending that platform or having that co-opted by an administration that doesn't feel the same way and doesn't fight for the same things that we fight for,\" she said Thursday.READ: Rapinoe scores twice as US marches to semifinalsREAD: Rapinoe isn't backing downRapinoe is one of three USWNT co-captains.It is the word \"fight\" that encapsulates the fearless midfielder's approach to life. She isn't the sort to hold back or shy away from an argument. This is a soccer great, a veteran of the US team who is full of wit, who wants to make a difference. She is true to herself. Being in a battle with the US President does not seem to weigh heavily on a player who describes herself as carefree and confident. It certainly did not curtail her performance in Friday's colossal quarterfinal match against France. She was, in her coach's words, \"fantastic,\" scoring both goals in a 2-1 win. But being the focus of attention is not new territory for Rapinoe. This is a player who has been booed by her own fans while representing her country when she knelt during the US national anthem in support of Colin Kaepernick's silent protest against police brutality.The midfielder was one of the first white professional athletes to show solidarity with Kaepernick and the first to do so on an international stage, helping turn a ripple of discontent into a wave that swept the country.\"I haven't experienced over-policing, racial profiling, police brutality or the sight of a family member's body lying dead in the street. But I cannot stand idly by while there are people in this country who have had to deal with that kind of heartache,\" Rapinoe wrote in the Players' Tribune to explain her decision. Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosRapinoe kneels during the US national anthem before a match against the Netherlands in September 2016.  There was outrage. Rapinoe, a player who once sang \"Born in the USA\" as way of celebrating scoring for her country, had struck a nerve. But she never felt alone, telling CNN Sport in November that she had the support of her teammates, just as she has this week with Ali Krieger backing her co-captain on social media and coach Jill Ellis saying on Thursday, \"we have each other's backs in there.\" Rapinoe herself said she had not destabilized the dressing room before a crucial match. JUST WATCHEDWomen's Football Is...ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWomen's Football Is... 00:48As \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has rung out in French stadiums before USWNT matches, Rapinoe has remained silent. She stands these days because she has been told she has to. In 2017, US Soccer passed a policy that requires players to stand for the national anthem. Though the World Cup winner has respected the bylaw, her beliefs have not changed. In the interview with CNN last year, the midfielder said she had no regrets about taking the knee and would do it again \"in a heartbeat,\" going on to describe America as a country that \"needs to confront its issues more honestly.\"The American, an accumulator of 157 international caps, is an engaging interviewee. She answers whatever questions come her way, and her smile can put you at ease. She is eloquent and honest and knows she can make an impact through actions and words. \"I'm very aware of our platform as a team and how much impact that it has,\" she said Thursday. She speaks out on topics when other sports stars remain tight-lipped because, as a woman in sport, she has had to fight throughout her career. \"Having a conversation about it no matter how it goes is better than not having it,\" she told CNN of the period in which she took the knee, which captures the attitude of a player who came out as gay after a series of brilliant performances during the 2011 Women's World Cup raised her profile. It was a Rapinoe cross that led to the Abby Wambach goal in the quarterfinal against Brazil, saving the US from elimination. There were concerns about the consequences of coming out, about endorsements disappearing and the hate that could follow, but Rapinoe wanted to be an example. It was time to be fearlessly open. The player and her girlfriend, Sue Bird of the WNBA's Seattle Storm, were the first openly gay couple to appear on the cover of ESPN the Magazine's Body Issue. READ: The match that changed women's footballRapinoe with girlfriend Sue Bird on the cover of ESPN's Body Issue.Raised in the conservative area of Palo Cedro to a Christian family, Rapinoe is one of six siblings and a twin. She told reporters this week that she comes from a strong family and that the people whom she is surrounded by have helped her feel \"empowered and emboldened.\"But it is the life of Brian Rapinoe, the brother she worshiped as a child, who spent eight of his 16 years in prison in solitary confinement and is now part of San Diego's Male Community Reentry Program, who has had the greatest impact on Rapinoe the social campaigner. \"He probably just needed more treatment or a rehabilitation facility, rather than being put in maximum-security prison for his offenses,\" she said Thursday when asked about her older brother, who got hooked on drugs as a teenager.\"It gave me a broader perspective on the criminal justice system, the people in there. They're your brothers, your friends and brothers. In a large way, especially as I've gotten older, that shaped my view on that in particular, but obviously that has a lot of ramification outside of just drug abuse.\"The Californian has said that gay rights, equal pay and racial inequality are intertwined. \"If we're still having the argument 'is there racism? Is there sexism?' -- those things exist. We know they exist,\" Rapinoe has told CNN. \"Insofar as we argue whether they exist, we're wasting time on the issue. I just wish we would just confront them more honestly, so we can get onto the solutions.\"But the wheels of progress turn slowly, which is why the midfielder, likely to be competing at her last World Cup, continues to be vocal and at the forefront for equality.JUST WATCHEDRapinoe 'confident' in discrimination lawsuitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRapinoe 'confident' in discrimination lawsuit 01:04Rapinoe was one of five players whose names were on the lawsuit filed against US soccer's governing body in 2016 alleging wage discrimination, which led to a new collective bargaining agreement. It was a fight that inspired other sportswomen: Canada's soccer team reportedly sought advice on how to get maternity coverage into contracts, and the US hockey team asked the USWNT for help.Around the world, women's teams found their voices. Nigeria's soccer players held a sit-in at their hotel to demand unpaid salaries, Ireland's female footballers threatened to strike, Australia did so, and Norway signed an equal pay agreement in 2017. Just months before the start of the World Cup in France, 28 members of the US squad, including Rapinoe, filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the US' soccer federation, citing \"institutionalized gender discrimination,\" which the reigning world champions say had existed for years. Last week, it was reported that the players and the federation have agreed to begin a mediation process after the World Cup. At the time, Rapinoe told CNN Sport that she and her teammates would \"fight until the end\" in the battle for equality and that the USWNT was happy to \"clear the path as much as we can\" for other countries in the battle for gender equality.There was the use of the word \"fight\" again. Rapinoe will continue to stand up for her beliefs. That the US President has started to take notice will probably embolden a player who believes there are things that are much more important than soccer.",

        "content": "(CNN)A rooster called Maurice was Thursday put on trial in western France, in an unusual case that has come to symbolize the divide between urban and rural communities.The copper-feathered cockerel is the defendant in a court battle stemming from a long-running neighborhood dispute over his early morning crowing.His owner Corinne Fesseau told CNN that neighbors in the village of Saint-Pierre-d'Ol\u00e9ron, on the Isle of Ol\u00e9ron, first complained in April 2017, asking her to keep Maurice quiet.\"I've lived here for 35 years, it's never bothered anyone,\" she said.However the neighbors accuse Maurice of causing noise pollution and the case was heard by the court in Rochefort, Charente Maritime on Thursday.Read MoreAfter the trial, Fesseau told CNN she was pleased with the developments and hopeful a solution could be found.\"I hope these people will understand the meaning of rurality,\" she said.While a verdict is not expected until September 5, the trial has already ignited debate in France.Saint-Pierre-d'Oleron sits on an island off the west coast of France.The neighbors in question are city dwellers who only visit Saint-Pierre-d'Ol\u00e9ron a few times per year, according to Fesseau.Their attitude towards the rooster, which is one of the national symbols of the country, has been perceived as indicative of the polarization between urban and rural France.\"The solution is for people to understand that the countryside is still the countryside and we must tolerate the crows of the rooster,\" said Fesseau. \"I want to protect all the roosters in France.\"And her struggle has received significant support as almost 120,000 people signed her online petition to save Maurice.She appeared on Maurice's behalf Thursday because she didn't want the rooster to go to court due to worries he would disturb proceedings.However Fesseau told CNN that several people came to the court with other roosters in a show of support.Julien Papineau, who describes himself as the lawyer for both Fesseau and Maurice, told CNN he is confident the trial will favor his clients.\"A rooster is not an abnormal, unbearable or excessive trouble,\" he said.\"This rooster was not there to be trendy. It lives there amongst hens like it has always has. Because its owners want eggs.\"Christophe Sueur, mayor of Saint-Pierre-D'Ol\u00e9ron told CNN that the case is an example of deeper issues in contemporary society.\"The problem is that we no longer tolerate each other,\" he said, adding that the traditional sounds of the countryside should be protected.\"Here, we can hear songs of turtledoves, the sound of seagulls, tractors, that's what makes the beauty of our island too. The soundscape is very important and it is part of what contributes to the charm of our landscape,\" he said.And Magali Richaud, a lawyer specializing in animal law, told CNN these kind of issues are common.\"We are in a classic dispute, with noise problems and city dwellers who do not understand,\" she said, adding that while the complainants could claim for compensation if they win the case, Maurice will live to tell the tale.Bresse is best: How to eat the world's most expensive chickenParis deputy mayor says tourist buses 'no longer welcome'\"We cannot order the destruction of property, the destruction of Maurice. He is still a living being endowed with sensitivity.\" The trial also struck a chord with Bruno Dionis du Sejour, mayor of Gajac, a rural town in the south of France, who has called on the government to list distinctive elements of the French rural soundscape as part of the national protected cultural heritage.\"I hope the owner of the rooster will win. It is still incredible that people who come from the city do not want to hear the sounds of the countryside: the rooster, the cow, the church bell,\" he told CNN.\"The gap between the countryside and the city is being widened.\"As for Fesseau, she is looking forward to telling Maurice about events of the trial.\"I'm going to go see him, give him a kiss and tell him we're going to win this trial!\"CNN's Celia Heudebourg and Rebecca Blanchard contributed to this report.",

New fan favoriteAnd when Rybarikova double-faulted to bring up a first match point at 5-3 in the second, the decibel level rose with cheers -- and applauding on double faults usually contravenes tennis etiquette. Gauff smiled and waved to her new adoring public as she left the court about 9.15 p.m. local time, probably not far off her usual bedtime. \"That smile at the end said everything,\" Blackman said. It was an 'A' performance from Gauff, who took a science test during her qualifying run while reaching the main draw.  She was due to face Rybarikova on Court Two -- still a big stage, especially for two unseeded players -- but organizers shifted the contest to the second show court when matches on Court 2 ran late.Perhaps memories of defeating Williams in the same arena two days ago boosted Gauff. She looked at home in only her second ever Grand Slam outing. Many a player before her has struggled to follow up massive victories, but Gauff seems a character hard to ruffle.

She even felt comfortable sliding on grass, considered by many players to be the trickiest surface to move on.  When Gauff needed to relieve pressure at 2-1, 30-30 in the second set, she struck an ace. A \"come on\" followed, and there were two more in that game, one following a sizzling forehand winner that allowed her to hold serve. Timely aceBut perhaps her loudest roar came at 3-2, deuce, when an ace flew off her racket immediately after she was run ragged by Rybarikova on a drop-and-lob combination. She never faced a break point. As she neared victory and chased another drop shot, another fan encouraged her to \"run, run, run.\" Gauff's reply found the net, but it was one of the rare occasions when Rybarikova's drop shot, one of her favorite strokes, stymied her opponent. It's hard to believe that when Gauff was 7, mom Candi said, she was the worst player in her tennis program. Mom did track and field at Florida State while dad Corey played basketball at Georgia State. Their athletic pedigree has surely aided Gauff, along with their daughter's resolve.

Though the Netherlands is the reigning European Champion, the US women's national team may have seen little in this semifinal to concern them ahead of the title decider in the same stadium. For World Cup pedigree, the finalists are poles apart: three-time winner US is facing a team ranked eighth in the world, which is in its first final and competing in just its second World Cup.But the Dutch are part of the European wave of traditional men's soccer powerhouses who have invested in women's football in recent years and the country's improvement has been exceptional. It is undoubtedly a talented team.Read MoreIndeed, the Dutch women are now on a 12-match winning streak in major tournaments after winning Euro 2017 and reaching the final in France, and as Netherlands coach Sarina Wiegman told reporters: \"It's one match and anything can happen.\"The showdown between women's football's old and new powers will also be the second World Cup final to be contested by teams managed by female coaches, a significant feat considering only nine of the 24 teams which featured in this tournament were managed by women. \"Women need to have the guts to make the choices and take risks to go for higher positions, but what we need to do as women is show that we have qualities,\" Wiegman said.

With their marching parades to the stadiums and their impressive repertoire of songs, the thousands of Netherlands Oranje fans in attendance in France have added much to this tournament. After the final whistle, trumpets were enthusiastically blown and Dutch flags waved as the fans stayed behind to cheer their history-making team.That the two teams with the most vociferous support in France have made it to the final will make it even more of a spectacle.But it was only in the second half that the Dutch fans had much to shout about, Vivianne Miedema forcing Sweden's goalkeeper, Hedvig Lindahl, into a fingertip save which rattled the crossbar only minutes after Sweden's Nilla Fischer had hit the post with a long-distance daisy-cutter.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosIn the 70th minute, much to the delight of the Dutch fans, lightning quick winger Shanice van de Sanden was introduced from the substitutes' bench. Immediately, her teammates sought her out and her pace put Sweden's defense on its heels. The US will be tested should the winger feature. Such was the Lyon forward's impact, she could be seen urging the Dutch fans to raise the decibels in the closing stages of the 90 minutes and their response was instant.In the 90th minute, with a rasping shot across goal, Van de Sanden forced a fine save from Lindahl but it was left to Groenen create history.But the sight of Kosovare Asllani being carried off the pitch on a stretcher towards the end of the match, after being hit by the ball following an aerial duel, was a sour ending. \"I know nothing right now,\" Sweden coach Peter Gerhardsson told reporters in the immediate aftermath of defeat. \"I have a feeling of emptiness, whether that's the match or Kosovare, I have a sense of emptiness.\"",

Images from the Tuwharetoa Maori Trust Board, an indigenous Maori body that owns the lake, show a blast of brown sludge inching into the lake's pristine teal water.800,000 liters of waste water flowed into the freshwater Lake Taupo -- the largest lake in New Zealand.After bringing in pumps and sandbags, the district council said wastewater is no longer flowing into the lake and the pipe has been temporarily fixed.Read More\"The drinking water is 100% safe and is continually monitored,\" said Gareth Green, CEO of the Taupo District Council.. \"There's no need to worry health-wise as long as people don't come into contact with the contaminated area in that specific place.\"Taupo is home to about 24,190 residents, and lies near the center of New Zealand's North Island. These residents, schools, and shops have now been told to save as much water as possible to ease pressure on the pipe's temporary repair. \"If it's yellow, let it mellow,\" reads a post on the council's Facebook page. \"Please minimize toilet flushing and water use this morning!\"All wastewater from showers, laundry, toilets, and washing dishes enter the same system, meaning residents have been told to skip or minimize those activities.Residents expressed their concerns on social media, asking about the safety of drinking water, the duration of the flush ban, and demanding accountability. The spill is of particular concern to the Ngati Tuwharetoa, the area's indigenous Maori tribe.After a water main broke, a landslide damaged roads and a wastewater pipe by the shore of Lake Taupo.\"Lake Taupo is a treasure of paramount importance to our people,\" said Topia Rameka, CEO of the Tuwharetoa Maori Trust Board.\"It has sustained our people for 30 generations. Any environmental impact that has the potential to degrade or impact the life-giving force of the water is something that is of major concern to us -- on an environmental level, a social level, and a cultural level,\" Rameka said.According to the district council, the visible effects of the spill will be gone in a few days, and a new pipe is expected to be installed in three to five days.Extra pumps worked overnight to redirect wastewater away from the lake.The pipe broke near the mouth of a river, so liquid waste is being flushed downstream, away from the lake, said Green.However, this adds another element of worry for residents who source their water from the river.\"The immediate concerns for our communities are those living downstream of the river -- their ability to take water from the river, drinking water,\" said Rameka. He added that if that happens, it'll likely be a short-term issue until the river carries the contaminants away.Cleanup efforts and road repairs could still take weeks, but council officials say there won't be long-term damage to the lake water.Pumps and sandbags are used to stem the flow of wastewater into Lake Taupo.Still, some worry that the spill could hurt the lake's large trout population.\"People are concerned about the catching of food,\" said Rameka, who added that the tribe will consider fishing prohibition measures, to allow the trout to decontaminate and recover.Ongoing investigations into the cause of the break have so far pointed to ground movement from recent earthquakes, rather than aging infrastructure, said the council in a statement on Wednesday.",

The Kremlin had initially been reluctant to release information about the blaze, which left 14 sailors dead due to smoke inhalation, calling it a state secret. The submersible, which is smaller than a submarine and has limited power reserves, was carrying out research in Russian territorial waters at the time of the fire and is now at the naval base in Severomorsk on the Barents Sea.According to a Kremlin transcript released Thursday, Putin asked Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu about the status of the vessel's \"nuclear power unit.\" Russia says submersible fire tragedy is 'state secret'\"Mr. President, the nuclear power unit has been sealed off,\" Shoigu, who had visited Severomorsk, replied.Read More\"The crew has taken the necessary measures to save the unit, which is in working order,\" Shoigu added. Repairable He confirmed to Putin that the vessel could be repaired and said \"the main reason for the tragedy: a fire in the battery (compartment) that spread out.\" \"We are using the services of the submarine designers and industry representatives to assess the volume and time frame of repairs,\" he added. Shoigu is overseeing the probe into the incident. On Wednesday, he indicated there were some survivors and that 10 of the victims were captains. \"Fourteen crew members were killed, the rest were saved,\" he said according to RIA-Novosti.\"Seven of the dead were captains of the first rank, and three were captains of the second rank. Two were Heroes of Russia.

The blaze is one of the deadliest incidents the Russian navy has experienced in years.Twenty people were killed on board a Russian nuclear submarine in 2008, when a fire extinguishing system was triggered accidentally. In 2000, more than 100 men died on the Kursk, a nuclear-powered submarine, when two explosions in its bow caused it to sink to the floor of the Barents Sea.CNN's Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Nine major international tournaments, nine times Lionel Messi has tasted disappointment with Argentina.Tuesday's 2-0 defeat to Brazil in the 2019 Copa America semifinal is the latest in an ever growing list of heartbreaks with the national team that could leave arguably one of the greatest players of all time without a trophy for his country.The latest disappointment wasn't enough to force Messi into international retirement -- as he did after defeat to Chile in the 2016 final -- but, uncharacteristically, he didn't hold back in his criticism of the referee.\"They were not better than us,\" Messi told reporters after the game in Belo Horizonte. \"They found the net early and the second goal came from a penalty they didn't award,\" added the 32-year-old Barcelona star, referring to a challenge on Sergio Aguero in the prelude to Roberto Firmino's strike that made it 2-0.\"The officiating was crazy. There were clear penalties, on Nicolas Otamendi, on Sergio Ag\u00fcero.Read More\"He [the referee] was on their side. In every divided ball or dispute, he tilted the pitch their way. It's not an excuse but the truth is that. In this Copa they kept on blowing for stupid things, for handballs, penalties. \"But today, they didn't even go to VAR when there were clear plays that should have been looked at.\"READ: Lionel Messi tops Forbes list of highest paid athletesREAD: Lionel Messi fast factsIt may sound like sour grapes but on closer examination, perhaps Messi has a point. If fans thought the use of VAR at the Men's and Women's World Cup was perplexing, this Copa America has taken the confusion to another level.Brazil celebrate as Lionel Messi once again tastes disappointment.Though it hasn't just been the use of VAR that's been the problem, it's also the lack of it. On the two occasions Messi mentioned, Argentina had legitimate shouts for a penalty incidents that were not even reviewed.South American governing body CONMEBOL didn't respond to CNN Sport's request for comment on refereeing standards and the use of VAR at the tournament.A new hope?But there may still be one more chance for Messi to crown his glittering club career with a trophy for Argentina. Thanks to CONMEBOL's scheduling and insistence on aligning the Copa with the European Championships, next year South America's most prestigious tournament will be played for a fourth time in six years.Some have joked that South America's governing body will choose to have a Copa every year until Messi finally wins one.The 2020 competition will take place in Argentina, too, which is co-hosting the 47th edition along with Colombia.Opinion is divided in Argentina as to who is to blame for the international team's malaise. Many blame Messi for not performing to the standards he does week in, week out for Barcelona, while others point the finger at his supporting cast that isn't quite as star-studded as Barcelona's.Lionel Messi was powerless to prevent a ninth straight trophyless tournament.But, of course, Messi certainly isn't blameless. For all the accolades and superlatives, the little magician failed to register a single goal or assist from open play in this year's Copa, scoring only once from the penalty spot against Paraguay.Another blank in front of goal means Messi has only scored four goals in 20 knockout matches when playing for Argentina.'Respected and not criticized'The Argentina manager's job, currently held by Lionel Scaloni, is arguably the most poisonous chalice in world football -- the dream job that no Argentine wants to take, but can't turn down.The national team, which has twice won the World Cup, is now onto its fifth manager in the last six years, each one dismissed with every new failure.For an international heavyweight -- perhaps now former heavyweight -- and a team with such a rich history, a 26-year trophy-less run stretching back to 1993 Copa America is deemed unacceptable.But there is a group of young Argentines making strides, plus some of the current crop, that are exciting both Messi and public. Spearheaded by 21-year-old Lautaro Martinez, Argentina's best player against Brazil, many are starting to feel more optimistic about the future.Lautaro Martinez is one of Argentina's exciting new stars.\"Something new is on the horizon,\" Messi said on Tuesday night. \"The truth is I have got on very well with this group of players and if I have to help in some way I will. This is a great group which is growing and if I can join them I will.\"I hope we are respected and not criticized. They should let the team be and let them grow,\" Messi added. Argentina's participation in this year's Copa America isn't completely over. The Albiceleste have a third place playoff on Saturday against the loser of Wednesday's semifinal between Chile and Peru, with the winner going on to play Brazil in Sunday's final.",

The rescue comes after the collapse of ISIS's caliphate in Syria, leaving thousands of ISIS affiliates -- many of whom are women and children -- in make-shift camps. Morrison said the eight rescued were now in the care of Australian government officials. \"The fact that parents put their children into harm's way by taking them into a war zone was a despicable act,\" he said in a statement sent to CNN. \"However, children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents.\"Veiled women, living in al-Hol camp which houses relatives of ISIS group members, walk in the camp in al-Hasakeh governorate in northeastern Syria on March 28, 2019. Read MoreMorrison said the decision to repatriate the children -- who will be taken to Australia -- was not taken lightly, and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) officials had supported the efforts.\"As I have said repeatedly, my government would not allow any Australian to be put at risk,\" he said. \"Australia's national security and the safety of our people and personnel have always been our most important considerations in this matter.\"When CNN asked for more details on the children involved, the Prime Minister's office said he was not able to comment on individual cases. More foreigners affectedThere are at least 50 other Australian children and women in camps in northeast Syria, including many who are sick and injured, according to non-profit Save the Children, which is working in several camps in northeast Syria.Save the Children chief executive Paul Ronalds commended the Australian government for bringing the eight children home -- but he urged them to help repatriate the other children too. \"They are innocent victims of war and we're pleased they will soon be reunited with their families back home to Australia,\" he said in a statement.\"These children have had their childhoods taken away from them, facing horrors and atrocities that are difficult to imagine.\"Countries around the world have been struggling with how to handle thee return of citizens who left to join ISIS.According to United States officials, there are around 2,000 foreign ISIS fighters currently detained by US-backed forces in Syria -- a small number of whom claim to be US citizens. There are also an additional 60,000 ISIS \"affiliates\" --  family members who have either chosen to stay, or were coerced to stay -- with around 15% of them from countries other than Syria or Iraq. Many of them are in make-shift camps that aren't built to house such large numbers for an extended period of time.Senior US defense officials have long encouraged countries to repatriate their citizens. Many countries, including European allies, are reluctant to do so because of the difficulty of prosecuting suspected ISIS members based on evidence collected on the battlefield.One of the most high profile cases involves Shamima Begum, who left London to join ISIS in Syria when she was 15. She hit headlines this year after the UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid decided to revoke her British citizenship.",

Ellis did not think so, going on to describe Rapinoe's replacement, Christen Press, who opened the scoring, as \"fantastic.\" \"There was an outside chance that Pinoe could take a penalty, so we didn't want to extend ourselves more than we had to,\" Ellis added. \"We give our starting XI when we have to. Fortunately, we didn't have to go to penalty kicks, but that was an option. I don't know about secrecy; we release [the team lineup] when we release it. Once she was warming up, I think you guys could figure it out.\"After a match, players have to negotiate a line of reporters before they have an opportunity to recover. Tobin Heath, creator of the US' first goal, walked by without much fuss, but Rapinoe was reportedly faced with a barrage of questions that she patiently answered. It is hoped that Rapinoe will be fit for Sunday's final, which will be against either the Netherlands or Sweden -- who will play each other Wednesday in Lyon -- but even if the 2015 World Cup winner does not make the starting lineup, the US has proved that it has a wealth of talent like no other team in this competition. The USWNT has also proved that it can turn a blind eye to pressure and other distractions.

There was also the brouhaha after the 13-0 thumping of Thailand in the opening week, with many arguing that the US had over-celebrated scoring against a lesser team.In answering how her players have managed to block out the noise, Ellis said: \"It goes back to the mindset and the expectation.\"We're here for one thing -- not lawsuits, not silly trumped-up things, not silly noise -- we're here for one thing, and that's the trophy. \"We focus on that. It's always this way, because when you're the premier team in the world, you're always going to have noise, external stuff to deal with, but I think we have a really unique way to make sure everything is about the game plan, the preparation. \"They're really talking the game, and that's kind of exciting as a coach. They're professionals, and that'd be the best way to sum it up.\"US coach Jill Ellis, right, celebrates with goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher. Ellis also had a word for her goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher, who has been criticized during this tournament for her role in the team's defensive lapses but played the starring role by saving a late Steph Houghton penalty  and denying England the opportunity to draw level. She also produced a wonderful first-half save. \"I don't pay attention to anything you guys write or what anyone thinks. She's been my No. 1,\" the coach told reporters. \"The theme of the tournament is 'dare to shine,' so I said to my players the other day, 'we're going to add to that, \"dare to shine the brightest.\" ' She shone. She was the brightest.\"I give her full credit. She's a tremendous person. People care about her; people have her back; people are starting to see glimpses of what I see every day in training. I think she's making her own mark and creating her own legacy, and I think that's fantastic, and she made a hell of a save, that's for sure.\"",

The American rapper was detained following a confrontation in the Swedish capital, according to Expressen.\"We are working hard with this and confident that the prosecutor will take a decision in favor of my client when he gets the full picture,\" Olsson Lilja said, according to Reuters.The 30-year-old, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was reportedly detained with three other people at around 1 a.m. local time Wednesday morning, after a brawl broke out in the city.

        "content": "(CNN)Europe's leaders have agreed to give two of the top four European Union jobs to women, but only after a marathon set of talks that exposed the continent's simmering divisions.German defense minister Ursula Von Der Leyen emerged as nominee for president of the European Commission, and International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde, who is French, was put forward for the presidency of the European Central Bank.Von Der Leyen's role must be confirmed by a vote in the European Parliament. If elected, she would be the first woman to lead the European Commission. Lagarde will be the first woman to head the bloc's central bank.Outgoing European Council president Donald Tusk called the appointments \"a perfect gender balance.\"Christine Lagarde tapped as next president of Europe's central bankThe deal was a classic European result, after days of backroom horse-trading that was bitter even by Brussels standards. Read MoreThe choice of Von Der Leyen, seen as a hawkish conservative, was designed to placate Hungary's hardline leader Victor Orban. His cohort of like-minded Eastern European leaders had joined with Italy to block the original frontrunner for the role, Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans, at the last minute.That maneuver had infuriated France and Germany. Lagarde's unexpected appointment was designed to keep French President Emmanuel Macron on side.The compromise may yet fall apart when it comes up against a fractious European Parliament. Elections in May injected the body with a new intake of assorted populists and trouble-makers. The parliament's socialist group was said to be infuriated by the candidacy of Von Der Leyen as president of the European Commission, the bloc's executive body.As part of the deal, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was also elected president of the European Council, to replace Tusk. Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell Fontelles will be high representative for foreign affairs and security policy.The appointments followed a tense series of negotiations. A summit broke up on Monday, after all-night talks failed to reach an agreement. Brexit Party MEPs turn backs during European anthemTusk appeared relieved that a deal had been done. \"We have chosen two women and two men for the four key positions -- a perfect gender balance,\" he said. \"I am really happy about it, after all Europe is a woman,\" he added, in a reference to Greek mythology.Lagarde said she would temporarily relinquish her duties as managing director of the IMF during the nomination period.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Given the buzz generated by the pair of games between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox over the past weekend, the unlikely marriage between London and Major League Baseball could be one that lasts.What's not in doubt is that on a sweltering weekend in the British capital, the London Stadium was the place to be for royals and any self-respecting A-lister.Like the annual NBA London Game, celebs came out to hobnob with players, from Spike Lee and Rudy Giuliani to Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who visited each team's locker room before Saturday's game.Meghan embraced Red Sox outfielder Mookie Betts, who is believed to be her distant relative. An amateur genealogist traced their lineage back 150 years to the same small town in Alabama.Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex meet Boston Red Sox players before a match against the New York Yankees in London, Saturday June 29, 2019. (Peter Nicholls/Pool via AP)British MP Ed Miliband, a Red Sox fan, discussed strategy with visiting Americans, while former New York mayor and Yankee fan Giuliani weighed in on the prospect of the sport taking off in the UK.  Read More\"I think the Brits love sports, and I think if baseball does what (the NFL) does and sticks with it, and stays here for four or five or six years, they will love it,\" Giuliani told CNN Sport.\"They love baseball; they will probably find a way to bet on it. They will probably bet on innings, half innings, balls and strikes ... they love to bet.\"Didi Gregorius of the New York Yankees (R) celebrates his home run with teammate Gleyber Torres on Sunday. The Yankees defeated the Red Sox in both games of their London visit.'Huge event'The MLB came armed with stars and scoring, welcomed by glorious weather and sellout crowds who sang \"Sweet Caroline\" during a break in the eighth inning as though they were in Boston's Fenway Park.\"It felt like a huge event,\" said Yankee manager Aaron Boone, whose team picked up a pair of wins with the record-breaking score lines of 17-13 and 12-8 to secure the best record in the American League halfway through the season. \"The energy in the building never let up and you could feel that ... it was a lot of fun to be a part of that.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosYears after the NFL and NBA established themselves with European audiences by holding annual mid-season games in London, the MLB announced last year that it would send two of its global sporting brands across the pond.It soon became evident that the team's logos carried far more fame than their players did in England. Although the Yankees 6-foot 8-inch, 282-pound star slugger Aaron Judge is hard to miss, he went unrecognized while walking around the London Eye while sightseeing on Thursday -- even by tourists wearing Yankee hats.\"They had no idea who I was,\" he recalled. \"I said, 'Hi, I'm Aaron, good to meet you.'\"Nevertheless, both managers and their players were aware of the gravity of the moment.\"The opportunity to showcase our game over here is great, and we should feel excited to play a little bit of a role in hopefully spreading our sport,\" Boone noted.Fears that the games would be tainted by low-scoring pitching duels, or possibly get rained-out given London's unpredictable summer weather, were quickly swept aside.Taking advantage of the short outfield fences, the teams combined for 50 runs -- a record for consecutive games played in their 117-year rivalry -- while blasting 10 home runs and 65 hits over the weekend.West Ham United's Mexican striker Javier Hernandez, known as Chicharito, swaps jerseys with countryman Luis Cessa, a pitcher for the New York Yankees before the meeting between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in London on Sunday. 'Pretty cool'On the downside, there was a total of 28 pitching changes, which led to long delays.By the time fireworks exploded and Frank Sinatra's \"New York, New York\" was played after the final out of Saturday's nearly five-hour marathon -- the first inning alone took 58 minutes -- half of the 60,000 seats at London Stadium were empty. Players, however, relished the surroundings and appeared undeterred by the new scenery that included artificial turf. \"It felt like a soccer match here, it was pretty cool,\" said Yankees shortstop Didi Gregorius, whose eighth inning homer on Sunday extended the Yankees record home run streak to 31 games.  \"It's fun being out here, crazy atmosphere.\"Gregorius, a Dutch-national who grew up between Amsterdam and Cura\u00e7ao, is one of 12 foreign-born players on the Yankees representing nine countries from Nicaragua to Japan.Among the hoard of assembled media over the weekend were at least 40 members of the Japanese press, on hand for Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka's shaky start on Saturday (he lasted less than an inning, giving up six runs).But out of the league's 251 international players that started the season, Gregorius is one of only three Europeans -- something the MLB is hoping to change.\"For me this means a lot, being back in Europe,\" said Gregorius, whose family traveled from the Netherlands to be in the stands on Sunday. \"We're trying to grow baseball all over the place.\"Soccer is dominant all over Europe, which I understand, because I grew up playing soccer a little bit,\" he added. \"But if people can see that there are more sports other than soccer -- you can't force it -- but if they get interested in it, it will be pretty cool to get people from London and other places in Europe to get in the Major League and represent their countries.\"Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who is from Puerto Rico, echoed the sentiment. Despite the defending champions' messy play, he called the event's execution \"outstanding\" and pushed for further games beyond next year's matchups between the Chicago Cubs and St. Luis Cardinals.\"Hopefully other teams can experience this venue,\" he said.MLB London Series: Yankees and Red Sox greats recall championships, brawls and the Curse of the BambinoREAD: Can baseball crack the British market?READ: MLB protective netting gains traction as another fan hit by ball Britain's cup of tea?Though the MLB's aim is to grow the sport in Europe, a large portion of seats were filled by existing baseball fans who traveled from the US.Among them were Bob and Maureen Gatulis, lifelong Red Sox fans living in Needham, Massachusetts, who were \"more than surprised\" to hear their team was coming to London.  \"I'm 65-years-old, something like this has never happened,\" Bob Gatulis said, while waiting on line at the souvenir stand before the first game. \"So as soon as I heard about it, I said jeez I think I want to go.\"He wasn't sold on the notion that America's pastime would soon be Britain's cup of tea, however.\"I don't know, baseball is a slow game,\" he said. \"There's a lot of history to baseball and a lot of nuances that you have to be a fan of the game to understand.\"Yankees fans show their support during the MLB London Series game between Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees in London on Saturday. Many attendees traveled from the US to watch the first regular season games held in Europe. Patrick Shine and his nine-year-old son Freddie traveled 50 miles from the town of Reading to the game, but were only vaguely aware of the rules, the father admitted. They were attending as fans of the NFL's Miami Dolphins.\"We love American sports,\" he said. \"This is a spillover for us because baseball is not really known here.\"Briton Bob Carter, 60, was gifted his tickets from his daughter, and the two decided they were rooting for the Red Sox on Sunday.But Carter lost interest about halfway through the game and streamed the Cricket World Cup on his phone to watch England play India. \"This is not as exciting as English football, or one day cricket,\" he said.Chicago college student Jeremiah Paprocki, 20, has been to every one of the league's 30 ballparks. He came away impressed by the authenticity the playing field placed on the grounds of West Ham United.\"The transformation is incredible; they made it look like an actual baseball field,\" he said. \"Walking in for the first time you can tell it was a soccer stadium because of how enormous it was on a baseball scale. Most MLB ballparks aren't this huge.\"\"London was a great host, and I think they will be a great host next year too,\" he added.JUST WATCHEDBaseball in BritainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBaseball in Britain 02:39If the past couple of days are anything to go by, the Cubs and the Cardinals -- another historic rivalry between two popular teams -- are set for a big weekend next year.The Yankees and Red Sox attracted the most fans for any MLB regular season game in 16 years on Saturday, according to Baseball Reference.

He was later moved to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, where he underwent another procedure and was listed in critical condition before his death.Tony Robichaux was the winningest head coach in Louisiana baseball history.With over 1,100 career wins, Robichaux's list of accolades and accomplishments is as long as it is impressive. He was the head coach for McNeese State for eight seasons before taking over as head coach at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where he served as head coach for the past 25 years. During that time, he became the winningest head coach in Louisiana baseball history. He was named the Sun Belt Coach of the Year four times, the All-Louisiana Coach of the Year six times and the ABCA South Central Region Coach of the Year four times. And under his tenure, he led Louisiana to 12 NCAA Regionals, four NCAA Super Regionals and the 2000 College World Series.Robichaux coached the McNeese State and University of Louisiana at Lafayette teams.\"As we learned this morning of the passing of our beloved friend and colleague, Coach Tony Robichaux, our thoughts and prayers turned immediately to the Robichaux family and the numerous current and former student-athletes that he greatly impacted,\" University of Louisiana at Lafayette Athletic Director Bryan Maggard said in a statement.

        "content": "Durham, UK (CNN)Jonny Bairstow's stylish century inspired England to a 119-run victory over New Zealand at the Cricket World Cup as the host nation booked its place in the semifinals.Follow @cnnsport\n\nOn a day where England's World Cup future was under threat, Bairstow produced his second century in four days and his third consecutive ton against New Zealand in one day cricket, to set up a likely tie with India at Edgbaston next Thursday.For England, which had to beat New Zealand to guarantee its place in the last four, victory brought welcome relief after a difficult few weeks in which it had proved consistently inconsistent.Jonny Bairstow of England celebrates his century against New Zealand.But here, buoyed by a capacity crowd in the picturesque city of Durham, England proved too good for a New Zealand team that has rapidly fallen away in its past few games.This defeat, New Zealand's third on the bounce, is unlikely to prove fatal to its own hopes of making the last four. It will now most likely face Australia in Manchester on Tuesday in a repeat of the 2015 final barring a miraculous intervention from Pakistan, which still harbors qualification ambitions of its own.Read MoreA fine victory over India in its last group game underlined this team's potential, while this win showed its ability to destroy an opponent's bowling attack and then strangle the life out of it in the field.RedemptionThat England's fate at this World Cup should rest on beating New Zealand, the team that humiliated it at the World Cup four years ago, was rather apt.Few English cricket fans will want to remember the 2015 defeat in Wellington in which England was beaten in a day/night game before the floodlights were even required.Skittled out for just 123, New Zealand required just 74 balls to condemn England to an eight-wicket defeat with 49 runs coming off just two Steven Finn overs.For England it was the nadir. For Eoin Morgan, it was one of the lowest moments of his career.\"It was a terrible day,\" Morgan said ahead of the clash with New Zealand in Durham.\"One of those moments in my career that will stand out for ever in my life as a day where I was devastated, not only with the way we performed but also the way we carried ourselves.\"READ: England gave Jofra Archer 'all the respect' he deserves, says RichardsREAD: England on the brink after Australia defeat TransformationFast forward to today and England is an entirely different proposition in one-day cricket.Indeed, the chastening defeat by New Zealand sparked a revolution in how England approached the 50-over game with Morgan taking inspiration from the philosophy employed by the Black Caps and its captain, Brendan McCullum.England's captain Eoin Morgan led his side to victory at Durham.\"The way his New Zealand team played, the way they did it their own way was important. It's important for any team to get their own identity and stick with it,\" said Morgan. \"New Zealand proved a point that you can actually be really good humans and grow the game and play cricket in your own way and win, at the same time.\"Since that defeat, England's fortunes have been transformed.  The 2015 3-2 series win at home to New Zealand marked the start of a climb to number one in the world rankings and four years of positivity going into this year's tournament. Such positivity was justified, too. A 5-0 win over Australia last summer, and a 4-0 whitewash of Pakistan ahead of the World Cup gave yet more impetus to the thought that this could finally be England's year.JUST WATCHEDViv Richards: Virat Kohli reminds me of myselfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHViv Richards: Virat Kohli reminds me of myself 02:06READ: Swarm of bees interrupts Cricket World CupREAD: Virat Kohli's fan club -- 103 million followers and Viv RichardsBut as ever with any England team, at any sporting tournament, progress is rarely simple.A defeat by Pakistan, a team it had beaten four times in succession only weeks earlier, and consecutive losses against Sri Lanka and Australia, left its place in the last four in severe jeopardy.Victory over India, which was unbeaten going into the contest and had temporarily replaced England at the top of the world rankings, was welcome, as was the nature of the performance.England, having won the toss and choosing to bat, made a riotous start with Bairstow and Roy putting on a first wicket partnership of 123 -- the same total the entire team combined managed when it last played New Zealand at the World Cup four years ago.Bairstow's century and Roy's 60 from 61 balls set the tone for the host, though New Zealand managed to fight its way back with England losing its next three wickets for just 20 runs.Ross Taylor of New Zealand is run out as Jos Buttler breaks the stumps after a throw from Adil Rashid.While at one stage England appeared to post a total in the region of 350, it ended up finishing on 305-8, a score that appeared enough to be confident of victory, but not certain.Not that England should have been too concerned given its bright start with the ball.Both New Zealand openers were dismissed with just 14 runs on the board and the visiting team was soon reduced to 69-4 with both skipper Kane Williamson and the dangerous Ross Taylor run out.Mark Wood of England celebrates bowling Jimmy Neesham of New Zealand.With those two batsmen went any hopes New Zealand had of winning the tie.Tom Latham did offer some resistance, hitting 57 before feathering the ball through behind to Joss Butler in rather disappointing fashion to leave his side 164-7.For New Zealand, the end was nigh. Mark Wood, bowling in excess of 145 km/h, claimed three wickets on his home ground to help dismiss New Zealand for just 186 and book England's place in the last four of the competition for the first time since 1992.",

The crowd jeered Kyrgios in Mexico and afterward Nadal claimed the Canberra native needed to show more respect to opponents, the crowd \u2014 and himself. A Kyrgios underarm serve that evening has now become a mainstay in his game, with another one on show Tuesday on set point against compatriot Jordan Thompson in what turned out to be a five-set victory.Kyrgios countered by criticizing Nadal's sometimes slow play between points before that no-holds-barred podcast which aired a day before the 24-year-old was given a game penalty, threw a chair on court and defaulted at the Rome Masters. READ: Kyrgios in fan altercation at Miami OpenRafael Nadal is chasing a third Wimbledon title and first since 2010. If it makes Nadal feel better, Kyrgios slammed world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, too, saying the Serb had a \"sick obsession with wanting to be liked.\"Publicly, Nadal made it sound like Thursday was simply another match for him. \"My thoughts are very clear,\" Nadal began after beating Japanese baseliner Yuichi Sugita in straight sets. \"I play against a top talented player, very dangerous player when he wants to play tennis.

Meanwhile, against his pals Andy Murray and Roger Federer\u2014 and thus where motivation might be harder to muster \u2014 he is a combined 2-10. He also appears to lack motivation for playing at the French Open, citing illness as the reason for his withdrawal in May after saying Nadal's most successful grand slam \"sucks.\" \"It's going to be a very interesting match,\" 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis succinctly told CNN. \"Both want to win. It's the biggest tournament in the world. Rafa is going to look to go out and compete and do what he does.

The last of his two Wimbledon titles came in 2010 and he fell in the defining men's match of 2018 in the semifinals against Djokovic in a thrilling five-setter. \"Last year I created the chance,\" Nadal said. \"I have been very close.

However, her long-time coach Patrick Mouratoglou warns she should never been ruled out, especially at Wimbledon where she has won seven singles titles, the last of which came in 2016. \"With Serena, there is no rule,\" Mouratoglou told CNN Sport at Roland Garros.When asked if he was confident Williams could pass Court at this stage of her career, the Frenchman said: \"Yeah, because you don't want to go to 24 (and get stuck).\" READ: Why Wimbledon is braced for a blockbuster yearSerena Williams won the last of her seven Wimbledon titles in 2016.'False record'Williams broke Steffi Graf's Open-era grand slam singles record at the 2017 Australian Open, when she beat her older sister Venus for her 23rd grand slam title -- while eight weeks pregnant. She returned from maternity leave in March 2018 and reached back-to-back grand slam finals at Wimbledon and the US Open, although she lost to Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka respectively. But 2019 has been less successful so far.After spraining her ankle during a quarterfinals defeat to Czech Karolina Pliskova at the Australian Open, Williams withdrew from a tournament in Miami in March with a knee injury that clearly hampered her movement during a straight-sets defeat to American teenager Sofia Kenin at Rolan Garros. Afterward, she visited Mouratoglou's doctor in Paris to assess the knee. According to Mouratoglou, Williams is pain free heading into Wimbledon.

She competed both in the amateur and the Open era, which began in 1968 when tennis turned professional. However, Court won 11 of her titles at the Australian Open, during a time when not all top players made the long journey Down Under. Court also played during a time when it was not unusual for players to skip slams altogether because they could make more money on the women's circuit.\"I don't think it is a record she [Serena] needs, and I don't think it is a record that she should be chasing,\" WTA expert Courtney Nguyen said of Serena at the French Open. \"I think that in a lot of ways her chasing the record, validates the record. When really the [main] record, it was Steffi's record, which she already broke.\"When Steffi got 22, no one said, 'Oh, you need two more to get to Margaret.'

And if she doesn't get it, now that she has chased it, it feels like she is missing something. \"But she never needed it.\"When asked if the hunt for the all-time record was a burden for Williams, Mouratoglou said: \"Whatever you are trying to achieve that is big, is possibly heavy. It's big because it's the record of all time and you have to set goals.\"Mouratoglou, who has guided Williams to 10 major singles titles since they started working together in 2012, said the attempt to break Court's record is \"really a source of motivation.\"\"It's difficult to reach it, the closer you get the more difficult it gets, as always,\" he said.Visit CNN Sport for more news and videos\"But now, for example, she's not thinking about it.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)The Vatican has ordered two of its own tombs to be searched -- the latest twist in the mysterious disappearance of a teenager, 36 years ago. Emanuela Orlandi was 15 when she vanished without a trace in the summer of 1983. The daughter of a prominent employee of the Institute for the Works of Religion -- better known as the Vatican Bank -- Orlandi was last seen at a music lesson in the grounds of Sant'Apollinare basilica in Rome. On Tuesday, Gian Piero Milano, the Vatican's Promoter of Justice, authorized two exhumations in response to a petition launched by the teenager's family, who believe that her body is buried at the Teutonic Cemetery in Vatican City. Remains at Vatican property probed for links to 35-year-old mysteryOrlandi's mother and brother still live inside the Vatican's walls and have continued to push for her case to be investigated throughout the years. The family's lawyer received an anonymous tip last summer suggesting that they should \"seek where the angel indicates,\" Italian news agency ANSA reported. The clue led the family to a wall in the Teutonic cemetery which features an angel pointing. The tombs will be opened on Thursday July 11, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti announced Tuesday. Read MoreGisotti described the case as \"a long and painful one\" but also appeared to try to temper expectations of a quick resolution, adding that any bones found during the search would have to undergo laborious DNA analysis. Demonstrators gather around Orlandi's brother Pietro, center, during a event marking the 30th anniversary of her disappearance in St Peter's Square in 2013. Gisotti said the operation would be a \"complex organization of personnel and machinery\" involving the Vatican Gendarmerie in addition to Vatican construction workers. He also said the Vatican probe would only handle the part concerning territory in the Holy See. Over the years, the wider investigation into Orlandi's disappearance has been handled by Italian authorities since she vanished in Italian territory. The Teutonic Cemetery is adjacent to Saint Peter's Basilica. It contains the remains of the Swiss Guards who died defending the Vatican City against forces of the new Kingdom of Italy in 1870. It is also the reserved burial ground for members of German-speaking religious institutions in Rome.The Orlandi case has enthralled Italians and sparked numerous conspiracy theories, which have pointed the finger at everyone from the Mafia to the Vatican itself.In 2012, a top Vatican exorcist, the Rev. Gabriele Amorth, told CNN he suspected the young girl had been abducted for sexual reasons, adding: \"The investigation should be carried out inside the Vatican and not outside.\" Bone fragments found during construction work at the Vatican Nunciature Embassy last year reignited speculation over Orlandi's disapperance. In 2005, an Italian detective received an anonymous tip off that Orlandi had been kidnapped by order of then-vicar of Rome, Cardinal Ugo Poletti, and that \"the secret to the mystery lies in a tomb in Sant'Apollinare basilica\" -- specifically the crypt that holds mob boss Enrico \"Renatino\" De Pedis.De Pedis was gunned down in Rome in 1990 and his body was moved to the basilica sometime before 1997.Missing girl's brother urges Vatican to open upIt was not the first time De Pedis' name had been linked to the Orlandi case. In 2008, his mistress alleged that De Pedis had been involved in the teen's kidnapping and that her body had been buried in the foundations of a property on the outskirts of Rome. Investigators followed up on the claims but found that the building's concrete foundations had been poured before the girl disappeared. De Pedis' tomb was searched in 2012 but provided no further developments. In 2018, human remains found at a Rome property owned by the Vatican sparked speculation that Orlandi might have finally been found. But DNA analysis on the bones determined they did not belong to the missing girl. CNN's Bianca Britton and Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.",

Donations flood in for migrant ship captain arrested for docking in Italy\"What do you have to do to go to jail in Italy? I am ashamed of those who allow the first thug from abroad to arrive in this country and disobey the laws and put the lives of the military at risk,\" Salvini said, promising to defend Italian borders and laws with renewed force.Under Salvini, Italy shuttered its ports to migrant rescue vessels in June 2018. And, earlier this month, it adopted a decree that could see ships docking without authorization face fines of up to $57,000. Italy's Interior Ministry said in a statement earlier this week that the Sea-Watch 3 would receive a fine between 20,000 and 50,000 euros ($23,000 and $57,000) and be confiscated.Salvini has also pledged to expel Rackete from Italy, saying on Facebook that she was a danger to national security. Rackete's decision to dock the Sea-Watch 3 meant the 40 migrants onboard, rescued off the coast of Libya weeks ago, were able to disembark. They will be redirected to five EU countries that have agreed to take them in, according to Italy's Foreign Ministry.\"It wasn't an act of violence, but only one of disobedience,\" Rackete told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in an interview published on Saturday. \"The situation was desperate ... my goal was only to bring exhausted and desperate people to shore.\"Sea-Watch 3 was one of the first migrant rescue vessels to test Italy's newest hardline migration laws.Rackete said she had decided to ignore the decree and head to port amid an increasingly desperate situation on board.\"I know what I'm risking,\" Rackete said at the time.",

        "content": "Lyon, France (CNN)For the ability to rise to the occasion, for the aptitude to turn a blind eye to pressure and produce on the grandest of stages, there is still no team quite like the US as the defending champion saw off a talented England team 2-1 to reach the Women's World Cup final.England's Ellen White had negated Christen Press's early opener, but on her 30th birthday, Alex Morgan headed home before the break to score what proved to be the winner.\n\n\n\n\nThough challenged by the world's finest teams in the knockouts, the USWNT remains firmly on its perch. But England will be kept awake at night by thoughts of what might have been: what if a White goal had not been ruled out for offside, what if captain Steph Houghton had not missed a penalty in the final 10 minutes.Though England must now come to terms with losing in a major semifinal for the third successive time, the US can celebrate reaching its third successive World Cup final, and it's goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher who will be remembered as the hero, thanks to a wonderful first-half save and for holding onto Houghton's spot kick. Becky Sauerbrunn, whose clumsy challenge on White led to the penalty, later revealed that such was her relief on seeing Naeher gather Houghton's effort, she told her goalkeeper that she loved her. Many of her compatriots will feel the same. Read More\"She shone tonight. She was the brightest,\" US coach Jill Ellis said after the match. \"I give her full credit. She's a tremendous person. People care about her; people have her back; people are starting to see glimpses of what I see every day in training.\"England was not quite at the US' level, and the frustration of missing opportunities to level was evident when Millie Bright was awarded a red card in the dying minutes.Unless the Netherlands or Sweden -- the second semifinal takes place Wednesday -- can achieve the unexpected in Sunday's final in the same stadium, the US will retain its title, accentuating the country's dominance of the women's game.READ: USWNT etiquette questioned by England coach READ: Sweden stuns Germany at Women's World Cup Alex Morgan celebrates her winning goal on her 30th birthday.Surprise substituteIt is rare for such an anticipated match to live up to its promise, but this semifinal between the No. 1 and No. 3 teams in the world certainly did. It was frantic, it was high-octane, and it was a magnificent advert for the game.At times, the atmosphere was wild. The majority of the 53,512 fans were rooting for the three-time winner, and it was the Americans, who have flown to France in huge numbers, who were celebrating at the end. For England's players, there were tears.\"We'll have to allow 24 to 48 hours for this to sink in, for them to get over the disappointed,\" England coach Phil Neville said, adding that his team's focus would eventually switch to Saturday's third-place playoff. \"No words that I can say to them [Tuesday] can make them feel better. Elite sport means that on Saturday, in Nice, we've got to go out there, and we've got to produce a performance.\"The announcement of the team hinted that this was going to be an exhilarating night. To the surprise of many, Megan Rapinoe, the match winner in both the last-16 and quarterfinal ties, started on the substitutes' bench. After much of the prematch talk centered on Lucy Bronze going head-to-head with Rapinoe, it was Press whom the England player -- dubbed the best in the world by Neville -- had to shackle.Though it was unexpected, Ellis later explained Rapinoe had a slight hamstring strain and that the forward was on the bench in case the match ended in a penalty shootout. \"There was an outside chance that Pinoe could take a penalty,\" Ellis said. Ellis also started with Lindsey Horan, the US' most imposing midfielder and the NWSL's 2018 player of the year but absent from the starting lineup in the two knockout matches. Again, the US' game plan worked, though in the closing stages, it had to hold on. England also made changes. First-choice goalkeeper Karen Bardsley did not feature because of a hamstring injury, so Carly Telford stepped in to make her second major international appearance. Arguably, Telford should have done better in stopping both headers, but it was a match in which both keepers made brilliant saves.Naeher, who has had to withstand much criticism this tournament, played her part, producing a stunning first-half save from a Keira Walsh thunderbolt and, of course, stopping Houghton's penalty, but in truth, it was a poor effort from England's defender.READ: Fighting for equality one world record at a timeREAD: Women's World Cup footballers capture their own storiesNo Rapinoe, no problemIn an entertaining first half, Rapinoe's replacement Press opened the scoring, heading home from a Tobin Heath cross. Rapinoe has been the focus of attention over the past few weeks, for her match-winning exploits and for agitating the US President, but those who have followed the US in this tournament will have been aware that it is Heath who has been the biggest threat down the flanks in France, and so she was once again in Lyon.While Heath has been piercing through defensive lines throughout this competition, England's White has been lethal in front of goal. With her first chance, the England striker struck from close range for her sixth goal in five games after a fine cross from Beth Mead.Ellen White, the joint top scorer at this World Cup, was in tears at the final whistle.The leveler had come during a period of US dominance, with Rose Lavelle in particular testing England's rookie goalkeeper with a number of shots from distance; one effort from the edge of the box in the 24th minute forced Telford into a brilliant reflex save.But with England gathering momentum after White's strike, Morgan gave her side the lead with a close-range header after Horan beautifully picked her out from a crowd. On her birthday, the striker celebrated by sipping from an imaginary cup of tea, a nod to the English's renowned fondness for the beverage.But in White, England has a special talent -- her manager has compared her to England men's greats Alan Shearer and Michael Owen -- and after a cute through ball from Jill Scott in the second half, she coolly placed an effort beyond Naeher.The striker posed with what is now her trademark celebration, but the referee called VAR into play, and though the margin was gossamer thin, replays did show that the striker was offside. Just. United States goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher is mobbed by teammates after her crucial penalty save.It will no doubt be a talking point, and some will almost certainly argue that the goal should have been awarded -- but England did have another fine opportunity to level, which it did not take advantage of.It was White in the mix once again. Falling inside the box after contact with Sauerbrunn, the striker earned her team a penalty after another VAR review. It was the slightest of touches from the US defender, but enough to bring White down when through on goal.Houghton stepped up, but she struck straight at the US goalkeeper.White was in tears during a BBC interview in the immediate aftermath of the match. Asked whether her team could have done any more to reach a first final, the lachrymose striker replied: \"Score.\"",

        "content": "Lyon, France (CNN)Days after seeing off France in a grueling encounter in Paris, the US faces another monster Women's World Cup fixture. All eyes now turn to Lyon, France's culinary capital and host city to a semifinal in which arguably the two best teams remaining in the competition scrap it out for a place in the final. A confident England awaits. \n\n\n\n\nIf the US is to successfully defends its title, it will certainly have done it the hard way because should the defending champion see off Phil Neville's team, it will have beaten the No 4. (France) and No.3 (England) ranked teams in the world in the knockout stages.   The USWNT has been the dominant force in the women's game since the first Women's World Cup in 1991 but England poses a real threat after ruthlessly dispatching Norway 3-0 in its quarterfinal. Neville's players are chasing history as well -- aiming to become the first senior England side since 1966 to reach a major football final. Like any match which induces feverish excitement days before kickoff, there are also plenty of subplots which make for a fascinating contest. Read MoreVisit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosEllis (left) and Neville were both in England and are Manchester United fans. Arrogance or excellent planning?\"It's not etiquette, really, is it?\" said England boss Neville in response to two US staff members being spotted at England's team hotel in Lyon. The build up to a big match isn't quite the same without a 'spygate' headline.US coach Jill Ellis told reporters that they were looking at the hotel as a potential base before Sunday's final in Lyon and played down suggestions that such preparedness hinted at arrogance. \"I think that's important, to do your job. So, in terms of arrogance, I think that's got nothing to do with us. That's planning and preparation for our staff, so I think that's pretty normal,\" she told reporters Sunday. Neville conceded that scouting the hotel would not give the US an \"unfair advantage\" in the semifinal. \"The only thing I would say is it's not something that I would want my team ops person doing. We're happy with our hotel. So, I hope they enjoyed the hotel,\" Neville said.Rapinoe vs. Bronze - A mouthwatering battleRapinoe's goal celebration against France was the focus of much attention on social media. Megan Rapinoe has dominated the headlines this last week. First a video of the US co-captain saying she wouldn't go to the White House should the US win the title went viral. Then US President Donald Trump responded to stoke the flames before Rapinoe became the match-winner Friday by scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over France. Rapinoe's brace meant the 33-year-old has been directly involved in 14 goals in her last 16 appearances at the Women's World Cup. \"Fantastic,\" was how Ellis described her forward's performance in that heavyweight battle. Hollywood star Zac Efron tweeted that he was going to dye his hair purple in homage to the winger. Indeed, after her scoring feat and arms-outstretched goal celebration against France, social media was awash with people voicing their admiration for Rapinoe.

In Tuesday's semifinal, Bronze, who plays for European champion Lyon, will likely to be tasked with marking Rapinoe. However, Neville suggested in his press conference Sunday that he may select Rachel Daly, who played at right back when England drew with the US in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. Is the England boss playing mind games? Perhaps. After all, he did play under Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, the master of mental manipulation. \"I do believe Lucy's the best player in the world. She's unique in almost everything she does,\" said Neville of his defender. \"If you look at the left-hand side of the USA and the right-hand side of England, I don't think you'll get a better left and right in women's football.\"READ: The match that changed women's footballEnglish born, American made Ellis moved from England to the United States in the 1980s.Ellis' accent, a curious mix of an American drawl and clipped English, hints that the 52-year-old did not spend her formative years in the US. It is the result of a childhood spent in Portsmouth, on England's south coast, and of nearly 40 years living in the US. She migrated in 1981 with her family to the Washington, D.C. area. Her father John is a former Royal Marine who used to work for the English Football Association. He set up a football academy after moving to the US and was assistant coach to the USWNT at the beginning of this century. Had her family not moved, Ellis has admitted her career path may have been very different. \"I truly think if I'd have stayed in England, I'm not sure I'd would be in coaching,\" she told reporters. \"At the time, it was not even a career path. It was a rare career path in the States, but it wasn't a career path [in England] for sure.\"Ellis has faced England before, five times since 2014, but never in a major tournament. Asked Friday how she felt about facing her home nation, she bristled: \"I've got US citizenship, brother.\"Having overseen 125 games, no one has coached more games for the USWNT than Ellis, and only Tony DiCicco has more national victories with 105. Ellis is unbeaten in 12 Women's World Cup games and the 2015 FIFA World Coach of the Year for Women's Football is aiming to become the first to win the World Cup twice. The coach who was made in America is two games away from history. The Man Utd great wanting to prove people wrong Thorough and organized, England's head coach is the sort of person who prepares for all eventualities. Ever since Neville was appointed in January 2018, the 42-year-old has been plotting England's path to World Cup glory. \"I've looked at how they prepare for games ... I've studied [Jil Ellis'] her press conferences and the way that she deals with the press and I've studied every single one of their players,\" Neville told CNN's Amanda Davies this week.\"You have to make sure you find out what their strengths and weaknesses are and you have to make sure you get there as quick as possible and it's took a while.\"With no previous experience in women's football or management, and despite initially not having applied for the job, Neville became the most high-profile England women's manager in history.JUST WATCHEDPhil Neville: WWC win better than '99 trebleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPhil Neville: WWC win better than '99 treble 03:18But it was a bumpy start for a man who, if rumor is to be believed, emerged as a candidate after a well-known broadcaster lightheartedly suggested him to FA bosses during a Christmas party. Within 24 hours of getting the job in January, the father of two was forced to make a public apology for Twitter comments made in 2012 which had prompted a sexism row. He weathered the storm. Speaking to CNN in December, the Englishman said one of his motivations was to \"prove people wrong that doubted me.\" He has silenced the naysayers by guiding England to the semifinals without much trouble. For a man whose playing career yielded 59 England caps and 10 major trophies with Manchester United, Neville's standards are unsurprisingly high. He has said that not reaching the final would be considered a failure. \"Nobody cares about the loser. We are going to go for it,\" said Neville. READ: World Cup stars capture their journeys to FranceBattle for the golden bootMorgan (left) and Rapinoe have both scored five times in France. It's a four-way tie at the top of the scoring charts, and three of the World Cup's leading scorers will be playing Tuesday. Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Ellen White have all netted five times in four games in this tournament. All of Morgan's goals came in the 13-0 thrashing of Thailand, while Rapinoe scored twice in back-to-back games to add to her goal against Thailand. England striker White has been consistently ruthless throughout. \"Ellen White is obviously coming into this next game really confident,\" Morgan told reporters Sunday. \"She has gained that starting spot and that's huge. We have to look at her because of the goals she is scoring.\"Can the US be beaten? England has never progressed beyond the semifinals, its best finish being third after beating Germany in the third-place playoff four years ago. The US is a three-time World Cup champion and has lost just once to England. In their only World Cup encounter in 2007, the US prevailed 3-0. But England's performances in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year, where England drew 2-2 with the US, will give Neville hope. England's players celebate reaching the semifinals. But the US' record at the World Cup is an intimidating one. The US has reached the finals four time in seven tournaments and in beating France the team tied the record of 10 successive World Cup victories. Indeed, the US has only lost once in 43 matches, a friendly defeat against France in January.Former World Cup winner Abby Wambach has described this US team as the greatest in the country's history. After the US beat Chile 3-0 in the group stage -- when coach Ellis made seven changes to the starting lineup -- defender Ali Krieger said the Americans had \"the best team in the world, and the second-best team in the world.\"But there is a chink in the US armor -- as Spain and France found by breaching its defense -- and a predator such as White will pounce on any lapses. Spain scored courtesy of the US defense being sloppy in possession near its own goal, while France halved the deficit from a set piece. England will have taken note and the US' defenders and goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher will no doubt be put under pressure. There is a sense that England needs to score first Tuesday because, as France found, attempting to catch the US once it has taken the lead is a formidable task. Around the hour mark against Les Bleues, the US retreated to a five-person defense and had the midfield dropping back to help. It was a conservative, but effective, approach. Former US goalkeeper Hope Solo has suggested England needs to change its pleasing-on-the-eye style and be more direct if it is to beat the US. Neville has ruled that out. \"The style is non-negotiable however far we go,\" he said.The mind games have started, the statistics are being mulled over. All the ingredients are there for a World Cup epic.",

        "content": "Birmingham, England (CNN)Two male penguins are struggling to have a baby. They sit on a rock for weeks, thinking it is an egg. A zookeeper, who feels sorry for them, gives them a real egg instead -- which hatches.\"And Tango Makes Three\" is a true story about male penguins who adopt an egg and raise a chick together at New York's Central Park Zoo. It is one of the many children's books about equality and diversity dotted around the classrooms in the red-bricked Anderton Park Primary School in the UK's second city Birmingham.The book, along with other titles including \"My Princess Boy\" and \"We Are Family,\" is part of a curriculum that teaches students between the ages of six and 11 about the human rights and characteristics legally protected from discrimination by the UK'S 2010 Equality Act. These cover race, religion, gender reassignment and sexual orientation. But the curriculum at Anderton Park and several other schools in Birmingham has sparked months of confrontations between teachers and mainly Muslim parents who believe it is inappropriate for primary schools to be teaching their kids about things like LGBTQ rights or same-sex relationships.Since March, angry demonstrators -- sometimes in their hundreds -- have gathered outside Anderton Park, where the majority of students are Muslim, to protest. Students have sometimes been pulled out of class for a day and teachers say they have been harassed at the school gates and online. The school's headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, said she has had sleepless nights over the protests.Read MoreThe protesters represent a blend of parents and concerned members of the community. Amir Ahmed became one of its leaders, despite not having a child at Anderton Park, because he said he was worried about what children in his community were being taught. He told CNN there was \"an agenda and a concerted effort to change the attitude and beliefs of children on sexuality away from our traditional values.\"  The school's headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, has been defiant in the face of the protests.\"There are many things that can be the glue that holds the math and English and history and geography music lessons together -- and in this school, it's our ethos of equality,\" she said of the importance of teaching about LGBTQ relationships. Referring to a sign brandished during one protest, she told CNN: \"If you say 'Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,' that is homophobic.\"Courage and sacrifice: 6 activists behind LGBTQ progressIn a \"frequently asked questions\" section posted on its website after the initial March protest, Anderton Park wrote: \"We are not promoting LGBT, just like we're not promoting being Christian, being black, being disabled or any other part of the Equality Act. We promote understanding about everyone. We are showing children that there are different kinds of people around us and we respect everyone, no matter what background you are from or they are from.\"By May, the hostilities had escalated to the point that the school had to close early for a mid-term break. Last month, a judge said, \"I find it likely the claimant (Birmingham City Council) will establish at trial some of the protesting has gone beyond lawful limits and strayed into harassing, alarming or distressing conduct, through its persistence, timing and context,\" the Press Association reported. The judge imposed a temporary exclusion zone around the school until a trial over whether the protests can be resumed outside the school takes place in July. But the debate has raged over what can be taught to children in the classroom -- and whether the beliefs of some minorities, who see homosexuality as morally wrong -- can supersede the need to teach basic human rights in a modern liberal democracy.Protests and misinformationThe protests at Anderton Park began after the nephew of Shakeel Afsar, 32, brought home a copy of \"My Princess Boy.\" \"We don't allow our children who are girls to believe they are boys, or boys to believe they are girls. We only believe in the two genders, which is male and female,\" Afsar, who is a property developer, said. Buoyed by the success of demonstrations he led against a program at another school, Ahmed decided to help Afsar and his sister Rosina -- the two other lead protesters outside Anderton Park. Ahmed denies being homophobic, and says the lessons are forcing parents to have uncomfortable conversations with their children about issues that contradict their religion. Outside the school, an Anderton Park parent who declined to provide her name said she supported the protests. \"Children should not be learning these things at such a young age,\" the woman told CNN. Misinformation has become a hallmark of the protests. Leaflets were passed out containing \"sexually explicit material\" that was falsely alleged to have been taught in the school, said local gay rights activist Khakan Qureshi, who has attempted to engage with the protesters.The injunction banned Amir Ahmed (2nd from right), one of the protest leaders, from entering the exclusion zone around the school.Hewitt-Clarkson debunked some of the leaflet's claims in a letter sent to parents in March. \"The leaflet states 'This programme promotes a whole-school gay ethos.' NO. This is not true. We do not have a programme and we never have,\" the letter said.\"The leaflet states 'It teaches boys it is OK to marry your best friend 'Abdul.'' NO. This is not true. The leaflet states 'It discriminates against beliefs of parents and children.' NO. This is not true.\" Amir Ahmed agreed that a \"gentleman\" had been sharing false information at one of the protests but denied supporting claims that Anderton Park was teaching the material outlined in the leaflet. The situation has taken its toll on parents and teachers alike. Hewitt-Clarkson told CNN that one of the protesters called her a pedophile while making a speech through a megaphone.\"Parents said to me, 'there are crazy people out there and what is there to stop them from throwing a brick through a window?'\" Hewitt-Clarkson said. \"How has this amount of hatred [come to] the pavements outside of my school [from] a few people seeking to drive wedges between the school, its parents and the community?\"She has found solace in the outpouring of support of the public. Behind her desk, a box is filled with cards from well-wishers, thanking her for making a stand.Teacher: \"There's nothing new here\" Hewitt-Clarkson stresses that only 0.5% of Anderton Park's annual timetable is dedicated to teaching about equality, which the school describes as \"breaking stereotypes\" and ensuring \"everyone is valued, feels safe, secure and happy.\" It is relayed through one lesson at the end of each term, she said, and books that go beyond the traditional tales of \"male heroes and female princesses.\" Classrooms have also been renamed after a diverse range of activists.\"There's nothing new here. It is about weaving it into everything you say and do, and having said that, that means we don't talk about it all the time, obviously -- when we are dividing fractions, we don't necessarily talk about males and females being equal,\" she said with a laugh. The protests in Birmingham are a microcosm of what could soon turn into a country-wide problem. In February, the government outlined new guidelines that will make relationship classes mandatory for state-funded primary schools (for children aged 5-11) in England, and sex and relationship classes compulsory at secondary level (ages 11-16) from September 2020.Zanele Muholi captures powerful portraits of South Africa's LGBTQ community \"We want the subjects to put in place the key building blocks of healthy, respectful relationships, focusing on family and friendships, in all contexts, including online,\" the government wrote in a set of draft guidelines.At the primary level, the guidance states that students will be taught about all different types of families, including \"single parent families, LGBT parents, families headed by grandparents\" and adoptive parents. While schools are \"free to determine\" what their new policy will look like, \"students' religious background\" should be taken into account, and schools should decide when it would be age-appropriate to teach \"their pupils about LGBT(Q).\" A \"frequently asked questions\" document, also published by the government, added that there was no specific requirement to cover LGBTQ content at primary schools. Teachers believe the act is ambiguous, leaving them with the responsibility of deciding whether the religious makeup of their students supersedes other protected characteristics of the Equality Act. The issue has also saddled them with the responsibility of figuring out what is age-appropriate, Colin Diamond, professor of educational leadership at the University of Birmingham, told CNN.\"It's a recipe for chaos, because the government has left loopholes in the regulations to allow children to be withdrawn in certain situations... they're exposing all the headteachers, particularly in primary schools, in England, to potentially a lot of protests and a lot of wasted time and energy,\" he added. The school's headmistress has been holding workshops to demystify equalities teaching to parents.Other faith groups watch from the sidelinesWhile government policy is in step with most of the more socially liberal British public, the lack of clarity has created \"a policy vacuum that will be exploited\" by socially conservative groups, Diamond added. \"It is a great shame because the intention of the policy is good.\"Other faith groups have been watching from the sidelines. The conservative evangelical lobby group Christian Concern, which has been criticized for its anti-LGBTQ and anti-abortion agenda, said while \"not directly involved in the Birmingham protests\" it considers the upcoming legislation \"Orwellian.\"  Roger Kiska, who works at the Christian Legal Centre, which is linked to Christian Concern, said he was actively looking \"for any legal challenges, because we feel that the provisional opt-out for sex education is not in accordance with the government's obligations under the Human Rights Act.\"The push for more parental control over school lessons has found some official support from lawmakers. Elaina Cohen, parliamentary adviser to Khalid Mahmood, the Member of Parliament for Birmingham Perry Barr, told CNN that she would write to the education select committee asking them to scrutinize how the policy will be rolled out and developed.\"The only discrimination in the classroom at the moment is against parents of faith, who said that their children are being force-fed something contrary to their faith,\" Cohen said.Education minister Nick Gibb said he would press ahead with the new statutory instrument. telling the Press Association that it was \"unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus.\" Africa is doing better on LGBTQ rights than you thinkBoris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, told the Birmingham Mail that he backed the Anderton Park teachers.Jess Philips, another MP for Birmingham, confronted protesters outside the school in May. In a heated exchange with Shakeel Afsar filmed by the BBC, she told him that the demonstrations were \"damaging the reputation of a peaceful and loving community that I have lived in my entire life.\"While the most recent temporary injunction against protests at Anderton Park has cut them down in size, Ahmed said he would fight for it to be lifted during a court hearing at the end of July.Even if that fails, he said momentum to \"fight for parents' rights\" has spread to other cities. He says he has been in touch with Muslim parents in Manchester, Bradford, and London who are eager to challenge the new guidelines.Hewitt-Clarkson believes more conversations will bridge the divide. Through workshops and meetings, she says she has been working to defuse the concerns of some parents at her school.When asked why she is refusing to back down, Hewitt-Clarkson pointed to a quote she has pasted on the wall of her poster-strewn office.\"Help your children become human. Your efforts must never produce learned monsters, skilled psychopaths or educated Eichmanns. Reading, writing, and arithmetic are important only if they serve to make our children more human,\" the quote reads, which is an excerpt from a letter from a Nazi concentration camp survivor.\"It's as lawful to be straight as it is to be gay. It's as lawful to have a mommy and a daddy as it is to have a mommy and mommy,\" Hewitt-Clarkson said. \"Schools cannot be part of any implied or tacit discrimination.\"",

Lyman Bostock, a 27-year-old outfielder who was finishing his fourth MLB season was fatally shot in September 1978, according to MLB.com. The killing was ruled a case of mistaken identity.According to the league's website, Bostock was considered a \"developing player with speed,\" and was batting .296 when he died.

A high-ranking northern Cypriot official told CNN that the object crashed on a mountainside near the village of Tashkent -- less than 15 (24km) miles north of the capital Nicosia -- after midnight local time on Monday. No one was hurt, the official said.\"The first assessment is that a Russian-made missile, which was part of the air defense system that was activated last night in the face of an airstrike against Syria, missed the target and completed its range and fell into our country,\" Turkish Cypriot Foreign Minister Kudret Ozersay said on Facebook on Monday.Syrian air defenses intercepted \"hostile missiles\" launched by Israeli warplanes targeting military positions in Homs and the Damascus outskirts, the Syrian Defense Ministry said on Twitter on Monday.The Israel Defense Forces are yet to comment on the incident, per their normal policy, but Israel is known to have attacked military positions in Syria on several occasions over recent months.Read MoreCNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment, but has not yet received a response.

Ozersay, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said in another Facebook post that the missile was thought to be a Russian-made S-200, similar to one that fell in Turkey last year. Due to a lack of craters on the ground, it is believed to have exploded in the air, he added. The official who spoke to CNN said a team of experts from the northern Cypriot and Turkish militaries were examining the object. \"The government there is in touch with the countries that are involved,\" the official added.Cyprus exists as a divided territory, and only Turkey recognizes the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- the northern part of the island -- as legitimate. After the former British colony became independent in 1960, tensions began to rise between the Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority. In 1974, Greek soldiers launched an attempted coup against Cyprus' then-president, Makarios III. Turkey joined the attempt to overthrow the archbishop-turned-politician, eventually taking control of more than a third of the island, declaring it a separate Turkish Cypriot state.The division persists to this day, with a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone cutting across the island, splitting the Turkish Cypriot north from the Greek Cypriot south. Efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure.CNN's Dimitris Sideridis contributed to this report.",

Football teams and coaches are usually highly sensitive to opposition sides potentially learning anything about their preparations for key games. In January, Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa was criticized after he admitted to sending a \"spy\" to watch Derby County at its training ground ahead of a key game.\"The only thing I would say is it's not something I would want my team ops person doing,\" Neville told reporters on Sunday. \"It's not something that England would do. \"It's not an unfair advantage.

That's probably who the two people were. It's important to do your job.\"The USA defeated France 2-1 last week to continue its run of reaching at least the semifinals at every World Cup.

From the revered crucible of Centre Court and the all-white clothing of the players, to the overnight camping and famous queue for daily tickets, and the elegance of polished notables in the royal box, the atmosphere is quintessentially British.Despite its heritage, Wimbledon has always been at the forefront of innovation and this year organizers unveiled a new sliding roof on No.1 Court, a $89 million bid to counter the vagaries of the British weather. Centre Court received a roof in 2009.Read MorePrize money, too, has kept up with the times. Winners of the singles titles will pocket $2.98 million each, while a first-round loser will earn $57,000. The total prize fund has increased 11% to $48 million.Nearly 500,000 people will visit the grounds over the two weeks of the championships, consuming about 76,000 ice creams, 22,000 bottles of champagne, 303,000 glasses of Pimm's and 166,000 portions of fresh English strawberries, according to the Wimbledon website.

The Swiss master craftsman has pushed his total of singles titles to 102 with three victories this season, second only to Jimmy Connors (109) on the all-time list.Fan favorite Federer may not have many Wimbledons left in his career, but he comes in off the back of a 10th grass court title in Halle, Germany. \"Every time I've won in Halle, I went on to play really well at Wimbledon,\" the world No.3 told reporters. \"It's never a guarantee of course, but I've been on the Tour for long enough to know what it means.

Well, it involves Bernie Madoff, of all people. In 1999, the New York Mets wanted to get rid of Bonilla, but still owed him almost $6 million on his contract. Instead of paying him outright, Bonilla's agent Dennis Gilbert negotiated with the team to defer payments until 2011, with an 8% annual interest rate. When you calculate it all out, you get that nice, generous $29.8 million sum. Read MoreThat seems like kind of a terrible deal for a team to pay almost five times the original amount of the contract, but here's the thing. One of the owners of the Mets, Fred Wilpon, was involved in Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme and believed he was getting huge returms from his investments that would far outweigh the eventual deferred cost of Bonilla's contract. Obviously, we all know how the Madoff scheme turned out, so unfortunately for the Mets, they never saw that return.Bobby Bonilla, however, will see another $1.2 million in his account today. Cheers. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated Bobby Bonilla's last year in the MLB was 1999. He last played for the Mets in 1999. His last year in the MLB was 2001, with the St. Louis Cardinals.",

He moved up to third after his second-place showing in Cascais last week and is now second behind Devos, only seven points adrift. He finished 25th on F One USA. In the Global Champions Tour team event, Maher's London Knights slipped to third following a second to last finish. Shanghai Swans overtook the Knights and so did Madrid in Motion, with a mere four points separating the trio at the top. It was the Scandinavian Vikings who collected a first-ever GCL victory -- withstanding the pressure of having to ride last among the 15 teams -- ahead of the Monaco Aces and Doha Falcons. The next leg takes place in Paris next weekend.",

        "content": "Leipzig, Germany  (CNN)It's a humid August afternoon and J\u00f6rg K\u00fchne gazes across a public square where children squeal and splash in an ankle-deep fountain.All around him people go about their business: a farmers' market is in full swing, a tram trundles past, cyclists weave between meandering tourists.\"It wasn't like this,\" K\u00fchne says, squinting against the summer glare. \"It was like the black and white photos. It was dark.\"Thirty years ago, this sprawling concrete square in the former East German city of Leipzig was the epicenter of freedom demonstrations that swept the country and brought down the Berlin Wall.Grainy images of 70,000 protesters in Leipzig carrying candles and chanting \"Wir sind das Volk\" -- \"We are the people!\" -- were beamed across the world on October 9, 1989. The rally was a turning point in the fall of the Iron Curtain a month later.          Read MoreK\u00fchne was one of the demonstrators who, in his words, \"longed for a free and united country.\" Then a 21-year-old locksmith working at the state railway company, he said the uprising in his hometown was \"the greatest thing I've ever experienced.\"Today he is again drawing inspiration from Germany's peaceful revolution -- this time, as a member of the country's far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party.K\u00fchne is a candidate in the upcoming Saxony state election on September 1, where the AfD is tipped to come in at second place, behind Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.Now the AfD is repackaging the 1989 Leipzig demonstrations for its 2019 political campaign -- resurrecting the same slogans, images and revolutionary rhetoric.From billboards showing historic photographs of the protest, to posters emblazoned with the famous slogan: \"We are the people!\" the AfD is urging voters in the east to rise up, much as they did against communism three decades ago.Saxony AfD candidate, J\u00f6rg K\u00fchne, sits in the square where 30 years ago he joined freedom demonstrations.Back then, protesters wanted to tear down the wall dividing their country. The east was eager to embrace western democracy and its promise of free elections, travel and a functioning economy. Fast forward to 2019 and the AfD is pledging to barricade the nation against Europe's open borders, playing on fears around migrants and world markets. This nationalist message has struck a chord in Saxony, and other states in former East Germany, where support for the AfD is the strongest in the country.My grandfather would 'turn in his grave'Today a man in his 50s and quick to make jokes about his weight, K\u00fchne paints a picture of similiar activists-turned-AfD supporters who have been sidelined for too long.\"We were not asked\" about replacing Germany's national currency with the euro, or Merkel's so-called open-door policy on refugees, he said. \"But we are the people. And of course my party still uses this wonderful slogan from the peaceful revolution today.\"A roadside AfD poster in eastern Germany with the famous 1989 slogan: \"We are the People!\"Indeed drive along the highway between Berlin and Leipzig and you'll see dozens of AfD billboards declaring \"We are the people!\" and referring to the protest date in 1989.Another billboard says \"The East is standing up!\" and in smaller print, \"Change 2.0.\"The posters imply that \"if voters opt for the AfD, they can finish the work of those who led the peaceful revolution,\" said Kristina Spohr, a historian and the author of \"Post Wall, Post Square: Rebuilding the World after 1989.\"\"This is an abuse of history,\" she added. \"What the AfD wants -- a nationalist, inward-looking Germany -- has nothing to do with what the people wanted in 1989.\"The AfD's rebrand hasn't gone down well with everyone in Leipzig, a city that has a reputation as a liberal stronghold in conservative Saxony. Martin Neuhof's grandfather was a photojournalist during the 1989 demonstrations. His picture showing thousands of people flooding what was then Karl-Marx-Platz was used in AfD billboards during local elections in May.Splashed across the photo were the words \"Change for Leipzig,\" and the AfD logo. \"If my grandfather knew about it, it would make him turn in his grave,\" said Neuhof of Friedrich Gahlbeck, who passed away 20 years ago.An AfD billboard with a photo of the 1989 Leipzig protests taken by Martin Neuhof's grandfather.The AfD is \"instrumentalizing the peaceful revolution in Leipzig,\" said Neuhof, who as a child spent hours developing photos in the darkroom alongside his grandfather, who worked for the East German state news agency.It inspired Neuhof's own career as a photographer in Leipzig, where he runs the anti-racism photo project \"Herzkampf\" -- meaning fighting from the heart -- featuring portraits of local activists. Neuhof's family is now in a legal battle with the AfD over its use of the historic photo. K\u00fchne says proceedings are \"ongoing\" but he thought it was a \"wonderful idea\" to use the photo in the political campaign.It certainly didn't hurt his own campaign -- K\u00fchne was elected one of Leipzig's city councillors. And is now one of 11 AfD members in the left-leaning council.'They thought everybody would be driving a Mercedes' Reminders of the revolution are everywhere here. A giant mural painted on the wall of Leipzig's Marriott Hotel depicts the 1989 protest in brilliant rainbow colors.Gisela Kallenbach is a retired Green politician who also took to the streets three decades ago. She points to the cartoon characters featured on the mural and echoes K\u00fchne's words -- \"It wasn't like this. It was dark.\"Protesters were engulfed in air \"choked with smoke\" from nearby lignite factories, remembers Kallenbach who was then a 47-year-old chemical engineer and mother-of-three.Retired Greens MEP, Gisela Kallenbach, poses in front of a mural depicting the 1989 protests.When the Berlin Wall finally did come crashing down, so did a lot of East German aspirations. Some had \"illusions that everybody would be driving a Mercedes,\" Kallenbach said.The rallying cry of \"We are the people!\" was replaced with \"We are one people!\" but the reality didn't quite meet expectations, Spohr, the historian, said. Very quickly, feelings of freedom gave way to feeling like second-class citizens. \"Basically the West German political system [was] applied to all of Germany,\" she said.  \"Everything that was tied to an East German identity was basically binned,\" Spohr said.By 1991, Spohr said the country was seeing a rise in far-right parties.Saxony and the neighboring eastern German states of Brandenburg (which also heads to the polls on Sunday) and Thuringia are fertile ground for the AfD. These are working class regions, hit by the closure of their coal industries, and still lagging behind the west in employment and salaries.     While the AfD took 12.6% of the vote nationally during the 2017 general election, it was double this in Saxony, where it had 25.4%. It is now the largest opposition party in Germany's parliament.Look further right, and you'll find other movements recycling the slogans of 1989. The anti-Islam group Pegida chanted \"We are the people!\" during demonstrations in neighboring Dresden in 2015, and held rallies against Muslims every Monday night -- a twisted version of the Monday peace prayers in Leipzig all those years ago. The slogan was resurrected by protesters during violent demonstrations against refugees in the city of Chemnitz, also in Saxony, last year that made headlines around the world.'People forget what they have gained'The AfD, like many populist parties surging in Europe, has directed much of its fury at the European Union.Kallenbach, who was a member of the European Parliament for years, was quick to defend the EU, though she admitted that German leaders made \"mistakes\" in the reunification process.\"I think people forget what they have gained in the last 30 years ... a free, democratic state,\" said Kallenbach, today in her 70s with a shock of brilliant red hair, chunky earrings dangling in agreement.Life in East Germany was drenched in fear and intimidation. Kallenbach has no photos of herself at the momentous demonstrations, because she was so terrified of being targeted by the Stasi. The shadow of Tiananmen Square loomed large, and she was painfully aware of the tanks lining Leipzig's streets.The Berlin Wall comes tumbling down in November 1989. East Germans of all ages were asking for \"basic human rights,\" she recalled -- things like freedom of speech, media and travel, that had been squashed following World War II.Now Kallenbach is determined to ensure the AfD doesn't turn back the clock on those hard-won freedoms, jumping on her bicycle to hand out anti-far right flyers in the state election.The shocking pollution in East Germany was one of the reasons Kallenbach hit the streets all those years ago. Today it is the AfD \"poisoning the atmosphere in our society,\" she said.\"Listen to the statements of their leaders. They are ... racist, nationalistic. They provide an atmosphere you can almost compare to the 1930s,\" she said in reference to Nazi Germany. \"I don't want to live in a country where this rhetoric is the common language.\" K\u00fchne from the AfD dismissed the comparison with a dark time in German history, adding \"I completely reject the catchword 'racism.'\"\"People can protest against the AfD,\" he said. But they \"should not attack us -- physically or verbally. We are open to a critical dialogue.\"'We will see who the people are'When fellow 1989 demonstrator Christoph Wonneberger nimbly alights from his bicycle, it's something of a shock to learn he's 75.The former pastor looks up at Leipzig's looming St. Nicholas Church, where he helped organized Monday peace prayers that morphed into the biggest protest movement the East had ever seen.From the early-1980s, each week people would gather at the grand church to discuss causes close to their hearts. As the threat of nuclear war increased, so did the number of patrons. Retired pastor Christophe Wonneberger outside St. Nicholas Church, where the weekly demonstrations began.By October 1989, more than 2,000 people were packing into the church, with thousands more spilling out into the streets.The demonstrators were determined not to act aggressively, not to give the police any reason to crack down. Wonneberger believes this non-violent approach -- along with their massive numbers -- was the secret to their success.He recalled how \"We are the people!\" actually came about. During one march, there was a confrontation with police where one of the streets was blocked off. \"The police shouted through the loudspeaker, 'We are the police!' And the protesters replied: 'We are the people!'\"\"Let's wait and see at the next election who 'the people' really are,\" said Wonneberger.",

        "content": "Uxbridge, United Kingdom  (CNN)It's a sweltering Sunday in late August and Ali Milani, dressed in a navy suit and clutching a wad of flyers, dabs at the beads of sweat gathering on his brow. The 25-year-old walks up the driveway of a redbrick house, on the outermost fringes of west London, and knocks. And waits. And rearranges his collar. No answer. \"The problem with a sunny day like this,\" he says with a tight smile, \"is that everyone is out.\"Undeterred, Milani carries on his mission. Which is convincing voters in this Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency to vote for him and boot out their current Member of Parliament -- who also happens to be Boris Johnson. If Milani pulls it off, it would be one of the biggest earthquakes in British political history.Read MoreNever before has a sitting prime minister lost their seat in a general election. And while Johnson is yet to call an election -- though speculation is rife there will be one before the year is out -- Milani is wasting no time hitting the streets in his bid to oust the prime minister.\"Can you imagine,\" he said wistfully, \"that moment when we stand on stage and the returning officer reads out the result ... a 25-year-old local resident has unseated the prime minister for the first time in history.\"It's not as far-fetched as it sounds. What was traditionally a safe Conservative seat has in recent years shifted to marginal. In the last election in 2017, Johnson's majority more than halved, to just over 5,000 votes. The constituency was created in 2010, due to boundary changes, and has been Conservative ever since. Now it is classed as \"vulnerable,\" according to the conservative think tank Onward, which took into account the growing number of younger voters in the area. Among them is this young Labour candidate and comic book fan whose favorite character is Superman. Shoppers mill around Uxbridge town center.The Anti-BorisWhat appeals to Milani most about his beloved comic book collection is \"the classic good versus evil story.\" It's a narrative he comes back to often.Milani lumps Boris in the same basket as US President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who he says represent a \"brazen, right-wing, nasty style of politics.\" Meanwhile, he sees himself as part of a \"wave of young progressive thinkers around the world.\"He compared Johnson's privileged upbringing and Eton schooling with his own childhood growing up on a social housing estate and a single mother who \"struggled to pay the electricity bill.\"\"I wasn't chiselled from birth to be an MP or prime minister,\" said the political newcomer who was born into a Muslim family in Iran and moved to the UK aged five.      Until he was selected as the Labour candidate in July, Milani was vice-president of the National Union of Students. And it was as a student at Brunel University in 2015 that he first encountered Johnson during a local hustings -- engaging in a lively \"back and forth\" over the merit of ballot boxes on campus. He said if he met Johnson again, he'd \"love to show him around Uxbridge.\" Towards the end of Johnson's stint as London mayor, the celebrity politician was \"parachuted in,\" as Milani describes it, to the safe Conservative seat and elected MP in 2015.The seat had a secure Conservative majority, and was as good a place as any for Johnson to make his return to Parliament.But \"he's never lived here,\" said Milani, gesturing at the neat suburban streets. \"If you dropped him at the end of the road he wouldn't be able to find his way home.\"      \"I grew up here -- I use the same hospitals as the people here, I studied in the same schools as people here,\" Milani said. \"And I think people deserve leaders who understand what it's like to live like us.\"He points to the local issue of plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, a stone's throw from this part of London. \"We have some of the worst air (quality) in London,\" says Milani. \"So when I say Boris is not from here, I mean he literally doesn't breathe the same air we breathe.\"CNN contacted Johnson's office for comment, but had not received a response at time of publishing.Brazenly offensive commentsIn Uxbridge town center, Milani greeted the owner of a bustling Greek caf\u00e9 with the familiarity of an old friend. Taking a seat among other customers, he condemned what he described as Johnson's \"brazenly offensive comments\" -- such as likening Muslim women wearing veils to letter boxes -- and said they were a \"shame\" on this \"multicultural\" community.That said, Milani's track record on offensive comments isn't exactly squeaky clean.A row of broken phone boxes in Uxbrdge's main shopping strip.In 2012 he wrote several antisemitic tweets, including one in response to a thread that said: \"Nah u won't mate. It'll cost you a pound #jew.\" Another tweet said \"Israel has no right to exist\" and \"oppression is something your people should know about.\" Milani has publicly apologized for those comments, which he says he made as a teenager. He was quick to add that \"doesn't make them right.\" He said he had since \"taken serious steps to gain people's trust,\" like visiting Auschwitz, reaching out to the Jewish community, and doing \"anti-Semitism training.\"The comments come as the Labour party -- and its leader Jeremy Corbyn -- has been dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism, something it officially denies. Shift to the left?For the local residents milling around Uxbridge's main shopping center, the biggest question mark hanging over Milani is, well, who is he?No one had heard of the Labour candidate gunning to unseat Johnson. But there was a mixed bag of Conservative and Labour support. One of them, 71-year-old Peter Hatcher, said he would continue voting for Johnson because he wants him \"to do what he says he's going to do\" -- namely, deliver Brexit.Hatcher, like the majority of people in this constituency, voted to exit the EU in the 2016 referendum. Johnson was a key figure in the Leave campaign and experts say his chances of winning the next election will largely be down to whether he can deliver before the October 31 deadline.Boris Johnson reacts after winning the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in 2015. Like many London boroughs, Uxbridge and South Ruislip has \"gradually been shifting to the left\" over the last 20 years -- though \"more slowly\" than others -- said Professor Tony Travers, director of the Institute of Public Affairs at the London School of Economics.A lot will come down to timing -- whether an election is called before or after Brexit, added Travers.He said the \"best backdrop\" for Johnson at the next election -- and likewise the worst for Milani -- would be if \"Brexit has happened and it hasn't proved a total disaster.\"It would allow Johnson to say he delivered on his promise, said Travers.Come Brexit or blazing sunshine, Milani is giving it his all.Cris Moisescu and Bianca Britton contributed to this report",

        "content": "London (CNN)A former British Prime Minister has joined a legal effort to prevent the current leader from suspending the UK Parliament in the runup to Brexit, an extraordinary development in a battle that has already turned precedent on its head.John Major, who was Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, announced that he intends to join the legal action brought by anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who wants to stop his successor Boris Johnson from closing down Parliament for five weeks.Major said he was keen to provide assistance to the court from the perspective of a former prime minister. The move was all the more striking, given that Major and Johnson are members of the same political party.Johnson is accused of suspending Parliament in order to limit the time for his opponents to legislate against a no-deal Brexit. The Prime Minister insists the suspension is constitutional, as it provides for a new session of Parliament to begin, with a new legislative agenda.John Major is joining the legal challenge. In a TV interview on Friday, Johnson warned his opponents that EU leaders would be less likely to offer him the deal he seeks on Brexit if they believed that lawmakers would remove the threat of Britain leaving without a deal. Read More\"If they think Brexit can be blocked anyway, they are not going to give us the deal we need. So my anxiety is that stuff going on in Parliament can actually undermine the UK's negotiating position,\" Johnson told Sky News.Major's announcement came on a day when opposition to Johnson's plan was crystalizing. A Scottish judge brought forward a full hearing in a case brought by more than 70 anti-Brexit lawmakers to next Tuesday. While he declined their demand for an immediate court order blocking the suspension of Parliament, Lord Doherty said it was in the interests of justice that the case be heard swiftly.In a separate case brought in Northern Ireland, the chief justice said a hearing would also be held on Tuesday. The high court in London said a hearing in the Miller-Major case would take place on Thursday. The suspension of Parliament is due to begin on September 9.Boris Johnson faces Brexit challenges as he steps up talks with EUParliamentary efforts to block the move will be unveiled when lawmakers from their summer recess on Tuesday.Before then, widespread public protests are expected. The left-wing campaign group Momentum has called on people to block roads and bridges in 10 major UK cities at the weekend.\"This is an establishment coup by a tiny, privileged elite who have been eroding our democracy for decades,\" Momentum's National Coordinator, Laura Parker said in a statement. \"Real power doesn't sit with the Queen or in Parliament. It's with us, the people -- and that's why we need to take action.\"\"We're expecting tens of thousands of us people to come against Johnson closing the doors on democracy. Our message to Johnson is this: If you steal our democracy, we'll shut down the streets,\" she added.The last time a UK Prime Minister was accused of suspending Parliament in for his own political interests was Major himself in 1997.Then, Parliament was shut for just under three weeks before it was formally dissolved ahead of the 1997 general election. Opposition parties at that time criticized the decision because it meant that the publication of a report into alleged \"cash for access\" could not be discussed in Parliament. Commentators do not give any of the current legal moves much chance of success. But the legal team behind the Miller-Major action scored a landmark victory at the UK's Supreme Court in 2016, when judges ruled that the official Brexit process could not be triggered without the approval of Parliament.Richard Greene contributed to this article.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson's surprise decision to suspend the British parliament in the runup to the next Brexit deadline appears to have had its desired effect. Opponents of the British Prime Minister's tactics were left scrambling on Thursday for a response to the move, which limited their options to prevent Britain leaving the European Union without a deal on October 31 if Johnson were determined to pursue that route.Opposition leaders released a joint statement via Twitter on Thursday night, announcing they will work together to stop Johnson's \"smash and grab on democracy.\"The joint statement from the Labour Party, the Scottish National Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, The Independent Group for Change and The Green Party demanded that Johnson reverse his decision to suspend parliament, or \"allow MPs to vote on whether there should be one.\"A joint statement from @UKLabour, @theSNP, @LibDems, @PlaidCymru, @ForChangeNow and @TheGreenParty as we work together to stop Boris Johnson's smash and grab on democracy: pic.twitter.com/e8fd2uSstS\u2014 Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) August 29, 2019 Earlier, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said he would support efforts to \"legislate rapidly\" against a no-deal Brexit in the limited timeframe available.Read More\"What we're going to do is try to politically stop him, on Tuesday, with a parliamentary process in order to legislate and prevent a no deal Brexit and also to try and prevent him shutting down parliament during this utterly crucial period,\" Corbyn told Sky News.The Queen on Wednesday approved the Prime Minister's request to prorogue Parliament in order to restart the political calendar -- usually a routine annual event. But the timing has been criticized because it limits opportunities for MPs to legislate against a potential no-deal Brexit.Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament over Brexit met with a backlashJacob Rees-Mogg, Leader of the House of Commons, argued the suspension was \"completely constitutional and proper.\"  Parliament will reconvene for a Queen's Speech -- which sets out the government's legislative program for the new session -- on October 14, around a week later than they would likely have returned from a separate recess for party conferences.Amid the fallout on a hectic day in Westminster, Johnson lost an important figure from his party. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, announced she was resigning on Thursday -- citing both a desire to spend more time with her family and a \"conflict\" she has felt over Brexit.Davidson, who has been an outspoken critic of a no-deal Brexit, urged Johnson in her announcement to \"get us a deal with the European Union\" and told MPs who three times voted down Theresa May's agreement: \"For God's sake, get behind it.\"The outgoing leader had revived the party's fortunes in Scotland, touring the country with charismatic flair and energy. There is no obvious successor, and her departure imperils the party's standing in a nation where the party has traditionally struggled, and where voters backed remaining in the European Union in 2016.In her resignation speech in Edinburgh, Davidson  said the Prime Minister had \"categorically assured me\" he was trying to secure a deal with the EU after she \"asked him outright\" at a meeting last week.Minutes earlier, another senior Conservative, George Young, resigned from the front bench in the House of Lords in protest at Johnson's suspension of Parliament.In his resignation letter, seen by CNN, he said Johnson's decision risked \"undermining\" the role of Parliament at a \"critical time\" in the country's history. \"I am very unhappy at the timing and length of the prorogation, and its motivation,\" Young added.Ruth Davidson announces her resignation in a press conference on Thursday.Challenges to Johnson's decision were also filed in separate courts by a cross-party group of 70 MPs and peers and the prominent anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller. Miller, who orchestrated the successful campaign to ensure a parliamentary vote on any Brexit deal, told the BBC Johnson was \"hijacking the Queen's prerogative power.\" And a petition calling for Johnson to reverse the decision surpassed 1.4 million signatures just hours after it was launched.While it is common for governments to suspend Parliament in the run-up to a Queen's Speech, critics have been irked by the timing of Johnson's move. It leaves MPs just a handful of days' worth of debate before the October 31 Brexit deadline.Johnson rebutted on Wednesday that lawmakers would have \"ample time\" to discuss Brexit before the deadline, which he has repeatedly pledged to stick to, \"do or die.\"Meanwhile, Dutch Foreign Minister Stephen Blok said on Thursday that \"serious talks\" on Brexit had taken place in Brussels this week, but warned the two sides \"are not there yet\" on a deal.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Nine days after he resigned when Italy's government collapsed, Giuseppe Conte has returned as Prime Minister to form a new one that will exclude hardline leader Matteo Salvini from power. Italy's president re-appointed Conte to the role on Thursday, as the political crisis plaguing the country in recent weeks began to subside. Conte will lead a new government comprised of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the center-left opposition Democratic Party (PD). The rival parties agreed Wednesday to form a coalition to prevent snap elections that would likely have been won by Salvini's far-right League party.Conte accepted the role with reservation, saying Thursday that he would immediately start working with all parliamentary groups, and that Italy must return to being an advocate for Europe and \"a country which is open to everyone.\"\"This is a moment for courage and determination -- a determination which will not be dogged by obstacles,\" he said.Read MoreThe previous coalition between M5S and the League Party fell apart last week after months of infighting over key policies. Hoping to seize on his rise in popularity, Salvini pushed for a no-confidence vote on Conte, but the plan backfired after he was excluded from the new government. Italian parties strike deal for new government in blow to SalviniIn a bitter, live address on Facebook Thursday, Salvini hit back at Conte's re-appointment and called the formation of the new coalition \"a real theft of democracy\" that doesn't represent the Italian people. He then called on his supporters to mobilize throughout the country in September and to come together in a massive rally on October 19 in Rome.  \"Rest assured you won't get rid of me,\" Salvini said. \"I don't give up easily.\"On Wednesday, Salvini told reporters that the \"only thing that unites them (M5S and PD) is their hatred of the League\" and that the \"the truth is that 60 million Italians are being held hostage by 100 parliamentarians who are dead scared of losing their seats.\"'A new humanism'Salvini and his euroskeptic, anti-immigrant, xenophobic right-wing League party -- who were once seen as a fringe movement --  had seen a massive boost in popularity across the country since last year's parliamentary elections.But for many who had feared Italy was walking down a dangerous path, his fall from parliamentary power this week will be hailed as a victory. Salvini had run on a promised to expel half a million illegal immigrants from Italy. During his time as the interior minister, the firebrand populist only amped up that rhetoric, often slugging at migrant and minority communities with incendiary remarks, such as implying that the country's low birth rate -- which is tied to the country's sluggish economy-- was being used as an excuse to \"import immigrants.\" He also spearheaded a series of anit-migrant policies, including shuttering Italy's ports to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean. Salvini's push for new elections ultimately backfired. The Five Star movement is also an anti-globalization, anti-free trade party which had gained ground with an electorate fed up with Italy's economic decline and its mainstream politicians. Their policies include a push for more environmental protections, public transport, free access to water sustainable development and the right to internet access.The center-left Democratic Party, who had suffered a blow to its leadership in the 2018 elections following the populist parties' gains, will now work together with anti-establishment M5S.On Wednesday, those party's leaders told Italy's President Sergio Mattarella that Conte should lead the new government once again.Speaking on Thursday, Conte spoke optimistically about the future. He said that while he has often made public addresses that referenced the term \"a new humanism,\" he \"never thought this could be a slogan for government -- I have always thought of it as the ideal vision for the entire country.\"Nicola Zingaretti, the PD's leader, said Wednesday that the coalition marked a \"real turning point\" for Italy, and stressed that it was \"not just a handover of power.\"\"We love Italy and we believe that it is worth trying this experiment,\" Zingaretti told reporters.Conte, a law professor who had never held political office prior to his appointment, became prime minister in June 2018, the compromise choice to lead the previous coalition of populist parties. In his speech on Thursday, Conte noted he had \"more than one doubt\" about taking that role again but that he had \"overcome those doubts.\"\"It will be full of obstacles but I am passionately committed to the task for this country that I love,\" Conte said. The prime minister also announced he would appoint new government ministers over the coming days.CNN's Radina Gigova and Bianca Britton contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Eliud Kipchoge has likened his upcoming attempt to break the two-hour marathon barrier to Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing in 1969, but one leading sports scientist says the conditions are \"contrived\" and likens it more to breaking the high jump record on Mars.The 34-year-old Kipchoge, who ran the fastest ever official marathon last year in Berlin in a time of 2:01:39, will try to dip under two hours in Vienna in October, aided by a group of pacesetters and running behind a lead car that will serve as a wind resistor.However, Professor Ross Tucker, the respected South African who served as an expert witness in Caster Semenya's hearing at the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS) earlier this year, is sceptical about the variables involved in the venture, dubbed the INEOS 1:59 Challenge.\"Getting man to the moon involved overcoming gravity. What Kipchoge is doing is taking gravity out of the equation,\" Tucker told CNN Sport. \"It would be the same as breaking the high jump record [set in 1993 by Cuba's Javier Sotomayor at a height of 2.45m] on Mars where there is less gravity.\"READ: Caster Semenya blocked from competing at World ChampionshipsEliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon this year.Read MoreRemoving gravityThe rationale behind Tucker's claim helps explain why the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the governing body for the sport of athletics, will not recognise Kipchoge's time as part of its official record. \"People within the sport who understand the constraints of what normally regulates or limits performance would appreciate that this isn't comparable [with the moon landing],\" Tucker said. \"The variables are too contrived for this to be regarded as a pure human accomplishment.\"However, INEOS spokesperson Tom Crotty said in a statement: \"The sub-two-hour marathon remains one of the last barriers in sport,\" and Kipchoge's achievement would represent a \"next step to make history, leave a legacy, and show that no human is limited.\"Kipchoge, who missed breaking the two-hour mark by just 25 seconds in Monza in 2017, added: \"It is not about a world record. It is about passing the message of inspiration to the whole human family. I am already the record holder for marathon but I need to do this for the human family.\"READ: Kenyan runner comes close, but two-hour marathon barrier remains unbrokenEliud Kipchoge won the 2019 London Marathon in 2 hours 2 minutes 37 seconds.A technological boostTucker is concerned that modern high-performance running shoes are so efficient they take away from the human achievement.Last year, The New York Times released a comprehensive report detailing the significant improvements Nike's Zoom Vaporfly 4% shoes -- worn by Kipchoge and on public sale at $250 -- afford men and women of all levels and ages. This primarily comes in the form of the assisted spring the shoes provide, propelling the runner forward while preserving energy.According to Tucker, a runner expelling four percent less oxygen for the same energy output is able to improve on his or  her performance by 2.5 percent at the elite level. Over the course of a marathon - 26.2 miles (42.2km) - this could translate to as much as two minutes. While the Nike shoe is perfectly legal, it throws up a similar situation to the swimsuit that took the 2008 Olympics by storm. In Beijing, 94 percent of all swimming races were won by athletes wearing Speedo's LZR Racer swimsuits, according to Time Magazine. Michael Phelps said he \"felt like a rocket\" in the swimsuit before claiming an unprecedented eight gold medals in Beijing. At the European Short Course Championships in Croatia later that year, 17 records fell to swimmers wearing the LZR which prompted the International Swimming Federation (FINA) to change its rules regarding the length and material of sanctioned swimsuits.\"We're talking about performance integrity,\" Tucker argues. \"Is Kipchoge an outlier of immense athletic potential? Or is he a simply a very good runner who is benefiting from the immense improvements that his shoes provide? Perhaps both. \"But the point is we don't know with absolute certainty. Running, especially marathon running, is supposed to be the purest thing humans put themselves through. It's just about feet, legs, lungs, heart and brain. These shoes create the same problems that doping throws up.\"Eliud Kipchoge (right) and Mo Farah (left) show off their running shoes ahead of this year's London marathon. 'Reassess what is achievable'Though Tucker remains unconvinced by the lasting legacy of the INEOS 1:59 from a pure athletic perspective, he believes it could raise the profile of the sport and shift expectations regarding a legitimate sub-two-hour marathon.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"It won't matter in people's minds that the bar was reset in a different ecosystem,\" Tucker said. \"The fact that a human body will cross that line in under two hours will stick in the minds of people who have struggled with barriers. \"Perhaps people who run Parkruns will now reassess what is achievable and it might inspire them to push themselves further. But no one within the sport is going to be thinking of this when the next big money marathon rolls around.\"Whether Kipchoge's attempt is as revolutionary as a moon landing or more akin to high jumping on Mars is a matter of opinion. Either way, a sub-two-hour marathon would constitute a new frontier in human physiology.",

His Melbourne-based lawyer, Rob Stary, said few details had been released about the case beyond the spying charges.Read More\"We don't know whether he's accused of spying on behalf of a third party actor -- a foreign government such as Australia or the US,\" Stary said. \"We know him as a blogger and democracy activist -- so we can't conceive of any other actions outside of his role as a political agitator.\"Stary said the spying charges were worrying.

        "content": "(CNN)When Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson spoke to reporters ahead of their meeting in Paris on Thursday, they stood side by side but sounded as if they were living in parallel universes. Both men stuck firmly to their lines -- the British Prime Minister demanding that the European Union reopens the Brexit agreement, the French President saying that's not possible. Macron said that he's often portrayed as the \"hard man\" in Brexit negotiations. But there is little time left to alter the existing deal substantively, he said. \"We will not find a new withdrawal agreement within 30 days which will be very different from the existing one.\"The French President reiterated his stance that Brexit is \"not the choice of the European Union.\" Johnson's Paris visit was the second leg of a trip aimed at pushing the European Union to shift its position on Brexit. The PM insists the EU must ditch the so-called Irish backstop -- a demand that has so far fallen on deaf ears among the bloc's leaders.Meet the real brains behind Boris Johnson's Brexit planRead More\"The Irish backstop (clauses) are not simply technical constraints but vital guarantees for the preservation of stability in Ireland and the integrity of the single market which is the basis of the European Project,\" Macron added. \"Where there's a will, there's a way,\" Johnson said. But when asked what the plan was, the prime minister fell short of delivering a concrete answer. Instead, he referred to \"an excellent paper\" published by a group of British lawmakers which outlined alternative solutions earlier this year. However, that proposal has already been rejected as unworkable by the European Union. It was always going to be a tough meeting for Johnson. The French President made it clear earlier that he won't be persuaded to change his position in talks with Johnson. According to Reuters, Macron on Wednesday warned renegotiation was \"not an option that exists,\" adding that Britain could become the \"junior partner of the United States\" after a no-deal Brexit.\"Can the cost for Britain of a hard Brexit -- because Britain will be the main victim -- be offset by the United States of America? No. And even if it were a strategic choice it would be at the cost of a historic vassalization of Britain,\" Macron said.Emmanuel Macron hosted Boris Johnson at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday.In his opening remarks, Johnson tried to highlight the good relationship between the two countries, mentioning the French and British troops working side by side in Mali and Estonia. He then pointed out that buses made in France are traversing London's streets and that French high-speed TGV trains run on British steel rails. But the charm offensive didn't seem to have much effect, as Macron kept insisting the backstop clause was indispensable.The backstop clause is designed to prevent the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. It was negotiated by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May, but widely criticized by UK lawmakers who still need to ratify the agreement to stop the country from crashing out of the bloc without a deal.However, the European leaders are sticking to their line: if Johnson wants to remove the backstop, he needs to come up with a specific alternative proposal.Speaking at a joint news conference in Berlin on Wednesday evening, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the \"UK has to tell us what ideas it has\" to solve the backstop issue, adding that \"it is not the job of the chancellor\" to find a solution.Merkel challenged Johnson to come up with a new plan for Brexit in 30 days.Merkel delivers Brexit ultimatum to Johnson on UK PM's first visit to BerlinEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said on Tuesday the backstop was \"an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found.\"\"Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support reestablishing a border. Even if they do not admit it,\" Tusk added.A lack of a Plan B would mean the UK is more likely to crash out of the EU without a deal. This would, according to the government's own forecasts, plunge the country into economic chaos. It could also spark food, medicine and fuel shortages.Johnson has indicated he is prepared to take the country out of the EU without an agreement.",

However, the proposal to reward people for cycling is too short. After all, what about people who do not ride a bicycle, but instead pay attention to a balanced diet? And what about the overweight cyclist who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day?\" BARMER added.\"Nobody wants a health police. Instead, we must succeed in convincing employees of a healthy lifestyle by means of a company health management system -- on a voluntary basis,\" they said.

On Wednesday morning she was interrupted by a request from the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, asking her to suspend Parliament for more than a month.Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish estate, in Aberdeenshire.Three members of the Privy Council, a small group of senior parliamentarians who advise the monarch on the exercise of her constitutional powers, arrived in rural Aberdeenshire to convey the request to the Queen.Read MoreIt sounds dramatic, but it ought to be routine. Every so often, the government of the day resets parliamentary calendar with a fresh legislative program, keeping the business of government focused around a defined set of priorities. Typically, this happens once a year, and in recent years has occurred in the fall.But these are not usual times. The latest deadline for Britain to leave the European Union, October 31, is fast approaching. Johnson has said that he's prepared to quit without a deal. The most divisive of political issues is reaching its apex.Boris Johnson's move has put the Queen at the center of a political controversy.Many lawmakers oppose a no-deal Brexit, and have been plotting to oppose it. Critics say Johnson's decision to start a new parliamentary session on October 14 -- and precede it with an unusually long break of up to five weeks -- is a ruse to shut down the options of his political opponents.The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote to Her Majesty calling the move an \"outrage and a threat to our democracy.\" There is speculation that, if Johnson loses a vote of confidence next week, he could set in motion plans for a general election on November 1, the day after Brexit day.That means parliament wouldn't be sitting on one of the momentous days in modern British political history.But if Johnson loses a vote of no-confidence, it would fall to the Queen to appoint a new prime minister who could demonstrate they could command a majority of the House of Commons.If Johnson gets his way, the Queen will preside over the State Opening of Parliament on October 14 and deliver a speech setting out the government's legislative program -- with Brexit at its heart.Boris Johnson just took a huge step to ensure Brexit happens on October 31All this has put the Queen exactly where she doesn't want to be -- at the center of the biggest political crisis in modern British history.Queen Elizabeth is revered for her ability to remain above politics, barely expressing any personal views, let alone party political ones. She sticks rigidly to the custom of only acting on the advice of ministers, to avoid the monarchy being used as a political football.In this case, Johnson is the minister but if any of the moves to oppose a no-deal Brexit succeed, the only person empowered to arbitrate may be the Queen.Ultimately, Parliament is sovereign and the only body, ultimately, with the power to unseat her.There is no written constitution in the UK to refer to and no precedent for this crisis. That leaves the Queen with a lot to consider during what's left of her summer break -- the role of monarchy in British political life, no less. But before that, she must come up with a form of words to write back to Corbyn, without actually giving away what she thinks.",

The rollout of the new footwear, which began in 2016, was scheduled to be completed by 2020 but has now been pushed back to mid-2022, the German Defense Ministry told CNN.\"Due to limited production capacity in industry the schedule could not be kept,\" a ministry spokesperson said. \"Thousands of boots are being produced at the same time.\"The ministry had planned to provide soldiers with two types of \"heavy combat boots\" and one \"light combat boot\" -- but it admitted only around a sixth of all soldiers had received the light combat boot and none had been given the second pair of heavy combat footwear.The first pair of heavy combat boots had been given to 160,000 of 183,000 soldiers, the ministry added in a response to an inquiry by opposition parliamentarian Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann.Read MoreMilitary rocket tests cause weeks-long moorland fire in northern GermanyThe delay was heavily criticized by a number of opposition lawmakers, who said the government had failed to adequately prepare the key NATO member's military for combat -- a charge that has frequently been levied against the defense ministry in recent years.\"Boots are the key to everything,\" Strack-Zimmermann told CNN. \"You don't go skiing with a pair of trainers and you don't go hiking in high heels.\" \"It is important that soldiers are equipped with the right pair of shoes -- in Mali you need different footwear than in other places. So it's a question of safety, and not that of fashion,\" she added.\"Everyone in the armed forces should have received their new pair of boots by the end of 2020,\" Strack-Zimmermann noted, calling the inability to provide the footwear on time \"extremely embarrassing.\"The rollout was initiated under the watch of Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's controversial former defense minister who left her post earlier this year to become the European Commission President. Von der Leyen's five-year stint in the post was beset by controversies, with many of her domestic critics arguing she left the military unprepared for combat.A parliamentary report published in January, for instance, found that \"far too few\" troops had been provided with equipment such as \"protective vests, boots, clothing, modern helmets or night vision devices.\"",

All have denied the allegations.Prince Andrew, Duke of York speaks as he hosts a Pitch@Palace event at Buckingham Palace on June 12 in London.Andrew, officially the Duke of York, has repeatedly rejected all accusations leveled against him in connection to the Epstein case.\"I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior,\" Andrew said in a statement released Saturday. Read MoreIn the statement, Andrew said he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 and \"saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year.\" Andrew also said that he stayed at \"a number of his (Epstein's) residences.\"\"At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction,\" Andrew said. Andrew added that it was a \"mistake and an error\" to see Epstein in 2010, two years after the financier first pleaded guilty to sex crimes.\"I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person,\" Andrew said. In 2015, Giuffre said in a federal court filing that she was forced to have sex with the prince while underage. \"I knew he was a member of the British Royal Family, but I just called him 'Andy,'\" she said in her first sworn statement to the court. Buckingham Palace rejected the claim, issuing a statement which said, \"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship\" with the woman. \"Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\"Shortly after that, Andrew addressed the allegation before a crowd at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, expressing his wish to \"reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.JUST WATCHEDThe rise and fall of Jeffrey EpsteinReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe rise and fall of Jeffrey Epstein 04:41Giuffre addressed the press outside a New York courthouse on Tuesday. She was one of more than a dozen Epstein accusers who had spoken in court about Epstein. \"I will never be silenced until these people are brought to justice,\" she said. When asked about Prince Andrews' denials, Giuffre said: \"He knows what he's done and he can attest to that.\"\"He knows exactly what he's done and I hope he comes clean about it,\" she added.Attorneys for Giuffre said Andrew's weekend statement was insufficient and that he should testify in court. \"Anybody can deny things in a printed statement. It's a different thing to come here, answer questions under oath, subject to cross examination. Those are the kinds of answers that we are eventually going to get,\" said David Boies, one of Giuffre's lawyers.",

And if he can run those 26.2 miles in under two hours -- and Kipchoge has \"no doubts\" he will run a marathon in under two hours -- he says his latest record breaking attempt will send a powerful message to the world.\"It will mean a lot when I run under two hours, when I leave a very pure, clean and positive history by running under two hours,\" Kipchoge said. \"My main focus is to pass the message onto more than three billion people in this world that no human is limited, and the only way is by running under two hours. \"And I hope they will all look on this achievement and be happy with their families and with their professions, with their daily life and above all, they will keep on running.\"Kipchoge crosses the finish line to win the London Marathon.READ: Dalilah Muhammad breaks 16-year-old world record at US track and field championshipsLearning from mistakesWhile October 12 has been outlined as the date for the attempt, there is an eight-day window until October 20 where he could make the attempt dependent on weather conditions.Vienna was chosen primarily as it is usually mild, sunny, and not particularly hot at that time of year.The use of runners and waiting for favorable weather conditions has led to some criticism of Kipchoge's record attempt.\"So I get the excitement and I share the excitement, but only if it happens organically in a real situation,\" leading sports scientist Ross Tucker told CNN Sport.\"This attempt is effectively being done in a lab, not the real world. It is an exciting experiment and I look forward to seeing the results.\"Kipchoge has been preparing for the Vienna run back in his homeland near to his birthplace of Nandi County, which is also home to many world record holders in athletics, including Kipchoge Keino, Pamela Jelimo and Conseslus Kipruto.Training for the 1:59 Challenge for Kipchoge has been similar to his preparation for other marathons -- which involves running between 200-220km a week in preparation -- and the Kenyan will arrive in Vienna one week before the race window opens. Kipchoge crosses the finish line to win the Berlin Marathon, setting a new world record.READ: Gabriele Grunewald: Professional runner inspired 'hope' in cancer fightBut while his running workload is as intense as ever, it is the difference in his training for his mind that Kipchoge believes will be key to going under two hours.\"Nothing much has changed, the training is the same, the strength, the speed,\" Kipchoge said.

His charges were announced by the Australian government. Yang's Melbourne-based lawyer, Rob Stary, said few details had been released about the case beyond the spying charges.\"We don't know whether he's accused of spying on behalf of a third party actor -- a foreign government such as Australia or the US,\" Stary said. \"We know him as a blogger and democracy activist -- so we can't conceive of any other actions outside of his role as a political agitator.\"Stary said the spying charges were worrying. Espionage can carry the death penalty in China, though Stary said it was \"not within our contemplation that this case will attract that penalty.\"A former official with the Chinese foreign ministry, Yang, 53, also holds Australian citizenship, and was known to spend most of his time in the United States. He also had a large following on Twitter, where he posted satirical commentaries and criticism of the Chinese government. Read MoreHe was detained in the city of Guangzhou in January, while he and his wife were visiting from New York, where Yang was a visiting scholar at Columbia University. Yang's wife, Yuan Xiaoliang -- a Chinese citizen with Australian permanent residency -- has been issued an exit ban preventing her from leaving China, Stary said. At a regular press briefing Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed Yang's arrest and said the case was \"under further investigation.\"Stary said Julian McMahon, a high-profile Australian barrister, had been hired to assist with the case.

JUST WATCHEDChina slaps ban on meat imported from CanadaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChina slaps ban on meat imported from Canada 02:04Diplomatic issueYang's detention in January came amid a period of rocky relations between Beijing and Canberra. The two sides were clashing on issues ranging from China's alleged attempts to influence the former's domestic politics, to Canberra's decision to ban technology by Chinese company Huawei from the country's 5G mobile networks and Beijing's rising ambitions in the South Pacific. Michael Kovrig.Marise Payne, Australia's minister for foreign affairs, said in a statement that Canberra was \"very concerned\" about Yang, who was moved to a detention center in Beijing in July, after six months of house arrest.\"Dr Yang has been held in Beijing in harsh conditions without charge for more than seven months. Since that time, China has not explained the reasons for Dr Yang's detention, nor has it allowed him access to his lawyers or family visits,\" she said. \"We have serious concerns for Dr Yang's welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being been held.\"Geng, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said Beijing \"expresses its strong dissatisfaction over Australia's statement on the case.\"\"I want to emphasize that China is a country with the rule of law. Australia should earnestly respect China's judicial sovereignty and must not interfere in China's handling of the case in any way,\" he said. Although Beijing denies any link between its detention of foreign nationals and bilateral disputes, critics say the cases have had a \"chilling effect\" on how foreigners view and deal with China.\"You start to hear people say, If my government has frictions with China, I'd better not be in China,\" Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch, told CNN earlier this year. \"Other people feel, I'd better stay quiet and not say anything critical of the Chinese government in case something happens to me.\" In December last year, two Canadians -- former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor -- were detained and accused of stealing \"sensitive information and other intelligence.\" Their detention came just over a week after the Canadian government arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, on behalf of the US.

It was legalized in 2002, making the country the first in the world to authorize the practice. Dutch euthanasia clinic offers mobile serviceThe trial, which is the first of its kind in The Netherlands, started Monday at The Hague district court.Prosecutors are not seeking a punishment for the unnamed 68-year-old doctor, who is now retired, saying they were taking into account that she had good intentions, had fully cooperated, and had already been affected by the prosecution and previous disciplinary proceedings.Read MoreBut they asked the court to declare her guilty in a case which they say \"raises an important question that must be submitted to the court.\"The case hinges on the debate over how doctors should deal with euthanasia in the case of a patient who is incapacitated but can still communicate a desire to live, contrary to an earlier statement.\"As long as the woman was able to communicate, the nursing home doctor should have kept talking to her about her desire to live or to die,\" reads the statement from the prosecutor's office. \"And as long as that conversation gave cause for doubt, the nursing home doctor should have refrained from euthanasia.\"However the doctor performed euthanasia \"in close consultation\" with the family of the patient on April 22 2016, according to prosecutors.\"In this case, the public prosecutor concluded that the nursing home doctor had not met all due care requirements for euthanasia and had not been sufficiently careful,\" according to the prosecutor's office. Two committees -- the Regional Review Committee on Euthanasia and the Central Disciplinary Board for Healthcare -- had come to the same conclusion, prosecutors said.Physician-Assisted Suicide Fast FactsThe trial will continue Wednesday and a verdict is expected in two weeks.Alistair Thompson, spokesman for anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing, told CNN that fear of becoming a burden to family members is driving increasing numbers of euthanasia cases.\"Once you say you have the right to die, that right quickly becomes a duty,\" said Thompson. \"You have people who are feeling pressured into ending their lives.\"Doctors are also affected by euthanasia policy, Thompson added.\"There's no real help for the doctors out there either,\" he said. \"We should be thinking about the medical staff, who are under considerable pressure.\"But Dignity in Dying, a group campaigning to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill, mentally competent adults in the UK, said the trial demonstrated that Dutch authorities were operating within clear safeguards, with decisions carefully examined.\"What is clear from this case is that under the Dutch law decisions are being scrutinized in an open, transparent way,\" Thomas Davies, the group's campaigns and communications director, told CNN. This was preferable to situations in which dying people were \"forced to make decisions behind closed doors, suffer against their wishes or spend huge amounts of money to have an assisted death overseas,\" he added.",

        "content": "Warning: This story contains an image depicting animal death (CNN)The mysterious death of 45 Australian wallabies in one week has sparked fears of a mass poisoning of the animals, which look like small, stout kangaroos with shorter legs.The first dead wallabies were found with whitened eyes and foaming mouths in Trinity Beach, in Australia's Queensland state, by conservation group The Agile Project. The non-profit organization was notified of the deaths on August 21, when a football club found a handful of wallaby bodies on a sports field.Since then, new bodies have been found every day. Several joeys -- baby wallabies -- have also been found inside their mothers' pouches, including one who tried to jump back into its dead mother's pouch. One joey has died, with six still alive and in the organization's care.\"I've been a rescuer for 9 years and I've never seen anything natural like this,\" said Shai Ager, the founder of The Agile Project.  Read MoreThe rescuers are awaiting toxicology results, which should be delivered in the next few days, to determine the cause of death. 45 dead agile wallabies have been found in north Queensland, Australia. The pink marks are spray paint indicating which wallabies have been checked for baby joeys.Potential causes include an attack by dogs, Ager said -- but many of the bodies didn't have wounds, making this unlikely. Or the wallabies could have been chased by dogs, and under stress, accidentally injured themselves. Another possibility is that the wallabies were targeted or poisoned. \"They died a really sudden death, and it was horrible, painful,\" said Ager, who had been with several wallabies as they died.  Wallabies are commonly found in open woodland, grassland, and dense vegetation -- but in recent years, they have been pushed out of their habitat by housing developments and forced to take refuge in suburban backyards and next to highways. Ager said that some in the area \"despise\" wallabies, and see them as pests -- a common controversy across Australia.Many in the local community, however, have been horrified by the deaths, with commenters on The Agile Project's Facebook page volunteering to do night watches.One place they could look out would be the local sports fields.  Ager said a one-way gate, designed to keep wallabies out of the fields, had been tampered with every night this week allowing wallabies to enter the fields. The fields aren't dangerous for the wallabies but Ager said the disruption pointed to human interference as more dead wallabies showed up in the fields overnight.Whatever the cause, the deaths are taking a toll on those who find the animals.\"It's highly disturbing as well, our rescuers are struggling to see so much death every day,\" said Ager. \"We put so much work to save these animals, so mass deaths like this shatter us. It's heartbreaking.\"",

It's sad. It's sad for him and for Brazilians. I think that Brazilian women are probably ashamed to read that their president has done that.\"\"I think that Brazilians, a great people, are a bit ashamed of this behavior,\" Macron added. \"As I have a lot of friendship and respect for the Brazilian people, I hope that they will quickly have a president who is up to the job.\"Read MoreBolsonaro's office didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron It comes after Macron angered Bolsonaro last week by calling the wildfires blazing in the Amazon rainforest an \"international crisis\" that should be on the agenda at the G7 summit.Bolsonaro said the idea of G7 discussing the issue was \"reminiscent of [a] colonial mindset [that was] inappropriate in the 21st century.\"Bolsonaro to deploy troops to fight Amazon rainforest firesOn Monday, Macron announced a $20 million emergency fund to help Amazon countries affected by the rainforest fires. He added that the wildfires were damaging the \"most important lungs of the planet\" and that France would provide military support. The French president admitted his country's interest in the Amazon was partly because it has territory in the Amazon.Bolsonaro launched another tirade against Macron on Monday, accusing the French president of unleashing \"unreasonable and gratuitous attacks on the Amazon.\"Bolsonaro added that he could not accept Macron's \"intentions behind the idea of an 'alliance' of the G7 countries to 'save' the Amazon, as if we were a colony or no man's land.\"",

Believe it or not, Miami has won five out of the last six games. The Hurricanes (7-6 in 2018) are starting anew after head coach Mark Richt retired this off season -- defensive coordinator Manny Diaz takes over.

Koepka is one of the athletes to pose for the upcoming ESPN Body Issue. The world #1 has a physique atypical for a weekend duffer -- hence all the hullabaloo.Koepka was asked this week about all the (naked) heat he was receiving on social media, to which he confidently replied: \"It's one of those things where all these people talk crap whatever on social media. They don't have the balls to do it. And they wouldn't have the balls to do it. And they won't look that good.

        "content": "Newbury, UK (CNN)For the last 38 years, a quintessential pocket of British countryside nestling amongst a sea of rolling green hills 60 miles from London has been paying homage to Arabian horse racing and culture. Some of the richest people in the world -- including members of the Dubai royal family -- descend on Newbury's racecourse to showcase the best of Middle Eastern culture both to horse racing fans as well as members of the local community. Different from the thoroughbreds that you might usually associate with racing, Arabian horses are generally smaller and are renowned for their stamina.\"They are cheeky, that's for sure,\" leading jockey Bryony Frost, who was riding in the Newbury event for the very first time, told CNN Sport as she reflected on the two breeds' different physical attributes.\"They're good fun, they're very sharp, they're very intelligent, They're always going to be two steps ahead of you so you've got to be three steps ahead of them.Read MoreShe continued: \"If you were to have a room full of class children with thoroughbreds and then the Arabs, I would definitely say that they [Arabian horses] would be the troublemakers amongst the bunch.\" READ: Sheikh Fahad and the phone call that changed horse racingREAD: Saudi Arabia set to stage record $20M horse race in 2020The day is organized under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum.Growing the sportGetting Frost to attend the event was certainly a coup for the organizers -- the 24-year-old is one of the most recognizable faces in British racing. In March she became the first female jockey to win a top-flight race at the iconic Cheltenham Festival.In between competing, Frost joined in the carnival atmosphere of the day, walking amongst the fans and answering any questions the crowd might have.She admitted to \"throwing myself in the deep end\" by making the switch from jumps to flat horses but was happy to help the sport develop. \"It gets massive support from the owners and the trainers as well,\" said Frost. \"Days like this you wouldn't know the difference between a flat meeting and an Arabian meeting.\"\"Crowds are really coming in because the money is behind it. So the children and everyone can have a class day.\"Frost was not the only big name to take place in the event, with four-time Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Olivier Peslier also competing in front of the enthusiastic crowd.

Almost all thoroughbred racehorses can be traced back to three Arabian horses that traveled to Europe to partner with the local breeds, providing the foundation for the lucrative industry today. Indeed, 95% of thoroughbreds can be linked back to one super stallion -- the Darley Arabian.This legendary horse was spotted in the 1700s by British Consul Thomas Darley while in Aleppo, Syria, and taken back to England where he covered local mares.Amongst others, the Darley Arabian sired Flying Childers -- one of the first champion thoroughbreds in history. However, as thoroughbred racing has grown into a billion-pound industry, Arabian racing has been left still finding its feet. \"I think Arab racing is at a crossroads where it's probably got to go more professional and bring in the opportunity for more people to own and train,\" Richard Lancaster, who is director of Shadwell Stud -- a global Arabian breeding and racing operation -- told CNN Sport.\"It has to get itself a good financial base from which it can expand and bring a lot of fun to people.\" Photos: Royal Ascot 2019: The most impressive hats on showScroll through to see some of the most impressive hats on show at Royal Ascot 2019 in June.Hide Caption 1 of 14 Photos: Royal Ascot 2019: The most impressive hats on showBold looks can be found on every corner of the Ascot Racecourse.

Arsenal's defense was peppered and pressured as Liverpool's three-pronged attack of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino probed and pushed in another Anfield thriller between the two sides. \"It was a performance full of power, full of energy, full of greed, full of passion which you need against such a good team like Arsenal,\" Klopp told broadcaster Sky Sports.\"The work rate of the boys is exceptional. Our identity is intensity and that's how the boys showed up today.Read More\"It's our fifth game (of the season) already.

The decision about the penalty was absolutely obvious, everyone could see there was a shirt where it should not be, and then Mo's third goal was unbelievable.\"The penalty came just two minutes into the second half and effectively snuffed out the chance of a meaningful Arsenal fightback.'Can't help himself'Luiz, a pragmatic summer transfer designed to shore up Arsenal's defense, conceded the penalty with an instinctive grab of Salah's shirt.\"He just can't help himself!\" former Manchester United defender Gary Neville commented on Sky Sports.Mohamed Salah and David Luiz of Arsenal discussed the penalty incident after the final whistleLuiz called the incident \"just a reflex\" and went on to argue that officials aren't able to judge the power of the pull and that Salah told him after the final whistle that he didn't feel anything.\"With VAR (video assistant referees), it's difficult for them to see the power,\" said Luiz. \"If you see the shirt going like that it's difficult for the referees to say it's not a penalty.\"If you play with an extra-large shirt now it would be a penalty every time. It's interpretation. \"Mo-Mo is my friend and he said he didn't feel that ... but football is like that.\" 'Special talent'Despite the dizzying Liverpool surge, Arsenal kept their heads and added a late goal through substitute Lucas Torreira to deny the Reds a clean sheet.The London club also remain second in the table, three points behind Liverpool.For Arsenal fans looking to take further consolation from another heavy Anfield defeat, it came in the shape of Nicolas Pepe.Arsenal's record signing -- who joined the Gunners for a reported  72 million pounds ($88 million) earlier this month -- made a confident debut, showing pace to rival Liverpool superstar Salah.

We continued doing our work. ... I think some players will look (and think) that they took another step here today.\"After we finished 3-1 pushing, that is the spirit we want.\"This fixture is the highest-scoring in the history of the Premier League and has produced some classic encounters -- before Saturday's clash, the two sides had clocked up 155 goals and a record six hat tricks.But for Arsenal, there are still scores to settle at Anfield -- while Liverpool walk on.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)It's been a heady summer for Russia's embattled political opposition. On August 10, as many as 50,000 people rallied in Moscow calling for fair local elections, the biggest protests seen in the capital since early 2012. Now opposition leaders are calling for a protest on August 31, hoping to build on the momentum of Moscow's summer of discontent. So who are the protest leaders, and what is their goal?Alexei Navalny is the most recognizable Russian opposition leader. In late July, ahead of unsanctioned protests, he was jailed amid a roundup of opposition figures ahead of unsanctioned demonstrations on July 27 and sentenced to 30 days for allegedly violating protest laws. While in custody, he was hospitalized with an \"acute allergic reaction.\" His physician suspected poisoning by an unknown substance.  Navalny was released from jail on Friday, but while he was inside another activist has emerged as a leading opposition voice: Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer and activist with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund. Sobol recently ended a month-long hunger-strike after election officials refused to allow her onto the ballot in upcoming municipal elections; she was also detained and subsequently released ahead of an August 3 protest. Alexei Navalny is arrested at a rally in January 2019.Initially, the protests centered on those municipal elections, which are scheduled for September 8. Moscow's election commission has barred a number of independent and opposition candidates from running because they had failed to obtain a sufficient number of signatures to be allowed to run. Opposition activists say the authorities are using administrative measures to block true political competition.Read MoreBut the protests have now taken on a different rationale: They have become a response to the wide-ranging crackdown on opposition activism. The slogan for the upcoming protest is \"against political repression.\" The response of the authorities to weeks of protest has been telling. In addition to the detention of leading opposition figures, police have made sweeping arrests of demonstrators. According to OVD-Info, a monitoring group, more than 2,000 people have been detained in recent large protests, both at unsanctioned marches and on the sidelines of legally sanctioned demonstrations. Lyubov Sobol is detained at an August 3 protest in Moscow.Carrots and sticks approachFootage of those arrests has spurred much of the outrage. One video that went viral showed a Russian riot police officer punching a woman in the stomach on August 10, the day of a sanctioned protest. Days before that protest, the Moscow prosecutor's office said it was seeking to strip an unnamed couple of their parental rights for bringing a baby to the July 27 rally.Authorities have taken other legal measures. The Investigative Committee, a top Russian law-enforcement body, opened a criminal case against Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund, saying it was initiating a criminal probe of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Fund, or FBK, over alleged \"financial transactions with funds known to be acquired by other persons by criminal means.\" The Investigative Committee alleged that Navalny's non-profit, which investigates official corruption in Russia, received money from third parties as part of money-laundering scheme. (Navalny and his supporters say such cases are politically motivated.)Russian lawmakers have also weighed in. The Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, ordered the creation of a special commission to probe \"foreign interference\" in Russian elections amid the wave of opposition protests.JUST WATCHEDVladimir Putin's rise from spy to Russian leaderReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVladimir Putin's rise from spy to Russian leader 02:43And local authorities have carrots, as well as sticks, to deter protests. The Moscow city government organized two last-minute street carnivals that appeared timed to lure Muscovites away from protests (including one barbecue-and-music festival on August 10, dubiously titled \"Meat and Beat\"). At this stage, it's hard to gauge where the protests are heading. After the massive turnout on August 10, demonstrations the following weekend were a more subdued affair. That protest involved \"solo pickets\" -- individual protesters holding signs in downtown Moscow to avoid arrest for participating in an unsanctioned gathering. But even modest protests can have an effect. Earlier this summer, Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against prominent investigative reporter Ivan Golunov after a fierce public backlash. The Kremlin, however, does not seem disposed to make concessions to the opposition. Asked on Monday about the recent arrests, Putin was adamant: Russians have a right to free assembly, within limits.\"Neither the authorities nor any groups of citizens have the right to violate the law and carry the situation to the point of absurdity or cause scuffles with the authorities,\" he said in a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. \"This is against the law, and all who committed these violations have to be held accountable under the Russian law.\"Put otherwise: Putin is unlikely to see the upcoming protest as a legitimate expression of political grievance.",

But the drama of an Ashes series presents an even tougher test than the cauldron of world-class, one-day cricket. Once again Stokes was up to the task.Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, a man who knows a thing or two about the unique pressures of the Ashes, said: \"This is one of the best innings I've ever seen.\"His team was gone, dead and buried -- but Stokes had none of that. He played an unbelievable innings.\"Former England captain David Gower, also speaking on Sky Sports, added: \"That is the most extraordinary performance by anyone that I've ever seen as a broadcaster and a player. \"That takes unbelievable skill and courage.\" Leach also played his part in England's brilliant, resilient last stand. The bowler stood firm for 60 minutes, doing his job of blocking balls and returning Stokes to the strike. Stokes and Leach celebrate their match-winning double act.The pair put on 76 runs, the third highest final wicket stand in the history of first-class cricket.England's hopes of keeping the Ashes series alive were very slim indeed after the home side were skittled out for just 67 runs in the first innings.But this is Test match cricket -- and it ain't over when Ben Stokes swings.",

Radiation poisoning at missile test site?Read MoreThe explosive incident at the Nyonoksa missile test site on August 8 took the lives of at least five nuclear specialists working for Rosatom state corporation. The company said at the time the engineers were testing a \"nuclear isotope power source\" for a rocket engine and the blast threw them into the sea.Funerals, on August 13, for the five Russian nuclear engineers killed by a rocket explosion in Sarov.According to the local ministry of health, more than 110 first responders were examined; some were even taken to Moscow's specialized facilities for additional screening, shedding new light on the scale of the incident. Tatyana Rusinova, the acting minister of health in Arkhangelsk, said that, apart from the doctor with cesium-137, \"No radioactive contamination of clothing or body surfaces was detected.\" Investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta later reported that two of the workers died from radiation poisoning. Reports claiming that dozens of medical workers were exposed to radiation have been circulating for a while. Several independent news outlets published anonymous accounts of doctors angered by the fact they were not warned about radiation and lacked basic protective gear.

When pressed to comment further, Peskov accused the media of attempting to \"distort reality.\"\"Have you not tried to look at the situation from a different side?\" Peskov said. \"The way the situation unfolds makes it seem like somebody intentionally wants to escalate the media coverage around this, distort reality and present the situation as if there are reasons to be worried about the danger.\"But one of the doctors employed at Arkhangelsk regional hospital -- Igor Semin, a cardiovascular surgeon -- came out publicly, slamming the authorities for putting the lives of his colleagues at risk.\"Many were let down: young guys, the oldest of whom was 31 years old and collapsed from radiation in a day, the population of Severodvinsk... doctors, my colleagues who found themselves in front of the victims with empty hands, not even a respirator,\" Semin wrote on his page on a social networking site called Vkontakte. \"No one said anything, did not warn anybody -- they threw them under a bus and let us sort it out.\"",

And, in the eyes of many Brits, he has gambled the UK's future to achieve it.Since becoming PM, Johnson has had one goal: to get the UK out of the European Union, a message he has hammered home this week in meetings with France's President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.In Biarritz, he will also meet with US President Donald Trump, Japan's Shinzo Abe, and Canada's Justin Trudeau. Johnson's moment in the sun will come when, if as expected, he and Trump unveil their much-hyped steps to a post-Brexit trade deal. UK faces food and fuel shortages in no-deal Brexit, says leaked plan It will be a handy trophy of sorts, which is intended to dazzle British voters and convince them that, despite the advice of the government's own civil servants and experts, Brexit will benefit the British economy.Read MoreAll of which will soon be hugely important as Johnson faces a looming challenge to his leadership and a general election.While Brexit is the talk of diplomats and business leaders the world over, little mention is being made of his apparent bet on America, the presidency of Trump, and all that entails.To side with America rather than the EU, as Johnson has been showing recently, risks committing the UK to far more than Brexit.Johnson is a risk-taker: while his gamble on Trump might benefit him today, it also risks breaking Britain, splitting the four-nation Union, and potentially putting it on the wrong side of emerging geopolitical fault lines.The reasons are relatively straightforward: the world has changed a lot since the Brexit vote in 2016.Indeed it is a very different place than it was when former prime minister David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membership in 2013.However while the world has moved on, Euroskeptics have not.

This week, in an extraordinary move even by his own unpredictable standards, he dissed Denmark, dumping out of an upcoming state visit, deeming it no longer worthwhile because it won't sell him Greenland.Yes, Donald Trump really believes he is 'the chosen one'Trump is utterly undependable, but it is in the case of China that he most threatens the post-Brexit calculus.The Asian superpower is coming of age, inevitably challenging the United States. China believes its technology sector should have a fair shake at dominating and appears willing to endure a bitter trade war with Trump to achieve it.A clash of these titans is on the horizon, and neither can be relied on to act in a way that might have been imagined five years ago.If Johnson wants a taste of what this could ultimately look like, he needs to look beyond the uplifting platitudes of fast trade deals with the US that Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, promised during his visit to London earlier this month.Betting the bank on USIf Johnson looks to Hong Kong and listens to the threats thrown at the UK by Beijing, he won't hear anything remotely friendly. Any wish to have a fruitful trade deal with China is exactly that -- a wish.China is on the way up and, thanks to Trump's trade war, the world is heading for an us-versus-them universe. There will be two camps, pro-America; pro-China, and Johnson appears to be betting the bank on America.The recent clashes over Chinese technology firm Huawei was a harbinger of issues that lie ahead.Bolton's trip to London and Johnson's apparent backtracking on allowing the Chinese tech giant to build part pf the UK's 5G network is one of several signals that the UK is tilting towards Trump.China is still hurting from the trade war and the pressure is mountingThe week before he took office, Jeremy Hunt, the UK's former foreign secretary, said Britain would look to EU allies to provide security for British tankers under threat in the Persian Gulf. Hours into office, Johnson turfed Hunt out of the job and gave it to his hardline Brexiteer colleague, Dominic Raab. Raab has wasted little time reversing Hunt's words, thrusting Britain into America's willing arms to help it -- not following the EU lead in securing shipping in the important oil transit waters just off the coast of Iran.It's what America wants, and so, it seems, does Johnson, despite Gibraltar, a UK overseas territory, refusing to accede to US demands to hand over an Iranian oil tanker temporarily impounded there.He has succeeded in convincing the country and the EU he'll leave the 28 nation alliance on 31st of October, \"do or die.\"Bolton says America will support the UK. Of course he did -- Trump wants the EU to be as weak as possible.But it's worth asking the question, is Johnson siding with America simply to make the EU take his no-deal threat more seriously? Or is he really throwing the UK's lot in with America.Then-UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson met President Trump at the UN headquarters in September 2017.Out in the coldIf the latter, where does that leave the UK, post-Brexit?While the EU is far from homogeneous in its view of Trump's America -- Poland, Hungary and some of Italy's leaders are big fans -- Germany and France fear his protectionist anti-EU policies.In China's eyes, the EU may look less like an economic threat than America. Any EU nation will be able to maintain an ambiguous relationship, warm and fuzzy with Trump if they like, but when dealing with China benefiting from the collective bargaining power that the EU brings to trade deals.Should Johnson deliver Brexit, the UK would be out in the cold and at the mercy of an unpredictable US President than might seem to be the case as Johnson bigs up his time with Trump at the G7.Johnson would do well to look at the legacy of another prime minister, Tony Blair. Blair was popular and had a huge majority (which Johnson does not) until he got caught up in former US President George W. Bush's 2003 Iraq war.  Blair lasted 10 years, five of them after the invasion of Iraq. If Johnson gets his gamble wrong, 10 months in office could seem like a stretch, leaving the UK paying the price long after he is forgotten.",

        "content": "(CNN)Longtime coach Richard Callaghan has been permanently banned from US Figure Skating after he was accused in a lawsuit of sexually abusing an underage figure skater. The action comes after the US Center for SafeSport -- the US Olympic Committee agency that has exclusive jurisdiction over allegations of sexual misconduct -- said Callaghan was permanently ineligible to participate in any competition or activity having to do with the US Olympic Committee or the sport's national governing body. US Figure Skating adopted the sanction, effective Wednesday, it said on its website. Earlier this month, Callaghan was accused of repeatedly sexually abusing former US figure skater Adam Schmidt over the course of two years, beginning when Schmidt was about 14 years old. The abuse occurred while Callaghan was coaching Schmidt, the lawsuit alleged, and later at a competition in San Diego. US Figure Skating previously declined to comment on the litigation, but said it \"supports all victims of sexual abuse and misconduct and encourages anyone who has been abused or suspects abuse or misconduct to immediately report it to local law enforcement, the U.S. Center for SafeSport or U.S. Figure Skating.\"Read MoreThe ice skating facility said the claims in the lawsuit were \"very serious\" and \"deserve a thorough investigation.\" The facility said it was first notified of the claims by news outlets and requests for comment from journalists and had yet to receive the lawsuit.The US Center for SafeSport previously suspended Callaghan in March 2018, following allegations that he made sexual advances as early as 1976 toward another young figure skater, who said he was 13 at the time.In an email, Callaghan's attorney, Dean Groulx, told CNN the ban marked a \"sad day for US Olympic sports. A true giant in US figure skating is subject to a lifetime ban without due process.\"Groulx blasted SafeSport, saying that the group \"changed its rules in the middle of its investigation of Richard Callaghan to carry out what can only be characterized, in my opinion, as a witch hunt.\"Schmidt, now 34, is a former member of the US National Figure Skating Team, his lawyers said. \"This announcement is a major victory for all who've suffered abuses by the former legend of figure skating, Mr. Callaghan,\" Schmidt said in a statement Thursday. He went on to accuse US Figure Skating of creating a \"culture of abuse that lasted decades and today is the first of many victories to come in reversing that.\"And Schmidt's attorney, John Manly, hailed the decision, telling CNN, \"This should have been done in the 90's. It's good news but small comfort to those he hurt.\"Callaghan coached figure skater Tara Lipinski to a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics. He also coached 1996 world champion Todd Eldredge.

        "content": "Kingersheim, France (CNN)A growing number of Europeans have decided that they've had enough of inaction in the face of the climate emergency, and they're in training to do something about it.This August, over 1,000 people gathered near the Alsatian town of Kingersheim, France to participate in the third edition of a two-week-long training camp put together by three environmental groups, Alternatiba, Friends of the Earth and ANV-COP21. Its climax was an elaborate exercise designed to simulate the disruption of a climate summit, attended by mock presidents Emmanuel Patron and Mickey Trump. A working lunch was organized for the faux-leaders and both had their own Twitter accounts (@ManuelPatron and @MickeyTrump3).Outside the venue, camp attendees joyfully practiced their freshly minted demonstration skills and waved colorful placards of their own design before phalanxes of fake police officers.Activists simulate a disruption to a climate summit.The youngest participant was under one year old, the eldest 86. Entire families came to learn how to take part in and organize effective protests against climate inaction, following a philosophy that rejects violence, but deems that law-breaking is an acceptable way to send a strong message to decision makers. Read More\"Some people here in the camp are soon going to be on trial,\" said Pauline Boyer, an organizer of the Kingersheim camp. She was referring to environmental activists who, in protest at what they see as weak climate policy, walked into city halls across the country this summer to illegally remove over 100 portraits of French President Emmanuel Macron from the walls. The idea is that the empty space where the photographs used to hang are a symbol the Macron government's dereliction of duty when it comes to climate change.According to Boyer, more than 200 training sessions took place at the camp over 12 days, all geared towards \"giving people concrete solutions, concrete methods to take actions, so when they leave the camp they can go back to their towns and cities and ... build resistance groups to tackle climate change.\"Participants pretend to be police during a protest scenario. The topics of the workshops ranged from how to cut down greenhouse gas emissions at home to cooking for large numbers with an eye to keeping protesters fed. Some taught participants how to carry out \"civil disobedience actions to resist projects that are worsening climate change,\" said Boyer. These non-violent protests often put activists at odds with the law and the police officers tasked with enforcing it.\"I learned, physically, how we can act when police come and hurt us,\" Esther Bernard, 18, one of the camp's first-time attendees, told CNN, emphasizing that \"we are not violent.\"On the camp's closing weekend, CNN witnessed a protest simulation. Around 700 participants were split into teams, with some acting out a demonstration, while others played the role of baton-wielding police officers seeking to break it up -- a chance to practice the non-violent resistance techniques learned earlier in the week.A growing movementAcross Europe, environmental movements are mobilizing and their actions have already been effective in growing their followings, getting politicians' attention and even drawing concessions from legislators.Extinction Rebellion, a UK-based group which stages non-violent civil disobedience campaigns, or \"rebellions,\" was founded just last year. Their first protest in London saw 1,500 demonstrators take over a square to mark their \"Declaration of Rebellion against the UK Government.\" Barely six months later, in April 2019, 6,000 participated in an 11-day blockade of London's roads and bridges, generating a huge amount of publicity. Data provided to CNN by Extinction Rebellion shows their cumulative income jumped 500% in four months, climbing from under $270,000 to nearly $1.3 million between February and May 2019.The group has scheduled a \"Global Rebellion\" for October 7, and now stages UK training camps almost every weekend, according to Alanna Byrne, a media coordinator.Activists stage fake arrests during the demonstration. \"We put people in scenarios like getting arrested and things like that,\" she told CNN. She said there is increasing interest among the public for the training camps. \"None of our events are small anymore. We've held six events in the London Olympic Park,\" she said.In Germany, an alliance of environmental and social justice groups called Ende Gel\u00e4nde (End of Story) specializes in deploying similar techniques to temporarily halt the activity of coal mines. (Coal-fired power plants are responsible for a considerable share of Germany's sizable carbon emissions, but account for a third of the country's energy production.)\"In the months before the actions, we have training all over Germany, where we teach people how to go into the mines, how to react to police, and how to blockade,\" Kathrin Henneberger, a spokesperson for Ende Gel\u00e4nde, told CNN by phone. \"What I see right now, which is really amazing, is there are groups all over Europe being inspired by Ende Gel\u00e4nde.\"These acts of civil disobedience have yielded some results beyond attracting media attention. In the wake of April's Extinction Rebellion protests in London, the UK Parliament agreed to the group's demand that an environment and climate emergency be declared, though the declaration is not legally binding.A threat to public order?For all the excitement they have generated, the willingness of these groups to break the law to give urgency to their demands has led some to see them as a threat to public order, and even to democracy itself. In a white paper published by the influential British think tank Policy Exchange, Richard Walton, a former head of the UK's Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command, wrote of Extinction Rebellion: \"The 'civilian resistance' model they espouse is intended to achieve mass protest accompanied by law-breaking -- leading eventually to the breakdown of democracy and the state. Obscured from public view, these objectives mark Extinction Rebellion's campaign out as an extremist one that seeks to break down the established civil order and liberal democracy in the UK.\"Protesters at the Kingersheim camp learn how to respond to police violence.Contacted by CNN, the French interior ministry declined to comment on whether they considered the Kingersheim training camp a threat to public order.When asked whether concerns about camp attendees turning more extreme in their activism were justified, C\u00e9cile Marchand, a Friends of the Earth trainer who helped run the event, said: \"It's not a secret: we do want to change the system, so for that we need to do more than just convince people, we need to put pressure on them.\"To critics who might call these tactics a threat against public order, Marchand responded: \"People not fighting against climate change are threats against the public order.\"",

Pope John Paul II arrives by helicopter to a \"youth Mass\" in Galway during his 1979 visit.\"When I look back at that visit and see now how it has been remembered, I think about myself at age 13. I was going to Catholic school, I was an altar boy, the youth group I went to took place in a convent. Everything I did, my whole life, the Church was at the center of it,\" O'Gorman said.\"And I think about how Pope John Paul II said he loved me -- well, he didn't.\"Read MoreThis weekend will be a moment of reckoning for survivors in Ireland and across the world, as Pope Francis arrives for the first papal visit to the country in nearly four decades amid an intensifying outcry over Church-related abuse scandals.Executive director of Amnesty International Ireland Colm O'Gorman, who is a clerical abuse survivor, has organized a demonstration during Pope Francis' visit to Dublin.On Sunday, as the Pope delivers a Mass to the faithful in Dublin's Phoenix Park, across town, at the Garden of Remembrance, O'Gorman -- who is now the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland -- will join thousands to protest clerical sexual abuse. The Pope's trip coincides with the World Meeting of Families, a gathering of the Catholic Church that was thrown into chaos last week by a Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing decades of sexual abuses by priests and cover-ups by bishops. Two American cardinals have had to drop out of the meeting as a result of the report, including Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the former Bishop of Pittsburgh and a key papal ally. Weurl, who was accused of helping to cover up abusive behavior, was to deliver the keynote address on \"the welfare of the family.\" In the wake of the report, the bishop said he \"did everything that I possibly could\" to stop abuse from happening.Pope Francis speaks with Cardinal Donald Wuerl during his visit to the US in September 2015. In response to rising anger over the revelations, the Pope issued a letter on Monday acknowledging the church's failure to act over abuse, but the apology has been criticized by victims -- as well as Irish clergy members -- for not going far enough. And after the Archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, sparked outrage earlier this month when he indicated that time would be \"very tight\" for the Pope to meet with abuse survivors on his two-day visit, the Vatican broke with tradition on Tuesday by confirming that private meetings would indeed take place. \n\n    Page 1 of 2018 07 25 Letter for His Holiness Pope Francis\n\n\n\n    Contributed to\n    DocumentCloud by\n    Eric Levenson of\n    CNN \u2022\n    View document or\n    read text\n\n\n\nO'Gorman, who sued the Church and won after being sexually abused by a priest between 1981 and 1983, said the Vatican's announcement had created a \"soap opera\" in Ireland, with members of the media repeatedly calling survivors to ask whether they had been granted an audience with the pontiff.\"I am disgusted with Pope Francis, and utterly repulsed with how the Vatican has conducted itself,\" O'Gorman said, adding that if the Pope cared about victims, he would be dragging documents relating to clerical abuse into St. Peter's Square in Rome for the world to see. As the Catholic Church continues to be rocked by sex abuse scandals spanning the globe -- most recently in the US, Chile and Australia -- pressure is mounting for the Vatican to release records from its secret archives. A demonstrator holds a placard reading \"Devils Disguised as Priests\" during a protest against the sexual abuse scandal in Santiago, Chile.On Monday, BishopAccountability.org, a US-based nonprofit that tracks allegations of abuse against Catholic clergy, published for the first time the names of more than 80 Catholic clerics in Ireland and Northern Ireland it says were convicted of child abuse.\"There are so many names that are unknown in Ireland, so many priests accused, that are under the radar,\" Terry McKiernan, founder of BishopAccountability.org, told CNN, adding that the organization hopes the database will encourage the Church to come forward with the names of all priests disciplined over abuse.Mark Vincent Healy, who was sexually abused by two priests, helped BishopAccountability.org compile the list. In 2014, he became the first male survivor of Irish clerical sex abuse to meet with Pope Francis, but he says the Church hasn't done enough in the intervening years.Terry McKiernan (left) at a 2003 protest in Boston carrying a cross with names of Catholic clergy members accused of sexual abuse. \"We're still fighting the same statute of limitations, we're still trying to get services for survivors, we're still trying to stem the self-harm and suicide rates, we're still trying to open closed records. It's too slow,\" Healy told CNN. Urgent calls for action, and exasperation over the same \"cut-and-paste\" apologies, are being echoed by survivors across Ireland. Marie Collins, who was assaulted by a priest at the age of 13, resigned last year from a special Vatican commission created by Pope Francis to tackle child abuse, saying that senior clerics in the Church refused to implement their suggested safety policies.\"What I would like to see when the Pope comes to Ireland, is to come out, not make these sort of 'we're sorry' type of statements, but to tell\u00a0us what is he going to do -- and do it,\" Collins told CNN. \"And it must be something concrete.\"But there is less consensus about what those concrete steps might be.JUST WATCHEDListen: Irish politician recounts clergy abuseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHListen: Irish politician recounts clergy abuse 01:22Since the first reports of abusive priests were released in Ireland in 2005, a torrent of revelations detailing abuse and mistreatment in Catholic-run institutions -- from orphanages, to industrial schools, workhouses known as Magdalene Laundries and so-called mother-and-baby-homes -- have followed.While Ireland has pledged \u20ac1.5 billion\u00a0to victims through a financial redress program, abuse survivor Michael O'Brien said that compensation wasn't enough -- calling on Pope Francis to do more.\"He must talk to us and tell us what he's going to do about the rape of children that's been done by priests of the Catholic Church today,\" said O'Brien, a former politician who rose to prominence a decade ago after revealing on Irish television that he was abused in a Catholic school as a child.\"We're fed up with all this. We want closure. We want it to stop,\" he told CNN. \"I don't see anything at the end of the tunnel. Until I hear something else from the Pope, I won't believe it.\"",

I think, ultimately, this is why they've taken a punt on Sarri.\"If the new coach, who ahead of the new season's start was laid low by pneumonia, can quickly implement Sarri-ball and get this team purring like his Napoli of old, this new-look squad could be Juve's most exciting yet.Cristiano Ronaldo is looking to add to his tally of five Champions League titles.But should Juve take its eye off the ball domestically, the new and improved sides will be ready to take advantage.\"I don't think (Juve) will dominate quite like last year because I think the competition has got better,\" Horncastle says of the Bianconeri's Serie A opponents. \"And there are some question marks about the new manager.\"In that, is he a good fit for Juventus? They're trying to do something very different with a manager who is very different from ones they've had in the past.\"But it's a very ambitious appointment and if he can implement that style of play with this group of Juventus players, it could be the best Juventus we've ever seen.\"Pretenders to the throneInter Milan is arguably best placed to steal Juventus' crown this season and not solely down to the signings it has made on the pitch.Conte returns to his domestic league for the first time since leaving Juve in 2014 for a two-year stint as head coach of the Italian national team.The 50-year-old, who won the Premier League and FA Cup in two seasons at Chelsea, is in charge of an exciting new crop of youngsters headed up by the experienced arrivals of Uruguayan defender Diego Godin and Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku.\"With Antonio Conte at the helm of Inter, he will stop at nothing to win the Scudetto and put Inter back where he feels they rightly belong,\" Horncastle said.\"Conte, for me, is one of, if not the biggest signing that the league has had, be it a coach or player, this season. I think Inter will be a formidable opponent for Juventus this year and it will go very close.\"Could Antonio Conte's Inter dethrone Juventus at the top of Serie A?Already in the mix from recent seasons is Napoli, whose settled squad could be ready to mount another title challenge after finishing 11 points back in second last term during Ancelotti's first, transitional season in charge.\"I think one of the reasons those guys have come back is because Serie A has an appeal again that it has lost,\" Horncastle said. \"I think they, particularly Conte, want to win and if he doesn't believe he can assemble a winning team, then he's not interested.\"More Milan misery?Meanwhile, AC Milan has recently appointed its sixth manager since 2014 after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the fifth consecutive season.Former player Gennaro Gattuso was the latest coach to walk out of Milan's revolving managerial door and was replaced by Marco Giampaolo following his good work with Sampdoria.\"Milan has been somewhat of an enigma over the last few seasons,\" football journalist Mina Rzouki told CNN Sport. \"And this is going to be the task that Giampaolo has, to instill something into this new team that has been regenerated once again.\"Having them play beautiful and progressive football -- which is what the style is at Milan and we always know they are a glamorous team, they're not the hardworking Juve but they're the beautiful Milan -- and when you have coaches such an Ancelotti and Conte, I'm not entirely sure he can compete with them.\"However, without the appeal of Champions League football, Milan has been forced to approach the transfer market from a different angle to its rivals.Marco Giampaolo in his last home match as Sampdoria manager.An influx of exciting young talent, headlined by striker Rafael Le\u00e3o and Real Madrid defender Theo Hernandez, provides an ideal template for Giampaolo to work with.\"This has the potential to be quite exciting,\" Horncastle said. \"One of the reasons why Milan has signed Giampaolo is not only because his teams play really good football, they're great to watch and they do well against the big teams, but also for a team club that doesn't own its own stadiu and  isn't getting into the Champions League -- how to you make money?\"You make money by signing young players who you develop and then sell on in some cases. Giampaolo has been fantastic at that.\"Among those talented youngsters to be sold during his time in charge at Sampdoria were Milan \u0160kriniar, Lucas Torreira, Bruno Fernandes and Patrik Schick.Two seasons ago, when Napoli pushed Juventus to the penultimate match of the campaign and led the league table for long periods, it looked as though the Turin club's era of dominance was coming to an end.However, last year's title procession reaffirmed that the best of the rest were still light years behind Italy's powerhouse.This season, though, that could be about to change.",

The reigning African footballer of the year sampled gourmet cuisine in five-star restaurants, relaxed on beaches, and kept himself in shape with some light training at the Nad al Sheba (NAS) sports complex. Mo Salah on women's rights in the Middle East and the Amr Warda controversyThis was not Salah's first trip to the complex, nor even his first this year. His Liverpool team booked in for a training camp in January, as did Premier League rivals Manchester United - who also visited the previous year. Arsenal were guests in March, adding their names to an illustrious list that includes Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, and AC Milan. Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo dropped in over his winter holidays. The appeal is not limited to footballers. Read MoreWorld number one tennis player Novak Djokovic posed for a selfie with the Crown Prince of Dubai at NAS in 2016.          View this post on Instagram           Your Royal Highness, thank you very much for allowing me to train in the best sports facility in the world. It was great pleasure to meet you. A post shared by  Novak Djokovic (@djokernole) on Oct 8, 2016 at 1:48am PDT From the Australian cricket team to UFC champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, the cream of international sporting royalty are flocking to the site. But why?'Aiming to be the best'The NAS complex, situated close by the world's most expensive horse racecourse, was designed with the aspiration to become one of the world's best. \"We aim to be recognised as an elite destination,\" says NAS director of sport Robert Wadsworth. Feedback from star clients - he prefers not to name names - suggests the service is \"comparable and in some cases significantly better than the facilities they are used to.\" Some clients have been happy to volunteer glowing reviews, such as Djokovic, who wrote a thank you note on Instagram \"for allowing me to train in the best sports facility in the world.\"Read More: 'World's longest desert ultramarathon' launches in Dubai'The sprawling site comprises a wide range of indoor and outdoor features. There are two FIFA-standard football pitches and an athletics track, as well as indoor arenas for badminton, volleyball, futsal (similar to five-a-side football) and martial arts. Mamadou Sakho, a defender for Premier League Crystal Palace, makes use of an anti-gravity treadmill.The complex also includes facilities for simulating different altitudes, cryotherapy chambers that aid recovery after exercise, swimming and hydrotherapy resources, as well as a sports science lab and medical support teams.\"The Nad Al Sheba Sports Complex is an evolving project, growing by the week, month and year,\" says Nasser Aman Al Rahma, assistant secretary general of Dubai Sports Council (DSC). Tailored usageDifferent clients find different uses for the complex. \"In the main it is for training camps either pre-season or mid-season, and injury rehabilitation and recovery,\" says Wadsworth.\"We have a host of soccer teams from the European leagues who will train with us from January to March when (many) leagues have winter breaks. We host teams from Asia from November to February when they are doing pre-season work.\"10 things visitors can do in Dubai that they couldn't a decade agoThe site also hosts athletes and teams as they prepare for specific tournaments, Wadsworth adds. \"Cricket Australia completed their pre-tour testing at NAS before flying to the UK for the World Cup and The Ashes.\" Beyond the function, Wadsworth believes privacy is a major part of the appeal for high-profile visitors. NAS is a private facility that takes pride in safeguarding against interruptions from the media or public.  That Dubai is used to catering for the rich and famous also allows a degree of anonymity for clients on their downtime, who can enjoy a quiet meal or visit local landmarks without being swarmed by sports fans.Commercial value The regular presence of star athletes at the NAS complex may bring benefits for both hosts and visitors. \"Several countries in the Gulf region are using warm weather training camps as part of their sports development strategies,\" says Professor Simon Chadwick, a sports business expert at the University of Salford, in the UK.\"They have positioned themselves as health and training destinations with the intention of drawing in athletes and teams, raising awareness of their facilities and, hence, driving long-term business.\"The Australian cricket team at the NAS Sports Complex in Dubai ahead of this year's World CupA 2015 Deloitte report also noted the potential benefits for boosting awareness and tourism.\"The use of Dubai as a location for warm weather training in the winter months is proving increasingly popular for football teams,\" the report states. \"If marketed correctly Dubai could in time become the 'go-to' venue for a significant number of clubs, with resulting opportunities for training (and) exhibition matches.\" \"Mass participation events also have considerable potential in attracting additional sports tourists.\"Read More: The most spectacular money-no-object experiences in DubaiChadwick believes there are also benefits for visiting sportspeople beyond their physical fitness.\"By training in the Gulf athletes and teams can raise their profiles across the region, build fan engagement, and establish potentially lucrative relations with commercial partners,\" he says.  The presence of commercial considerations in trips to Dubai has been highlighted by visitors such as Bernd Wehmeyer, manager of German football team Hamburg SV, who said the club's sponsorship by Emirates Airline was a factor in the choice of destination.Wider ambitionsThe development of relationships with international sports stars is taking place alongside a wider drive to develop sporting participation and infrastructure in Dubai.The Emirate recently opened the 17,000-seat Coca-Cola Arena which will host football, basketball and ice hockey. Dubai also upgraded facilities such as the Al Maktoum Stadium for the 2019 Asian Cup, held in the UAE. \"There are many other sports projects under discussion,\" says Aman Al Rahma, listing plans for new bicycle tracks and golf courses in the desert.  Read More: 'World's most famous' helipad on Burj al Arab turns 20The DSC is also aiming to boost participation across all demographics, says Aman Al Rahma, with the aim of making Dubai \"one of the most physically active places on the planet.\" \"That is why, if you look at Dubai's annual sports calendar, you will find a number of community sports events alongside the star-studded elite sporting extravaganzas,\" he says.Having secured an influx of international talent, Dubai is also seeking to cultivate its own.",

        "content": "(CNN)Novak Djokovic was just 11 years old and asleep in his bed in Belgrade when a loud explosion, followed by the sound of shattering glass and air raid sirens woke him up.It's March 24, 1999, and the air strikes on the Serbian capital mark the beginning of what would be a 78-day campaign by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to try and bring to an end atrocities committed by Yugoslavia's then-president Slobodan Milosevic's troops against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo.While his father, Srdjan, helped his mother, Dijana, who  temporarily lost consciousness after hitting her head against the radiator following the first explosion, Djokovic searched for his brothers, eight-year-old Marko and four-year-old Djordje, in their pitch dark apartment.\"At 11, I was the big brother,\" the top-ranked Serb wrote in \"Serve to win,\" his 2013 autobiography. \"I'd been holding myself responsible for their safety ever since NATO forces started bombing my hometown of Belgrade.\"A woman walks on March 22, 2014 in front of the building of the former federal Interior Ministry in Belgrade, which was destroyed during the 1999 NATO air campaign against Serbia and Montenegro. READ: Djokovic wins fifth Wimbledon title after longest finalRead MoreREAD: Wimbledon victory was 'mentally the most demanding' of my careerRemarkable journeyTwo decades on, the now 32-year-old Djokovic is the favorite to win the US Open, which starts August 26 in New York. Such has been his dominance in the past year, he has clinched four of the last five slams. He now holds 16 majors, just two shy of Rafael Nadal of Spain, and four behind men's Grand Slam record holder Roger Federer of Switzerland.His journey from war-torn Belgrade to the top of the men's game has been nothing short of remarkable. In the introduction to his autobiography, Djokovic explained how the odds were heavily stacked against him.\"A boy like me, growing up in Serbia, becoming a tennis champion? It was unlikely in even the best of circumstances. And it became ever more unlikely when the bombs started dropping,\" he wrote.     READ: Are smartphones holding back tennis's next generation?Bomb shelterIn the first chapter of his autobiography, titled \"Backhands and Bomb Shelters,\" Djokovic vividly recalls the night that changed his life forever.After Dijana regained consciousness, the Djokovic family entered the unlit streets of Belgrade and tried to make their way to the nearby apartment building of an aunt's family, which had a bomb shelter.  While his parents ran down the streets, holding his younger brothers, Djokovic suddenly found himself all alone after he fell flat on his face in the street.\"And then it happened,\" Djokovic wrote. \"Rising up from over the roof of our building came the steel gray triangle of an F-117 bomber.\" \"What happened next would never leave me,\" he said. \"Even today, loud sounds fill me with fear.\" The bomber dropped two laser-guided missiles right over his head, which struck a hospital building a few streets away. \"I remember the sandy, dusty, metallic shell in the air, and how the whole city seemed to glow like a ripe tangerine,\" Djokovic said in his book.The streets now covered in light, Djokovic spotted his parents and brothers in the far distance, and chased after them until they all reached the concrete shelter safely.There were about 20 families hiding in the shelter.\"There were children crying. I didn't stop shivering for the rest of the night,\" Djokovic said in his book.In a 2015 interview with CNN television, Djokovic recalled the bombing campaign, during which he and his family would spend each night in the shelter from 8 p.m., and only had electricity for a few hours each day. \"Those times are certainly something that I don't wish for anybody to experience,\" he said. \"Two-and-a-half months, every single day and night, bombs coming into the city. We saw planes flying over our heads, and literally rockets and bombs landing half a mile away.\"Djokovic pictured with his wife Jelena.'Magic childhood'Until that dark spring night in 1999, Djokovic had enjoyed what he called in his autobiography, a \"magic childhood.\"His father Srdjan was a former pro skier and Djokovic first started playing tennis at the age of four. No one in his family had played the sport before.Djokovic, who spent large parts of his youth in the small Serbian mountain resort of Kopaonik, where his parents ran a pizza parlor, told CNN television in 2014: \"It was kind of like a destiny. Something that just happened out of the blue. I saw the tennis court and I saw tennis on TV when I was four. My father bought me a small tennis racket and that's when I think we all fell in love with the sport.\"At the age of six, he was spotted in Kopaonik by the late Serbian coach Jelena Gencic, who had worked with Serbian-born former world No. 1 and nine-time major winner Monica Seles of the US. Soon after, Gencic told his parents Djokovic was \"the greatest talent I have seen since Monica Seles.\" The pair would work together for five years, during which Gencic taught her pupil many life lessons. Djokovic was so grief-stricken when he heard of her death during the 2013 French Open, he canceled his post-match press conference. Novak Djokovic's son Stefan, 3, watches his father hoist the Wimbledon trophy in July 2018. Different perspective Although the bombing raids could easily have ended his tennis career, it put life in a completely different perspective, Djokovic told CNN television in 2015.\"It gave me much more appreciation for all the values that I have in my life,\" he said. \"From tennis to whatever. I know what it feels like being without anything more or less, and then being on top of the world in this very global and popular sport in the world. So this contrast gives me the right perspective in life.\"Although Djokovic said in his autobiography the relentless bombing campaign, the largest military operation in NATO history, left him feeling \"helpless,\" it didn't stop him playing tennis.Serbia's Novak Djokovic kisses the winner's trophy after beating Roger Federer in a five-set epic final at Wimbledon last month.In fact, Djokovic stepped up his training sessions during the 11-week campaign. He practised for up to five hours a day at sites across Belgrade chosen by Gencic, based on where the most recent bombs had fallen, in the hope NATO planes wouldn't target the same place twice.From being paralyzed by fear initially, something changed as the strikes continued, Djokovic said in his book.\"We decided to stop being afraid,\" he said. \"After so much death, so much destruction, we simply stopped hiding. Once you realize you are truly powerless, a certain sense of freedom takes over.\"No. 1On June 10, 1999, the air strikes ended, after Milosevic agreed to troop withdrawals from Kosovo.In September of that year, the now 12-year-old Djokovic left Serbia for Munich, Germany, to train at the tennis academy of former Yugoslav pro Niki Pilic. He would turn pro four years later. In 1994, the then seven-year-old Djokovic appeared on Serbian TV, confidently telling his interviewer: \"The goal for me is to become the world No. 1.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosSeventeen years later, he became the first Serbian player to rise to the No. 1 ranking on the men's ATP Tour after he won his first Wimbledon title.",

        "content": "(CNN)Anton \"Squeezer\" Andersson, the daredevil who in 2017 became the youngest wingsuit pilot to fly through a solid target at 250km/h (155mph), has been back on the record-breaking trail.The 25-year-old, from Sk\u00f6vde in the south of Sweden, attempted two new record-breaking jumps in July: the longest distance wingsuit flight from a cliff, and the smallest target hit from a BASE jump.Andersson's double achievement involved two grueling climbs, the first beginning in complete darkness in the early hours of the morning.  Accompanied by a support team of three climbers, their paths to the summit lit only by helmet lamps, he scaled Switzerland's tallest peak: Jungfrau, near the city of Bern, standing at 4,158 meters.\"I've climbed mountains before, but this was really raising the bar. Navigating crevasses with ice axes, crampons and ropes,\" the Swede told CNN Sport.Read MoreREAD: 'As I took off I knew there was no way back,' says snowboarderREAD: Climbing 3,000 feet without ropesAnton \"Squeezer\" Andersson is a 25-year-old professional wingsuit pilot.Deep, deep feeling of fearNear the top of the mountain, Andersson needed to abseil down an exposed face, in almost complete darkness, above a sheer drop of 500m. He describes the descent, and being lowered down by his colleague, as one of the scariest moments of his life.\"It's this incredibly deep, deep feeling of fear,\" he explains. \"It's a huge commitment of trust, and the fear, which is felt through the entire body. It's like your entire body is just bubbling, from top to bottom, it's fully vibrating, I cannot describe it.\"Once at the summit, switching from climbing to jumping mode was also a challenge. \"The climb in itself is more like an endurance thing,\" Andersson says.  \"I have to ensure that I have enough energy to do the jump and have a clear mind. It's definitely harder to focus -- the air in the atmosphere at that altitude is much thinner.\"The Swede climbing the mountain ahead of his record breaking attempts.READ: 'The thrill, the fear and the excitement'READ: Ross Edgley -- 'It was goosebumps upon tears, upon smiles''Jumping mode'The Swede has a routine that he follows to prepare, which helps banish any doubts about the task ahead.  \"To control the fear, I always have to go into the same 'jumping mode,'\" he added. \"It's a ritual, a technique that I do before jumping off, I'm taking deep breaths and getting my body fully connected to what I'm going to do. Feeling the winds, judging the entire situation, and then getting ready and pushing off.\"Once airborne, those doubts quickly evaporate.  \"It's this amazing feeling of freedom. Nothing else matters, there's just that moment, that first few seconds when you're accelerating,\" he says. \"It's a feeling of joy, it's a feeling of freedom, and just this feeling that nothing else matters.  It's a really addictive feeling.\"After flying for two minutes, joined by wingsuit cameraman Scotty Nice -- who jumped from a helicopter to shoot the record attempt -- Andersson deployed his parachute and touched down. This time, however, he had another immediate goal in mind. He began the ascent of the 2,190m Stockhorn mountain, to tackle his next record attempt -- a precision flight to hit a tiny target.JUST WATCHEDClimbing a 3,000-foot cliff without ropesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClimbing a 3,000-foot cliff without ropes 02:48'You almost feel drunk'Andersson told CNN Sport that, despite a rigorous training regime, the second climb of the day was a serious physical challenge, particularly as he neared the jumping off point.\"It was a kind of dizzy and light-headed feeling, you almost feel a little bit drunk,\" he explains. \"You can't really think much more than about keeping the focus and breathing properly, to get enough oxygen through your body, because if you don't, it's easy to pass out, or have experiences that you don't want to.\"Once in position, it was also a struggle to make out the 30cm x 30cm Styrofoam target positioned far below him.\"I remember standing on the edge trying to see the target that I was going to hit, but it was so small that I could barely see it from a distance,\" he explains. \"We knew where it was, but it couldn't be seen from the cliff edge.\"Andersson says the feeling before his second record-attempting jump was almost like being drunk.'Every moment is critical'For such an intricate flight, details are enormously important, Anderson says.  \"Everything from jumping off to hitting the sign and opening the parachute, every moment is really critical to making it safe, and not more dangerous than it already is.\"Andersson launched off, swooping down the mountainside towards his goal. His trajectory was flawless, and he hit the target perfectly.\"It's so fast that you can barely say if you hit the target or not,\" Andersson recalls. \"I mean I knew I hit it, but I didn't know I hit it so centrally.\"The record breaker describes a feeling of enormous satisfaction when he landed.  \"There's this amazing feeling of accomplishment after landing, just laying down on the ground, and laughing of relief and of accomplishment of course.\"READ: 'It's like meditation.

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK seems to be obsessed with the man at the heart of its new government.He is widely regarded as a political genius. His name is in the papers every day. Some believe he was the single most important figure behind the country's decision to leave the European Union. And after three years of Brexit paralysis, he has promised to spend every waking hour in a herculean effort to make Brexit happen on October 31, do or die.This man is not Boris Johnson, the new British Prime Minister, but his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings.If Johnson was the face of the official Brexit campaign, Vote Leave, Cummings was its brain. He is credited with creating the \"Take Back Control\" slogan and calculating the Brexiteers' widely-debunked claims that the UK sends \u00a3350 million ($424 million) to Brussels every week. Once a political outsider, he's now at the center of Johnson's efforts to prise the UK out of the EU in two months' time.For this profile, CNN spoke to multiple British government officials, civil servants, and former colleagues of Cummings. Most agreed to be quoted only on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly. Some would not be quoted at all amid concerns about discussing one of the most powerful -- and sometimes feared -- men in the UK. Read MoreAlmost everyone CNN spoke with agreed on one thing about Cummings -- his single-minded zeal to get the job in front of him done. The Leave campaign's success, it's often said, was down to its singular focus on a simple message. And the decision to have such a simple message was made by Cummings.\"What sets him apart from many people is the unbelievable strategic focus on the task at hand. Dom's favorite phrase was always 'don't get stuck in the weeds,'\" says Gisela Stuart, a former opposition party lawmaker who chaired the Vote Leave campaign.Dominic Cummings was once a political outsider. Now he's at the heart of the UK government.A loathing for elitesCummings, 47, is not the sort of person typically associated with top-level politics. Despite having spent his whole career working for conservative politicians and a conservative think tank, he claims to have never been a member of any political party and loathes large parts of the governing Conservative party he now serves.He has stated publicly that he had to be convinced to lead Vote Leave. \"I wasn't massively keen to get involved with this,\" he said in 2017, claiming that he'd had enough of the Conservative party's infighting over Brexit.Cummings largely shuns the spotlight -- Downing Street was approached for comment for this article but declined to provide any. He seems to revel in his reputation of being an irascible eccentric, his vast intellect perfectly matched with an instinctive understanding of how normal people think. Friends say he detests the political elites and relishes being seen as the strategic genius they all aspire to be.As a close friend puts it: \"All of the charlatans and spivs are courtiers to the people at the top of their parties. They are all looking at Dom because he is doing what they wanted to do. The only problem is, they're bulls, they're just style. Dom is the substance.\" His physical appearance can be messy: On the day Johnson took up residence in Downing Street, he was pictured in an old T-shirt, lurking in the corner. His manner can be bizarre: \"He used to turn up to work wearing deliberately scruffy clothes and would quite often just sleep at his desk overnight,\" says a former colleague who worked with Cummings during his time as a political adviser to the Conservative party when it was in opposition.  Dominic Cummings is seen in the background (R) on the day Boris Johnson (L) first entered 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister.Some colleagues find his behavior divisive. David Laws, a former Liberal Democrat lawmaker who worked with Cummings in the coalition government led by David Cameron, described him as a \"Grade-A political rottweiler.\" He doesn't suffer fools and has a reputation for dismissing those he doesn't respect.Such was the fascination with Cummings and his role in Brexit, he was portrayed in a recent biopic by none other than Benedict Cumberbatch. James Graham, who wrote \"Brexit: The Uncivil War,\" says his decision to make Cummings the central character was easy. \"He is different, and different is fun... He doesn't speak or talk or behave like other political strategists I have met.\"Cummings was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in 'Brexit: The Uncivil War.'Since entering Downing Street Cummings has embarked on a wide-ranging shakeup of the civil service and the army of government aides, known as \"special advisers,\" or in the Westminster parlance \"spads,\" multiple sources have told CNN. Longer hours, endless reams of paperwork preparing for Brexit and canceled vacations have become normal. Cummings' devotion to work and enormous energy is being instilled across government.Yet despite this sudden increase in workload, it's hard to find anyone currently working with Cummings who has a bad word to say about him. Many civil servants and special advisers say that after former Prime Minister Theresa May's repeated failure to deliver Brexit, a single-minded commitment to leave the EU with or without a deal on October 31 has given them a fresh sense of purpose.While Cummings' eccentric style had been evident earlier in his career, it was when working as an adviser to then education secretary Michael Gove in 2010 that his way of doing things began to attract wider attention.  He was reportedly dismissive of David Cameron and Nick Clegg, the Prime Minister and deputy prime minister for whom he and Gove worked. David Laws wrote in his book \"Coalition\" that Cummings once said to him while discussing education policy, \"I don't like Clegg, but I think Cameron and No. 10 are muppets as well. They have no idea what they are doing.\" Cummings eventually left this job in 2014. Then he let rip.JUST WATCHEDWorries over Boris Johnson and a 'no-deal' BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWorries over Boris Johnson and a 'no-deal' Brexit 02:27In the years between leaving government and starting Vote Leave, Cummings retreated to his father's farm in the north of England and read. A lot. He would occasionally publish his thoughts on politics, politicians and more in long posts on his blog.Here, Cummings mused on issues far bigger than the politics of the day. He wrote extensively about how artificial intelligence and machine learning were developing faster than the brains of humans, and the dangers presented by this development. He wrote about how, post Brexit, the UK should consider working with the entrepreneur Jeff Bezos to build a moon base to advance international cooperation and \"create real long-term value for humanity.\"And, of course, in almost all of these blogposts, he savaged the political establishment, both in London and Brussels, for its limited ambition and failure to prepare for what he saw as a longer-term crisis facing the human race.What motivated a man who so hates the establishment and wanted to leave politics lead a campaign that ultimately placed him at the heart of it?  \"If the UK leaves on 31 October... I think in his view that will be halfway through the mission; the second part will be the reorganization of government,\" explains a friend of Cummings.This ambition to change government is one side of the Cummings' master plan. The other is his belief that politics simply doesn't adequately serve the public. Cummings was behind the debunked claims by Vote Leave that the UK sent \u00a3350 million a week to the EU.Several former colleagues explained that his disdain for the ruling class came from his belief that for too long, the political elite had ignored the masses. In 2017, Cummings took particular aim at the Conservative party, claiming the view among much of the public was that it \"is run by people who basically don't care about people like m... I am sad to say the public is basically correct.\"And it's this single-minded drive that so many admire in Cummings that enables them to overlook his flaws. \"He's eccentric, he's off the wall, but he's never, in my experience, been wrong,\" says a Conservative party insider who worked with Cummings in the coalition government of 2010 to 2015. \"His political judgment is brilliant... everyone who is on the opposing side should be astonishingly frightened.\" \"Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved,\" wrote the Italian diplomat Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. That might have been true in 16th century Europe, but Machiavelli didn't have to deal with the UK's notoriously bureaucratic civil service, nor the intransigence of the European Union. Could Brexit be his downfall?Delivering Brexit rubs up against both of these obstructions. And it's here that even Cummings' admirers predict that his busy, take-no-prisoners approach to government could ultimately be his downfall. The civil service in London has a particular habit of wearing political appointments down. In Brussels, the EU also presents a challenge. However popular Cummings might be now, some in Westminster think that his way of doing things isn't sustainable. \"I would say that he is very good at delivering a short-term task and cutting through the bulls to deliver that. I am not convinced he will be around in government in long term,\" says one of his former colleagues. Fortunately for Cummings, the job in hand has a firm deadline of October 31. After that, he might find himself eased out of Downing Street so that Johnson can begin governing more traditionally. Cummings is a paradox that even Machiavelli might struggle to understand. He is simultaneously loved, feared and respected. People who disagree with his methods cannot deny his genius and privately wish he was on their side. And despite his career of rejecting the establishment and political mainstream, his star continues to rise. It's worth remembering that in 2016, the Leave campaign was the underdog. No one believed that Cummings could pull off a victory for the pro-Brexit campaign. And even if the UK voted to leave -- as it did, narrowly -- the idea of leaving the EU without a deal was unthinkable. Now, it seems to be the most likely outcome.\"One of the best decisions that Matthew Elliot (chief executive of Vote Leave) made was to bring Dom in to run the strategy side of the Leave campaign. No one thought we could win the thing, but he had a plan, he stuck to it and it worked,\" says Daniel Hannan, a prominent Leave campaigner, and friend of Cummings.The outsider who defeated the British establishment now stands inside the most important building in London, ready to take on the Brussels establishment. The odds are stacked against him, and some believe his project is doomed to fail.But if history tells us anything, when Cummings seizes a plan and sticks to it, his opponents tend to break first. It's little wonder that Boris Johnson wanted him by his side as he embarks on the most controversial period in British political history.",

In 2017, her ship, the Iuventa, was seized by authorities in the Italian port of Lampedusa, and she was subsequently charged with assisting illegal immigration. Klemp is currently awaiting trial and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted, she told Swiss newspaper Basler Zeitung in June.

A report the previous year by the UK's National Audit Office blamed, among other factors, rises in rental costs and the capping and freezing of housing benefits, which began in 2011, for the rapid increase in homelessness across the country.It said the government's approach to working with local authorities to tackle the problem was \"light touch,\" adding: \"This contrasts with the more interventionist approach that it has taken during previous periods of high homelessness.\"In response to the new report, a government spokesperson told CNN: \"No child should have to live in dangerous accommodation and we are working to ensure all families have a safe place to stay. \"We have invested \u00a31.2bn to tackle all types of homelessness, and we are working closely with councils across the country to reduce the number of families in temporary accommodation.\"",

The other is a battle for survival as a solitary human hurtles down a skyscraper of water, riding the boundary between life and death at mind bending speeds.But for all their differences, those at the elite level of each sport understand that failures carries consequences. It was with that in mind that Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp invited professional surfer Sebastian Steudtner into the Reds training camp in Evian, France, ahead of the 2019/20 English Premier League season's start.\"I just shared my mindset, how I live my life, how I approach my sport, how I approach performance,\" the 34-year-old Steudtner told CNN Sport's Don Riddell.\"We discovered there are a lot of similarities.

He is a good leader and is really humble. He never seems stressed in a bad way.

        "content": "Melbourne (CNN)Former Vatican treasurer George Pell will remain in prison after an Australian appeals court rejected the disgraced cardinal's appeal against his conviction for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in the mid-1990s.The most senior Catholic official to be convicted of child sexual assault, Pell was sentenced in March to six years in prison, with a non-parole period of three years and eight months, for an attack described by Chief Judge Peter Kidd as \"breathtakingly arrogant.\"Lawyers for the 78-year-old cardinal immediately appealed his conviction, and in June presented 13 \"solid obstacles\" to a guilty verdict on all five charges, including that it was \"not possible\" for Pell to be alone while robed after Sunday mass and for no one to notice the boys were missing at that time.On Wednesday, the appeals court rejected that submission, accepting that it was possible for the jury to have found Pell guilty beyond reasonable doubt, based on the evidence presented at Pell's five-week trial last December.\"There has been vigorous and sometimes emotional criticism of the Cardinal and he has been publicly vilified in some sections of the community,\" said Chief Justice Anne Ferguson as she delivered a summary of the judgment. \"It is fair to say that his case has divided the community.\"Cardinal George Pell was wearing his clerical collar as he sat in the dock for his appeal ruling on Wednesday, August 21. Read MoreFrom the dock in court 15, Pell showed little reaction as Chief Justice Ferguson delivered Wednesday's verdict, which followed more than two months of deliberation between three judges who returned a majority ruling, two votes for and one against. Pell listened intently during the summary, staring straight at the judge.Pell's accuser, who can't be named under Australian law, said he was \"relieved\" by the verdict.\"After attending the funeral of my childhood friend, the other choirboy, I felt a responsibility to come forward... I had experienced something terrible as a child, something that marked my life. I wanted at least some good to come of it,\" he said in a statement read by his lawyer, Viv Waller.The father of his childhood friend, who also can't be identified, said the ruling had taken a \"weight off his shoulders.\" \"I believe in forgiveness, but you can't forgive someone who does things like that, especially to 13-year-old children,\" he said.After the hearing, Pell was taken away to continue serving his sentence on one count of sexual penetration of a child and four counts of committing an indecent act with a child.A statement released on his behalf said the cardinal is \"obviously disappointed\" with the decision and \"maintains his innocence.\" His legal team will examine the judgment to determine whether to challenge the ruling in the High Court, it added. In a short statement, the Holy See acknowledged the ruling and noted that Pell has the right to appeal. \"The Holy See confirms its closeness to the victims of sexual abuse and its commitment to pursue, through the competent ecclesiastical authorities, those members of the clergy who commit such abuse,\" the statement said.Cardinal George Pell is seen addressing the audience during the Opening Mass of Welcome of World Youth Day Sydney 2008 at Barangaroo on July 15, 2008 in Sydney, Australia.Cardinal's convictionWednesday's ruling marks another twist in a story that has gripped the global Catholic community since Pell's conviction was reported in February. Before that, reporting of his trial and verdict had been suppressed to avoid prejudicing a third potential trial, relating to different charges, that was subsequently dropped.Pell was convicted by a 12-member jury in December, largely on the testimony of one accuser, a man now in his 30s who, as an alleged sex abuse victim, can't be identified under Australian law. The second alleged victim died several years ago having never told anyone about the alleged attack. It was Pell's second trial on the same charges -- the first trial, also held in secret, ended in a hung jury after the jurors failed to agree on a verdict. JUST WATCHEDAustralian survivors of clerical abuse tell their storiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralian survivors of clerical abuse tell their stories 04:34In taped evidence played to a closed court -- to only the judge and the jury -- the man told how he and his friend had snuck away from the rest of the choir to drink wine in the priest's sacristy after mass one Sunday. Both were 13 years old at the time.The man told the court Pell had caught them drinking wine and said something like \"you're in trouble,\" according to Judge Kidd's summary of the case. Pell then started moving something under his robe, the man said, before he sexually assaulted them, one after the other, Judge Kidd's sentencing notes said. During the ordeal, which lasted five to six minutes, the boys were \"sobbing,\" the man said in his testimony. At one stage, Pell told them to be quiet, \"because they were crying,\" Judge Kidd recounted. Neither boy told anyone about the ordeal, until 2015 when the man approached Victoria Police to file a formal complaint. By then, he had attended the funeral of his former friend, who had died from an accidental overdose after years of drug abuse. The appealAt the appeal hearing in June, Pell's lawyer Bret Walker SC presented 13 \"solid obstacles\" why it was \"not possible\" for Pell to have committed the alleged attack. He also cast doubt on the man's account. In Wednesday's ruling, Chief Justice Ferguson said she and Justice Chris Maxwell rejected all 13 obstacles. They said the victim was \"clearly not a liar, was not a fantasist and was a witness of truth.\" The dissenting judge, Justice Mark Weinberg, said discrepancies in the victim's account left him with some doubt.Pell's lawyers also appealed the conviction on two other grounds, which would have led to a potential a re-trial. They included that the defense should have been allowed to show an animated video and that Pell should have entered a not guilty plea in front of the jury. Both grounds were refused.The Catholic Bishops Conference of Australia released a statement, saying \"all Australians must be equal under the law and accept today's judgment accordingly.\" A Vatican spokesman told CNN on Monday that the church \"awaits the results of the ongoing process and the decisions of civil justice before dealing with the case.\" When Pell's guilty verdict was made public, the Vatican said it would launch its own investigation into Pell.  Pell was granted leave from the Vatican to contest the charges. In February, after his conviction became public, the Church confirmed that his position as the prefect of its secretariat for the economy had not been renewed. And, along with two other cardinals, Pell lost his place on the Pope's small council of advisers last year, which the Vatican attributed to his advancing age.Pell has 28 days to appeal Wednesday's ruling in Australia's High Court, the country's highest-ranking court. Any ruling made there would be final and not subject to appeal.",

Carrasco fired in a 97 mph which surprised even himself.\"You know what, it feels great because the first time coming back from two and a half months without baseball and just a couple bullpens, maybe three or four bullpens, and the first pitch is 97 [mph],\" Carrasco said. \"Right away, I looked back to the scoreboard because I just wanted to find out what was that pitch, and it was 97 mph and it feels great.\"I was surprised because all my pitches were way different than before. Even my changeup, too.\"READ: David Ortiz calls his doctors, nurses and caregivers 'some of the best teammates I have ever had'Returning to the big timeIf Carrasco's on-field performances made him popular in Cleveland, his off-field ventures have also made him  a beloved figure there.With the help of his wife, Karelis, the Venezuelan set up the Carlos Carrasco Foundation which funds early childhood education in Cleveland and back home in Venezuela.Last Saturday, Francona said the plan was to keep Carrasco on a reliever's program to ease him back into baseball and eventually back to the Major Leagues in Cleveland.Carrasco participates in the Stand Up To Cancer during the 2019 MLB All-Star Game.\"I think when he started thinking about building up as a starter, it kind of seemed a little daunting, a little far away,\" the manager said.But following an outing which included 11 of his 16 pitches clocking in at 94 mph or higher, Carrasco's return could be sooner rather than later.

I've got to be able to train a couple of days out and then face fast bowling to make sure my reaction time is in place.\"READ: Steve Smith 'probably the best Test batsman we've ever seen' as Australia crushes England in openerA dark reminderThe sight of an Australian batsmen lying prone on the ground having been struck by  a cricket ball brought back some troubling memories for Australian cricket. In 2014, Australian batsman Phillip Hughes died aged 25, two days after being hit in the head by a ball when batting in a domestic match.Following Hughes' tragic death, changes were made to further protect batsmen, with stem guards designed and made optional for players to wear on their helmets. Spectators pay tribute to former cricketer Phillip Hughes.After initially not feeling comfortable playing with the guards on his helmet, Smith believes he may have to rethink his stance on them following this recent episode. \"I think I, along with a few other players in the team, find it a little bit different, uncomfortable compared to what we're used to,\" he said.\"I feel a little bit claustrophobic when it's on. I feel like I'm enclosed and not overly comfortable.\"It's certainly something I need to probably have a look at and perhaps try in the nets and see if I can find a way to get comfortable with it.\"READ: Sledging and the bitter fight for iconic minuscule trophyThe correct decisionResearch carried out by Cricket Australia shows that delayed concussion -- where symptoms don't develop until several hours after the initial blow -- occur in approximately 30% of cases.In the second Test at Lord's, three players were hit on the head and Smith was the only player to suffer a concussion.Smith lays on the pitch after being hit in the head by Jofra Archer.And given only around 20% of head impacts in cricket result in a concussion, Alex Kountouris, Cricket Australia's manager of sports medicine, believes removing a player from the game every time they were struck in the head would be unnecessary.\"The reality is only about one in five or six head impacts end up in concussion,\" Kountouris said at a press conference in Australia on Monday.\"If we pulled out every player who had a head impact, we'd be pulling out 80% of players who don't have a concussion and taking them out of the game. So that would be an overreaction.\"If you look at that game, there were three other head impacts and only Steve had a concussion.\"He didn't have a concussion at the time (he was hit) so he was allowed to play. If we took him out of the game, we would have been leaving him out of the game for no reason other than what we saw on the field.\"WATCH: Jason Roy on life in and beyond the boundaryFollowing protocolsKountouris also said he was \"100%\" satisfied by Dr. Saw's treatment of Smith. \"At the end of the day, our doctor pulled him out of day five of the Test match, which was a pretty critical part of the game,\" he said.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"Our doctor is an expert in his field, he's trained to pick up even the minor signs of concussion.\"(He) was brilliant. Everything he did was according to the protocol, he was very thorough, and we know he's very thorough. We're 100% happy with what happened over there.\"Australian lead the series 1-0.",

The US Women's National Team's lawsuit was filed in March in US District Court in California, with 28 members of the team listed as plaintiffs. Read MoreThe suit alleges US Soccer's payment practices amount to federal discrimination by paying women less than men \"for substantially equal work and by denying them at least equal playing, training, and travel conditions; equal promotion of their games; equal support and development for their games; and other terms and conditions of employment equal to the MNT.\"Follow @cnnsport\n\nMediation talks between US Soccer and the US women's soccer team broke down, Levinson said last week. The players had previously requested a November 2020 trial date, while US Soccer asked that the trial begin in December 2020.The argumentIn one hypothetical case cited in the lawsuit, if the women's and men's teams both won 20 straight games in a season, the women would make 38% what the men do.Talks break down between USWNT and US Soccer over equal pay  Last month, US Soccer said the reigning Women's World Cup champions earned more than the US Men's National Team, with US Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro releasing an open letter on Twitter saying that from 2010 through 2018, the federation paid $34.1 million in salary and game bonuses to the women, compared with $26.4 million for the men.Those figures did not include benefits, such as health care, that the women receive. Included in the federation's numbers is that US Soccer pays USWNT contracted players a salary to play in the National Women's Soccer League, while the men are paid by their individual teams.The women's and men's compensation structures are different, as those each were collectively bargained.The figures were described as misleading and \"utterly false\" by Levinson in a July written statement.America's women have been far more successful than their male counterparts, winning four World Cups -- the most recent last month in France -- and four Olympic gold medals.USWNT beat Netherlands in Lyon in July to retain the Women's World Cup. The USMNT said its players, too, \"were not impressed\" by Cordeiro's letter. \"The women's national team players deserve equal pay and are right to pursue a legal remedy from the courts or Congress,\" the men's team said.Sponsors have added to the pressure to resolve the equal pay fight, with deodorant brand Secret saying in July that it planned to contribute $529,000 to the USWNT players' association. Nike, US Soccer's biggest partner, has also said it's a strong advocate for pay equity. \"Regarding gender equality, Nike has been an advocate for women and girls in the US and around the world,\" a spokesperson said.Minutes after the USWNT's World Cup win on July 7, Nike ran a 60-second ad celebrating the team's victory, centering on the concept that the USWNT's win is about more than winning a soccer title. However, Nike has been criticized for reducing athletes' pay during their pregnancies, a practice it said in May it would discontinue.Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosIt emerged this month that US Soccer had enlisted two lobbying firms, FBB Federal Relations and Vann Ness Feldman, to push back against claims of pay disparity after two Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require equal pay for men's and women's national teams. The move had left the team \"stunned and disappointed,\" Levinson told CNN.",

Epstein, 66, was found dead in his prison cell earlier this month. He had been awaiting trial on federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing underage girls. File photograph of Prince Andrew on July 11 in Harrogate, England. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video or when it was shot. When CNN contacted Buckingham Palace for comment, officials declined to answer CNN's specific questions about the video. Read MoreThe Palace referred CNN to the statement it released Monday, which said: \"The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent.\"Buckingham Palace also referred to a statement it issued to CNN last month, which said: \"The Duke of York accepts it was unwise to have met Mr. Epstein in December 2010. The Duke has not met with Mr. Epstein since.\" The statement was originally issued to CNN in response to a Daily Mail story that alleged Prince Andrew attended a party at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2010.The Mail reports the video it published Sunday was shot on December 6, 2010, around the time the royal was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park.Jeffrey Epstein's cause of death was suicide by hanging, medical examiner saysThe images showed that Prince Andrew was still associating with Epstein after his controversial 2008 plea deal amid similar accusations. The non-prosecution deal with federal prosecutors allowed the financier to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges. Epstein ultimately served 13 months in prison, registered as a sex offender and paid restitution to the victims identified by the FBI. Epstein was arrested on new charges in July, and was awaiting trial on counts of trafficking of minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking, when he died on August 10. Prince Andrew, the Queen's third child, was named in court papers in Florida this month, in fresh allegations that he groped another young woman at Epstein's Manhattan property. Previously, he was named in connection to Epstein when Virginia Roberts Giuffre claimed Epstein kept her as a teenage sex slave. She alleged Epstein forced her to perform sex acts with a number of prominent men, including the Duke of York in 2001.Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the allegations, telling CNN previously that \"any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.\"CNN's Sarah Dean and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report.",

He was spotted by Rennes playing football in Foug\u00e8res, 50 kilometers from the city, at the age of 13.Camavinga has already starred against PSG once this season in the Champions Cup defeat.READ: Liverpool holds on for win against Southampton despite Adrian howlerREAD: Without Lionel Messi, Barcelona stunned by Athletic Bilbao in La Liga openerHe signed his first professional contract with Rennes in December and, in an attempt to tie down his future at the club a little longer, signed an extension this week until 2022.Though a native of Angola, L'Equipe say Camavinga is in the process of becoming a French citizen with a view to playing for the national team.Before Sunday's win over PSG, Rennes manager Julien St\u00e9phan warned of the exposure -- and subsequent necessary protection -- Camavinga will need.\"Exposed, because if he repeats the kind of performance that he achieved against Montpellier (1-0 on the opening day), he has chances to take a greater place in the team,\" Stephan explained. \"But also protected, because he is not yet seventeen years old, he is still building himself on a muscular level and he has not experienced a Ligue 1 sequence of matches with the intensity it requires yet.\"Camavinga was on the receiving end of several cynical fouls from frustrated PSG players -- many of who cost tens of million of dollars -- who rarely got anywhere near the ball when it was at his feet.Eduardo Camavinga, remember the name \ud83d\ude4cThe 16-year-old put on a stunning display against PSG last night, including this utterly sublime assist for the winner!We repeat, 16-years old! \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/fkuT9Vy3u6\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) August 19, 2019 He may be tall for a 16-year-old -- standing at six foot -- but Camavinga's frame is slight, though it's not a part of the game his boss worries about.\"He's a very well-built person,\" Stephan said after the physical match. \"Who knows how to question himself, who knows how to do the right thing. \"He has a very interesting game, I'm going to have to deal with it. I will talk to him so that he can grow up in conditions of serenity.\"Felix's flairIn Spain, Felix showed no signs of being weighed down by his hefty $142 million price tag as his dancing feet ran Getafe's defense ragged.Diego Simeone made the teenager the fifth most expensive player of all time in the summer but so far the Benfica academy product looks worth every penny.After receiving man of the match recognition in the 7-3 pre-season demolition of city rival Real Madrid, Felix began his La Liga career with a performance that showcased his immense talent.Possibly the filthiest nutmeg you'll see all season from @joaofelix70. \ud83e\udd24#AtletiGetafe pic.twitter.com/xwOToQZuHr\u2014 LaLiga (@LaLigaEN) August 18, 2019 Atleti's new signing Kieran Trippier crossed for Alvaro Morata to head home the opening goal, before Felix's trickery -- a run which started with a nutmeg inside his own half -- won a penalty in the second period.Morata failed to convert but Atletico held on for victory at the first attempt in the post-Antoine Griezmann era.Kai shines for BayerBayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz is by now accustomed to breaking records.In 2016 he became the youngest debutant in Bundesliga history; in 2018 he became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances; and last season he hit 17 goals to become the highest scoring teenager in a Bundesliga season.After narrowly missing out on the German player of the year award to Marco Reus, reports suggested several of Europe's major clubs would try and prize Bayer's star possession away.Seventeen Bundesliga goals last season...No doubt the first of many this season \ud83d\udc4cKai Havertz opens his account for 2019/20 in style! \u2744\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/RICHOENjCr\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) August 17, 2019 But the 20-year-old remains at the club and scored a delightful chip in Saturday's opening-day 3-2 victory over Paderborn, becoming the second youngest player in history to reach 25 Bundesliga goals.Big things are predicted of the youngster this season, who seems more than likely to eclipse his performances from last season.Timeless talentThough this article may be about the stars of the future, a word has to go to 38-year-old Aritz Aduriz -- the veteran striker who continues to defy Father Time.Playing in his final season of professional football, he came off the bench for Athletic Club with two minutes remaining in the opening game of the La Liga season.But two minutes were all he needed, scoring a stunning bicycle kick to inflict an opening-day defeat on Barcelona.Additional reporting by Martin Goillandeau",

The Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as the Grace 1, set sail under an Iranian flag for an unknown destination.The move came after the United States issued a warrant for the ship's seizure on Friday, in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to stop the tanker from moving on.Gibraltar said on Sunday it was unable to comply with the request to continue detaining the vessel and its cargo due to differences in sanction laws between the European Union and the US.US makes last-ditch attempt to stop Iranian supertanker setting sail Iran's ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidinejad, wrote on Twitter that the tanker was expected to depart on Sunday night, adding that two engineering teams had been flown to Gibraltar to assist.Read MoreThe release of the ship comes more than a month after British Royal Marines and Gibraltar authorities stormed the tanker because it was believed to have been carrying oil to Syria, which would be in breach of EU sanctions. It was seized July 4 in territorial waters of Gibraltar, a British overseas territory on the edge of southern Spain. A crew member checks the new name of Iranian oil tanker Adrian Darya, formerly known as Grace 1.Iran denied the ship was headed for Syria. Two weeks after the tanker was taken, Iran seized a British-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz, in what has been widely regarded as an act of retaliation.Tensions between Iran, the UK and US ratcheted up. The Supreme Court in the British territory of Gibraltar last week approved the release of the Grace 1, which was seized off the country's coast by authorities last month, after officials said they no longer wished to detain it. Gibraltar defies US and releases seized Iranian tanker Grace 1Gibraltar said it had received assurances from Iran and the owners of the oil that, were the tanker to be released, its cargo would not be taken to Syria, which would be in breach of European Union sanctions.The Adrian Darya's owner said the released Iranian tanker would head to the Mediterranean, Iran's semi-official Mehr News Agency, citing Iranian Maritime official Jalil Eslami, reported last week.The US also got involved in the standoff when the Justice Department applied to extend the Iranian tanker's seizure and block its release. The State Department said in a statement late Thursday that it had deemed the ship to be \"assisting\" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which the US has designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization, in evading sanctions.But Gibraltar declined to comply, saying that Europe and the UK did not share that designation for the IRGC. \"The EU sanctions regime against Iran -- which is applicable in Gibraltar -- is much narrower than that applicable in the US,\" the Government of Gibraltar said in a statement Sunday.CNN's Karen Smith, Tim Lister and Gena Somra contributed to this report.",

Ahmed Shobair, the deputy head of the EFA, denied the accusations, insisting the players and the hotel was isolated from the public.\"These are the same accusations we heard from him (Salah) during the World Cup,\" Shobair told CNN.\"Compared to the alleged mistakes of the World Cup, the African Cup of Nations' training camp was extremely disciplined,\" he added.Shobair and the rest of the EFA board members resigned in July in response to public anger for Egypt's performance in the African Cup.Mohamed Salah is marked by South Africa's midfielder Dean Furman (R) during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) Round of 16 football match between Egypt and South Africa.\"I think with the federation, it was a bit like a competition,\" Salah told CNN.\"Who's the winner?

The violence is believed to have started when Olimpia supporters attacked the Motagua team bus with stones and sticks. \"Bottles, stones were thrown at us and the players threw themselves on the floor screaming,\" Diego V\u00e1squez, Motagua coach, told Honduran media.Three Motagua players --- Emilio Izaguirre, Jonathan Rougier, and Roberto Moreira -- were injured by shards of broken glass and transferred to a private hospital to receive medical assistance, according to the team's social media.Members of the Honduran Red Cross transport injured fans to a hospital following the clashes.The Honduran National Police said that fans of the rival teams rioted following the attack on the bus. \"Fans of both teams staged a confrontation on the outskirts of the stadium, so they (police) proceeded with the use of deterrent means,\" police said, adding that tear gas was used.Read MoreLaura Schoenherr, a spokeswoman for the city's Hospital Escuela Universitario, confirmed that numerous fans were injured in the incident. \"Three people died and seven were shot and stabbed. One of them is a boy. Three of the injured adults are in critical condition,\" she told Reuters.

        "content": "London and Moscow  (CNN)An explosion. An abruptly-canceled village evacuation. Five dead nuclear experts. And a few traces of radioactive iodine in the air over the northern Norwegian coastline.These are the fingerprints of what appears to have been Russia's latest failed bid to test its Burevestnik missile, also known as Skyfall. It's claimed by its owner, Russian President Vladimir Putin, to have unlimited range and be able to outflank all US air defenses. But this month, it proved, for a Kremlin keen to emphasize its growing military muscle, yet another high-profile hiccup.It wouldn't be the first time that a test of the missile wasn't entirely successful, according to US officials.But what is Skyfall? In truth, analysts don't really know, but their guesswork leads them to believe it's a form of cruise missile designed around a nuclear reactor.Read MoreThe spiking of radiation levels in the area, potentially reaching as far away as Norway, lends credibility to the theories.A deadly mishap in Russia's Far North, and a nuclear mystery lingersPutin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, declined to confirm widespread international speculation that the accident involved a nuclear-powered cruise missile, but said the mishap would not set back Russian efforts to develop advanced military capabilities.Peskov said that only experts could speak with authority on such matters, but added: \"Accidents, unfortunately, happen. They are tragedies. But in this particular case, it is important for us to remember those heroes who lost their lives in this accident.\"Jon Hawkes, associate director of land warfare at Jane's IHS Markit, said the system could work one of two ways. It could be an \"air-breathing engine employing a small nuclear reactor core to heat incoming air that is expelled to generate thrust.\" Or it could be a \"nuclear thermal rocket engine, where the nuclear core is used to heat a liquid fuel such as hydrogen before expelling it through a nozzle to produce thrust.\"'Doomsday weapon'Yet he added, \"given the Russians are claiming unlimited range, then one would assume it has to be along the lines of the first option, as the hydrogen fuel device would have a limit to its range.\"The major problem with the 9M370, or SSC-X-9 Skyfall (as NATO calls it), is the exhaust. You can't use a nuclear reactor to power a rocket without likely creating a form of dirty bomb on wings.Russia might be trying to look more to look \"more militarily formidable than it is.\"\"This is a doomsday weapon really,\" said Dr Mark Galeotti, from Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies.\"It's not something that could be deployed in anything other than a full-scale nuclear war. It is a cruise missile that can stay in the air for a long time, but it is belching out radioactive plumes behind it.\"The US indeed had a similar program in the 1960s, called Project Pluto, which was abandoned as they concluded it was too dangerous at the time.When Putin launched the missile with great fanfare in March 2018 he extolled its unlimited range -- that it could circle the globe many times and then fire itself at its target from an unexpected angle, perhaps even days after launch.Is Putin bothered that it doesn't appear so far to have worked that well? Not really, said Galeotti.\"Vladimir Putin's Russia is basically trying to puff itself up,\" he said. \"It is trying to look more militarily formidable than it is. Although they don't like the fact that this failed, the fact that we are talking about the latest Russian military technology is definitely something of a plus.\"US officials told CNN it's been tested a few times, but never fully successfully. How far along the project is, and how big a setback this, is is anyone's guess.A bad summerBut the Kremlin has had a number of incidents to brush off in the past month.In early July, the AS-31, or Losharik, super-deep, super-secret spy submarine, ran into trouble off the northern coast. State media said 14 sailors on board died of smoke inhalation, and the Kremlin insisted its nuclear reactor was intact when it was returned to port.The Losharik -- named after a Soviet-era cartoon horse because of the compartmentalized components that enable it to dive to the bottom of the ocean floor -- was meant to plunge to depths that nuclear and attack submarines could not. Again, Putin found himself being briefed on a clean-up operation.Weeks later, a munitions dump in Achinsk suffered a series of explosions over five hours, some causing devastating shockwaves and debris to be scattered over the area. A week later, local officials admitted forty people were injured.Dozens were injured in a series of explosions at munitions dump in Achinsk.These three incidents amount to a bad summer for the Russian military, who after the invasion of Ukraine, and their intervention into Syria, had benefited from a short-term lift in their domestic prestige.Could over-reach be behind this recent spate of problems?Andrey Kortunov, Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council, said, \"if you look at the current defense budget of the Russian Federation, it reached its peak in 2016.\"He added it had decreased since.\"So basically, the military and the defense sector are asked to do more for less,\" he added, \"and that might be a stretch. Maybe some of these accidents are a part of the price that the military has to pay from this relatively modest budget but the [substantial] ambitions behind this budget.\"A turbulent month of unexpected blasts and leaks that begs the question as to whether the Kremlin's race to the bottom of the sea, or top of the heavens, will scorch too much in its wake.",

Zinedine Zidane can no longer rely on Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid.\"So now we'll see the true Zidane. The people here in Madrid said: 'The Real Madrid of Zinedine Zidane, it was the Real Madrid of Cristiano Ronaldo.' Now we will see how difficult it is to manage, to master a dressing room like Real Madrid -- especially when results are not good.\"He has a lot of credit because he won three Champions Leagues, however it will depend not only on the results but on how Real Madrid plays.

He said: 'Pogba.'\"Of course it's a big disappointment if Pogba stays [at Manchester United], he will have to find solutions somewhere else. He's been offered three of four different options and he's not happy with Bale, who is a player who makes a difference but he gets injured very often.\"Several new summer signings will also need time to gel and Zidane has continued to show preference to what he views as his trusted old guard.Karim Benzema looks set to start the season up front ahead of new \u20ac60 million ($66.5M) striker Luka Jovic, while doubts remain as to the role summer marquee signing Eden Hazard will play.To make matters worse, Real announced Friday that the Belgian star has suffered a hamstring injury and will miss Saturday's season opener against Celta Vigo.Stalwart Marcelo will likely be preferred at left back to exciting young signing Ferland Mendy, as will Raphael Varane in place of \u20ac50 million ($55M) signing Eder Militao to partner captain Sergio Ramos in the heart of defense.\"I don't see them winning many more titles,\" Macia said. \"In Europe they have big competitors, in La Liga they have Barcelona which is very well settled. It will come down to how Real Madrid grows this project.Real Madrid will be without the injured Eden Hazard for the first La Liga match of the season.\"With new players, especially the signing of Hazard, and how they make the transition from the older ones -- like Modric in midfield -- and the newcomers. I think that Real has the players to do it but I'm not sure that Zidane is the man.\"I think it will be very difficult for him and his new time there will be more difficult than the previous four years.\"READ: Real Madrid and Gareth Bale saga is a 'Rubik's Cube to solve'READ: From dream start to nightmare end, Gareth Bale's Real Madrid career turns sourChampions League 'obsession'With Atletico Madrid undergoing the biggest squad overhaul -- albeit an exciting one -- in Diego Simeone's eight-year reign, Barcelona's settled side is the overwhelming favorite to retain its La Liga title.The \u20ac120 million ($132M) signing of Antoine Griezmann from direct rival Atleti and the arrival of precocious talent Frenkie de Jong from Ajax has bolstered an already world class squad.However, Barcelona's focus this season will undoubtedly be on the Champions League, a competition it hasn't won since 2015 and has crashed out of in spectacular fashion the past two seasons.Barcelona threw away a 3-0 aggregate lead against Liverpool last season.After surrendering 4-1 and 3-0 aggregate leads against Roma and Liverpool, respectively, there is an increasing concern among fans that the club is throwing away opportunities for arguably the greatest player ever: Lionel Messi.\"After what has happened in the last two seasons, the Champions League is now the priority -- I would say it's an obsession,\" Macia said. \"In Barcelona we know we have potentially the best player of all time and that we are wasting our time committing absurd mistakes.\"In Barcelona we think that the Champions League is a must for this team. Not only because of Messi but because Barcelona has an incredible team.\"They've invested a lot of money in Griezmann and De Jong and potentially Barcelona has the best squad in Europe, along with Manchester City.\"Barcelona's pre-season has been promising, losing just once and showing signs that the new players are integrating well into the plans of Ernesto Valverde, who himself is under pressure this season after also losing the Copa del Rey final.But Barca's defeat in Bilbao Friday hinted the Blaugrana could have a fight on their hands to win the title, while Real won 3-1 away at Celta Vigo despite playing most of the second half with 10 men after Luka Modric was sent off.",

        "content": "(CNN)Australia has thwarted a push by Pacific Island nations for more action on the climate crisis in an emotional forum at which one leader broke down in tears.Australia, New Zealand and 16 Pacific Island members held talks at the Pacific Island Forum in the tiny island nation of Tuvalu on Thursday, eventually reaching an agreement after a 12-hour meeting.But the final declaration was weaker than an earlier agreement by smaller Pacific countries, which called for a rapid phasing out of coal and higher emission reduction targets, Australian national broadcaster ABC reported. The islands of the South Pacific -- many of which are low-lying and aid-dependant -- are on the front line of climate crisis. Last year, the United Nations described climate change as \"the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.\"Australia is also being affected, with global warming killing coral on the Great Barrier Reef and contributing to fires, floods and droughts. Read MoreYet, while a survey revealed that 64% of the Australian population believes climate change should be a top priority, the government has been slow to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Coal is Australia's second-largest export, according to Minerals Council of Australia, which represents the country's exploration, mining and minerals processing industry. The Prime Minister of Australia Scott Morrison speaks at Parliament House on July 1, 2019 in Canberra, Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has long supported the coal industry. He famously brought a chunk of coal into Parliament in 2017, taunting the opposition party about its push for more renewable energy by saying: \"This is coal, don't be afraid, don't be scared, it won't hurt you.\"Pacific Island countries, home to fewer than 10 million people, had this week hoped that Australia and New Zealand -- the richest and biggest emissions contributors of the 18 Pacific Island Forum members -- would step up their efforts to address the climate crisis by endorsing the so-called Tuvalu Declaration at the forum. However, Australia had reservations about the sections on emissions reductions, coal use and funding for the UN's Green Climate Fund, the ABC reported. New Zealand also expressed concern about the Green Climate Fund, it added.As he left the meeting, Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said: \"We tried our best.\" Later, he recounted an exchange with Morrison during the talks, in which he told the Australian leader: \"You are concerned about saving your economies ... I'm concerned about saving my people.\"Sopoaga also described how, after a presentation earlier in the week, the Prime Minister of Tonga, Akilisi Pohiva, was brought to tears. #PIF2019: We came together in a nation that risks disappearing to the seas, but unfortunately, we settled for the status quo in our communique.

On Thursday, New Zealand also announced it would dedicate $150 million (US$97 million) to help with climate change resilience.\"We also did this because it is what's necessary to prevent our Pacific neighbors like Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands being put at significant risk of devastating impacts linked to climate change,\" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. \"The catastrophic cost of doing nothing to tackle climate change is no longer an option.\" Why China is challenging Australia for influence over the Pacific IslandsJonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an independent Australia-based think tank, said climate change is \"more than just a thought exercise for a country that most modeling shows will be uninhabitable within our lifetime.\"Pryke added that Morrison had faced \"uncharacteristic hostility\" from Pacific nations during the \"bruising\" meeting, which wouldn't help Australia's relations across the region.Australia is the biggest donor of aid in the Pacific. But in recent years, China has emerged as a major player, investing billions of dollars in Pacific infrastructure projects -- prompting concern about Beijing's rising influence.",

Yes, a cheeky start, but next week kicks off five straight months of college football that will dominate your Saturdays. It will culminate in mid-January with the National Championship in the Big Easy.So while we still can, let's take some time to highlight three non-college football events happening this weekend:UFC 241: Nate Diaz's comeback and Cormier vs. MiocicIf you ask casual sports fans who Nate Diaz is, the usual reaction is a pursing of the eyes. The name resonates, but the details are fuzzy. Read MoreDiaz is the man who knocked Conor McGregor off his perch when the brash Irishman was at the pinnacle of the mixed martial arts mountain. The shocking 2016 upset was quickly followed by a rematch later that year at UFC 202, which McGregor won via a majority decision. Nate Diaz chokes Conor McGregor at UFC 196.Then, poof! Diaz disappeared from the octagon and the mainstream. It's been almost three years since Diaz has been featured on a fight card. He told ESPN this week that after his rematch loss to McGregor, UFC essentially wanted him to \"get out of here.\" UFC President Dana White disputes the claim.Giant-killer Diaz returns to the octagon (probably with a chip on his shoulder) on Saturday night to face Anthony Pettis at UFC 241.Despite the hyped Diaz resurrection, the Pettis bout isn't the headliner. That honor belongs to Daniel Cormier and Stipe Miocic, who will go toe-to-toe for a second time. The first edition ended with Cormier knocking Miocic out within five minutes and leaving the building with the Clevelander's belt. UFC 241: 'I try to honor the people that I've lost,' says Daniel CormierCormier -- who is the UFC heavyweight champion, the No. 1-ranked pound-for-pound fighter in the world and the first and only UFC fighter to defend titles in two weight classes -- says Saturday's fight could be his last.When asked about retirement, Cormier told CNN on Thursday that \"everybody asks about it, but that's what happens when you turn 40. I feel great. I wanna get through this weekend, and then I'll sit with my family, and we'll figure out what's going on. It's a real thing, though. Father time catches up to everybody.\"Sounds like this could be the last time to witness the former Olympian in action.

This year's edition is conjuring up memories of pure joy. It's hard to believe that five years have passed since Mo'ne Davis became a national sensation.

Similar content populates the Instagram posts of an account by the same name.But according to a company source familiar with the project, Woke is in fact part of a counter-terror program funded by the British government -- raising ethical questions about transparency in such online initiatives.  Woke describes itself on Facebook as a \"media/news company,\" and its name derives from US slang describing a state of social and historical awareness, with progressive connotations.Middle East Eye, the news site that first investigated the network, said it was created by a communications agency as part of a UK government counter-terror program known as \"Prevent,\" run from the British interior ministry, the Home Office. Facebook fights fake news using more African languagesRead MorePrevent aims to educate the public about the risks of extremism and to identify individuals who seem \"at risk\" of becoming terrorists, through a variety of public sector work.The Home Office did not contest Middle East Eye's characterization of \"This is Woke\" when questioned by CNN. \"We are committed to using all of the tools available to counter the threat from terrorism in the UK,\" a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, adding that they could not comment on commercial contracts.Woke's aim, according to its Facebook page, is to engage \"in critical discussions around Muslim identity, tradition and reform to provide a positive vision of what it means to be Muslim today.\"The network's content includes inspirational memes, including images of late South African President Nelson Mandela, and panel discussions on veganism, fake news and modern dating. In the fake news discussion, four young panelists discuss how to \"train ourselves against what's going on out there.\"Middle East Eye reported that Breakthrough Media was responsible for creating the content on the network. One of its videos, on Muslim women describing the first time they wore \"the hijab,\" received more than 250 thousand views.Middle East Eye reported that Breakthrough Media was responsible for creating the content on the network.The source CNN spoke to said that Breakthrough Media, which has been renamed Zinc Network, stopped working on the Home Office account four months ago and it is now in the hands of advertising agency M&C Saatchi.CNN has reached out to M&C Saatchi for comment.When asked if it had created Woke content for the Home Office, Zinc Network told CNN only that it is \"enormously proud of the work we undertake for our clients. \"Providing support to communities, brands and governments to promote positive social change and tackle some of the most complex issues in the world today is the driving force of our agency,\" it added.Controversial programThe Home Office says that Prevent does not target any specific demographics and deals with \"all forms of terrorism, including Islamist and extreme right wing.\" However, over the years, it has been accused of fostering discrimination against Muslims and creating an atmosphere of distrust in the Muslim community.When asked about Woke, the Home Office spokesperson also said that \"the Prevent program continues to play a vital role in this fight against radicalization and has had a significant impact in stopping people being drawn into terrorism,\" the spokesperson added.Prevent's aim is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. Its objectives include preventing people from being drawn into terrorism and working with key sectors and institutions \"where there are risks of radicalization which we need to address,\" according to a 2011 Prevent Strategy document written by the Home Office. \"We will also work to tackle the challenge of radicalization on the internet,\" it added.Beyond educational outreach, Prevent also requires public-sector workers in schools and hospitals to report individuals who are believed to be \"at risk\" of radicalization. Once someone has been reported, the police or local authority decide whether they should be referred to Prevent's anti-radicalization program -- known as Channel -- where they receive mentoring and counseling.

Keen to foster the interest in the sport that his son had already shown, Mark contacted local clubs to see if there was an opening for the seven-year-old, eventually plumping for the Northamptonshire club Brackley Town.It was a 30-minute drive from their home in Oxfordshire to the club but for Mark, the prospect of his son playing more competitive football was vital to continue Christian's development.And after his first trial at the club, the coach of Brackley Town's Juniors Under-8 team Robin Walker could already tell that the young Pulisic might become a special player.\"You could see straight away ... his touch, his movement, his passion, he had something about him. I said, 'we'll sign him up,'\" Walker told CNN Sport. As a seven-year-old, Pulisic was a year younger than the rest of the team and physically smaller than his teammates, but his \"never say die attitude,\" according to Walker, stood him in good stead.\"He got fouled, he got straight back up again,\" said Walker. \"And that tenacity really took me by surprise. He was better than all the players that we had.\"Christian Pulisic (bottom row, third from left) with his Brackley Town teammates, coach Robin Walker and ex-Chelsea player Gavin Peakcock.Having level-headed parents also played a key role in keeping Pulisic on the right track.\"They're not the sort of the head in the sky sort of parents,\" Walker said. \"His dad was quite firm but in a sort of relaxed manner.\"You get some dads shouting on the touchline and yelling their head off. That wasn't Christian's dad. He was quite firm. He pushed Christian.\"Mark made the most of the family's time in England, taking Christian to professional games to see the likes of Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.\"He really fell in love, became obsessed with the sport,\" Mark told the Guardian in 2016 about their time in the UK.READ: Premier League predictions: Liverpool or Manchester City? Kane or Aguero?Returning homeIf his passion for football was fostered in England, Pulisic's footballing roots are in Pennsylvania.Before leaving for their year abroad at Oxfordshire, Pulisic had been part of his local U.S. Soccer Development Academy club, Pennsylvania (PA) Classics, and upon the family returning in Hershey, he re-joined the club.Steve Klein -- academy director at PA Classics and Pulisic's former coach -- has known the Chelsea player since he was a young kid, but only really saw his true potential when he reached his teenage years.Pulisic faces England for the USA Under-17 team.\"Once he was 13 or 14 then you could start seeing that this kid's pretty special,\" Klein remembers.\"He might be someone that could be in a national team. He was just very technical with both feet. He was always very quick. You could see that from an early age, his reading of the game was just better.\"Pulisic had training sessions with Barcelona, Chelsea, Porto, PSV Eindhoven and Villarreal and was also on the USA national team's radar -- he began playing for the Under-15 team in 2012, aged just 13, and went on to score 21 goals in 28 international appearances over the next two years. Once more though, Mark was keen to temper expectations about his son, according to Klein.READ: Chemnitzer FC sack captain for displaying neo-Nazi sympathyEuropean adventuresWith the world seemingly at his feet as a 16-year-old, Pulisic had offers from all across Europe to further develop his game.With an offer from Spanish giants Barcelona on the table, Mark made the decision for his son to join German side Borussia Dortmund, a club renowned for being able to transform rough diamonds into highly valued players.So, in February 2015, 16-year-old Pulisic joined the eight-time German champions and was immediately moved to their Under-17 side.Pulisic  of Dortmund celebrates after scoring for the Borussia Dortmund Under-17 team.In the Dortmund academy set-up, the youth teams are well integrated with each other, with players regularly interchanging between the age groups and the senior side.As a result, Marc-Patrick Meister -- head coach of the Under-19 team when Pulisic joined -- saw a lot of the American and was immediately impressed.\"A lot of times he was part of our (the Under-19's) training session,\" says Meister.\"He had an outstanding level from the first day he became a member of Borussia. Later on, even the professional coaches David Wagner, Jurgen (Klopp) and Thomas (Tuchel) recognized very fast that this is an outstanding boy and with an outstanding mentality to work hard even against forces which are against him on the pitch and outside the pitch.\"To help Pulisic acclimatize to the move to a foreign country, with an entirely new language, father Mark also came over to Dortmund and joined the club as a coach.Meanwhile Pulisic's dedication to adjusting to life in Dortmund by learning the German language was key to his integrationPulisic with the DFB Cup after Dortmund beat Eintracht Frankfurt in 2017.\"When people ask me about Christian, I compared him with Son Heung-Min,\" Meister said. \"In 2009, I worked with Hamburg SV.\"We had a cooperation with the Korean Football Association who traveled over for 10 days, stayed there and we choose three boys for a one year trial period from the KFA to Hamburg.\"At the same age, 16 years old, Son became part of my team in Hamburg and he was the one out of the three who was so keen, and he worked a lot to be able to understand first and then even to speak the German language which is very hard.\"READ: Marco Reus: The man who came back from the brink -- again and againBack to where it all beganIn November 2018 -- two months before his big-money move to Chelsea was confirmed -- Pulisic said he would be \"open\" to a move to the Premier League.But after suffering injuries and losing his place to another upcoming young star -- Jadon Sancho -- a move away from the German side looked less likely.Then after signing for Chelsea in January, having spent the second half of the 2018/19 season on loan back at Dortmund and managing to rekindle some good form, the excitement has picked up for Chelsea fans.Pulisic is joining a team that has lost the talismanic Eden Hazard to Real Madrid, though club legend Frank Lampard has replaced Maurizio Sarri as manager.Pulisic runs past Oriol Busquets of Barcelona during their preseason friendly match.But despite all those obstacles, Alex Goldberg -- Chelsea fan and host of 'The Byline' podcast -- believes Pulisic is perfectly poised to be a success.\"Obviously, Chelsea are not in the greatest position right now, losing Eden Hazard and having a transfer ban,\" said Chelsea fan and host of \"The Byline\" podcast Alex Goldberg.\"It looks like he's playing some really confident football and I think the big thing is that he is 20 years old and has top-level experience.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"A lot of the youth players that Chelsea fans want to play, including myself, are 20 years old and are coming from the Championship in England but Pulisic has years and years of Bundesliga league experience.\"An American Chelsea superfan, Goldberg has amassed a large following with his hot takes and passionate support for the Blues resulting in videos from Chelsea players including Callum Hudson-Odoi and Mason Mount, thanking him for his support.Goldberg believes having an American playing for one of the biggest clubs in the Premier League will do wonders back home.Pulisic captains the United States against Curacao in the CONCACAF Gold Cup.\"I definitely do think that Pulisic is going to improve as a player being at Chelsea which then indirectly improves the United States men's national team,\" Goldberg said.\"Also, just what Pulisic has done for young American players has been great. Showing them that there is a path.\"We're starting to see a couple more legitimate players --  like Weston McKinney and Timothy Weah -- really make names for themselves.\"Especially if he succeeds at Chelsea, what he will do for the sport of football in the US is probably incalculable.\"",

Included in the federation's numbers is that US Soccer pays USWNT contracted players a salary to play in the National Women's Soccer League, while the men are paid by their individual teams.The women's and men's compensation structures are different, as those each were collectively bargained.In a written statement in July, Levinson said the figures were misleading and \"utterly false.\"America's women have been far more successful than their male counterparts, winning four World Cups -- the most recent being in France last month -- and four Olympic gold medals.The USMNT said they too \"were not impressed\" by Cordeiro's letter. \"The women's national team players deserve equal pay and are right to pursue a legal remedy from the courts or Congress,\" the men's team said.Sponsors have also been adding to the pressure to resolve the equal pay fight with deodorant brand Secret saying in July that it planned to contribute $529,000 to the USWNT players' association.

Learmonth was then declared the winner. But despite being comfortably clear of their nearest competitors, the pair were disqualified for their show of solidarity.The International Triathlon Union's competition rules state that \"athletes who finish in a contrived tie situation, where no effort to separate their finish times has been made will be DSQ (disqualified).\"Learmonth and Taylor-Brown nonetheless received support from a number of fellow athletes following the ruling.Read More\"I am genuinely upset for these champions. A telling off , a fine perhaps but dq ??? Olympic places lost and lives potentially changed?!\" former British Olympian and Ironman champion Jodie Swallow wrote on Twitter.Bermuda's Flora Duffy, who finished after the pair, was elevated to the winner's position, while Italian Alice Betto claimed second place.Fortunately for the pair, however, the disqualification did not ultimately result in them missing out on places in next year's Olympics. The running section of the race was cut from the Olympic distance of 10km to 5km due to poor weather, meaning Britain's Olympic competitors will be decided later in the year rather than on the results of the contest.British athlete Vicky Holland finished third as a result of the disqualification. She told the British Triathlon governing body: \"It's wasn't the set of circumstances that you want when you win a medal but you have to play to what's given to you and I've come out with a third place finish.\"\"I really feel for Jess and Georgia because they raced exceptionally well today and I feel like they absolutely smashed it and deserved the first and second finish,\" she added.Mike Cavendish, British Triathlon National Performance Director, added: \"It's obviously disappointing to have Jess and Georgia disqualified but it's a testament to the depth of our female squad that we still have another athlete on the podium.\"",

Sala and David Ibbotson were traveling from Nantes, France, to Cardiff, Wales, when their Piper Malibu aircraft crashed, killing them both. The 28-year-old had joined the Welsh club for a reported \u00a315 million ($19.3 million) from the French side and was heading to Wales after saying farewell to his former teammates.Ibbotson's body has still not been found, but toxicology tests on Sala showed harmful levels of carbon monoxide in his blood, which could have caused a seizure, unconsciousness or a heart attack. The report released by the Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) said it was likely that Ibbotson would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide. Read MoreMan, 64, arrested over soccer star Emiliano Sala's death\"Toxicology tests found that the passenger had a high saturation level of COHb (the combination product of carbon monoxide and haemoglobin). It is considered likely that the pilot would also have been exposed to carbon monoxide,\" reads the report published Wednesday. \"When our investigation has concluded, we will publish a final report.\"Blood tests showed Sala had a COHb saturation level of 58%. \"A COHb level of 50% or above in an otherwise healthy individual is generally considered to be potentially fatal,\" the report adds. A lawyer representing Sala's family called for the plane to be recovered for further examination and said the report \"raises many questions for the family.\" Visit CNN.com/Sport for more news, features and videosGas colorless and odorlessCarbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas, is produced in high concentrations in piston-engined planes, but is removed through the exhaust system. Poor sealing of the cabin or leaks into the heating and ventilation system from the exhaust could allow the gas into a plane, according to the report. \"Whilst piston engines produce the highest concentration of CO, exhausts from turbine engines also contain CO,\" it says.Exposure to CO can lead to damage to the brain, heart and nervous system and, the report adds, \"It is clear from the symptoms that exposure to CO can reduce or inhibit a pilot's ability to fly an aircraft depending on the level of that exposure.\"The AAIB said it was working with the aircraft and engine manufacturers and the National Transportation Safety Board in the US to identify how the gas might have entered the cabin of an aircraft such as the Piper Malibu.  \"Work is also continuing to investigate pertinent operational, technical, organizational and human factors which might have contributed to the accident,\" the report concludes. Sala was the only passenger on the plane. Questions raised Sala's body was recovered from the plane's wreckage on February 6 after a private search for the missing footballer and the pilot was commissioned by his family -- financed by a crowdfunding campaign. The investigation into the crash is ongoing. Daniel Machover, of Hickman and Rose Solicitors, who represent the Sala family, said in a statement: \"That dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide have been found in Emiliano's body raises many questions for the family. How he died will be determined at the inquest in due course.\"The family believe that a detailed technical examination of the plane is necessary.\"The family and the public need to know how the carbon monoxide was able to enter the cabin. Future air safety rests on knowing as much as possible on this issue.\"Emiliano's family call on the AAIB to salvage the wreckage of the plane without further delay.\"CNN's Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)An official state of mourning has been declared in the Russian city of Sarov. Last Thursday, five nuclear specialists employed by Rosatom, Russia's state atomic energy corporation, were killed in a blast at a military test site in northern Russia, not far from the port of Severodvinsk.According to the official account, the elite scientists killed in the accident -- Alexey Vyushin, Yevgeny Koratayev, Vyacheslav Lipshev, Sergey Pichugin and Vladislav Yanovsky -- were killed during tests on a liquid propulsion system involving isotopes.Sarov, known during the Cold War as Arzamas-16, is one of Russia's secret cities. Closed to foreigners and accessible only by special permit, Sarov is the rough equivalent to Los Alamos, New Mexico, one of the birthplaces of US nuclear weapons design.Five Russian nuclear agency workers killed in a blast while testing 'jet propulsion system'In other words, the test most likely had some nuclear dimension. And the reflexive secrecy of the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin has only further fueled speculation about the cause of the accident.Here's what we know: authorities in northern Russia detected a brief rise in radiation levels following an explosion at a military training ground there, Russian state news agency TASS reported Thursday. Read MoreSeverodvinsk has a naval base and shipyard and TASS, citing emergency services, initially said the incident began onboard a ship.The Arkhangelsk regional governor told TASS that the area around the explosion would not be evacuated. But the reports of the brief radiation spike and the lack of information around the incident raised immediate red flags.'An unusual component'While the Russian Ministry of Defense admitted something went wrong, informed observers immediately raised questions about what, exactly, had been going on at the test range.Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, was one of the first to suggest that missile accident had an unusual component. On Twitter, Lewis linked to an August 8 picture captured by satellite imaging company Planet Labs, showing the Serebryanka, a nuclear fuel carrier, near the missile test site in Russia where the explosion and fire broke out. The ship's presence, he speculated, might have been related to the testing of a nuclear-powered cruise missile.The Serebrynka, Lewis noted, was the same ship used to recover a nuclear propulsion unit from a failed nuclear-powered cruise missile test last summer off Novaya Zemlya, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.\"We are skeptical of the claim that what was being tested was a liquid propellant jet engine,\" Lewis told CNN, referring to last week's explosion. \"We think it was a nuclear-powered cruise missile that they call Burevestnik.\" The same missile is known by NATO members as SCC-X-Skyfall. A US official has also told CNN that the explosion was \"likely\" linked to the Skyfall prototype. US President Donald Trump also made the connection, tweeting on Monday: \"The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air and around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!\"The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian \"Skyfall\" explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2019\n\nLittle public information is available about the Burevestnik/Skyfall. But last year, Putin boasted of new weaponry that he claimed would render US missile defenses obsolete. Showing a video, he said: \"As the range is unlimited, the missile can maneuver for as long as necessary.\"Chernobyl and the dangerous ground of 'dark tourism'Questions linger today about whether something dangerous has been released following this incident. According to the local website 29.ru, officials have shut down the Dvina Bay in the White Sea for swimming for a month.Is it the new Chernobyl? Certainly, no massive plume of radiation has been detected, as happened over Scandinavia before the Soviets acknowledged the 1986 disaster. But official secrecy often fuels fears of a cover-up.In this case, the accident seems more reminiscent of an incident that happened 19 years ago: the sinking of the nuclear-powered submarine, the Kursk, led to the deaths of more than 100 sailors and was a public-relations disaster for Putin, who was still newly in office.  Today, unlike then, Putin now enjoys a near-total monopoly on Russian media. And the Kremlin thus far is working to contain and control the embarrassing news about the accident at a secret military test range.CNN's Zachary Cohen, Mary Ilyushina, Zahra Ullah and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

The American's self-imposed three-week break from golf in May and June proved just the tonic -- on Sunday, Reed won The Northern Trust by a shot in New Jersey.His final-round 69 was enough for Reed to maintain the one-stroke advantage he'd started the final day with, handing him his first win since his triumph at last year's Masters. Instead of toiling over the minutia of his game on the practice course, Reed opted to vacation with his family at the Hamptons --  the summertime playground for some of New York's most affluent residents --resisting the urge to pick up his clubs even though he was surrounded by some of the world's best courses.Reed went 10 days without picking up a golf club.

This could be it, this could be the week your beloved soccer team wins that all-important three points. Your nerves are jangling, palms are sweating and nothing in the world can distract you from watching the action as the referee starts lifting the whistle to his lips. All of a sudden, the whistle sounds, and the game is over. You leap into the air celebrating the win like some feral animal, confused by those who don't get this invested into 22 people kicking a ball around a field. Watching soccer is special, there's simply nothing quite like it. But now, thanks to new research led by the University of Leeds, it gets even better. The recent study, due to be released soon, suggests watching your beloved soccer team romp home to victory has a positive impact on your health, with spectators experiencing physical stresses equivalent to going for a brisk 90-minute walk.Read MoreResults also found that a win lifts a spectators mood for a whole 24 hours after the game has finished. \"Ultimately supporting your team at a football match gives you a moderate cardiovascular workout and depending on the result of the match, a psychological boost or slump,\" said Dr. Andrea Utley, the sports scientist who led the study in conjunction with BetVictor.A new study reveals football could be good for your health.'Good stress'The experiment monitored 25 Leeds United fans, aged between 20 and 62, throughout three key games during the Championship last season.One game was watched in a controlled environment while the other two were watched live in the stadium during the team's chaotic playoff finals, with promotion to the English Premier League at stake. Researchers analyzed the participants' heart rates before the game, at halftime and after the match had finished -- noticing that on average heart rates increased by 17 percent. \"There is good stress and there is bad stress and there's a level of arousal which is actually good for you and the level of arousal that takes you over the edge,\" Utley told CNN Sport. \"Although people think watching football takes you over the edge, it doesn't. We found it just kept people at a good level of arousal.\" Heart rates particularly peaked around goal scoring opportunities, with rates increasing 27 percent after a Leeds United goal and 22 percent after an opposition goal. Ultimately, the more the game matters, the bigger the reactions are.

I think we quite enjoy this, we enjoy being passionate.\" However, this was not the case after watching a loss, with blood pressure continuing to rise long after the final whistle.Findings reveal that a defeat can have a \"severe\" impact on fans' mental health. 'Severe slump'The study also noticed how people's mood is hugely affected by the outcome of the match. Participants filled out a short mood survey before and after each game which revealed just how hard a loss can hit supporters. When their team wins, fans experience \"an absolute high\" with the euphoria lasting a day. However, when their team loses, the slump can \"actually be quite severe.\" One of the participants said losing a match felt like a \"low hum\".\"That disappointment of Friday meant that the first thing I thought of when I woke up on Saturday morning was, 'I don't believe we lost that game,'\" they said in a focus group after the game.\"That sort of sets the mood for the rest of that morning until you can pull yourself out of it.\"Another participant said the loss felt like \"a friend has died.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Frank Lampard's first Premier League game as Chelsea manager ended in a humiliating defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford. Two goals from Marcus Rashford and one each from Anthony Martial and debutant Daniel James helped the Reds to a comfortable 4-0 victory in the Premier League's standout fixture from the opening weekend.The game appeared to be evenly poised at the hour mark -- the sides separated only by a first-half penalty from Rashford -- but two goals in the space of a minute allowed United to breathe easily in the game's final quarter. A goal for 21-year-old James shortly after he had come onto the pitch was the icing on the cake. \"We rode our luck a little bit in the first half, we'd given up too many chances and we were too sloppy on the ball,\" Harry Maguire, making his first start just a week after signing for United, told Sky Sports. Read More\"But in the second half it felt like we were a lot better, much more ourselves and we controlled the game. I think we thoroughly deserved the three points in the end.\" READ: Man City opens Premier League title defense with easy victory over West HamREAD: Why watching football is good for your healthRashford scores from the spot against Chelsea.Chelsea appeared to have the upper hand in the opening stages as Tammy Abraham rifled the ball against David De Gea's post inside four minutes. But when Kurt Zouma brought down Rashford with a clumsy challenge in the Chelsea box, the England international stepped up to give the home side the advantage, dispatching his penalty firmly into the top-left corner. The Blues, however, continued to trouble the United goal and struck the post again shortly before halftime through Emerson. But in the second period, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side started to expose Chelsea's frailties on the break. Rashford found himself in space inside his own half and carried strongly towards the Chelsea goal. He fed Pereira, who whipped in an excellent cross that Martial tapped through the legs of Kepa Arrizabalaga.READ: Christian Pulisic's journey from Pennsylvania to London (via Brackley Town and Dortmund)READ: Liverpool cruises past Norwich in Premier League openerJames (right) celebrates giving United a 4-0 lead. United's third came from a long ball over the top of the Chelsea defense from Paul Pogba. Rashford controlled expertly and coolly rolled his shot past Arrizabalaga. James showcased his blistering speed for the game's final goal, where Pogba was once again the provider. The Frenchman found his teammate in space on the right side of the Chelsea box, and James hacked home a deflected shot. It was a nightmare start for Chelsea, which next faces Liverpool in the UEFA Super Cup. Lampard, faced with an injury-hit squad, started with the inexperienced Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount -- both recalled after loan spells in the Championship -- in attack. De Gea was forced to make a few smart saves in the first half -- but remained largely untroubled in the second. \"There were loads of lessons for us, you can't make unforced errors and mistakes at this level,\" said Lampard, Chelsea's all-time top scorer who takes charge of the club after Maurizio Sarri's departure. \"But if you just flicked on and saw it was 4-0 -- it was nowhere near a 4-0.\"We controlled major parts of the first half ... probably made poor decisions in the final third a couple of times when we should be able to get shots away and score goals. At half time we should have been in the lead.\"It was a testing opening day for Lampard and Chelsea. United spent big in the summer transfer window and was duly rewarded as its new signings looked calm and composed. Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka made assured debuts in defense ensuring a clean sheet was kept -- something that happened just twice in the league at Old Trafford last season -- and the pace of James looks likely to trouble a number of defenses over the course of the season. In Sunday's earlier kickoffs, Arsenal defeated Newcastle 1-0 thanks to a second-half goal from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Leicester and Wolves played out a goalless draw at the King Power Stadium.",

The emphatic scoreline bettered rival Liverpool's 4-1 victory over Norwich City on Friday night, further evidence that these two sides will be frontrunners again this season.  It was also an action-packed afternoon for the video assistant referee, which is being used in the Premier League for the first time.

The Seattle native is regularly stopped in the street by people wanting pictures, but the \"perfect 10 girl's\" sudden fame has had it downsides. While the positivity and energy that shone through in her performance as she danced to Beyonc\u00e9 and Tina Turner resulted in glowing praise from all over the world, Ohashi was also subjected to a number of body shaming comments on social media. \"I feel like, a lot of times, I've felt alone when I was going through all this stuff,\" Ohashi told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. \"Social media portrays one side of a person that they don't mind you seeing, but the other parts are hidden and not so openly talked about.

They always say, 'those 15 minutes of fame,' right? I've managed to elongate my time from one gymnastics video, which is really amazing to see. \"And continuing to spread this positive message to other people that might be struggling or need to hear exactly what I've been through.\"READ: Team USA predicted to have another bumper Olympics at Tokyo 2020Overcoming hurdlesOhashi became involved with gymnastics as a three-year-old, and by the age of four, she was able to do a back handspring. But her journey to where she is now -- she scored six perfect 10s in the 2018/19 season -- has been anything but straightforward. Ohashi performances her 'perfect 10' routine for UCLA.At the age of 15 and at the perceived peak of her powers, Ohashi was beating the likes of Simone Biles -- now the most decorated gymnast of all time -- on the way to winning the American Cup. But due to the stress and amount of training she was putting herself through, Ohashi knew she was injured and the pain she was battling through limited any joy she got from winning. After undergoing scans, she discovered she had been competing with a fractured back and two torn shoulders and, going against the advice of the then-national medical coordinator for USA Gymnastics, Larry Nassar, Ohashi had surgery on the injuries.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosOnce a world-renowned sports physician treating America's foremost Olympic women gymnasts, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison last year after more than 150 women and girls said in court that he sexually abused them over the past two decades. After her surgery there was no guarantee Ohashi would be able to participate in gymnastics at all, let alone competitively. But after just a year out and acknowledging that her body could not handle elite gymnastics, she joined the UCLA Bruins gymnastics team and fell in love with the sport again. Eating disordersSurgery isn't the only obstacle Ohashi has had to come overcome. Due to the strenuous demands placed on them by gymnastics, Ohashi and some of her fellow gymnasts were driven to eating disorders. In an interview with Marie Claire in April, Ohashi said of that time: \"We would measure our thighs and if we couldn't fit our hands around our mid-thighs, then we'd stop eating for the rest of the day.Ohashi competes in floor exercise during a meet at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, California.\"Whenever we'd go to a party where there was a lot of food, we'd feel so bad about eating that we would go to the bathroom and throw up without realizing that's an eating disorder.\"Her honesty has struck a chord and Ohashi now regularly receives messages of support from her fans because of the positive body image energy she exudes.\"I got the honor of speaking on the phone with to a girl,\" Ohashi remembers. \"Just last week, I was on FaceTime, and she's gone through a lot of similar injuries that I did. \"And to let her know from an early age that you don't have to be validated by your score or one thing that you do -- you're a human being, and there's so much that we have to offer the world. \"She reached out, and she was just like, 'it helped me so much, and it made me so happy to hear you say that you were proud of me.' That was another thing that was heartwarming to hear.\"READ: The Auburn gymnast who dislocated both knees now just hopes she can walk down the aisleGrowing togetherGiven the Nassar sexual assault scandal, Ohashi says gymnastics can evolve and develop from the dark cloud that has been hanging over the sport.\"I think a lot of it came from ignoring the athletes' voices. So, you can see that the repercussions happened at huge extremes,\" she said. Ohashi attends the UCLA The Wonder Of Women Summit at UCLA.\"Unfortunately, it had to get to this in order to rebuild. But I think we're trying to get on the right path, hopefully, of listening to the athletes and having open communication between athletes and coaches, coaches and parents, and parents and athletes, because that's so important. \"Really taking the time to figure out who they want to represent everyone, in like a checks and balance system almost, because it is very easy for people in high power to take advantage of that and abuse their power.\"But if we are on the same page and understand how important the athlete voices -- which you can start seeing -- everyone's kind of been on the same page of openly speaking out on issues.\"",

Since the latest transfer window opened on May 16 for domestic deals, 11 clubs have smashed their own transfer records, according to the Deloitte Sports Business Group which tracks football finances. In fact, in the case of Premier League newcomers Sheffield United, the club record was smashed on four separate occasions in one single window.The figure of \u00a31.41 billion ($1.7 billion) is the second-highest total spent since the transfer window system was introduced in 2003, falling just short of the \u00a31.43 billion ($1.72 billion) set in the summer of 2017. It also represents the fourth successive transfer window where spending by England's top clubs has been in excess of \u00a31 billion ($1.2 billion).Nicolas Pepe joined Arsenal in a deal worth a reported \u00a372 million ($87 million)Read MoreREAD: Inside the world of the lonely megabucks soccer starREAD: Transfer deadline day: Whatsapp messages, spinning plates and a 'Catch-22'Arsenal, the biggest spenders of the window with an outlay of \u00a3155 million ($187 million), according to Deloitte, led the way ahead of Manchester City on \u00a3150 million ($181 million), Manchester United \u00a3145 million ($175 million), Aston Villa \u00a3125 million ($151 million) and Everton \u00a3110 million ($133 million)\"Premier League clubs' transfer spend continues to be driven by the desire for success on the pitch, ranging from competing at the top of the Premier League and qualification for the UEFA Champions League to simply survival in the top division,\" said Dan Jones, partner at the Sports Business Group at Deloitte.\"This summer has seen over half of the Premier League clubs break their individual player transfer records in pursuit of these objectives.\"Spending upAccording to Deloitte, the average gross player transfer expenditure for a Premier League club in the 2019 summer window was about \u00a371m ($86 million), up from approximately \u00a361 million ($74 million) last year.In addition, the net spend of Premier League clubs during the 2019 summer transfer window is the lowest since 2015. As of August 8, net player expenditure was \u00a3625 million ($754 million) with only three clubs, Chelsea, Liverpool and Crystal Palace, in a net receipts position.\"With this level of net spend, combined with a more modest increase in Premier League broadcast rights values for the coming season than we have seen previously, we would expect wages to increase at a greater rate than revenue, returning to a wages to revenue ratio of 60%,\" Jones said.\"However, this does not signal major financial concerns as Premier League clubs collectively generated pre-tax profits of \u00a3426 million ($514 million) in 2017/18, whilst net spend as a proportion of revenue of 12% is at its lowest since 2012.\" Harry Maguire has become the most expensive defender in football history.READ: German club sacks captain for displaying neo-Nazi sympathyREAD: Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies faces calls to quit after making racist comments Manchester United's \u00a380 million ($97 million) purchase of Harry Maguire from Leicester City set a new world record paid for a defender. It was also the largest fee spent on a single player by a Premier League club closely followed by Arsenal's \u00a372 million ($87 million) signing of Lille winger Nicolas Pepe.Manchester City, aiming for a third consecutive Premier League title, smashed its transfer record with the \u00a362.8 million ($76 million) signing of midfielder Rodri from Atletico Madrid, as well as splashing out \u00a360 million ($72.4 million) on Portuguese defender Joao Cancelo.Tottenham, which reached last season's Champions League final, signed Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon for \u00a353.8 million ($65 million) -- its first first-team acquisition since January 2018.Tottenham Hotspur's Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen has been linked with a move to Spain.While the transfer window in England might have closed, clubs on the continent can still sign players with the window in Germany, Spain and France open until close of play on September 2.That means Premier League clubs can still offload players they may no longer want, or have their best players poached by the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.Manchester United's Paul Pogba has been linked with a move to Spain, as has Tottenham's Christian Eriksen. Leroy Sane, who had previously been a target for Bayern, now looks set to stay at Manchester City after sustaining a cruciate ligament injury.Spanish spending spreeThe problem for English Premier League clubs is that with no facility to replace players, they risk being caught short if a foreign club comes calling with a big-money offer.The increased spending of clubs in Spain's La Liga, currently \u00a31.1 billion($1.3 billion) according to Deloitte, is a new league record after breaking the \u00a31 billion mark for the first time.Two-thirds of that spending has come from just three clubs -- Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid. Antoine Griezmann left Atletico Madrid for Barcelona earlier this summer.Sports lawyer Daniel Geey, author of \"Done Deal: An Insider's Guide to Football Contracts, Million-Pound Transfers and Premier League Big Business,\" believes Premier League clubs could be left in a \"Catch-22\" by the early closure of the transfer window.\"There are at least a couple of situations where you take Christian Eriksen and Paul Pogba, who look like they are wanted by foreign teams,\" Geey told CNN.\"It means their current clubs have a predicament which is whether they need to try and get a replacement in advance of the window closing because of the subsequent risk of them leaving.\"Reactively or proactively, this puts English clubs on a difficult footing. For English clubs, there is an advantage if in the medium term the push is then for European leagues to align.Paul Pogba has been linked with a move away from Manchester United.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features\"Ultimately, what has been the play from Premier League clubs previously is that they want all their business done by the time the season starts.\"Until that alignment happens, European clubs are potentially going to have a destabilizing effect on potential squad members because European windows are open.\"It's a Catch-22. Clubs will be thinking whether they need to replace someone before the end of the window where a continental club can wait until the end of the month to force the issue.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool is now unbeaten in its last 13 games against Norwich City as it started its English Premier League campaign with a dominant 4-1 victory over the newly-promoted side. The reigning European champion barely broke a sweat under the Anfield lights as they ran riot against its inexperienced opposition. In fairness, the disparity between the two clubs was clear before a ball was even kicked on Friday.  Liverpool is defending its UEFA Champions League trophy this season whilst chasing a 19th domestic title. Meanwhile, Norwich was playing in its first top flight game for three years. An already challenging evening quickly became a lot more difficult for the underdogs as Scottish international Grant Hanley scored a calamitous own goal within the opening 10 minutes.Read MoreThe experienced defender was one of only two Norwich players who had previously tasted life in the top flight but his error opened the door for an emphatic Liverpool win. Egyptian star Mo Salah quickly doubled his side's lead before Virgil van Dijk and Divock Origi made it 4-0 at halftime. READ: World's best soccer stars are playing too much, says players' unionREAD: Premier League clubs spend $1.7 billion in summer transfer windowLiverpool brushed aside newly-promoted Norwich City on Friday. However, Teemu Pukki -- who was last season's top scorer in British football's second tier -- gave the visiting fans something to cheer about after he swept home a consolation goal in the second half.\"It was a pretty good second half from us,\" Pukki told Sky Sports after the match. \"We decided at half time it was maybe too much to get some points so we just wanted to go and try and score.\"Liverpool concerns despite winThere was an intensity about the hosts throughout the game which highlighted the cavernous gap between the two sides, and Liverpool fans will hope history continues to repeat itself. The last time Liverpool played Norwich at home on the first day of the season, the Reds went on to win the league.\"We didn't underestimate them at all,\" Liverpool defender Joe Gomez told Sky Sports.\"We knew they'd come here to play football, the manager warned us about that, and they got behind us a few times.\"It was frustrating to concede the goal but we have to learn from it and progress.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will have concerns about his side's defense though which occasionally looked vulnerable against Norwich's front line.  In addition, goalkeeper Alisson Becker -- who was representing Brazil in the Copa America this summer -- was forced off in the first half after picking up an injury. Alisson is one of a number of Liverpool's top players to have had a busy off-season and Klopp has previously criticized the congested fixture list.\"With Alisson it is not good, but we will find a solution and move on,\" Klopp told BBC Sport's Match of the Day after the match.\"He felt his calf. He looked behind him because he thought something hit him.\"Sports scientist Simon Brundish previously told CNN Sport that he predicted a \"catastrophic season for injuries\" with top players unable to rest appropriately between games.

'I love my players'Despite the heavy loss, Norwich can take heart from a gutsy performance which improved in the second half.Manager Daniel Farke promised to stick to the club's new attacking style of play and his side did create a host of chances against far superior opposition. Admirably, four of Norwich's starting lineup had graduated from the club's youth academy but it will have to solidify its defense this season if it wants to avoid a record fifth relegation from the EPL. \"In general we are disappointed we lost the game,\" Farke told Sky Sports. \"We wanted to start with some points but of course unbelievably happy with the character of my team. We showed great character.\"He added: \"We created more chances and had more shots on the goal in the second half. My feeling was in the first half we were not that bad.

The Hunter will serve as a technological demonstrator to prove that Russia can develop and deploy heavy strike drones, and will likely be marketed to third parties, he added.It also faces competition from a rival strike drone, Orion, that is being developed by Kronshtadt Group for the Russian military.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's the day the dollars are splashed, headlines are made nerves are frayed, and football fans flock to their club's stadium to surround television reporters in the desperate bid to catch a glimpse of a new superstar signing.Soccer's transfer deadline day has taken on almost a religious fervor in England as fans await news of a dramatic late signing before, to borrow one of the sport's most overused cliches, \"the transfer window slams shut.\"Driven by rolling news channels, an insatiable appetite for transfer rumors, deadline day itself has arguably become one of the most entertaining days in the football calendar.In England, the world's richest league, the transfer window for Premier League clubs closes at 5 p.m (12 p.m. ET) on Thursday August 8.Juventus' Argentine forward Paulo Dybala has been linked with a move to Tottenham.As the clock ticked down on Thursday the likes of Juventus star Paulo Dybala and Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho are both being linked with a move to Tottenham, while Christian Eriksen is reportedly seeking a transfer away from the north London club with Spain his favored destination. Read MoreThen there's Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku, reportedly destined for a new adventure with Italian giant Inter Milan. And don't forget Brazilian superstar Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain and Gareth Bale at Real Madrid whose futures remain uncertain with their respective clubs.Rumor and speculation are rife, social media goes into meltdown and fans go through an emotional rollercoaster right up until the deadline, and sometimes hours after, as the final paperwork filters through.England defender Harry Maguire is now the most expensive defender in history.Clubs in England's top division have spent just over \u00a31 billion ($1.2 billion) so far this summer, fractionally down on last year's total of \u00a31.2 billion ($1.46 billion), and \u00a31.4 billion ($1.7 billion) in 2017.Several Premier League sides such as Arsenal and Manchester City have smashed their own transfer records, while newcomers Sheffield United have done similarly on four separate occasions since winning promotion to the Premier League.Aston Villa, which is back in the top-flight after winning the Championship playoff final, has reportedly spent over \u00a3130 million already ($158m).And then there's Manchester United, which broke the world record paid for a defender when it splashed out $97 million for Leicester's Harry Maguire just this week.But while the cash is being thrown around and the dramatic rhetoric surrounding deadline day grows ever more frenzied  the reality behind the scenes is slightly more prosaic, according to David Seligman, a UK sports lawyer at Brandsmiths.Barcelona's Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho looks set to leave the club.READ: Inside the world of the lonely megabucks soccer starREAD: Alejandro Bedoya on gun violence: \"More needs to be done\"\"It appears it has been left late, but it hasn't been left late,\" Seligman told CNN Sport when asked about all those apparent last-minute deals.\"Deals that happen on deadline day can be months in the making -- it's just that the deadline forces the parties to ultimately reach a compromise whether it's on wages, the transfer fee or an agent's commission.\"It might appear to the media that it has been done overnight but the player would have been tracked for a long time and they've possibly been speaking for a while.\"Usually a player's personal terms are agreed with the club way before deadline day. The last thing that is agreed, which should probably be the first thing agreed in practice, is the amount the player is going to get sold for.\"Manchester United's Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku could be set to leave the club.According to Seligman, in some cases the player's agent will already have advised a potential buying club of his client's salary and bonus terms as well as the potential asking price.\"There's no point in having a negotiation with a selling club if they haven't agreed personal terms with the player or terms with the agent.\"The ballpark salary and commission are generally agreed before clubs enter into protracted negotiations regarding transfer fees otherwise you'd wasting your time.\"Tottenham Hotspur's Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen has been linked with a move to Spain.READ: German club sacks captain for displaying neo-Nazi sympathyREAD: Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies faces calls to quit after making racist comments While TV channels, live blogs and social media go into overdrive on deadline day, the reality behind the curtain can be just as stressful for those involved. Phil Korklin, soccer agent and co-owner of UK-based Momentum Sports Management says it can be frantic with phones buzzing and Whatsapp messages flooding in.\"If you have deals on the go it can be hugely frantic, especially waiting for a club to give a player permission to travel for a medical,\" Korklin told CNN.\"Then there's the domino effect where a club is waiting to sign a player in order to let your player go. It's just like a house chain but with a deadline.\"If one deal falls through, the whole chain falls apart and there can be a lot of unhappy players and clubs left in the lurch. So it all needs to be handled very carefully indeed, spinning lots of plates all at once.\"Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace has been linked with a move away from Selhurst Park.That deadline is almost upon England's top division but other European leagues have a while longer to spend their millions.Spanish, French and German clubs can buy until September 2 meaning some Premier League teams may be reluctant to let players go without being able to replace them.Given Europe's longer purchasing period, English clubs face a period of uncertainty after its own window closes with overtures for its star players from the continent's biggest clubs a potential menace.Sports lawyer Daniel Geey, author of \"Done Deal: An Insider's Guide to Football Contracts, Million-Pound Transfers and Premier League Big Business,\" believes Premier League clubs could be left in a \"Catch-22\" by the early closure of the transfer window.Paul Pogba of Manchester United has been linked with Spanish club Real Madrid.\"There are at least a couple of situations where you take Christian Eriksen and Paul Pogba, who look like they are wanted by foreign teams,\" Geey told CNN.\"It means their current clubs have a predicament which is whether they need to try and get a replacement in advance of the window closing because of the subsequent risk of them leaving.\"Reactively or proactively, this puts English clubs on a difficult footing. For English clubs, there is an advantage if in the medium term the push is then for European leagues to align.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features\"Ultimately, what has been the play from Premier League clubs previously is that they want all their business done by the time the season starts.\"Until that alignment happens, European clubs are potentially going to have a destabilizing effect on potential squad members because European windows are open.\"It's a Catch-22. Clubs will be thinking whether they need to replace someone before the end of the window where a continental club can wait until the end of the month to force the issue.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)When the world tunes in for Friday's curtain raiser of this season's English Premier League, they will be witnessing a true baptism of fire.After threes seasons out of the top flight, Norwich City travels to Anfield as a rank outsider. Among the hot favorites to be relegated, many predict the newly-promoted team to provide little opposition to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, still riding the wave of its UEFA Champions League triumph last season.And who can blame them? After all, the disparity between the two clubs is cavernous.As well as starting the new season as the reigning European champion, Liverpool finished second in the league last season -- falling just short of Manchester City by a single point in one of the most tightly fought campaigns in the history of the division. And let's not forget Liverpool's history. The Reds have won the domestic title 18 times and have been champions on Europe on six occasions. Meanwhile Nowich has spent most of its modern history yo-yoing between the first and second tiers of English football. Read More\"Apprehension is probably the overriding emotion for me,\" said lifelong Norwich fan Jack Reeve, founder of podcast Talk Norwich City, speaking to CNN Sport ahead of Friday's game.\"Nobody expected us to go up last season so I guess that puts us in a tricky situation. We are where we are but we didn't expect to be here.\" READ: Premier League predictions -- Liverpool or Manchester City? Kane or Aguero?READ: Manchester City beats Liverpool to begin defense of its domestic quadrupleEuropean champion Liverpool face newly promoted Norwich in the English Premier League opener. Global vs. local supportReeve has spent six years growing his fan podcast which now boasts over 16,000 YouTube subscribers.The 21-year-old knows the club more than most having interviewed players both past and present whilst following his team up and down the country. Like many Norwich fans, he is excited to be back with the \"big boys\" this season having watched his side languish in obscurity in recent years and knows exactly what this game means to the wider community. \"You're almost in a little bubble because wherever you go, everyone supports Norwich,\" he added, describing the buzz around the city ahead of the season.\"Norwich is not very well connected so it feels like us against them at times. People don't want us to succeed, so we will try even harder to succeed.\"Norwich, owned by one of Britian's most loved celebrity chefs Delia Smith, has to rely on predominantly local support which cannot compare to Liverpool's global fan base.The iconic Anfield stadium, with its capacity of just over 54,000, holds almost double Norwich's Carrow Road ground alone but Reeve says being a smaller club offers spectators a \"unique\" experience. \"I think there's a lot of pressure and there's a lot of expectation on players who come to Norwich because for a lot of fans, it's all they've got and it's all they live for,\" he said. READ: Wayne Rooney to leave DC United for Derby County in return to English footballLiverpool Anfield stadium is world famous, holding a 54,074 capacity. Norwich City's historic Carrow Road holds a capacity of 27,244 capacity. Tired Liverpool?Since Norwich was last in the EPL, Liverpool has spent millions molding one of the most complete squads in the world.The Reds spent $226 million on recruiting players ahead of the 2018/2019 season alone and paid agents $57.2 million (\u00a343,795,863) between February 2018 and January 2019 -- the most of any English club in this period.In comparison, Norwich has never spent more than $12.5 million (\u00a310m) on a single player and has resisted the temptation to splash the cash again this summer, despite netting a potential windfall of more than $206 million for promotion. World's best soccer stars are playing too much, says players' unionHowever, one of Liverpool's concerns this season is just how many games they will have to play.As well as 38 Premier League games and defending its Champions League title, Liverpool will travel to Qatar in December to play in FIFA's Club World Cup tournament. Klopp's team will also compete in two domestic cup competitions -- the FA Cup and League Cup -- while on August 14 play Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup final.A new report by FIFPRO said players such as Sadio Mane, Alisson Becker and Mo Salah -- all of which played international tournaments this summer, hampering their ability to rest -- could be at risk of burnout.Klopp himself has been critical of the season's start date, having already played and lost the Community Shield against Manchester City. \"I don't know why we start that early. The Premier League is such a wonderful product. It doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"I love football. From my point of view we can play each week but somebody has to think about the players and nobody is doing it.\"READ: Alejandro Bedoya on US gun violence: 'More needs to be done'Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is not happy with the EPL schedule. Quiet revolution Despite being unable to compete with Liverpool on a financial basis, Norwich has been undergoing a quiet revolution over the last couple of years.A restructuring of the club's hierarchy, more pertinently the arrival of sporting director Stuart Webber in 2017, has seen a rapid turnaround in the club's fortunes. Webber, who previously worked as Liverpool's director of recruitment, has set about adopting a philosophy that runs through the entire club and out into the wider community. Along with team manager Daniel Farke, Webber has created a winning mentality that's mirrored the fortunes of his former team Huddersfield -- which he helped promote to the EPL in 2017. Even still, last season was simply not meant to happen and promotion came as very pleasant surprise.\"It means that we're coming up to the Premier League with a squad that a lot of people have written off already,\" added Reeve, admitting last season was a shock. \"I mean, you look at the odds, I think we are second favorites to go down and I think that's probably justified in a way because we've spent barely spent any money.\"READ: The loneliness of the megabuck soccer starNorwich City manager Daniel Farke has implemented an exciting style of play at the club.  'Let's show the EPL what we can do'Central to the club's new philosophy is a considered transfer policy which has seen a host of previously unknown players come in and surprise a lot of people.That approach has seen the likes of Argentine Emi Buendia and Finn Teemu Pukki join the club, both of whom have had a huge impact.Striker Pukki was perhaps the most surprising success, arriving for free before becoming the Championship's top scorer (29 goals) in his first season at Carrow Road, although he's yet to come up against the likes of Liverpool's record signing Virgil van Dijk.  Meanwhile, youngsters such as Max Aarons and Jamal Lewis have proved welcome additions to the team  having graduated from the youth academy -- an aspect of the club rejuvenated under Webber's watchful eye. \"For me, I think he's [Webber] is a genius,\" added Reeve, who interviewed the 35-year-old on his podcast ahead of the new season.  \"It's just been a really slow process but there's always been an end goal and he's always been honest and open with the fans. We don't get that across football nowadays.\" Webber is also realistic about where the team stands but is determined to stick to his plan.\"I'm confident we'll give it an unbelievably good go. I really do,\" he told Talk Norwich City podcast.\"I'm enjoying all the experts telling us that we need to spend this, you need to do that. It's great because it's the same stuff we were hearing last year. Let's go and prove people wrong, embrace it and enjoy it.\"Emi Buendia was one of Norwich City's best performers last season. German influence  Farke, also instrumental in implementing the new brand of football, has drawn parallels with counterpart Klopp since moving to English football in 2017.Both German managers spent time at Borussia Dortmund in the past -- albeit at different times and Farke taking charge of the reserve side -- and both have seemingly energized their current club whilst adopting a friendly approach to the media. As a result, Klopp will be facing some of his former players on Friday, with the likes of Mario Vrancic, Marco Stiepermann and Moritz Leitner likely to feature for Norwich. \"It's a really interesting story, pretty much all German managers who work in England managed at Borussia Dortmund, that's really funny,\" Klopp told Optus Sport. \"He's [Farke] doing an incredible job.\"READ: Harry Maguire completes record $97 million move to Manchester UnitedNorwich City won the Championship, England's second divison, last season.Reeve hopes the energetic and attacking brand of football that Norwich has now adopted will give his side a chance against a Liverpool side expected to be firm challengers for every competition this season.Let's not forget that the last time Liverpool played Norwich at home on the first day of the season, the Reds went on to win the league. \"Let's go there and let's show the world what we're about,\" Reeve added. \"Let's play the football we played last season, football that took us up as champions by some distance and was so successful and let's show the English Premier League what we can do.\"",

But in what until recently was predominantly a male-dominated sport in Ireland, getting the opportunity to compete in boxing as a women proved more challenging.Despite training with boys at her local club, St. Fergal's Boxing Club in Bray, Ireland, Taylor had to remain at home when the boys traveled to competitions.\"I think I was the only female boxer in the country at a time, so I used to have to pretend I was a boy to get in to these competitions,\" she remembers. \"I used to have my hair up in my headgear and I used to be known as 'Kay Taylor.' So, when I took the headgear off at the end of the fight and everyone realized I was a girl, there was uproar.\"READ: Manny Pacquiao beats Keith Thurman in split decision for welterweight crownChanging perceptionsGrowing up on what her mother describes as one of the \"worst estates in the country\" -- Old Court in Bray, near Dublin -- boxing for Taylor provided a means of escape.There weren't many women boxing role models to look up to but Deirdre Gogarty -- Ireland's first female professional boxer -- was just that to TaylorTaylor (L) fights with Yana Zavyalova from Ukraine during the semifinals of the European Amateur boxing in 2007.The Drogheda native was the internationally recognized world champion who couldn't fight in her own home and had to leave the country in order to fight professionally.Little did Taylor know it, but her persistence and abilities in the ring were changing people's ideas about women's boxing in Ireland. And coached by her father and training with her two elder brothers, Taylor's perseverance began to pay off.In 2001, aged just 15, Taylor fought Alanna Audley at the National Stadium in Dublin in what was the first officially sanctioned female boxing match in Ireland.\"I just remember being so excited,\" remembers Taylor. \"I'm actually getting my first official female fight and I don't think I realized how big it, the event, actually was, or the enormity of it.\"To get ready for my first official female fight was a history making fight and women's boxing hasn't looked back since.\"READ: Tyson Fury announces rematch with Deontay WilderIt all comes down to thisAfter that bout, Taylor spent years traveling the world fighting in amateur tournaments -- and often winning them.She wasn't just useful in a pair of boxing gloves. Taylor was equally talented with her feet -- so much so she played 11 times for Ireland's senior international soccer side including a number of qualifiers for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.But the dream of winning Olympic gold focused her mind on boxing.Taylor plays against the USA during an international soccer game in 2006.\"I remember getting invited to a competition in Chicago for the Olympic committee,\" recalls Taylor, who was told that the fight would determine whether women's boxing would be in the Olympic Games.\"So, it was a huge pressure fight. What a position to be in. Petitioning for women's boxing so that they have a right in the Olympic Games. And thankfully they passed it after that fight and women's boxing is in the Olympic Games now to stay.\"Taylor's trophies are on display in her mother's new house -- which is where she stays when she returns to Bray from her new base in Connecticut in the US.Hanging on hooks beside the shelves that hold her belts are five world championship gold medals, six European gold medals, and five European Union gold medals, but there is one medal in particular that draws attention.Seated on the top shelf in its own case is the gold medal Taylor won at the 2012 Olympics in London, something she describes as the \"pinnacle\" of her career. She was also Ireland's flag bearer at the Games.Taylor looks at her gold medal at the 2012 Olympics.During the award ceremony, the Irish boxer was perfectly prepared to receive the gold medal because as a youngster, according to her mother, Taylor used to practice how she would accept a medal if she were to win one.\"It feels like a distant memory now, but to be the flagbearer for the London Olympics and to go and win the gold medal at that, it's a childhood dream, right there,\" Taylor said.\"There wasn't a day that went by where I didn't actually dream of that gold medal.\"READ: Hugo Santillan becomes second boxer to die in a week from injuries sustained in a fightFamily supportAthletes from all disciplines often credit the impact their parents have had on their careers, and Taylor is no different.Bridget and Peter Taylor spent countless hours ferrying their four children to different sporting events -- in some instances, they used to drive past each other in their respective cars heading to different events.They fanned her love for boxing by buying their daughter DVDs of her favourite fighters -- in fact, Taylor describes one of her \"greatest Christmas presents\" as a DVD of every single one of Sugar Ray Leonard's fights.Taylor loses to Mira Potkonen of Finland in Rio de Janeiro.Heading into the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Taylor was the favourite to retain the gold medal. But just before the 2016 Games started Peter -- her coach since she had taken up boxing -- separated from Bridget and moved away from the family ahead of the tournament and she was eliminated in the quarterfinals, beaten by Mira Potkonen of Finland.\"We spent every single day together. We shared many great moments together,\" an emotional Taylor remembers.\"We were definitely a great team. But just a breakdown of the relationship. Because he was obviously a great father.\"And I spent every single day with him. Trying to get ready for a big competition in the Rio Olympics, I guess I just couldn't really focus.\"I guess it hurt so much just because of how much I loved him as well. But I still have a great relationship with my Dad. I still absolutely love him. He's always been a hero to me. And, and that will never change as well. But just to go through that was really difficult for me.\"READ: He got into trouble for fighting as a kid. Now Jamyle Cannon's boxing program is helping students stay on the right pathThe start of something bigTaylor is very open about 2016 being her worst year in the ring after she lost three fights in four months.\"Life is about mountain tops and valleys,\" reflects Taylor. \"It's great being on top of the mountain, but the valleys are the places that mature you.\"That's where our character is built. And I knew that after the Rio Olympics there, I needed to change something. My career was going downhill very, very fast and I knew I needed to change.\"So Taylor contacted trainer Ross Enamait, who suggested she should move out to Connecticut to train with him.Despite being a self-proclaimed \"home bird,\" Taylor relocated to the US and only comes back to Bray to visit her family.  After the Rio Olympics, Taylor also agreed her first professional contract with Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing in October 2016.She's won all 14 of her first professional fights, claiming the WBA, WBO and IBF female lightweight titles.That 14th fight -- a unification bout against the holder of the WBC female lightweight title Delfine Persoon, a Belgian police inspector who trains the riot squad in her native country -- was on the undercard of the recent Anthony Joshua vs. Andy Ruiz contest.Taylor celebrates after her win against Delfine Persoon.It was to test all of Taylor's skill and mental strength.The scoring of her 10-round victory over Persoon -- 95-95, 96-94, 96-94 -- was questioned by many in the boxing community, with former world champion Carl Frampton calling it a \"disgraceful decision,\" while former world heavweight champion David Haye even suggested that Taylor secured the victory as a result of \"political power.\"\"It's actually a very, very easy fight to score in my mind,\" says Taylor. \"A lot of people had it 6-4 to me. Some people had it 5-all. But very, very few people, that I've spoken to, actually had her winning.\"And I've spoken to a lot of boxing experts over the last few weeks doing interviews and they all had me winning as well.\"But, you know, people don't speak about that those sorts of things. They just focus on the controversy. And zone in on the negative comments.\"Following that controversial victory, the demands for a rematch have grown.\"The rematch is going to be on the cards very, very soon,\" says Taylor. \"And I can't wait for that. I think people are going to be more interested in the rematch because of how close the fight actually was and how exciting the fight was.\"I definitely look forward to beating her a little bit more convincingly. She's a fantastic fighter. And a fantastic champion. And I don't think people really gave her any credit coming into this fight.\"The wider contextSince Taylor turned professional in 2016 there's been a noticeable change in attitudes towards women boxing with the number of kids getting involved in the sport increasing steadily over recent years. According to the Irish Athletic Boxing Authority, there are around 11,000 girls participating in boxing in Ireland at the moment. Taylor takes part in a training session ahead of her fight against Nina Meinke.\"I love the fact that I can have a positive influence on young girls coming up and be a great example to them,\" said Taylor, who during a visit to Temple Street Children's Hospital with CNN, brought plenty of smiles to lots of kids' faces.\"I really feel like it has had a great influence on this nation as well. Which is a great feeling to have.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\"Every single boxing club in the whole country is just packed with female boxers now. And when I started boxing, I felt like I was the only female boxer around.\"So, to have a lot of girls looking up to you and to see so much talent going up is probably the most satisfying part of this journey.\"",

Manchester City will aim to defend its title for a third consecutive season, while Champions League winner Liverpool will hope to win its first domestic crown since 1990.Vincent Kompany of Manchester City lifts the Premier League trophy after winning at Brighton.It's Liverpool that gets the 2019/20 season underway with a home clash against newly-promoted Norwich on Friday night as Jurgen Klopp's men look to put down an early marker.But what does this season have in store? Will Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane win the Golden Boot? Can anyone spring a surprise and break into the top four? Could we see another shock such as a Leicester City title triumph? Let's face it, probably not.Read MoreFortunately, CNN Sport's football experts have some words of wisdom to offer before it all kicks off once again.Matias Grez (Charlton Athletic)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Manchester City. Having strengthened in the one area that needed strengthening, signing Rodri from Atletico Madrid to support and (eventually) replace Fernandinho, it's hard to see any team halting City's well-oiled machine. Coupled with Liverpool, its nearest rival from last season, yet to strengthen its first team squad, I expect City to run away with the title this year. 2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?Alexis Sanchez. Having been pilloried for his performances since leaving Arsenal for Manchester United -- and rightly so -- this will be the season we see the Alexis of old. It's hard to believe a player who was world class a mere two seasons ago can seemingly turn into a bad player overnight. His performances for Chile at this year's Copa America proved that the old Alexis Sanchez is still in there somewhere.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?Sergio Aguero. Simply put, he's one of the best strikers the Premier League has ever seen, still in his prime and playing in the league's deadliest front line. Harry Kane might run him close purely down to his incredible individual ability, but the Argentine should edge it.Sergio Aguero scored 21 goals in the Premier League last season.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Leicester. Already boasting an exciting core of young attacking talent, the Foxes finished last season in good form following the appointment of Brendan Rodgers. A manager who favors an entertaining style of football, coupled with the exciting permanent addition of Youri Tielemens and the hard-working Ayoze Perez, it looks to be an ideal match. 5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? Alexis Sanchez to win the league and Crystal Palace to get relegated, passing Charlton on its way up.You can follow Matias on Twitter hereAimee Lewis (Liverpool)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp has not any made major signings this summer but the squad, bolstered by the return to fitness of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Joe Gomez and the promising Rhian Brewster after the trio missed substantial spells of the 2018/19 campaign, looks well equipped to end Manchester City's reign as champion. 2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?New Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has no Eden Hazard to bamboozle Premier League defenses after the brilliant Belgian was lured to Real Madrid. Christian Pulisic has been signed to fill the void -- but keep an eye on England teenager Callum Hudson-Odoi. Currently recovering from an Achilles injury, the talented 18-year-old can make an impact for the Blues this season.Callum Hudson-Odoi made his England debut last season.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?Harry Kane. Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang beat Kane to the Golden Boot last season, but the England striker -- blighted by injuries in recent campaigns -- has enjoyed a full preseason and says he \"feels sharp.\" Should injuries not hamper his season once again, he should surpass the 27 goals he scored for club and country last season.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Norwich. My colleague Ben Church supports the Canaries and he may never make me another cup of tea again were I to not at least hope that newly-promoted Norwich will stay up and thus surprise many by avoiding becoming the most relegated team in Premier League history.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? Racism in English football has frequently been in the news this year. Lord Ouseley, Kick It Out chairman, said in February that English football was \"dysfunctional\" in the way it tackled racism. More needs to be done to deal with the worrying rise in racist incidents.You can follow Aimee on Twitter hereJames Masters (Leyton Orient)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Manchester City look nigh on impregnable and it's difficult to see anyone getting as close to it this season as Liverpool did last. Liverpool's remarkable campaign in which it lost just one game all season and yet still finished second to City shows how tough the task can be. Liverpool aside, it's difficult to see any other club challenging for the title.2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?When a star player leaves a club, it leaves a vacuum for someone else to step into the limelight. For Ross Barkley, this could be the moment. The departure of Eden Hazard means Barkley is likely to be afforded more space to influence Chelsea's play in the final third. He's looked excellent in preseason, but whether he can finally fulfill his undoubted potential remains a perennial question. 3) Who will win the Golden Boot?As a player who scored his first ever goal in professional football for Leyton Orient, I'm not ashamed to say I've always had a soft spot for Harry Kane. The forward has finally had some much needed rest, has looked sharp in preseason and will look to hit the ground running. If he can avoid the injuries which affected him last season then there's no reason why he can't be top of the charts once again.Harry Kane playing for Leyton Orient during a loan spell as a teenager.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?I really like the look of Leicester City going into the new season. The signing of Youri Tielemans is a terrific piece of business, and James Maddison in midfield should benefit from having completed his debut year in the Premier League. Under Brendan Rodgers, Leicester will give some of the big clubs a real fright.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? That football's governing bodies can finally show they are able to tackle racism efficiently and effectively. There's no room for racism in football -- it's about time that actions matched words. You can follow James on Twitter hereBen Church (Norwich City)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Liverpool -- only because it has to win it again eventually. Confidence should be soaring through the side after its European triumph and the players certainly have the quality to win it. It almost won it last year and Mohamed Salah wasn't even in his best form. 2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?A diminutive Argentine attacker who has the ability to take players on a score wonderful goals -- remind you of anyone? Yes, that's right, it's Emi Buendia of Norwich City.The 22-year-old hasn't played in the EPL before but his ability to produce magic out of nowhere will be a pleasure to watch.3) Who will win the Golden Boot and what makes him your top choice?It's hard to look past Harry Kane. If, and it's a big if, he stays fit then I can't see anyone scoring more goals. He knows exactly where the net is and is, possibly, the best finisher in the league. Emi Buendia of Norwich City lifts the Championship trophy in celebration.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Norwich (and not because they're my team). The Canaries were promoted last season and many people think they're going straight back down. These people are wrong. The entire club has been rejuvenated and it's on a more stable path. Morale in the team is high and its style of football will grace the EPL.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to be a success at Manchester United. I've always had a soft spot for the Red side of Manchester (unpopular, I know) and the EPL doesn't feel right without United challenging for the title. If anyone can wake the sleeping giant, it's the \"baby-faced assassin.\"You can follow Ben on Twitter hereJohn Sinnott (Liverpool)1) Who will win the Premier League title?One hundred and ninety eight points over the last two seasons points to why Manchester City will win the Premier League for a third year running. Liverpool pushed Guardiola's City all the way to the 38th game in the 2018/192 campaign before losing out by a single point but the European champion's involvement in the Club World Cup in December will make it tough for Jurgen Klopp's side to replicate last season's feats.2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?Arsenal's new $87.9 million signing Nicolas Pepe's 22 goals and 11 assists was key to helping French club Lille qualify for the Champions League last season. No wonder Lille coach Christophe Galtier said of the 24-year-old Ivory Coast international impressive Ligue 1 campaign: \"He is exceptional. He is an incredible talent and he has proved this season that he is a world-class player already.\"Ivorian forward Nicolas Pepe is tipped to make a big impact in the English Premier League.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?Sergio Aguero has scored 164 goals in 239 Premier League appearances for City -- that's 0.69 goals per match. It's not just the goals which makes Aguero the favorite to win the Golden Boot, it's the teammates he has around him in creating chance after chance and City's relentlessness in scoring goals -- 95 last season and 106 in the one before. At times Aguero must feel he's like a kid left alone in a sweet shop.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?West Ham finished 10th last season in Manuel Pellegrini's first season in charge. The London club has signed striker Sebastien Haller in a club record deal worth up to \u00a345 million ($54 million) and midfielder Pablo Fornals from Villarreal. West Ham host champion Mancester City on the opening day of the season, but Pelligrini's teams play an exciting brand of football and expect the Hammers to cause the Premier League's top six teams problems.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? That VAR decisions aren't too time consuming ...You can follow John on Twitter herePatrick Sung Cuadrado (Real Madrid)1) Who will win the Premier League title?La Liga is the only thing that matters, but probably Liverpool because it will put all its eggs in one basket for the league, while Manchester City (and Pep) worries about the Champions League.2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?Dani Ceballos is an incredible talent and should do really well in Unai Emery's system. He deserved a lot more playing time at Real Madrid and should shine on loan at Arsenal.Arsenal's Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored 21 Premier League goals last season.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?CoughMessiCough But the EPL Golden Boot, probably Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang since Arsenal's attack will only get better this year and he'll have plenty of goal-scoring chances.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Norwich. Why? I couldn't tell you, but I like their mascot and my colleague Ben used to be in their academy, so I'll choose them.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be? For Arsenal to be great again so my Gooner friends won't be so sad this year. But yeah, honestly, my only hope for football this year is Real Madrid not to be terrible anymore.You can follow Patrick on Twitter hereMassimo Marioni (Arsenal)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Liverpool. They'll be hungrier than Man City, who have won back-to-back titles, and riding high from their Champions League win, though injuries could leave them exposed in key areas.Liverpool's players celebrate winning the Champions League.2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?Callum Hudson-Odoi. The 18-year-old should finally get a sustained run in Chelsea's first team this season due to their transfer ban, and having impressed in brief glimpses last year, this could be his breakthrough season under new boss Frank Lampard.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?Harry Kane. Spurs are playing their first full season in their new stadium and after slipping behind the Premier League's leading scorers last year -- mainly due to injury -- the stage is set for the England man to return to the top after an impressive pre-season.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Leicester. They were resurgent under new manager Brendan Rodgers last season, and have made smart signings in tieing up a permanent deal for Youri Tielemans and picking up Ayoze Perez from Newcastle United. Need to replace Harry Maguire effectively though given his move to Manchester United.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be?For Pep Guardiola to realise he's wasting his time at Manchester City and leave to manage Arsenal -- but only after relegating Spurs on the last day of the season.You can follow Massimo on Twitter hereDom Rech (Burnley)1) Who will win the Premier League title?Before reading anything, please take most of the following with a pinch of salt.  If there is one man who can cause an upset this season, it's Sean Dyche. Leicester City surprised everyone when they lifted the trophy in 2016, so why can't Burnley do the impossible? Manchester City may have money, Liverpool may have flair, but Burnley have good old-fashioned grit and determination. I am, of course, partially joking. However, If the wheels fall off the wagon for everyone else in the league (perhaps all 19 other outfits) this may be Burnley's time.Sean Dyche was appointed Burnley manager in 2012.2) Who is your player to watch in this year's Premier League?Jay Rodriguez. I'll try and not make every answer Burnley related but the boy is home and back at Turf Moor. I'm not exaggerating when I say Rodriguez is good and he's even better with a claret and blue Jersey on. He came through the Burnley academy. He was made in Burnley. He's returned to Burnley. He'll do wonders again for Burnley. If the striker doesn't score more than 10 Premier League goals this season, I will eat a hat. Aside from that, Wolves' Raul Jimenez is a player who I think will cause a lot of trouble for opponents this year.3) Who will win the Golden Boot?It's a tough one. Ashley Barnes, Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez will make it an interesting three-horse race but I think Arsenal's Piere-Emerick Aubameyang will pip them all to the top spot. The man is prolific and now that Unai Emery has a season under his belt, this could be the year to get the best out of his number 14 striker. I think Harry Kane and Sergio Aguero will underperform this year.4) Which team will be the surprise story of the season?Aston Villa. Unfortunately not the shade of claret and blue, which is closest to my heart. I watched them a little last season in the Championship and thought they were impressive. They now have a wonderful goalkeeper in Tom Heaton (for an absolute bargain too -- from Burnley), so I think they will be the surprise team of the season.5) If you could make one wish for this Premier League season, what would it be?For Burnley's Sean Dyche to be knighted. Well, maybe not knighted but perhaps a strong season and a manager of the year award. He was unjustly beaten by Manchester City's Pep Guardiola a couple of years ago and it still hurts. I hope he is at least given the respect he deserves by all across the Premier League and football. He takes a hard working club and helps them overperform year in, year out. Dyche's gruff, gravelly tone and slick amber hair is enough alone to deserve respect.You can follow Dom on Twitter hereThink we've got it right? Think we've got it hopelessly wrong?

But they have said there are no initial signs of foul play, according to the UK Press Association (PA).Quoirin's family, however, insisted that she would not have left her bedroom herself.Read More\"Nora's family believe she has been abducted,\" they said in a statement carried by PA. \"We are especially worried because Nora has learning and developmental disabilities, and is not like other 15-year-olds.\"\"She looks younger, she is not capable of taking care of herself, and she won't understand what is going on,\" they added. \"She never goes anywhere by herself. We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.\"Members of search and rescue teams work at a temporary operation shelter near to The Dusun resort on Tuesday.The Dusun resort, where the family were staying, is in a remote area 800 feet above sea level in the Titiwangsa mountain range. It contains six houses, each surrounded by rainforest, and has capacity for just 20 guests.In a statement posted online, the management of the Dusun resort said that hotel staff searched the 12 acre (48,562 square meter) property \"all Sunday morning,\" before then joining the wider police search.

        "content": "(CNN)Ever since the earliest recorded form of football was played in 200 BC, various forms of the Beautiful Game have been invented and reimagined over the years. From futsal and beach football, to more recent iterations that have seen it combined with other sports, such as footgolf and footvolley, different variants of football are constantly evolving.The latest is Teqball; born in Hungary, it already looks to be taking football-mad Brazil by storm.The brainchild of former professional footballer Gabor Borsanyi -- who co-founded the game with businessman Gyuri Gattyan and computer scientist Viktor Huszar -- Teqball involves playing with a football on a surface that resembles a curved table tennis table.Played as singles or doubles, it requires players to take one touch to control the ball and return towards their opponent at the other end of the table.Read MoreRonaldinho says he doesn't want to be a football coach or manager.READ: Neymar, Bale, Coutinho -- The loneliness of the megabuck soccer starREAD: World's best footballers are 'reaching threshold of human endurance'Ronaldinho, Teqball addictAmong its official ambassadors -- or \"Teqers\" -- Teqball counts World Cup winners Carles Puyol, Robert Pires and Christian Karembeu, Portuguese legend Luis Figo, Premier League legend Gianfranco Zola and, as the latest addition to its list, two-time FIFA World Player of the Year Ronaldinho.The former Barcelona star is a self-confessed Teqball addict since discovering the game a couple of years ago, sometimes playing for up to six hours consecutively.The 39-year-old last played professional football in 2015 for Brazilian club Fluminense and has since had stints playing in India's Futsal Premier League, although the thought of returning to football as a manager is not something he has ever entertained.Former Real Madrid stars -- and 'Teqers' -- Luis Figo and Christian Karembeu play in Monaco.\"No, no, no, it's not for me,\" he laughs. \"I don't see myself as a coach, it's never gone through my head.\"Such is his enthusiasm for this new game, Ronaldinho and his brother will now start the official Teqball Federation in Brazil.\"When I am at home, I play it everyday,\" he tells CNN Sport. \"Once I discovered it, I started playing regularly with my friends. Today in Brazil, nearly everybody plays it, on the beach or wherever. \"I had already played it a few years ago but not on a table like this and when I saw the new table formats I liked it a lot. Since then we haven't stopped playing.\"Known for always playing with street football flair and a grin on his face, Ronaldinho says he fell in love with Teqball first and foremost because it involved a ball.\"I've always been like that since I was small, the funnest part of my day was when I had a ball at my feet,\" he says. \"That's why I was always smiling, because whenever I had the opportunity to be with the ball it was always the happiest part of my day.\"Argentina's players Juan Foyth (L) and Milton Casco (R) play teqball during a training session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.$10,000 prizeDespite Brazil already being addicted to the 11-a-side version, beach football and footvolley, Teqball has managed to break through and become one of many Brazilians' favorite pastimes.\"In Brazil we play on the street, but this game is different,\" Ronaldinho explains. \"We've always loved footvolley on the beach but when it rains we want to play inside.\"Now we play almost everyday and everybody likes it, nearly every football club has a table inside the dressing room for warmups and training. It's something that is growing a lot.\"Ajax, Arsenal, Chelsea, Flamengo, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are just a few of the clubs around the world that Teqball now count as official users.\"It helps a lot with the technical aspect of your game,\" Ronaldinho says. \"To make sure the ball doesn't leave you, you have to move and have a certain technique that you need to improve.\"Ronaldinho says he sometimes plays for up to six hours in a row.Later this year the sport's organizers will stage the third annual Teqball World Cup.The 2017 and 2018 editions were hosted in Budapest, Hungary and Reims, France and the gold medal winners last year in singles and doubles -- top dogs of 90 competitors -- were given $10,000.Co-founder Huszar says one of the organization's legacies is their donation of the tables to the host cities for use in schools and public parks.Despite his renowned skill with a ball, Ronaldinho insists he won't be representing Brazil in 2019.\"No, no, I'm not at that level yet,\" he laughs. \"I like to play but there are others who are very, very good.\"",

Honestly I didn't know if I could catch that 19-second gap.\"My tires were going drop off -- all these things going through your mind. But like the team said, just keep your head down so I just did and kept pushing and pushing and the gap closed and closed and closed.\"My hat off to the team and I think if Niki [Lauda] was here today he would take his hat off.\"Good start, bad finishVerstappen got off to a flying start, easing into a comfortable lead as the two Mercedes battled and slowed each other down behind him.The 21-year-old must have been cheering internally watching the action unfold in his wing mirrors. Bottas locked up his brakes on each of the first two corners, allowing teammate Hamilton to pass him around the outside.Perhaps the Finn is feeling the pressure of his seat at Mercedes reportedly being under threat for next season. Rumors suggest that Bottas will know as early as the Belgian Grand Prix -- the first race back after the August summer break -- whether or not the team's reserve driver, Esteban Ocon, will replace him for 2020.Things then went from bad to worse, as Bottas was forced to pit on lap six to change his front wing which sustained damage in minor collisions with Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel on the opening two corners.When he reemerged from pits, he was dead last and almost a minute behind race leader Verstappen, who he had started next to on the grid just a few laps ago.Far out in front of the congested field, Verstappen and Hamilton were pulling away and engaged in an intriguing battle.Lewis Hamilton celebrates his seventh Hungarian Grand Prix win.Red Bull decided to pull its driver in to pit first, before Mercedes called Hamilton in a few laps later -- though a mistake when changing the rear right tire cost the Brit valuable time.When he came back onto the track, the gap to Verstappen was up to almost six seconds.He was advised by his engineer over the radio to look after his new tires, but took matters into his own hands and was on Verstappen's tail within two laps.What ensued was a thrilling, wheel-to-wheel battle over several corners as Hamilton tried to take the race lead. It was an enthralling tussle between arguably the two best drivers on the grid.Roll the diceVerstappen eventually forced his rival wide and off the track and emerged unscathed still leading the race.The young driver may have won seven races already in his fledgling career but this was the first time he had ever qualified on pole.Coming from behind to win is one thing, but attempting to lead from start to finish brings a whole new kind of pressure.Lewis Hamilton extended his championship lead over Valtteri Bottas, who struggled to eighth place.Verstappen's radio messages to his engineer were becoming increasingly more frantic, querying everything from his car's power to the team strategy.With 20 laps remaining and Hamilton's attempts to pass beginning to wane, Mercedes took a gamble -- with nothing to lose in second place -- and decided to pit Hamilton for a second time and put on a set of new tires.On fresher tires and able to put in faster lap times than Verstappen, Hamilton was soon bearing down ominously on the race leader.With just six laps remaining, a skittish Verstappen lamented into his team radio: \"The tires are dead,\" and so were his chances of a win.",

Protesters take to the streets in central Moscow Saturday.It is the latest in weeks of protests against independent and opposition candidates being barred from the ballot in municipal elections scheduled for September.

        "content": "Stockholm, Sweden (CNN)A court in Stockholm has allowed A$AP Rocky to await the outcome of his assault trial in the United States, releasing the American rapper who has spent the past month in Swedish jail. The Stockholm District Court has not yet made a ruling in the case, but said Friday that A$AP Rocky and his two co-defendants were free to leave Sweden. Rocky, David Rispers and Bladimir Corniel are currently on their way back to the US, according to a US State Department official.A judgment will be delivered on August 14.The 30-year-old artist -- whose real name is Rakim Mayers -- has been in custody since July 3. After his release, he thanked the court and his supporters in a message posted on his Instagram account. \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of my fans, friends and anyone across the globe who supported me during these last few weeks,\" he said. \"This has been a very difficult and humbling experience,\" he added.Read MoreThe alleged victim in the case was \"very satisfied\" with how the trial had been conducted, according to his lawyer Magnus Stromberg. \"My client has nothing against these gentlemen. He wishes them all the best in life. He feels that he has been able to tell his view of events,\" Stromberg told reporters outside the court room. \"We are very satisfied with the actual trial. Then we'll see what the court decides.\" A$AP Rocky, right, leaves the district court after the third day of his trial in Stockholm on Friday.His case had fueled a diplomatic quarrel after repeated interventions from US President Donald Trump, who publicly demanded the rapper's release, even raising the issue with the Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven. Swedish authorities have repeatedly stressed that the country's judiciary is independent and that the government is \"not allowed, and will not attempt, to influence the legal proceedings.\"After the court's decision on Friday, Trump tweeted: \"A$AP Rocky released from prison and on his way home to the United States from Sweden. It was a Rocky Week, get home ASAP A$AP!\"Trump: Sweden has 'let our African American community down' in A$AP Rocky caseIn theory, the rapper could still face a prison sentence in Sweden, as the prosecutor asked for a six-month prison sentence. However, the court said he will not be required to be in Sweden for the judgment hearing.  Slobodan Jovicic, A$AP Rocky's lawyer, said he was \"satisfied.\" \"We had two goals -- one goal was that my client was going to be a free man today,\" he said. \"And then we are hoping for an acquittal in 14 days, but we have to wait and see.\"The allegations against A$AP RockyA$AP Rocky was accused of committing assault during a June street brawl in Stockholm. He pleaded not guilty and has argued that he, Corniel, and Rispers were only defending themselves.But prosecutor Daniel Suneson told the Stockholm District Court on Friday that he had proven the accused were not defending themselves and therefore could not claim self-defense. \"In a putative self-defence situation, the violence must still be proportionate. Here we have three people delivering kicks and punches to a person lying down,\" Suneson told the court in his closing statement. \"The three should be convicted of assault according to my description of events,\" Suneson said, adding that previous sentences for such crimes ranged between six to 10 months in jail. The maximum penalty under Swedish law is two years in prison. A$AP Rocky wore a dark suit in the third day of the trial. The alleged victim told the court A$AP Rocky and his entourage assaulted him by kicking and beating him with a glass bottle or part of one while he lay on the ground.The rapper himself, who was cross-examined by prosecutors on Thursday, admitted he briefly held a bottle during the altercation, but put it down without using it as a weapon. Jovicic has also said there was no evidence of the bottle hitting him. The three suspects told the court they would accept community service if they had to. However, Suneson said that was not an option.Renee Black, A$AP Rocky's mother, arrives at the courthouse on Thursday.A high-profile trialThe trial had been moved to a special secure courtroom because of the huge media attention it attracted. However, Jovicic said the case shouldn't be handled in a special way. \"When they ask me who is my client, I say Rakim Mayers, I never say A$AP Rocky. This is just like any other trial.\"The trial was monitored from the courtroom by Trump's top hostage negotiator, Robert C. O'Brien, who also wrote a letter to the Swedish Prosecution Authority earlier this week, saying the US government wanted to \"resolve this case as soon as possible to avoid potentially negative consequences to the US-Swedish bilateral relationship.\"O'Brien's letter also asked for a humanitarian release from prison to a \"supervised detention in a local Stockholm hotel pending final disposition of the case\" -- a request rendered moot by today's ruling.A$AP Rocky says he wants justice, not money, during assault trial interrogationThe letter was leaked to Swedish media and its authenticity was confirmed to CNN by the Swedish Prosecution Authority. In a response to the letter, Petra Lundh, Sweden's Prosecutor-General, stressed the independence of the prosecutor, and said \"no other prosecutor, not even I, may interfere with a specific case or try to affect the prosecutor responsible.\"Following the decision, O'Brien said Friday was \"a good day for the United States of America and a good day for the Kingdom of Sweden.\"Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Petra Lundh's surnamePer Nyberg reported from Stockholm and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 wrote from London.

        "content": "(CNN)Cristiano Ronaldo is back in the headlines without even kicking a ball -- and it hasn't gone down well in South Korea.Ronaldo's absence from Juventus' preseason friendly in Seoul last week is the subject of an increasingly acrimonious dispute between the Serie A team, the Korea Professional Football League (K League), the event organizer and soccer fans in the country.  The Portuguese star was contracted to play for at least 45 minutes of last Friday's contest against the K-League All-Stars, according to the K-League.Instead Ronaldo spent the entire game on the bench to the dismay of many of the 66,000 fans that went to the match.At a media conference after the game, Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri justified the decision not to play the Portuguese international because he \"was very tired, so we decided to rest him.Read More\"He wasn't 100% fit due to muscle fatigue and we concluded that it would be best for him to rest.\"However, some South Korean fans are now pursuing a group lawsuit against the event organizer.Cristiano Ronaldo spent the entire match against Team K-League on the bench.Myung-an, the South Korean law firm representing those fans is seeking legal action against The Fasta, the sports marketing agency responsible for the event with Juventus, for a breach of contract and is seeking a full refund of ticket prices for participants. \"The firm decided to go ahead with this lawsuit as football fans ourselves without retaining fee to prevent the recurrence from happening again,\" said Myung-an lawyer Kim Hun-ki.READ: Neymar, Bale, Coutinho -- The loneliness of the megabuck football starREAD: World's best footballers are playing too much, says players' union'Indignation and disappointment'After the match The Fasta, which is accused of falsely advertising that Ronaldo would be playing for at least 45 minutes during the match released a statement expressing \"sincere apologies\" to fans, but also claimed that it did not know about Juventus' decision to bench Ronaldo in advance.According to Reuters, The Fasta CEO Robin Chang confirmed to local broadcaster SBS that the contract stipulated Ronaldo play 45 minutes and said she found out that the 34-year-old would not take part 10 minutes into the second half.The K League issued an apology to fans over Ronaldo's absence from the field, also announcing plans to also lodge a lawsuit against The Fasta, according to the K League's public relations team.In a statement sent to CNN on Thursday, the K League says it feels \"indignation and disappointment,\" after it failed to receive an apology for the player's failure to take the field, adding that it felt \"cheated by Juventus for its shamelessness.\"Some South Korean fans are now seeking legal action.\"For fans in South Korea, Ronaldo's appearance isn't just about a contract, but trust in Juventus with 121 years of its rich history. The fans expected Juventus to offer an explanation and a sincere apology for the reasons of discrediting the trust so easily, but the Juventus club even gave up its last hope.\"Juventus told CNN on Thursday it had no comment regarding the spat, though according to the K League statement sent to CNN the Italian club has told the Korean organization that its \"legal team will manage any alleged breach of contract issues.\"According to Reuters, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli responded on Wednesday, insisting his club did nothing wrong and offered no apology for Ronaldo's absence.Tickets for the highly-anticipated soccer match sold out within two hours, while the most expensive premium zone seats, commanding a price of $337, sold out in fifteen minutes of ticket sales going live, according to Ticketlink, the designated ticket sales site for the match.South Koreans fans, who spent a small fortune on tickets specifically to get a glimpse of Ronaldo, were left sorely disappointed by a match that was already delayed due in part to Juventus' late arrival in the country from China.Cristiano Ronaldo's Instagram account was flooded by comments from Korean fans.Some South Korean fans booed as they saw Ronaldo on the big screen sitting on the bench and others eventually left the stadium during the second half after losing hope that he would compete in the match, local media reported.READ: St\u00e9phanie Frappart will be first female ref to take charge of a major UEFA men's finalREAD: Real Madrid and Gareth Bale saga is a 'Rubik's Cube to solve''Chanting Messi's name'\"Why didn't you tell us you are not feeling well?

You will be remembered as the worst player in Korea,\" wrote another.\"They went from chanting Ronaldo's name to chanting [Lionel] Messi's name by the end,\" wrote another user on reddit.In a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday, Agnelli writes: \"Every single player present in Korea ... played the match, except one: Cristiano Ronaldo, who was obliged, according to our medical staff's advice, to rest due to muscle fatigue after the Nanjing game (against Inter Milan) which was only 48 hours before the one in Seoul.Juventus claim its star forward was suffering from fatigue.\"Therefore, Mr President, I definitely reject your accusation of irresponsible behaviour, of arrogance, of disregard for fans, who we always honor.\"No one at Juventus wanted to bring disrepute to K League, Korea Football Association, or Asian Football Confederation.\"On Wednesday, Juventus' website described its Asian Tour as \"exceptional.\"\"We visited four major Asian cities: Singapore, Nanjing, Shanghai and Seoul, in three different countries, where we either played or created exciting events that allowed us to reach so many of our fans\", said Giorgio Ricci, Juventus Chief Revenue Officer.",

        "content": "Luca Semprini, Ducati Corse press officer pictured in this article, passed away suddenly at the Czech MotoGP this week. He was just 35 years old. CNN Sport extends sincere condolences to Luca's family, friends and colleagues. (CNN)Back in June, on a sweltering Sunday at Italy's majestic Mugello circuit, Danilo Petrucci fired his Ducati across the line for his maiden MotoGP victory.There can scarcely have been a more popular winner in recent MotoGP history and Petrucci had to battle his way through backslapping fans and rivals alike to reach a final, rapturous reception from his team in Parc Ferm\u00e9.The 28-year-old recalled the experience recently to CNN. \"It was so incredible,\" he smiled.  \"You have to go through all of the pit lane because Parc Ferm\u00e9 is at the end, and there was all the paddock waiting for me, just touching me. I felt really emotional.\"READ: The power behind Marc Marquez's MotoGP throneREAD: MotoE takes to the circuit just months after fire destroyed everythingRead MoreNo greater prizeFor any MotoGP rider, let alone an Italian, there is simply no greater prize than a win on a Ducati at Mugello. This is the two-wheeled equivalent of a Ferrari victory at Monaco. As Fratelli d'Italia belted out over the podium ceremony, Petrucci dissolved into tears of joy and disbelief.An exhausted, overjoyed Danilo Petrucci is embraced by his Ducati team in Parc Ferm\u00e9.But his triumph also has a fascinating backstory. At the post-race press conference, his voice choking with emotion, Petrucci dedicated the win to his teammate and fellow Italian, Andrea Dovizioso. \"He adopted me this winter, like a child,\" Petrucci smiled as the post-race press conference roared with laughter. \"Like a brother -- a very, very big child; but this was unbelievable, a true teammate.\"Petrucci told CNN that he had reached a low point after the third race of the season, in Austin, and was beginning to think his future lay elsewhere. The self-deprecating Umbrian, in his first ever season for a factory team, knew things had to change.Key weakness\"I'm in difficulties when I have to be an actor,\" he explained. \"When things go wrong, you can read it on my face, and also when things go in a good way.  But I always put myself in a team in the last position.\"           View this post on Instagram           Danilo Petrucci claimed his first ever #MotoGP victory! \ud83d\udc4f #ItalianGP #Motorcycle #Racing A post shared by  MotoGP (@motogp) on Jul 21, 2019 at 8:42am PDT It was this tendency to put himself last that, he realized, was a key weakness. It was Dovizioso who helped him understand why.\"I was thinking, I have to be clear about the reality. I'm not 20 years old, I can't say: 'Okay, I haven't won with Ducati, so maybe I'll have another chance with Yamaha or Honda.' My career from now, compared to many others here, is quite short,\" he said.\"Andrea talked to me. He said: 'You are very funny, you always say the truth; but sometimes saying the truth is not useful for you. You are not young anymore. If you continue thinking like this -- that you are not capable of doing something, watching others like a target -- you will not stay with Ducati next year.'\"Dovizioso told CNN that he recognized something in his teammate. \"He doesn't have the same experience as most of the riders in MotoGP, he came from a different championship, family, city -- it's a different way to arrive in MotoGP,\" he explained.  \"He was really fast, with a good speed, but he couldn't keep the same speed for a whole season and in a lot of situations he didn't approach things in the right way.\"Small thingsThe 33-year-old has been the closest challenger to Honda's prodigious Marc Marquez for the past three seasons and puts his success down to a change in focus, partly from working with renowned psychologist Amedeo Maffei.  He said that the changes in his approach are \"nothing special, small things,\" but is effusive about their impact.Petrucci dips under Dovizioso and Marquez to take final lap lead.\"You feel the effects, everywhere, everywhere. If you understand what is important for you, what is not important, you live in a better way, and you can transmit this to everybody.\"Dovizioso has had numerous teammates in his long career. \"I've had a lot of experience with a lot of different riders, and you can see a lot of different ways to approach the same thing,\" he said.  \"And that affects a lot, for example, Marc (Marquez) is a big talent, a fast rider, blah blah blah, but one of his biggest advantages is his attitude -- and that affects everything he is doing.\"Human passionPetrucci says his teammate's guidance was all-encompassing.           View this post on Instagram           Experience the emotion of @petrux9's maiden victory with unseen footage from Mugello! \ud83c\udfc6 // #MotoGP #DP9 #Motorcycle #Racing #Motorsport A post shared by  MotoGP (@motogp) on Jul 22, 2019 at 6:01am PDT \"Andrea gave a lot of advice to me but not simple advice, like 'taking a corner like this,' but just seeing how he lives; what is his feeling when he's worried about a race, when he's sad.\"I saw the human passion of Andrea and this helped me a lot. He helped me a lot to be a better person and a better rider, and the first thing is connected to the last.\"He was inspired to change. \"From that point I said: 'I don't want to have regrets.' Maybe next year I'll work for my uncle and I'll think: 'F*, I haven't given my all in the last year,' and I didn't want to have regrets. So I just put everything in and from that point the results changed.\"Since Mugello, Petrucci has managed a podium at the Catalan GP as well as a creditable 4th in Germany -- both ahead of his teammate.Dovizioso is not surprised by Petrucci's subsequent success. \"It's just another confirmation,\" he told CNN. \"I don't need it, but it's clear what I did in the past three years, what I did differently and that it worked.  \"Not many people believed in Danilo because he did two seasons in a similar way, but most of the people don't know the details. I knew what he needed. So, I just tried to show him a few things and you see the result. Small things.\"Not comfortable Paolo Ciabatti, Ducati Corse's Sporting Director, is pleased with his riders' harmonious relationship. \"I think Danilo is fast enough to be stimulating Andrea to go even faster. He's not a comfortable teammate,\" he told CNN. \"Some people thought you might have somebody who is not pushing, but you can see lately sometimes he's been even faster than Andrea, so it's good.\"Danilo Petrucci on the grid prior to the Italian GP.\"The fact that they don't hate each other, they don't live separately from each other, that they can go out for dinner and discuss what they see, it's definitely a different way from any other team, but it's also helping us to develop the bike faster and to understand better where we can improve it.\"Dovizioso believes that the right mental approach is also vital to prolonging a career in MotoGP. \"At the beginning you push so hard to race in the world championship, but when you arrive here it's not enough, you want to win, and to win is difficult.So everything changes: your life, your approach, and the way you think, and that is very important -- which way that change goes, because not a lot of riders are able to manage that in the right way. \"To become a champion, to stay with a foot on the ground and have a long career is very, very difficult, it's not easy to manage that.\"Both Ducati riders will approach this weekend's Czech MotoGP with optimism. This unusual double act will be hoping the second half of the season further confirms the value of small changes.",

        "content": "(CNN)The official demise of a landmark arms control pact between the US and Russia is a \"bad day\" for stability in Europe, the military alliance's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN Friday, hours after the US withdrew from the pact.Speaking to CNN's Hala Gorani, the Norwegian politician called the end of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Moscow a \"serious setback.\"\"I'm part of a political generation that was shaped during the 1980s, where we all were concerned for the risk of nuclear war and where we were actually able to reach the INF treaty that didn't only reduce the missiles but banned all intermediate range missiles and weapons,\" he said. The Cold-War era pact was signed by US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. It has limited the development of ground-based missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, between both nations for the past three decades. But the West says Russia has been violating the treaty since the days of the Obama administration. The Trump administration began taking steps this year to notify Russia and NATO that it would withdraw unless Moscow reversed course. Read More'A bad day for all of us' Stoltenberg said Russia had deployed new missiles that can reach European cities \"within minutes,\" that are \"hard to detect, are mobile and are nuclear capable, and therefore reduce the threshold of any potential use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.\"  That paired with the demised INF treaty made it a \"bad day for all of us who believe in arms control and stability in Europe.\" He, however, added that \"NATO will take the necessary measures to protect our allies in a world without the INF treaty.\"United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday that \"Russia is solely responsible\" for the treaty's end.US pulls out of nuclear treaty, Pentagon to test new missileIt's a view Stoltenberg shares. \"Today, the INF treaty ceases to exist because Russia has deployed the SSC-8 missile system,\" he told a news conference later on Friday.   \"There are no new US missiles, no new NATO missiles in Europe but there are more and more Russian missiles,\" Stoltenberg told journalists.Analysts now worry about a new Cold-War style arms race, something Stoltenberg is keen to avoid.He told reporters Friday that NATO would respond to the risks posed by the Russian missiles in a \"measured and responsible way.\"\"That is also the reason why we continue to work for arms control, non-proliferation, and disarmament.\"This story has been updated to clarify the Secretary General's comments.CNN's Kylie Atwood and Zahid Mahmood contributed to this report.",

Tottenham star Heung-Min Son played 78 matches over the last 12 months and traveled nearly 70,000 miles to represent South Korea at the FIFA World Cup, the Asian Games and in the Asian Cup. \"To meet the demands of the match calendar, players are being repeatedly asked to play at their limit, without sufficient rest and recovery,\" said Theo van Seggelen, FIFPRO General Secretary.\"This means that they cannot perform at their best and, worse still, that some are struggling with sustained periods of mental and physical strain.

The lack of recovery is associated with a decrease in performance and an increase in the likelihood of injury. \"We need to manage the workload for all players very well and balance the needs between the player, club and country,\" said Italy and Juventus star Giorgio Chiellini.\"For us to continuously play at our best and improve performance, we need to be protected from excessive match schedules.\"World governing body FIFA did not immediately respond to CNN Sport's request for comment.Sports scientist Simon Brundish told CNN Sport that the congested fixtures list means the sport is \"reaching the threshold of human tolerance with the performance load being placed on these players.\"READ: Chelsea bans six fans, one for life, for racist abuse of Raheem SterlingREAD: Jill Ellis stepping down as US women's soccer national coachWithout rest, top players are at a greater risk of injury. 'Catastrophic season for injuries'While welcoming the report as a way of opening the conversation about the physical and mental toll on players, Brundish says the report misses some key statistics. He says that over the course of the last seven years, the total distance run by players during a game has increased and that the number of sprints performed has risen by a staggering 38%.He says that last season, the likes of Antoine Griezmann, Luis Suarez and Mohamed Salah all covered more meters and played more minutes than South Korea's Son, one of the players highlighted in the FIFPRO report.  \"Sprinting has the highest metabolic cost on a player so it requires the most recovery,\" added Brundish. \"At some point, players are going to start breaking. I think this could be quite a catastrophic season for injuries for the clubs.\"Mohamed Salah joined up with Liverpool in late July to prepare for the new seaosn following the Africa Cup of Nations.Club's losing top playersHowever, Brundish believes that injuries to some of the best players in the world could be the turning point in securing the long-term health of footballers.He says that last season, the top six teams in the English Premier League -- Manchester City, Liverpool, Spurs, Chelsea Arsenal and Manchester United -- had between them 42 players at the last week of the World Cup. These players had fewer than 21 days of pre-season training before the 2018/2019 EPL season started. Brundish says players need at least three weeks off to physically and mentally recover. \"Of those 42 players, 69% missed more than five games, 42% missed more than 10, and 22% missed more than 20 games,\" Brundish said. \"Given the quality of player that's going to the World Cup, you're missing hugely valuable players for your club. That's just not sustainable and it's not going to carry on.\" READ: Algeria crowned Africa Cup of Nations champion after beating Senegal Liverpool may have to play 15 games in 43 days over the Christmas period.  Busy LiverpoolLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in particular will have to manage his player's playing time this season, given his team could end up playing a total of 67 games, if they go all the way in every competition, including an incredibly busy festive period.Liverpool will also compete in December's FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar -- resulting in a 7,000-mile round trip -- in addition to a packed domestic schedule. As a result Klopp's side may have to play 15 games in 43 days.If that wasn't concerning enough, the European Champions are full of international stars who will be traveling thousands of miles to play for their countries.Goalkeeper Alisson Becker traveled almost 50,000 miles last season, while forward Mane traveled over 60,000 miles. Mane, who relies heavily on his sprinting, also played in the Africa Cup of Nations throughout the summer while Becker appeared in the Copa America. Mane was still playing for Senegal when Liverpool had already started their pre-season preparations for the 2019/2020 season.Players who start playing young might now be at greater risk of injury later on.Young players at riskAs the intensity of games increase, professional players at the top of the game are seemingly getting younger and Brundish is concerned that teenagers being exposed to such grueling schedules could have their careers cut short. Players from the past such as former Liverpool strikers Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler both played a lot of football at a young age but tailed off in their later years. \"You can look at the main body of players and peak years used to be 27, 28 or 29 and they're now becoming 23, 24, 25,\" he said. \"Players start to drop off.\"",

Local resident Marella Cairns, who lives below the dam, told CNN she was turned back while trying to drive back to Whaley Bridge on Thursday.  Read More\"Fortunately, my son's girlfriend had been working nights, and was asleep at our house, and was still there. I asked her to grab the dogs, my medication and my knitting and to meet me at the evacuation center, which is the local high school,\" she said. After resting there \"for a while\" she moved to her brother's house in Greater Manchester.

On Thursday, the Environment Agency issued a \"danger to life\" warning covering the River Goyt.A resident told PA that another section of the dam's spillway also collapsed on Thursday.\"I've lived in Whaley (Bridge) for the best part of 45 years, and I've never seen water flood over the dam like that, ever, nor thought that we could possibly be at risk in this way,\" Carolyn Whittle told PA. The 45-year-old added that \"another section of the concrete on the dam face has now collapsed.\"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted Friday that his \"thoughts are with those who have had to leave their homes and all of those who are affected in #WhaleyBridge.\" Johnson also announced a ministerial COBRA meeting chaired by the Environment Secretary to coordinate the government's response.'Reduced considerably'Videos shared on social media by a local fire station showed a Royal Air Force Chinook helping to reinforce the dam wall and dropping sandbags to bolster the damaged part of the structure. It helped \"move more than 50 tonnes of aggregate into the reservoir wall to reinforce it,\" the police wrote.

Julie Sharman, chief operating officer of the Canal and River Trust which runs the reservoir, said water flowing into Toddbrook has been \"reduced considerably\" thanks to additional pumping. \"We've lowered the level of the water in the reservoir by 200mm. We are obviously aiming to get that down considerably more,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today program. In a later interview with PA, she said while the important, water-retaining clay core of the dam is intact, it is vital to replace material lost when the earth was eroded. \"It is a critical situation at this point in time. And until we're beyond that ... the risk is a material risk and that's why we've taken the action we have.\"In a statement Friday, the NFCC said \"it is currently anticipated that the incident will run for at least 2 to 3 days.\"But it is still unknown when residents will be allowed back to their homes. \"We don't know how long this operation will take to conclude but we and our colleagues in the emergency services, partner agencies, Environment Agency and military are doing everything humanly possible to save the reservoir wall and to protect the town,\" Assistant Chief Constable Kem Mehmet said in a statement.Scientists say that while it's impossible to attribute a concrete weather event to climate change, the climate crisis is making episodes like this more likely.From CNN's Livvy Doherty contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The bitter saga surrounding Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid has taken a new twist -- on a golf course.Speaking earlier this week at the Audi Cup in Munich, Real boss Zinedine Zidane told reporters that Bale, who has consistently been linked with a move away with the club, was left out of the squad for the two-match tournament because \"he wasn't fit.\"The ongoing row between Zinedine Zidane and Gareth Bale looks set to continue.But a photo in Spanish publication El Confidencial, which it says was taken during Real's defeat by Bale's former club Tottenham on Tuesday, shows the Welshman enjoying a round of golf. Speaking after his side's victory over Turkish side Fenerbahce on Wednesday, Zidane said he did not want to interfere in Bale's personal life.\"I am here, I'm here with my players, so I can't really say much. I hope that he has trained there,\" Zidane told reporters after being asked about the incident.Read More\"I'm not going to stop anyone from doing something, you know? Everyone has their own responsibilities and we will see what he's been up to in Madrid.\"I'm not getting involved with his personal life. He stayed back to train. I think he has trained. And we will see about everything else.\"Bale has fallen out favor at Real Madrid following the return of Zinedine Zidane.READ: From dream start to nightmare end, Bale's Real career turns sourREAD: Bale left in limbo after Real calls off China moveThe incident is likely to spark further tension between Bale and Zidane, who according to the player's agent, have no real working relationship.Speaking to French publication Le Journal du Dimanche last week, Barnett said the falling out between the pair is personal, rather than professional or tactical.\"It's quite simple, Zidane doesn't like Gareth,\" Barnett said. \"There is no relationship between them, there never has been.\"Bale scored one of the most spectacular goals in Champions League history with this strike in the 2018 final.After leaving Bale out of Real's first preseason game of its US tour on July 21, Zidane told reporters: \"We hope he leaves soon. It would be best for everyone.\"In response, Barnett told AFP: \"Zidane is a disgrace -- he shows no respect for a player that has done so much for Real Madrid.\"READ: Bale's agent calls Zidane 'a disgrace'READ:  The foreign footballers giving up their passports to become ChineseBale came on as a substitute in the recent 7-3 friendly defeat by Atletico Madrid.Bale, who has three years remaining on his current deal, had appeared set to complete a move to China last week after reportedly agreeing $1.2 million-a-week deal with Jiangsu Suning.But that move was called off by Real President Florentino Perez, who has often come to Bale's aid during his difficult time in the Spanish capital.Bale, 30, has suffered a series of injuries over the past four years, limiting his appearances for Real. He  has made just 79 La Liga starts in the past four seasons.Yet his contribution, 14 major trophies, 102 goals and 65 assists in 231 matches, remains hugely impressive. He made 42 appearances last season as Real endured a dire campaign, finishing 19 points behind arch rival and La Liga champion Barcelona and surrendering its Champions League crown at the last-16 stage.Bale has three years left on his Real Madrid deal.\"Real Madrid have made a rod for their own backs,\" European football writer James Horncastle told CNN.\"He's got multiple years left on his contract, he earns very good money there and I think it's complicated for a club to find an alternative destination for him.\"Someone who can provide a fee, which would allow them to go back into the transfer market and buy again. Someone who could satisfy the player in terms of what he earns.\"It's a Rubik's Cube for them to solve. I think from Bale's point of view, for someone who has achieved everything he has in the game, having won multiple Champions League titles ... what is his ambition?\"He has nothing left to prove. Does he feel the need to move elsewhere? I think beyond the relationship between him and the manager, there isn't any real reason to go.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A \"burqa ban\" came into force in the Netherlands Thursday, but there are doubts over whether it will be applied in practice.The legislation applies to all face-covering clothing on public transport and in schools, hospitals and government buildings, according to a police statement. However, it does not apply to public streets.It covers the burqa and the niqab, as well as motor helmets and ski masks, with offenders subject to a 150 euro ($166) fine. But it does not include headscarves, as the face is still visible.Police guidance says that staff at government institutions or on public transport are responsible for addressing those who flout the ban and requesting they remove the face covering, or leave the premises.However spokespeople for the affected sectors have said they will not take responsibility.Read More Photos: Burqa, hijab, niqab: What's what?

A burqa is similar, but also features a mesh covering over the eyes.When the law passed in June 2018, Upper House press officer Gert Riphagen estimated there were between 200 and 400 burqa or niqab-wearing people in the Netherlands, out of a population of roughly 17 million.Proponents of the law, including far-right Freedom Party politician Geert Wilders, say it will improve safety by making people more easily identifiable. Critics warn it could dissuade some women from entering public spaces, including schools.The law follows similar bans in France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Denmark, some of which go further than the Dutch prohibition.Denmark's ban, which covers all public places, came into force on August 1 2018, sparking protests from hundreds of demonstrators.By August 3 the first woman was fined 1,000 Danish kroner (about $155) for violating the ban.France has had a ban in place since 2011, with fines of up to 150 euros ($172) for wearing the niqab or burqa in public places.In October 2018 the United Nations Human Rights Committee said the ban violates the human rights of Muslim women and risks \"confining them to their homes.\"The committee said two women fined for wearing the full-face Islamic veils should be compensated and called on France to review the ban.",

This year's Shiseido WTA Finals in Shenzhen will award its winner an eye-watering $4.75 million check if she manages to go the entire competition unbeaten. The champion's prize will eclipse the $4 million handed to the entire USWNT team that won the FIFA Women's World Cup and is over double what Tiger Woods earned from clinching this year's Masters.The ATP finals, the equivalent competition on the men's tour, only set aside $2.71 million for an undefeated champion last year -- demonstrating the work being done to uphold equal pay in tennis.Current world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty says the prize money is the \"icing on the cake\" as she thanked sponsors for staging such a lucrative competition. Read More\"As tennis professionals, we are very fortunate to make a living from playing the sport we love, and to be rewarded so well for it is a real privilege,\" Barty told CNN Sport, in a written statement. \"I also take my hat off to all the amazing players over the years who helped make tennis so popular with fans around the world.\"READ: Cori 'Coco' Gauff, 15, says she will 'learn a lot' after losing in straight setsREAD: Worth $5 billion, the world's most valuable sports team is the Dallas CowboysThe WTA Finals is offering the biggest prize money in the history of tennis.

Competitors compete in two round robin groups and knockout rounds to be crowned the WTA champion. Eight of the last 16 winners have gone undefeated, the latest being 2018 victor Elina Svitolina.The players vying for the bumper prize are decided based on the Porsche Race rankings, with points accumulated from 53 WTA tournaments and the four grand slams.

However, this year's WTA Finals can boast a more lucrative winner's check than any of the major tournaments on the circuit.Even if the eventual winner loses one of her group games, she will still walk away with $4,420,000 and should she lose two, she will claim $4,115,000.It could also be a record breaking tournament for the women's doubles champions -- an undefeated duo will earn $1 million.WTA chief executive Steve Simon says the prize money on offer is an indication of the significant growth of women's tennis around the world. \"For five decades the WTA has been committed to equal pay and equal opportunity, beginning with the pioneering efforts of Billie Jean King and all of the 'Original Nine,'\" he said, in a written statement provided to CNN Sport. The \"Original Nine\" were the group of women -- King, Rosie Casals, Nancy Richey, Judy Dalton, Kerry Melville Reid, Julie Heldman, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon and Valerie Ziegenfuss -- who helped set up the Virginia Slims Circuit, which later became the WTA Tour.\"Working with the Gemdale Group in Shenzhen, we are excited to provide an unprecedented level of investment that supports the founding principles of the WTA,\" added Simon.READ: Novak Djokovic says Wimbledon victory was 'mentally the most demanding' JUST WATCHEDCounting the cost of Naomi Osaka's meteoric riseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCounting the cost of Naomi Osaka's meteoric rise 02:18\"Not to be happy with the crumbs'Despite the obvious step forward in terms of pay parity, many still feel the sport has a long way to go. The top male players consistently earn more than the top female players and the likes of Serena Williams have had to continuously defend equal pay at the grand slams. In 2016, Williams wrote an open letter calling for more equality in sport:  \"It frustrates me because I know firsthand that I, like you, have done the same work and made the same sacrifices as our male counterparts,\" it read.\"I would never want my daughter to be paid less than my son for the same work. Nor would you.\"King, one of the pioneers of equality in tennis, also said female players must keep asking for more. \"Girls aren't used to that. We're told not to, from the time we're born we're told stay in the background, make sure you're supportive,\" she told CNN Sport.\"It's important to also not be happy with the crumbs. It's important that women have the cake the icing and the cherry on the top just like men. We should all be striving for that.\"The WTA Finals will begin on October 27 and run until November 3. It's the first staging of Shenzhen's 10-year tenure as host.The first edition of the event was held back in 1972 with $25,000 going to the winner.",

We thought that the behavior of these guys was strange, it got a bit scary,\" A$AP Rocky, whose real name Rakim Mayers, told a packed courtroom.Read MoreHe added that he suspected the man was under the influence of drugs, and that he and his entourage attempted to walk away but were followed by the man and his friend.A$AP Rocky pleads not guilty to assault as Stockholm trial begins\"At this point we are really scared. I saw my security guard being cut, bleeding. We didn't know what to expect with these strangers -- I'm not from Sweden, so it was really scary,\" the rapper said.\"I wanted to go straight to the hotel for safety. I didn't want this to happen,\" he added. \"We had no clue where we were, we just knew we weren't close to the hotel.\"\"I was scared and we were in defense mode,\" the rapper added later, during cross-examination by the Swedish prosecutor. \"You've got to realize that my life is very, very particular,\" he said. \"We're in a foreign country. We're approached by two strangers with aggressive behavior.\"Ten months ago when I was with my cousin and these two gentlemen, I was stabbed in the face,\" A$AP Rocky said, adding that his home has been twice robbed at gun point. \"I don't know what to expect when I'm being approached by strangers. That is why I have a security guard. I'm only thinking about defending myself.\"When quizzed by his own lawyer, the rapper said he wanted \"justice\" in the case.\"I spent a month here in Sweden. This is my fifth or sixth time here. I've seen the most beautiful architecture and beautiful side of Sweden. And the obviously the not so pretty side of Sweden from inside prison,\" he said.\"I've heard speculation that I could demand damages and money and what not. I don't want any money. I can earn that money back. For me, what I want is justice. And I want my name to be cleared. And justice for all.\"Surveillance footage analyzedA$AP Rocky's lawyer, Slobodan Jovicic, began proceedings on Thursday by grilling the alleged victim about why he started talking to the rapper's bodyguard. \"To me they were just normal people. I didn't recognize them,\" the alleged victim said, adding that he approached the bodyguard to ask for help finding his friend.The court was also shown surveillance footage of the brawl, in which the rapper and his two co-defendants, Bladimir Corniel and David Rispers, assert they were acting in self-defense.The man says A$AP Rocky and his entourage assaulted him by kicking and beating him with a glass bottle or part of one while he lay on the ground. Under Swedish law, A$AP Rocky could face a maximum penalty of two years in prison. However, according to Swedish media, the prosecutors have indicated they do not expect to ask for the maximum penalty.The rapper admitted he briefly held a bottle during the altercation, but put it down without using it as a weapon.The alleged victim told the rapper's lawyer Jovicic he was surprised by the behavior of A$AP Rocky and his entourage, whom he claimed were pushing him away as he searched for his friend.But Jovicic pressed the alleged victim on why he approached the group in the first place.\"Out of all the people in this square, you feel it appropriate to ask these people, whose language you don't even understand?,\" he asked. The alleged victim spoke in Persian and his answers were translated in the courtroom.Jovicic also played a clip from a cell phone where it appears the victim was trying to strike the rapper's bodyguard with his fist and rings, followed by an attempt to hit him with headphones.The alleged victim was also probed by Corniel's lawyer, Martin Persson, on whether a bottle was used in the attack, as previously claimed during Tuesday's hearing. After viewing stills from a video of the incident, Persson referred to the alleged attackers and told the victim: \"So none of the eight hands in these photos actually holds a bottle.\"\"I asked if they had the bottles from the beginning when they approached you and you said yes. Why are you unsure of this now?,\" the lawyer added. Renee Black, A$AP Rocky's mother, arrives at the courthouse on Thursday.The alleged victim replied: \"My wounds have not come from nowhere. Would they have come from the air? There are witnesses that can attest to this.\" The images only show \"a short sequence of what happened. I was trying to get away,\" he added. In photos of the crime scene displayed to the court on Tuesday, a broken glass bottle was visible on the street where the brawl took place and a fragment of what appeared to be the same bottle could be seen stuck in A$AP Rocky's sweater.Footage of the altercation posted by TMZ and clips shared by A$AP Rocky himself, which have been at the heart of the investigation, were also played in court on Tuesday.Presidential presence in courtroomPresidential Hostage Affairs Envoy Robert C. O'Brien greeted A$AP Rocky's mother with a handshake as proceedings began.O'Brien's presence in the courtroom, for the second day of the trial, marks the latest move from the Oval Office in a trial that is being closely watched by Trump and has caused a diplomatic quarrel between the President and his Swedish counterparts.Robert C O'Brien, US Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, arrives at the second day of the trial on Thursday.It comes after O'Brien told CNN on Tuesday that Trump wants the rapper and his two co-defendants, Corniel and Rispers, to \"come home as soon as possible.\" Trump has repeatedly pressed Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven to free A$AP Rocky on Twitter, but his efforts have been rebuffed by the country's government.A$AP Rocky is expected to testify later on Thursday. Jovicic maintains his client did not commit any crime. The rapper asserts that he was acting in self-defense when he threw the victim to the ground and stepped on his arm.The trial, at a packed Stockholm District Court, has attracted the world's media, and judge Per Lennerbrant told the courtroom on Thursday he wanted its focus to remain on the incident in question.\"This case is about an alleged assault that happened here in Stockholm. Nothing else. I want to say this to everyone, ahead of today's questioning,\" he said at the start of proceedings.The trial is set to conclude on Friday, when closing arguments will be made, but Lennerbrant suggested on Thursday that proceedings are running behind schedule and a further day may be needed.Per Nyberg reported from Stockholm and Rob Picheta wrote from London.

        "content": "Moscow, Russia (CNN)The impeachment inquiry roiling Washington is not the first time Ukraine has been at the center of a US political scandal.Ukraine derives its name from a word that means \"borderland.\" And since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Ukraine has been on the frontier of a clash between East and West. The map makes it fairly obvious: Ukraine is sandwiched between Russia and the European Union. Unlike former Communist countries like Poland or Hungary, Ukraine never joined NATO. Ukraine shares borders with the European Union, but it has not yet become a member.  Trump's Ukraine scandal: Who's who?And as one of the poorest countries in Europe, Ukraine has been a major recipient of US assistance: Since 1992, the first full year of independence, the US Agency for International Development has contributed more than $3 billion in development assistance to Ukraine.Why would stabilizing a country on the edge of Europe be a priority for Washington? Nukes, for starters. The demise of the Soviet Union created a potential nightmare for policymakers: An independent state had just appeared on the map that, after inheriting part of the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal, had become home to the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world.     Read MoreKremlin's suspicionIn 1994, the United States, together with the United Kingdom, Russia and Ukraine, signed a memorandum providing Kiev with security assurances. In exchange for signing on, Ukraine would give up its nuclear weapons; the signatories pledged to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity.That guarantee was effectively chucked out the window by Russia. The Kremlin had watched with suspicion as NATO expanded eastward to include the Baltic states, which had been absorbed by force into the Soviet Union. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukraine's Western-leaning aspirations were impermissible: the US, in his paranoid worldview, was pulling the strings in Ukraine's democratic revolution of 2014. Following the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, Moscow occupied and annexed the Crimean peninsula.Putin emerges as a winner in Washington's Ukraine turmoilThe US and its allies imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Russia over Crimea and for Moscow's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. The US also provided security assistance to Kiev, though the Obama administration stopped short of providing lethal aid to Ukraine.That policy drew vocal criticism from late Republican Sen. John McCain in 2015 for being inadequate. But during the 2016 presidential race, Republicans also seemed to waver when the Trump campaign amended language in the party platform that endorsed the US government sending lethal arms to Ukraine and bolstering Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts.The report of special counsel Robert Mueller subsequently said its investigation \"did not establish that one campaign official's efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform ... were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia.\" Russia's President Vladimir Putin visits the Crimean port of Sevastopol in May 2014.The Manafort connectionWhat the Republican 2016 convention did do, however, was cast a spotlight on Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's financial ties to Ukraine. Manafort had worked as a political consultant for Ukraine's former pro-Russian ruling party and for Yanukovych, who fled the country after violent street demonstrations in 2014.Manafort is now behind bars after being sentenced earlier this year for tax fraud, hiding his foreign bank accounts and defrauding two banks for more than $4 million in loans.Paul Manafort arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court in June 27, 2019.The Manafort saga showed the amount of shady money that seemed to be sloshing around in Ukraine. In 2016, Ukrainian lawmaker Sergii Leshchenko made public the \"black ledger, a once-secret list of payments made by the Party of Regions, Yanukovych's party, to Manafort and others. The ledger has figured in the latest round of scandal: Over the past year, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer and political attack dog, had begun spinning an elaborate counter-narrative over foreign interference in the 2016 election, saying it could all be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine.Giuliani has circulated a claim that Leshchenko interfered in the 2016 US elections, a claim Leshchenko says was effectively knocked down in July by a Ukrainian administrative court ruling in the matter.But Giuliani also zeroed in on another Ukraine narrative: pushing for investigation of former US Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had a lucrative job on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma.There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. But the optics were not great, particularly when one of Joe Biden's jobs as vice president was to badger the Ukrainian government about shoring up the rule of law.Rudy Giuliani has spun an elaborate counter-narrative over foreign interference in the 2016 election, saying it could all be traced back to Democrats' dealings in Ukraine.A previous president in the spotlightThe Trump administration did approve the provision of lethal arms to Ukraine, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, something long sought by Kiev. But the Trump administration's hold on $400 million of military assistance to Ukraine is now at the heart of the whistleblower complaint that has spurred calls for impeachment. Questions remain about the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when Trump pressed him to investigate the Bidens -- at a moment when a hold on aid was in place.  This is not the first time a US president has landed in hot water over Ukraine.US President Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former US Vice President Joe Biden (pictured center), and his son Hunter (left).On August 1, 1991, then-President George H.W. Bush gave a speech to the Verkhovna Rada, the parliament of Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. In his remarks, Bush warned against \"suicidal nationalism:\" At the time, republics of the USSR were clamoring for greater independence from Moscow, and the Bush administration was concerned about a potentially violent breakup of a nuclear-armed superpower.Such advice may have seemed prudent at the time. Ethnic conflict was already tearing Yugoslavia apart, and in the Soviet Union, open warfare was underway between Armenians and Azeris over the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. But Bush had profoundly misread the desire of Ukrainians for statehood. Within weeks, the Ukrainian parliament declared independence. Later that year, Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for withdrawal from the Soviet Union. William Safire, the influential New York Times columnist, called Bush's remarks the \"Chicken Kiev speech.\"In retrospect, the quibble over Bush's remarks in Kiev looks quaint compared to the political controversy that is now hitting Washington. That storm is now set to engulf Ukraine.",

The result was much-needed for Gregor Townsend's side, which was lackluster in its opening defeat by Ireland eight days ago. But a potent attacking display, that was capped off with a late fourth try to secure a bonus point, ensured that this pool will go down to the wire. Japan's stunning victory over Ireland Saturday means that Scotland likely needs to beat the host side on October 13 to progress to the knockout stages. Two penalty tries -- the second of which saw Samoa's Ed Fidow sent off for picking up a second yellow card -- and one try each for Sean Maitland and Greig Laidlaw ensured a comfortable Scottish win. Read More\"Historically we've always had really tough games against Samoa so I was really pleased with the performance and really pleased with how we started,\" Scotland captain Stuart McInally told ITV. \"It was great to get the win today.\"A massive thanks to all the Scottish fans who are here today and everyone who's supporting us back home as well and sticking with us after last week.\"READ: World Rugby apologizes for playing Russian song after Georgian victoryREAD: Wales edges out Australia in Group D thrillerJUST WATCHEDRugby superfans cycle from London to TokyoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRugby superfans cycle from London to Tokyo 03:06Who goes through from Group A?It took Scotland half an hour in Kobe to register its first try of the 2019 World Cup, but after that scores came thick and fast. Maitland touched down first after gathering a pinpoint cross-field kick from Finn Russell, and Laidlaw's conversion, coupled with an earlier penalty from the scrumhalf, gave Scotland a 10-point lead.Laidlaw was soon on the score sheet again when he bumped off a tackle to go over near the posts after Scotland began a flowing move inside its own half. A classy, long-range drop goal from Stuart Hogg added further salt to Samoa's wounds before the stroke of halftime as Scotland piled on 17 points in 10 minutes. Scotland pushed hard for a bonus point throughout the second period and was rewarded with a penalty try on 57 minutes when Fidow prevented  Fraser Brown going over from a driving maul.Fidow was sent to the sin bin and was again penalized when his illegal tackle using only his knees prevented the diving Maitland from grabbing Scotland's fourth. After reviewing the incident, the referee awarded Scotland a second penalty try and Fidow was sent off for his second yellow.

If those games play out to form, then Scotland needs a victory over Japan to stand a chance of reaching the quarterfinals. Whichever team finishes second will likely play reigning champion New Zealand with the top side facing South Africa. \"We were all delighted to get that bonus point,\" said head coach Townsend. \"It means we're still in this World Cup. We have two games to go and if we play like we did tonight and can improve a couple more aspects, we'll very much be in this World Cup.\"As for Samoa, the result is a disappointment following an opening 34-9 victory over Russia. The Pacific Islanders became the first side to fail to score a point in a game this tournament, while poor discipline also continued to be a problem.Samoa played today without center Rey Lee-Lo and hooker Motu Matu'u who both were handed three-match bans for dangerous tackles against Russia. Fidow's two yellow cards against Scotland all but extinguished hopes of a comeback in Kobe, meaning chances of progressing out the group rest on victories against Japan and Ireland.",

When he left the field, Burfict blew kisses to the Indianapolis crowd at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Raiders would go on to defeat the Colts 31-24.It is the longest punishment for an on-field act in NFL history, according to NFL.com. Burfict, 29, has three business days to file an appeal. CNN has reached out to the NFL Players Association for comment.Jon Runyan, the NFL's vice president of football operations, issued the suspension for a violation of Rule 12, Section 2, Article 10, which states: \"It is a foul if a player lowers his head to initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponent.\"\"There were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\" Runyan wrote in his letter to Burfict. \"Your contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game.Read More\"Following each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly-appointed appeal officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\"Your extensive history of rules violations is factored into this decision regarding accountability measures.\"Appeals are heard and decided by either Derrick Brooks or James Thrash, the officers jointly appointed and compensated by the NFL and NFLPA to decide appeals of on-field player discipline.Burfict, who spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, signed with the Raiders in March. This will be the fourth suspension of his career, and he's also had numerous fines for illegal hits.In 2017, he was suspended for five games -- later reduced to three -- for making prohibited contact to the head and neck area of a defenseless player as well as forcible contact with his opponent away from the flow of the play.In 2016, Burfict was suspended for the first three games of the season for unnecessary roughness for using his shoulder to make forcible contact to the head and neck area of a defenseless receiver.Burfict also was suspended in 2018, for four games, for use of a banned substance.",

Anger is rising at Moria as agencies continue to warn of a deteriorating situation at the camp, which is now home to around 12,000 people -- four times its official capacity -- according to UNHCR. Read MoreAs of Monday, authorities moved 250 people to the mainland in a bid to \"ease conditions at the Moria camp,\" police said.Clashes with the police led to teargas being fired. \"We have learned with deep sadness that the lives of a woman and a child were lost in a fire on #Lesvos today. We are ready to support those affected and authorities by all means possible,\" UNHCR Greece wrote on Twitter. Angry camp residents told an Agence-France Presse correspondent they were rioting over the long time it took the fire brigade to arrive and extinguish the blaze. The Greek fire services have yet to give an official reason behind the fire. \"An investigation is underway to determine the exact cause of the fire,\" its spokesperson told CNN, adding that one of their vehicles was damaged as it tried \"to operate in the camp.\" Greece is hosting more than 80,000 refugees and asylum seekers who have made the sea crossing from Turkey since 2015. An increase in sea arrivals in recent months has increased the burden on island camps, which the UN warned in August as being far above their estimated capacities.

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has denied an allegation that he groped a female journalist while he was the editor of the Spectator magazine two decades ago. Charlotte Edwardes, now a columnist at the Sunday Times, wrote on Sunday that Johnson squeezed her thigh under the table during a lunch, and claimed he did the same thing to an unidentified woman sitting on his other side during the same event.Edwardes said the incident took place during a private lunch in the late 1990s or early 2000s, when she was a newspaper reporter in her 20s and occasionally contributed to the Spectator. Johnson was in his 30s.\"More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table, I feel Johnson's hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright,\" she wrote.Charlotte Edwardes wrote about the incident in her column in The Sunday Times.On Sunday, the Prime Minister's official spokesman -- who usually confines himself to political matters -- denied the allegations in a one-line statement. \"This allegation is untrue,\" it read. Read MoreConfronted with the Edwardes allegations during a visit to a factory on Monday, Johnson was equally blunt. \"No,\" he said, in reply to a question about whether the incident happened, before steering away from the topic.\"No, and I think what the public want to hear is about what we are doing to level up and unite the country and the announcements we are making today,\" the Prime Minister said, referring to an infrastructure and road program announcement.However, even some members of Johnson's own government expressed support for Edwardes.Speaking to Britain's Channel 4 News, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"I know Charlotte well and I entirely trust what she has to say. I know her and I know her to be trustworthy.\"Amber Rudd, until recently the work and pensions secretary in Johnson's government, tweeted that she agreed with Hancock. For US and UK, the race to melt down may be too close to callThe accusation from Edwardes was the second time in just a week that Johnson was forced to defend himself. The Prime Minister is also facing a criminal misconduct inquiry over his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, an American businesswoman whose firm received tens of thousands of pounds in public funding during Johnson's tenure as the Mayor of London.The monitoring office of the Greater London Authority (GLA) said Friday: \"Allegations have been brought to the attention of the Monitoring Officer that Boris Johnson maintained a friendship with Jennifer Arcuri and as a result of that friendship allowed Ms. Arcuri to participate in trade missions and receive sponsorship monies in circumstances when she and her companies could not have expected otherwise to receive those benefits.\"The Independent Office for Police Conduct is currently assessing whether to investigate Johnson over a potential criminal offense of misconduct in public office. Arcuri and her company have not responded to CNN's request for comment. She told the Sunday Times: \"any grants received and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\"Downing Street declined to comment to CNN on the allegations, but Johnson said in a BBC interview that everything was done \"entirely in the proper way.\"",

But her journey back to the track has not been an easy one. Read MoreIn November 2018, Felix battled preeclampsia and underwent an emergency C-section at 32 weeks to deliver her daughter.In December, Felix told her birth story to ESPN, and talked about her struggle to keep up the image of a world class athlete in the midst of a pregnancy. She discussed the emotional toll the NICU takes on the families that have to stay there.  USA's Allyson Felix celebrates as she crosses the finish line to win the Women's 4x400m Relay Final in Rio. She then explained the fear and faith of having to let go of her plans:\"If I come back and I'm just not the same, if I can't make a fifth Olympic team, I'm gonna know that I fought, that I was determined, and that I gave it my absolute all. And if it doesn't end up the way I imagined in my head, it'll be OK. I just have to go for it, because that's just simply who we are now.\" Not only is she going to her fifth Olympic games, but in August the new mom was part of a high profile movement that pressured Nike to change long-standing maternity policies for its sponsored athletes. Along with decorated women runners -- including Alysia Monta\u00f1o, Kara Goucher and Phoebe Wright -- Felix successfully got the brand to adapt its policy which now ensures female athletes won't be \"adversely impacted financially for pregnancy\" for 18 months, which is six months more than under the previous policy. Felix put Nike behind her and is now the first athlete to be sponsored by Athleta, according to parent company Gap, Inc.  Now the world can watch Felix run in Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics.

        "content": "(CNN)Sebastian Kurz's Austrian People's Party came first in the country's general election on Sunday, winning in every federal state except the capital Vienna, according to the Austrian Interior Ministry.The vote also marked significant losses for the far-right Freedom Party, which lost around third of its seats. Kurz and his right-wing coalition government lost a vote of no-confidence in May, following a corruption scandal prompted by a secretly-filmed video.According to the ministry's preliminary results, the People's Party (\u00d6VP) secured 38.4% of the vote, a gain of almost seven percentage points compared to the last election in 2017. Austria's Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) came second with 21.5% of the vote. Read MoreThe far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6) finished third with 17.3%. This result came as a disappointment to its supporters, with the party losing nine percentage points since 2017.Austria names its first female chancellorFreedom Party's general secretary Harald Vilimsky blamed the poor performance on \"negative headlines in the media.\"The Greens on the other hand gained almost nine points since the last election, securing 12.4% of the vote.\"As in many other countries, the traditional center-left and center-right mainstream parties have lost much of their traditional appeal in Austria,\" Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank, wrote in an analyst note. \"The charismatic Kurz owes his victory largely to his own political skills rather than his \u00d6VP party,\" Schmieding added.Coalition conversations\u00d6VP leader Kurz will now hold coalition talks, which will likely take several weeks. Tying up with the Greens, the SP\u00d6 or the FP\u00d6 would give him enough seats in the parliament. Kurz, who at 33 is one of the world's youngest leaders, was the first Austrian Chancellor since World War II to be defeated by a motion of no confidence.The vote was triggered after Kurz's government became embroiled in a political crisis over an undercover recording. The secretly filmed video showed Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache -- of the Freedom Party -- appearing to offer state contracts to a woman falsely claiming to be the niece of a Russian oligarch.Sebastian Kurz hugs a supporter after the results were announced.Strache resigned after the tape was revealed by Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper. Filmed in Ibiza two years ago, it was not known who recorded the video or set up the meeting. Strache denied any wrongdoing but apologized to \"everyone I have disappointed with my behavior.\"The scandal was the biggest crisis Austria's governing coalition faced since forming in 2017. Kurz's party was quick to distance itself from its coalition partners.Kurz is likely to return as Chancellor but he will have to decide whether to once again form a coalition with the far-right or turn to the left.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz loses confidence vote Elected to the chancellorship in 2017, Kurz shrewdly turned one of Europe's biggest crises -- the refugee influx of 2015 -- into a vote-winner at the ballot box.Kurz arrived in power just as Chancellor Angela Merkel's grip in neighboring Germany appeared to be weakening. He seemed keen to dismantle at least some of her welcoming approach to migrants and take the continent down a more hardline path, despite insisting regularly on his support for the European project.His party was the driving force behind a law banning full-face Muslim veils in public spaces in 2017.Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen appointed a caretaker government led by constitutional lawyer Brigitte Bierlein after Kurz's government lost the no-confidence vote on May 27.",

Maher had been trailing his rival Pieter Devos of Belgium by just one point before winning the 18th and final leg in New York.Earlier on Saturday, Maher had also brought home the overall championship for the London Knights in the Global Champions League for teams.  \"I knew it was going to be a tough weekend,\" said Maher. \"The dream was going to be to win the team and the individual, obviously.

The Belgian eventually finished in seventh place in New York with eight penalties. \"I don't know what to say really,\" said Maher, when asked if he had spoken to Devos. \"I feel bad for him, it's been a tough day, he gave a great fight. ...He had an unfortunate mistake here. It's sport, it's happened to me before and I am sure he is going to come back strong.\"  As the sixth rider to go, Maher steered Explosion W round the sandy arena on Governors Island, off the southern tip of Manhattan, at a steady pace. The pair took the lead with a clear round in 34.08 seconds, beating the previous leader, Germany's Marcus Ehning and Cornado NRW, by 0.57 seconds. Could the final rider, Maher's London Knights' teammate, Martin Fuchs, stage an upset?Riding his second horse, The Sinner, the Swiss rider was never able to match Explosion W's pace, and eventually finished in third place, 0.87 seconds behind Maher.

The Paris Panthers were second, while the Prague Lions finished third. The Knights won the overall title with 326 points, just three points clear of Saint Tropez Pirates, and 23 points ahead of Madrid in Motion. The Knights had won Madrid, Cascais (Portugal), Stockholm and London earlier in the season.As team manager and rider, Maher played an instrumental role in its success. After securing the win in New York, the Briton paid tribute to his team, which also included Under-25 rider Emily Moffitt of Britain and Belgian twin brothers Olivier and Nicola Philippaerts.

It has also been a successful season for Fuchs, the newly crowned European champion.\"A great year for me,\" said Fuchs. \"My horse Clooney has been fantastic the whole year, and to be in such a team with the London Knights and to be with Ben Maher performing always great, it's amazing.\"The Knights had been lying in pole position in New York overnight, and after Fuchs and Clooney put down a clear round on Saturday, Maher rode into the arena as the final rider in the knowledge four penalties or better would bring home the overall team title once again.Leaving nothing to chance, the experienced Briton took the fastest route around the course, finishing with a clear round.  \"There was a lot of pressure before coming here,\" said Fuchs. \"So we said we bring Clooney and Explosion, two of our best horses. We knew we had to win, and that's what we came for.\"With the regular season now finished, all eyes will be on the  GC Prague Playoffs. Staged in the middle of the Czech capital  between November 21-24 , the Playoffs will see the world's top riders battling it out for a total prize money pot of $3.3 million.",

After the final whistle at Japan 2019 games, a popular song from the victorious nation is played -- a Tom Jones song reverberated around the Tokyo Stadium following Wales' victory over Australia.But as the Georgian players celebrated their hard-fought 33-7 victory over Uruguay with its fans, the song heard in the Kumagaya Rugby Stadium was sung in Russian, rather than in Georgian.\"They were playing a song after the match, it was a Russian song sung by a Georgian singer,\" said Georgia's New Zealand head coach Milton Haig. \"We want to make it clear Russia is not Georgia, and Georgia is not Russia. It is a different language, culture, everything. Please make sure these kind of things are ironed out for us.\"Read MoreTensions escalated between Russia and Georgia in August 2008, when then-Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops to regain control over the Russian-backed self-proclaimed autonomous region. Russia responded by moving tanks and soldiers through South Ossetia and advancing farther into Georgian territory.During the five-day conflict, nearly 200 serviceman and 228 civilians from Georgia were killed, according to an EU fact-finding report. Sixty-seven Russian servicemen and 365 South Ossetian servicemen and civilians also lost their lives in the conflict.A ceasefire agreement was brokered by France and signed a few days later by Saakashvili and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.While Moscow recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states, they remain officially part of Georgia but have separate governments.Georgia's supporters celebrate their team winning against Uruguay.READ: A nation united in belief as host Japan secures famous victoryWorld Rugby has apologized \"on behalf of the organizing committee for the oversight.\" \"It was a Georgian singer performing a Russian song,\" World Rugby told CNN. \"It will not happen again.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIt's not the first time that cultural mishaps have occurred at international sporting events.In September, the Andorran national anthem was played instead of Albania's ahead of their Euro 2020 qualifying match against France. Meanwhile at the 2012 London Olympics, South Korea's flag was displayed before the North Korea women's footballers played -- the players left the pitch before it was corrected.Despite the musical mix-up, it was a successful day out for Georgia, as they bounced back from their disappointing 43-14 loss to Wales in their opening game. As for Uruguay, the result meant they came crashing down to earth following their shock victory over Fiji.",

She told the Sunday Times, \"any grants received and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\"The GLA also released a letter it sent to the Prime Minister, informing him it has referred the issue to the police watchdog.In the letter, the authority's monitoring officer details instances of Arcuri's businesses allegedly receiving public money. These include two sponsorships -- one of \u00a310,000 in 2013 and one of \u00a31,500 in 2014 -- from London & Partners, the mayor's promotional agency.The letter also lists three international trade missions in which Arcuri allegedly took part. According to the letter, she was allowed to take part in two even though her companies did not qualify. She participated in the third one after re-applying following an initial rejection.CNN's Nada Bashir contributed to this article.",

        "content": "London (CNN)British Prime Minister Boris Johnson could be forced out of office next week as opposition lawmakers try to join forces to replace him with an interim administration in order to secure another Brexit delay.Senior Scottish National Party (SNP) MP Stewart Hosie told the BBC on Saturday there was a real chance a House of Commons no confidence vote could take place in the government next week. If Johnson lost that vote, he could be forced to let Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn try to form a minority government.Brexit is a tool for Boris Johnson to win an election. The EU is in no mood to do him any favorsCorbyn himself is a divisive opposition leader, having faced criticism for his vague Brexit stance and failure to stamp out anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. His approval rating of minus 60 points makes him the least popular of any opposition leader on record, and support for Labour is stuck in the mid-20s -- well short of the level required to win a majority in the UK Parliament.Hosie warned that sending Corbyn to Downing Street may be the only way to ensure the UK does not crash out of the European Union on October 31. For a vote of no confidence to succeed in Parliament, all opposition parties would need to support it.Read More\"We have to do that because there is now no confidence that the Prime Minister will obey the law and seek the extension which Parliament voted for only a few weeks ago,\" Hosie told the BBC. Johnson has consistently used the controversial phrase \"surrender act\" to describe the legislation that Parliament passed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which requires him to ask for an extension if he cannot get a new deal with the EU by October 19.Lawmakers have called Johnson's language \"disgusting\" in the Commons, with former Conservative MP Justine Greening calling it \"deeply disrespectful\" to Parliament.Johnson has said he calls the law \"surrender act\" because it was \"intended to damage this country's negotiation position.\"\"It would oblige us to stay in the EU for month after month at a cost of a billion pounds per month, it would take away from this country the ability to decide how long that extension would be, and it would give that power to the EU, it would absolutely undermine our ability to continue to negotiate because it takes away our ability to walk away from the negotiation,\" Johnson said.Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking at the Labour Conference in Brighton.While the SNP's Hosie suggested that the interim administration could be led by Corbyn, he acknowledged that the Liberal Democrats and many Conservative rebels who had the whip withdrawn have made it clear they would not put the Labour leader into Downing Street -- even if it was for a short period.However, Hosie warned it may be lawmakers' only choice if they're serious about blocking a no-deal Brexit.\"If we are serious about the extension that is the only game in town,\" Hosie said. \"This is a short term procedure in order to get the extension to Article 50 and then to have an election.\"[The Liberal Democrats] need to stop playing political games [and] get on board with everyone else. If this is the only game in town, they need to play it or nothing,\" he added.Corbyn said Saturday that he had a \"productive meeting\" with opposition parties on Thursday, according to PA. The Labour leader reiterated to reporters that \"our priority, all of us, is to prevent a no-deal exit from the European Union on the 31st.\"CNN's Zahid Mahmood contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)How much rugby is too much rugby?Paul Erskine is finding out. He has tickets for 36 of the 48 World Cup matches in Japan, and is determined to set an official Guinness World Record. Because apparently that's a thing -- most matches attended at a Rugby World Cup by an individual.A 54-year-old coal industry executive who traveled to Japan from South Africa, Erskine is taking it seriously. This feat is two years and about $33,000 in the making.Wearing a custom jersey promoting his ambitious record bid, and riding a train to the City of Toyota Stadium near Nagoya to see Wales play Georgia, Erskine explained that it's actually quite a process to make the record official.Paul Erskine has tickets for 36 of the 48 World Cup matches in Japan, and is determined to set an official Guinness World Record.For starters, he had to register his attempt three months prior to the tournament.Read MoreThen, to prove his attendance at each of the 36 matches, Erskine is required to provide a ticket stub, photographic evidence that he was present for the pre-game national anthems, signatures from two witnesses, and detailed notes about how he got to the stadium.\"People can lie,\" he says. \"They could win (the record) by one ticket or two tickets. But, physically, how could you get from A to B?\"At the end of the tournament, he'll compile his data and send it in to Guinness. And after all this, if he's ultimately triumphant, he'll get ... nothing.Erskine laughs and explains that maybe he'll impress his kids. \"They'll say, 'That's my dad.'\"     READ: Uruguay stuns Fiji to deliver first major shock of Japan 2019READ: Samoa escapes double red card and ralies to winWild adventureThe South African will be in Japan for 42 days. On Thursday he was in Kobe watching England beat the USA and he will be in Yokohoma for the World Cup final on November.Despite the number of games he has to cram in, Erksine isn't worried he's going to miss one. \"Japan Railways doesn't have delays,\" says the South African.He's living out of a small backpack and is traveling light. Two of everything. But no razors. He's refusing to shave. Because why not.Back home in November, bearded and travel weary, he'll only have to answer to his wife. And that shouldn't be a problem. \"She's used to it,\" quips Erskine.     This isn't the first time Erskine has ventured off on a wild adventure. In 2011 he competed in the Mongol Derby, celebrated as the world's longest endurance horse race.It's a grueling 10-day, 1,000 kilometer journey through the Mongolian steppe following the route of an ancient postal messaging system developed by Genghis Khan.For animal safety, riders are required to change horses every 40km. Human safety is less a concern. And many participants, like Erskine, never even finish the race.So, yeah. That kind of adventuring. Climbing tall mountains. Diving deep seas. And seeing the far reaches of the planet as he checks things off his non-traditional bucket list.Of course, watching rugby, drinking cider, and sleeping in hotels won't be quite as physically taxing as 10 days in the saddle.

        "content": "(CNN)FIFA has threatened possible sanctions against some national federations over the voting process for its annual \"The Best\" awards following media coverage questioning the poll's integrity which the world governing body described as \"unfair and misleading.\" The glitzy awards hosted at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on Monday honored the world's top footballers and coaches.Lionel Messi holds his trophy after winning FIFA's best men's player of the year award.Winners of the best men's player and coach were selected by an international jury comprising the coaches of all men's national teams (one per team), the captains of all men's national teams (one per team), one specialist journalist from each territory represented by a national team and fans from all over the world who registered on FIFA.com.However, in the days following the awards ceremony there was confusion as to who had voted on behalf of Nicaragua, after captain Juan Barrera took to Twitter, contradicting reports he had taken part in the polling.In fact, Manuel Rosas had voted on behalf of the Central American country ranked 148th in the world, with the Nicaraguan federation erroneously submitting Barrera's name.Read More\"FENIFUT would like to leave it clear that this whole situation was a misunderstanding. We take responsibility for the administrative error and we understand the annoyance it could cause to one of our captains,\" read the statement which was shared on Twitter.\"FENIFUT would like to apologize for the misunderstanding that this whole issue generated.\"On Thursday, it was widely reported that votes cast by the Egyptian coach Shawky Gharib and captain Ahmed Elmohamady for the best men's player were not recorded as they were signed in capital letters which is in breach of FIFA's voting rules. READ: Megan Rapinoe praises Raheem Sterling, 'Blue Girl' in FIFA award speechREAD: Neymar, Bale, Coutinho: The loneliness of the megabuck soccer starMohammad Salah of Liverpool received votes that weren't eligible, according to FIFA.The two representatives of the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) nominated their countryman and Liverpool forward Mohammad Salah.In a statement sent to CNN, FIFA said that the EFA's voting forms were not signed by the federation's general secretary, which is mandatory.

        "content": "London (CNN)Is Britain being led by political trolls? Anyone looking at the state of the UK political scene these days would be forgiven for asking that question. After being hauled back from New York by order of the Supreme Court, a furious Boris Johnson tore into lawmakers in the House of Commons on Wednesday night for failing to back his Brexit plans or grant him a general election. Even by the vicious standards of the British Parliament, the animosity of the clashes was shocking. Johnson goaded and taunted his opponents, denouncing no-deal Brexit legislation as a \"surrender act\" and accusing lawmakers of wanting to \"betray\" British voters who wished to leave the European Union. In one particularly vicious swipe, he dismissed as \"humbug\" the concerns of an MP, Paula Sherriff, who asked him to recall the politically motivated murder three years ago of a Labour lawmaker, Jo Cox.\"When the trolls are in Parliament, how do we stop feeding the trolls,\" asked opposition Labour MP, Stella Creasy, in a swiftly scheduled debate on the toxicity of language in the House of Commons on Thursday. Given that the Prime Minister knows how raw the memory of Cox's murder remains in the Commons, what on earth was he up to? Wes Streeting, a Labour MP, thinks it was planned. \"It does feel like there is a deliberate and calculated strategy on behalf of the government to inflame tensions and increase hostility towards MPs,\" he told CNN.Read MoreSam Gyimah, who left Johnson's Conservative party recently in protest over his Brexit plans, agrees. \"It is deliberate... there is no project at the heart of this government. All it wants to do is leave the EU by any means necessary.\"Boris Johnson's sister calls him 'tasteless' and 'reprehensible'It's a strategy that Johnson and his inner circle clearly think is working. His aides simply don't believe that the language used by Johnson stokes hatred towards opposition MPs, and they will not apologize for it. Moreover, they believe the language is justified. Johnson himself responded immediately to the \"surrender act\" criticism, saying the legislation \"would oblige us to stay in the EU month after month\" and that it would \"undermine our ability to properly negotiate in Brussels.\"On paper, this sounds like a measured and calm response. But the word \"surrender\" has particular connotations, particularly when spat across the Commons chamber. As former Labour leader Ed Miliband pointed out, it implies that the UK is  at war with Europe. \"But we are not at war with Europe and we are not at war with each other,\" he said in the House of Commons on Thursday.Ever since the Brexit vote, divisions between those who wish to remain, those who wish to leave with a soft deal and those who want to leave with no deal at all, have become painful. Some MPs, Brexit supporters and some sections of the media have denounced  judges, anti-Brexit campaigners and others in even more vicious terms than those employed by the PM on Wednesday.Johnson may not have been so explicit, but it is worth remembering that he is the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As Gyimah told CNN, \"Boris Johnson is acting like a campaigner, not a Prime Minister.\" This charge carries particular weight, when you consider the aides employed by Johnson since taking office.  Johnson was the figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, and his most significant hire since entering Downing Street is Dominic Cummings, the controversial campaign director of Vote Leave. Dominic Cummings, a senior aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at a book launch in London.Critics say that Cummings and his juniors are still in campaign mode, behaving like the underdogs that took the fight to the establishment to deliver the Brexit vote in 2016. That's certainly how Cummings sees it: In rare public remarks on Thursday evening, he described the current turmoil as a \"walk in the park\" compared with the referendum campaign. \"We're going to win, we're going to leave,\" he said. Vote Leave, of course, was accused of all manner of shabby practice, from playing fast and loose with the facts to whipping up fear over immigration from Turkey. But Vote Leave won, and it stands to reason that the winning team would think that a similar strategy in government would bring similar success.  Johnson's poll lead remains strong and Conservative ministers even privately shrug off any suggestion that this hardline approach does anything other than play into their \"people versus parliament\" election campaign. The British Parliament is back and it's angrier than everGovernment sources point to the words others have used against Johnson, implying that the insults flow both ways. And to some extent, they have a point. As Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow said on Thursday, there's an \"atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House.\"This nastiness seems unlikely to stop any time soon, not least because the government doesn't believe that its behavior amounts to nastiness. Given the strength of feeling in British politics right now, that opinion could uncharitably be described as gaslighting. Yet Johnson's supporters don't seem put off.  So, to answer Stella Creasy's question, \"how do we stop feeding the trolls?\" Until there is evidence that the strategy is costing Johnson support out in the real world, it might not be possible. Which, given the UK's political deadlock, means things could be about to get a hell of a lot more ugly.",

It's not about a particular continent. I don't see this as a personal issue.

I want athletics to always be at the forefront of thought leadership. That isn't an easy position to be in, but it is the right position to be in. I'm happy that our sport is brave enough to want to challenge these issues and take them head on.\"Christian Coleman crosses the finish line to win the men's 100m final during the 2019 USATF Outdoor Championships Des Moines, Iowa.

Coleman will be and is the bookies' favorite to claim the men's 100m title, ahead of convicted doper Justin Gatlin.The two American sprinters are standout figures in a field lacking in household names. Usain Bolt ran his last race in 2017 and Wayde van Niekerk -- reigning 400m world champion -- continues to miss out with a recurring knee injury.In the women's sprints Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Dina Asher-Smith willl attract attention, but is a lack of star-quality elsewhere a concern for Coe?\"In my lifetime, I don't remember being more excited about the current batch [of young athletes] that are coming through,\" said Coe.\"If you take all our disciplines, the top 10 in those disciples, a quarter of them are under the age of 22 to 23. That's a fantastic position to be in and we will have some amazing names emerging.\"READ: Caster Semenya begins 'new journey' at football clubREAD: Caster Semenya blocked from competing at World ChampionshipsShelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce will be one of a few household names competing in Doha.Coe continued: \"We've got a new generation coming through that are communicating well.

That we're putting systems in place that are going to protect them.\"The IAAF didn't provide details of what level of protection or what duty of care, each individual athlete will receive. Coe also spoke on the importance of filling stadiums, on keeping sponsors on board, on attracting a new fan base and reaching a new audience through innovative technologies.He added that he was excited to do \"some of the fun stuff now,\" having laid down the \"foundation stones\" during his first period as president.But as new challenges arise -- the reintroduction of Russia after allegations of state sponsored doping that saw 67 athletes banned by the IAAF in 2016, as well as the the organization's role in combating climate change, to name but two -- Coe will appreciate that his organization still has much to doThe World Championships begin on September 27. For 10 days, Coe will hope that conversations stay on the track and a clutch of new fan favorites usher in a new era.",

        "content": "(CNN)If success in soccer was measured solely by results in the boardroom rather than on the field of play, then Manchester United would be the team to beat.On Tuesday, the club announced record revenues of \u00a3627.1 million ($772 million) for the year ending June 30, 2019 -- an increase of 6.3% from the previous year, in part courtesy of the new Champions League broadcasting deal.In addition was the announcement of 10 new or renewed global sponsorship deals, as well as the claim that it now had 1.1 billion fans and followers across the globe, according to data from Kantar, added further gloss to the shiny figures.But when you swap the spreadsheets for the Premier League table, it's clear something doesn't add up.In fact, by the time United arrives at Old Trafford to face Arsenal on Monday it could already be out of the title race -- if it was really in it to start with.Harry Maguire of Manchester United looks dejected following the defeat at West Ham.\nRead MoreLast season it finished sixth, 32 points behind champion Manchester City and 32 ahead of Cardiff, the team occupying the final relegation place.After a mere six games of this fledgling Premier League season, United is already 10 points adrift of league leader Liverpool -- by Monday it could be 13.\"I never said it was going to be easy this season,\" United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told reporters Friday.\"There are going to be bumps in the road, ups and downs, highs and lows - when we lose a game we have to trust ourselves and what we are doing, keep our eyes on the prize and the principles we believe in.\"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signed a three-year deal with United in March 2019.READ: Has VAR gone too far?READ: What is going on at Tottenham?Those bumps do not look like they'll be subsiding any time soon. On Wednesday, United required a penalty shootout to defeat third-tier Rochdale in the English League Cup after the contest finished 1-1 after 90 minutes.That result came on the back of a nondescript performance during the 2-0 defeat at West Ham which sparked criticism from the club's former players as well as insipid display against Astana in the Europa League.'Shocked and saddened'\"I don't know where to start,\" former United captain Roy Keane told Sky Sports in the aftermath of the defeat at London's Olympic Stadium.\"I knew they weren't in a great place but I am shocked and saddened by how bad they are. You can lose a game of football but everything about United was lackluster.\"No quality. A lack of desire. A lack of leaders. A lack of characters. It is a long way back and it is scary just how far they have fallen.\"Fred (C) of Manchester United looks dejected with Harry Maguire (L) after West Ham's second goal.\nKeane is hardly alone in criticizing this United side. Gary Neville, the former United defender, was similarly critical after the loss at West Ham.\"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I've said over the last few weeks, watching this team and squad that it's not ready,\" he told the Gary Neville Podcast.\"There are going to be ups and downs and lots of pain. It was painful at West Ham, but it doesn't make it any easier when you see it with your own eyes. This squad is depleted. It's young, inexperienced and not ready.\"Alex Ferguson won 13 Premier League titles with Manchester United.READ: Manchester United's players 'at best staying still, but most of all regressing'READ: Italian soccer pundit fired for racist on-air comments about LukakuUnited's failings since the retirement of Alex Ferguson in 2013 have been well documented, but its failure to address them has left it light years behind its main rivals.While Liverpool and Manchester City have both succeeded in establishing a philosophy and successful transfer strategy, United has done neither.Since Ferguson left, David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho have all attempted to instil their own imprint on the club. None succeeded.The problem, as witnessed across football and not just at United, is that when there is a constant change of management, it brings with it instability.Players that are brought in under one coach, are discarded by the next. That coach then brings in his own players, who then are often sold off by whichever coach replaces the previous incumbent. It is not a sustainable strategy.'Started really well'For Solskjaer, the man charged with restoring good fortune to Old Trafford, the task is a considerable one. When Moyes, the man who replaced Ferguson, made that famous statement in December 2013 that United needed to improve \"in a number of areas, including passing, creating chances and defending,\" he was widely mocked and chastised. He was sacked after just 10 months in charge.Both Van Gaal and Mourinho tried to fix United, both winning silverware but failing to ensure the club reasserted itself as a serious Premier League title contender.Ole Gunnar Solskjaer enjoyed a stunning start to his reign at Old Trafford.When Solskjaer replaced Mourinho on an interim basis in December 2018 the change in both mood and form was almost instantaneous.United went unbeaten in his first 11 games in charge and produced an astonishing comeback to defeat Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the European Champions League on away goals after losing the first leg 2-0.Before Solskjaer was appointed as head coach on a full-time basis in March 2019, United won 14 of his 19 games in charge, drawing two and losing three, while scoring 40 and conceding 17. He had a win percentage of 73.7%.But that form trailed off horribly. In fact, Solskjaer's record over his 27 league games in charge is now identical to the last 27 of Mourinho's reign -- 14 wins, six draws and seven defeats with a win percentage of 51.9%.\"He started really well. The first two months were fantastic,\"  Andy Mitten, football writer and editor of the 'United We Stand' fanzine, told CNN.\"He lifted the mood and it needed lifting. The players liked it. He made them more attacking. They felt they were too cautious and defensive-minded under Mourinho, but results are everything.\"When results stop, people start turning on each other and that has been happening. If Manchester United loses a game now then it's complete despondency.\"Manchester United's Daniel James (R) celebrates with teammates after scoring on his full Premier League debut against Chelsea.After a sixth placed finish last season, Solskjaer attempted to revamp the squad in order to make it more competitive and tailor it to the style of football he wanted his side to play.During the summer the club spent around \u00a3150 million ($184 million) on new recruits which included making Harry Maguire the world's most expensive defender following his reported \u00a380 million ($98 million) move from Leicester. Maguire, along with defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka and winger Daniel James, have all enjoyed encouraging starts to life at Old Trafford.Solskjaer also managed to offload a number of players on big wages who he no longer wanted at the club including Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, two big-name stars that had been brought into the club at considerable cost.Instead, he has placed his faith in youth, including 17-year-old Mason Greenwood, who is likely to start in attack against Arsenal after scoring in his previous appearance against third-tier Rochdale. 'Fragile'\"It's a rebuilding process,\" Mitten said. \"It's a young squad. Ole Gunnar needed to get rid of the players he didn't think had a future at Manchester United and bring in the players that he did.Mason Greenwood celebrates scoring against Rochdale.\"They've done well, the three players he's brought in. It was him who pushed for them, no one else. He was the one making the calls and they've done well but it hasn't been a good start to the season.\"They've won two of the six league games, have been pretty poor against Astana and Rochdale and that confidence that grew on the preseason tour, and I was on that tour in Australia, it was always fragile and it keeps getting pounded when United don't win matches.\"Mitten, who has followed United for decades across England, Europe and the world, believes there are a series of factors behind United's woes.He cites the success of its rivals, as well as the financial health of those such as Leicester, Tottenham and West Ham, clubs which in the past United would have little trouble in being able to afford pinching the best players from.He is also critical of the club's transfer strategy, insisting United should be doing better given its exorbitant wage bill.Alexis Sanchez struggled to make an impact at Manchester United. He has since joined Inter Milan on loan.\"They're underachieving and should be doing much better,\" Mitten said of United.\"They've wasted and squandered so much money on players who failed from Angel Di Maria to Radamel Falcao to Alexis Sanchez and it looks like a club that is rudderless in terms of its direction or has done until now. \"And now they're saying, 'OK,  we have got this idea. Here's what Solskjaer's going to do, play this style of football, bring players through who can play in the Manchester United way, invest a lot of money into the academy.'\"It's much better than it was four years ago but academies take five years to reap rewards and while Ole has to plan for the future, he also has to get results in the present. He just has to be and when United has been playing as they have done fans are going to be unhappy.\"'Patience'For now, those at the top of the club are backing Solskjaer. Ed Woodward, the club's executive vice-chairman, told a post-results media call on Tuesday that \"it is important we are patient while Ole and the team build for the future.\"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer celebrates during the famous win over PSG.Woodward, who himself has been criticized for United's failings in the transfer market, is likely to come under renewed pressure should United fail in reeling in its rivals.The former investment banker who advised the American Glazer family on its takeover of United in 2005, has faced calls to appoint a director of football to oversee the club's recruitment process.He will also be aware that the club's failure to qualify for the Champions League will have financial ramifications with revenue for United's 2019-20 financial year being forecast at between \u00a3560m and \u00a3580m ($689 million-$714 million)  down from 2018-19's record of \u00a3627.1 million ($772 million).There's also growing competition with Barcelona announcing last week a $1.1 billion turnover for 2018-19, adding that it expects to move past the \u20ac1 billion ($1.152 billion) mark this year.For now, United will place its hope and trust in youth and Solskjaer. In a world where patience is almost extinct and instant gratification a constant, such a move is rather refreshing.Now it is up to Solskjaer to combine that young talent with the likes of wonderfully gifted Paul Pogba and return United to its once customary place at the top of English football.\"I never said it was going to be easy this season,\" Solskjaer said Friday. He may never be proved more correct.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Friday released its findings as part of its newly published European Red List of Trees. While the European Red List had already assessed 15,000 species, including vertebrates, freshwater molluscs and trees, the latest study focused on the dangers to lesser-known species. One million species threatened with extinction because of humansIn total, 58% of Europe's endemic trees are at risk of dying out -- as well as more than two-fifths of the continent's 454 native species.The horse chestnut -- native to Bulgaria, Greece, Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia but widespread elsewhere in Europe -- is among those in danger.

They belong to the \"Sorbus\" genus, which is particularly affected -- three-quarters of its 170 species are at threat, the IUCN said.Almost 600 plant species have become extinct in the last 250 yearsCraig Hilton-Taylor, head of the IUCN Red List Unit, said: \"It is alarming that over half of Europe's endemic tree species are now threatened with extinction.\"Trees are essential for life on earth, and European trees in all their diversity are a source of food and shelter for countless animal species such as birds and squirrels, and play a key economic role.\"He called for cooperation between the European Union, regional assemblies and conservationists to overcome the threat. The latest assessments show that it is not only trees that are endangered -- almost half of Europe's shrubs and more than a fifth of land molluscs are at risk of extinction. Luc Bas, director of IUCN's European Regional Office, said: \"This report has shown how dire the situation is for many overlooked, undervalued species that form the backbone of Europe's ecosystems and contribute to a healthy planet. \"We need to mitigate human impact on our ecosystems and prioritise the protection of these species.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)British filmmaker Asif Kapadia smiles at the suggestion that his third major documentary feature -- \"Diego Maradona\" -- is his hat-trick piece of work, following the stellar \"Senna\" (2010) and Oscar-winning \"Amy\" (2015). \"I suppose I'm interested in slightly edgier characters,\" Kapadia reveals when recently speaking to CNN World Sport's Don Riddell in New York.\"I wanted to make these films about people who are kind of pop-cultural references. Most people think they already know their story and you say, well maybe you don't know their story.\"When it comes to stories, the 47-year-old filmmaker from north London has been drawn to tales related to \"child geniuses and fame.\"\"Senna\" focused on the wild ride lived on and off the racetrack by Brazilian motor racing star Ayrton Senna, while Kapadia then trained his lens on the singer Amy Winehouse, whose flame burned briefly but brightly.

The Argentine was recently named manager of Argentine football team Gimnasia.\"Maradona was the best player in the world,\" Kapadia begins. \"And I guess to make a movie there's got to be drama, there's got to be something: It's not just about being brilliant at something, it's also about what's going on in your personal life.\"And that's the reason why I don't think there's any footballer that is a better subject to make a movie about.\"Diego Maradona beats England defender Terry Fenwick on his way to scoring his outstanding individual second goal in the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal.\"More comebacks than Jesus\"When the eternal question of life and death is raised, Kapadia points out that the case could be made that Maradona has straddled the line between both on numerous occasions.\"I think the interesting thing about Diego Maradona is that he's actually died a few times and then he comes back again! That's the story -- death and resurrection. You know, more comebacks than Jesus ... Every time people see his career is over, he'll come back, he'll reinvent himself.\"WATCH: Soccer legend Maradona opens up in new documentaryIn a sense, Kapadia has no need to reinvent the way he works. The director's great gift is having the uncanny knack of turning what could be the dry medium of the documentary into rip-roaring excitement.Look no further than the opening sequence from\u00a0\"Diego Maradona,\" which appears to be a car chase more in keeping with a \"Jason Bourne\" action movie -- or should that be \"The Italian Job\"? -- than the reality of the footballer being followed to the stadium in Naples for his unveiling, by a car which got closer to him than many opposition defenders. Kapadia has also eschewed the traditional staple of documentaries -- the talking head -- with a preference for simply hearing the audio over meticulously researched archive, which lends an often never-before-seen authenticity to the finished product (he estimates that approximately 80 interviews were conducted, including the subject himself in Dubai).According to Kapadia, much of the footage has never been seen for 30 years.\"So, there will be a lot of stuff when he's at his prime that he's not seen and will have forgotten ... I'm hoping he'll be able to look at it and understand, 'that's who I was, that's what I did.'\"\u00a0JUST WATCHED'Goal of the Century': Maradona's 1986 magicReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Goal of the Century': Maradona's 1986 magic 04:33READ: How Diego Maradona redefined football in the space of less than five minutes\"I had to touch him\"What Maradona failed to understand from the making of the movie was the effect even he could have on a seasoned filmmaker such as Kapadia, who confessed to inexplicably reaching out during an interview and placing a hand on the Argentine while sitting at his feet and recording the audio.\"I touched his left foot, which was kind of a mad feeling, of meeting someone like Maradona,\" Kapadia explains. \"And realizing I had this kind of mad feeling I had to touch him! I never felt that way with anyone else before! He wasn't a huge fan of the idea actually, I have to be honest.\"The streets are never far from Maradona's story, with Kapadia frequently referring to him as a \"street fighter,\" as well as acknowledging how he grew up playing \"street football\" in Villa Fiorito, just outside Buenos Aires. It is also the \"street guys\" to whom Maradona gravitates towards in his social life in Naples, which is where Kapadia claims \"all of his personal problems really began.\" JUST WATCHEDSoccer legend Maradona opens up in new documentaryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSoccer legend Maradona opens up in new documentary 02:06King of the streetsKapadia also notes that Maradona's \"way of moving and controlling the ball came from playing on a rough surface.\"\"But mentally he's also like that: He's a street fighter so the way he played football, the way he played against England in 1986, the idea of scoring on one hand the best goal ever perhaps, versus the handball, that's both sides of his personality.\"And it's how he lived on the pitch and off the pitch. And so, the people he hung out with often off the pitch were also street guys. And that's really what the film is about. Wherever he goes, he will want to know who runs this town, who's in control, who's in power.\"They all want to hang out with Diego Maradona, but he also wants to know he's going to be protected and looked after. And his natural instinct is to go to the street guys, which is what happens when you're in Naples, you have to hang out with street guys.\"Argentine former football star Diego Armando Maradona gestures during the first training session of Gimnasia.The fact that Kapadia's subjects are complex seems clear, but does that make it more difficult to celebrate a polarizing figure such as Maradona? \"He was the best footballer in the world,\" asserts Kapadia. \"You celebrate him for being what he was: An athlete. These guys never come out saying, 'I'm going to be a role model for the rest of the world.\"'\"That's not what I'm trying to do here. I think our film explains, it's to do with this idea of a kid coming from nothing, who rises up to the top but has given everything. \"And his issues with addiction come out. It looks like he's this kind of crazy guy, who acts really stupidly and having fun. But actually, underneath it, there's some sort of cry for help going on there.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing pressure over his alleged relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri during the time he served as the Mayor of London.Johnson has been given 14 days to provide the details of the relationship after the Sunday Times reported that a company run by the tech entrepreneur received tens of thousands of pounds in public funding when Johnson was mayor.Boris Johnson and Jennifer Arcuri pictured together at a tech conference in London in 2014.The company also had access to overseas trade missions headed by the then mayor, according to the newspaper. The Sunday Times alleged Arcuri was given preferential treatment when it came to joining the missions, despite her business \"not meeting the eligibility criteria for any of the three Johnson trade missions she attended in the space of just a year.\"The Oversight Committee of the Greater London Authority has asked Johnson to disclose details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri during his 2008-16 mayoral term. They also want the PM to explain how that alleged personal relationship was disclosed at the time Arcuri was awarded the grants. Arcuri and her company did not respond to CNN's request for comment. She told the Sunday Times any grants received and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman.\"Read MoreHow long can Boris Johnson cling onto power for?Downing Street declined to comment on the allegations. Johnson himself first dodged the topic, then suggested in a BBC interview everything was done \"entirely in the proper way.\"The issue was even discussed in Parliament on Wednesday, when lawmakers forced an official from the government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to come into the debating chamber and answer questions about his agencies role in awarding Arcuri's company their most recent public money. Arcuri's latest company, Hacker House, was awarded \u00a3100,000 ($123,000) funding earlier this year from the department. The company says it provides \"practical ethical hacking skills\" training online. The funding was part of a program aiming to increase the diversity and numbers of those working in the UK's cyber security sector.Questioned about a possible conflict of interest, Matt Warman, the undersecretary of state for digital, said all grants are awarded through transparent and competitive way. He added the company has been paid \"some \u00a347,000\" to date.\"We are of course aware of the claims raised recently by The Sunday Times and the department is reviewing the decision that was taken,\" he said.Boris Johnson returns to UK to face Parliament after Supreme Court rulingLiberal Democrat MP Layla Moran alleged in Parliament that the funding was meant for businesses based in the UK, and added that Arcuri lives in the US.Warman said the company's location will be part of the review. \"But it is a company with a British phone number,\" he said, adding that Johnson was not involved in the decision to award the grant.Moran also said the funding the company received was higher than what it was eligible for, saying the grant was set at maximum of 50% of a company's income. Warman said the officials scored the application highly and \"decided the other aspects more than outweighed that particular individual criteria.\"The company's registered address in central London is a building that houses offices for rent, as well as \"virtual offices,\" a service that makes it possible for businesses to have a physical presence in London without any actual space or desks. It is not clear if Hacker House uses that service.Hacker House was not immediately available to comment. The company did not respond to email and voice mail.",

The 2003 champion simply outclassed its opponents in Kobe City scoring seven tries, with the Americans almost becoming the first team not to register a score at this year's tournament until a late try from Bryce Campbell put the USA on the scoreboard.To make matters worse, USA's John Quill picked up the tournament's first red card for a sickening tackle on Owen Farrell. Defeat for the Eagles means its wait for a first Rugby World Cup win since 2011 continues whilst England has now won both of its games so far this tournament after beating Tonga 35-3 in its opener Sunday. Despite boasting a population of 330 million, men's rugby in the US is still on the rise and its opening match in Japan demonstrates just how far there is to go before it can compete on the biggest stage.

George Ford carved his way through the US defense to register England's first try within seven minutes, becoming the fourth England captain to score a try at the Rugby World Cup.Instead of capitulating after the early setback, the US defended ferociously but Eddie Jones' side continued to knock on the door. Eventually, the door came flying off.Billy Vunipola drove over from a line-out and Luke Cowan-Dickie once again capitalized on a set-piece before half-time offered the USA some respite from England's relentless attack. The second half was very much a mirror image of the first though, with England piling the pressure on USA's tiring defense. Joe Cokanasiga scored the seemingly inevitable bonus-point try after Jonathan Joseph made an impressive dart behind the USA defense. Ruaridh McConnochie, Lewis Ludlam and Cokanasiga then went over before Campbell capitalized on a bizarre passage of play to register a score for the underdogs right at the death. \"I guess we were fortunate enough to get one on the scoreboard and I'm proud of the effort,\" said USA captain Blaine Scully.READ: Samoa escapes double red card as it rallies to win against RussiaEngland's Owen Farrell receives medical treatment after a horror tackle.

Despite the brutal collision, Farrell was up in seconds to confront Quill, sparking ugly scenes in an otherwise entertaining spectacle.England coach Jones will be happy with England's defense which has only conceded one try at this year's tournament but sterner tests lie ahead in the shape of France and Argentina.\"Two games, 10 points and what a great occasion for rugby,\" said Jones after the match, before praising the lively atmosphere in the humid Kobe. \"It's terrific for rugby.

The Prime Minister provoked particular anger when he urged lawmakers to honor Cox's memory by backing the government on Brexit. (Cox was a supporter of staying in the European Union.)Rachel Johnson, second left, pictured with brothers Boris and Jo in 2014.Read More\"My brother is using words like 'surrender' and 'capitulation' as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people, as defined by the 17.4 million votes in 2016, should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred, and feathered,\" Rachel Johnson told Sky News. \"I think that is highly reprehensible.\"\"I think it was particularly tasteless for those who are grieving a mother, MP and friend to say the best way to honor her memory is to deliver the thing she and her family campaigned against -- Brexit,\" she added.Rachel Johnson has been a critic of Brexit, and stood as a candidate for the pro-EU rebel bloc The Independent Group for Change at this year's European elections. She is not the first member of the Prime Minister's family to voice dissent --  their brother, Jo, resigned from the government earlier this month, citing family divisions. Later on Thursday, the opposition Labour MP Jess Phillips said a man had been arrested after calling her a \"fascist\" and trying to \"kick the door\" of her constituency office.Phillips has spoken frequently about abuse she has suffered as an MP,  and criticized Johnson about his rhetoric in Parliament earlier Thursday. \"We all get abuse, and I've had a death threat this week that literally quoted the Prime Minister and used the Prime Minister's name and words in a death threat that was delivered to my staff,\" she told lawmakers.Opening parliamentary proceedings on Thursday, Speaker John Bercow denounced the previous evening's scenes as \"toxic\" and pleaded for a calmer atmosphere.\"I think there is a widespread sense across the House and beyond that yesterday, the House did itself no credit,\" he said. \"There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House. On both sides, passions were inflamed, angry words were uttered. The culture was toxic,\" he added.",

Johnson says he wants an election, but can't make it happen. The opposition claims it wants an election, but won't make it happen. British politics is in a deeply weird place. The government and the opposition each hold the keys to giving the other what they want, but neither wants to be the one to release the lock.Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives at 10 Downing Street as MPs return to Parliament.\nJohnson is leading a minority government and wants an early general election as soon as possible. In order to get one, he needs the country to believe he is fighting tooth and nail to get Brexit over the line, once and for all. Corbyn and the rest of the opposition are frustrating his efforts at every turn. That's the message he is hammering home, over and over.Read MoreIf the polls are to be believed, it's a narrative that's working in his favor. Labour and the rest of Johnson's opponents, however, only want an election after they can be absolutely sure that the looming October 31 Brexit deadline has been neutered. Only a delay, they argue, would prevent a no-deal Brexit which they believe would cause economic havoc, and even put lives at risk.JUST WATCHEDCorbyn outlines how he would handle BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCorbyn outlines how he would handle Brexit 02:32Doubtless, they are sincere in this argument. However, it's hard to ignore the idea floated in some corners that if Brexit is delayed, Johnson would have failed to deliver his central promise and his poll numbers would collapse. A clearer path to power, therefore, would emerge for Labour and the other UK opposition parties.That's why Corbyn may not bring forward a confidence vote now, but instead continue to pile political pressure on the Prime Minister to resign. If the Labour leader can force that scenario, someone else would be forced to ask Brussels for a Brexit extension and Johnson would be cast as an abject failure who quit when the going got tough. All of which would presumably work to the electoral advantage of one Jeremy Corbyn. Johnson and Corbyn, it seems, are trying to trick the other into acting against their own interest. The politics of the UK have seldom been this baffling. It's hard to see that this will lead to anything other than a monumental grudge match. We got a taste of it on Wednesday -- the exchanges in the Commons were among the angriest and most bitter in years. Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, said Parliament was \"dead\" and \"no moral right\" to sit. Johnson, later, peppered his remarks with the people-versus-parliament rhetoric of \"surrender\" and \"betrayal\" that has become his trademark.In response to calls from Labour MPs to moderate his tone and reflect on the politically motivated murder three years ago of lawmaker Jo Cox, Johnson said: \"The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory is to get Brexit done.\" Even some Conservative MPs were aghast that the Prime Minister would use the horror to make a political point.But don't expect him to back down. Johnson thinks it will work, and there will be more to come.Parliament is back -- and angrier than ever. The next few weeks will get even uglier.",

The Australian was initially fined $113,000 for smashing two rackets and calling chair umpire Fergus Murphy a \"f*ing tool\" in his three set defeat by Russia's Karen Khachanov.However, his behavior has been subject to an ongoing investigation by the sport's governing body which concluded the 24-year-old had committed \"aggravated behavior\" and identified a pattern related to verbal abuse of officials and spectators. Both the potential fine and suspension will be lifted after a six-month probationary period provided Kyrgios meets a number of conditions laid down by the ATP.

        "content": "Brighton (CNN)The vision of the United Kingdom laid out at the annual gathering of the country's main opposition party this week sounded like a socialist utopia. Britons would only work a four-day week. A \"Green New Deal\" agenda would aim to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Elite private schools like Eton, incubator of 20 British prime ministers including the incumbent and his predecessor, would be abolished. Some workforces would take a 10% stake in their businesses and gain employee seats on company boards. Rail, water, energy and the postal service could be renationalized. And many essential services would soon be free, including higher education, childcare, social care and medical prescriptions. A slate of potentially vote-winning policies designed to attract voters ground down by years of austerity? An ambitious, radical government-in-waiting? A party fired up to tackle the burning issues of the day?Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gives a thumbs-up on the third day of the party's conference. If only.Read MoreFor all its progressive plans, Labour is unable to escape, nor even cut a clear path forward, on the single biggest issue facing the country. Brexit hung like a metaphorical cloud over the conference, weighing it down alongside the decidedly non-metaphorical rain that lashed the seaside resort of Brighton where this year's gathering is wrapping up.That's a big problem. Because if it were to come to power, Labour's entire future in government would be framed by Brexit -- not least because of the economic shock that the rupture is predicted to bring.Divisions over the issue -- as well as more personal feuds that have simmered ever since veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn rose from the margins of the party to become leader in 2015 -- seemed set to tear Labour apart, just as it laid out its bid to become Britain's next government.JUST WATCHEDJeremy Corbyn: Anti-establishment and unconventionalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJeremy Corbyn: Anti-establishment and unconventional 03:18Before a conference debate on Brexit even got underway, an extraordinary attempt emerged to unseat the elected deputy leader of the party, Tom Watson, who has clashed bitterly with Corbyn over the party's struggles with anti-Semitism. The audacious plot -- which involved a procedural effort to abolish the role of deputy leader -- was launched by Jon Lansman, founder of the Momentum group, the grassroots caucus that swept Corbyn to power. Watson, himself an expert in party machinations, found out about the moves just in time to be able to mobilize a successful rearguard action.But the wounds from what Watson described as a \"drive-by shooting\" seeped into the opening days of the conference. And if that wasn't bad enough, Corbyn's chief policy aide Andrew Fisher announced his intention to resign, accusing the party's leadership of engaging in \"class war,\" according to a memo leaked to the Sunday Times newspaper.It was almost as if the party didn't want to win an election. \"We must resist the destructive, corrosive impulse of factionalism,\" Watson said at an event Sunday. \"I honestly think that there is a battle for the future of the Labour Party.\"Labour deputy leader Tom Watson speaks to the media at the conference in Brighton.When delegates came to debate the party's stance on Brexit -- with grassroots members determined to force the leadership into a more full-throated anti-Brexit position -- the mood matched the storms brewing outside.Even the vote was controversial. On a show of hands, it seemed hard to call, but the conference chairwoman refused to allow a tabulated vote. Corbyn's position to promise voters a second Brexit referendum -- but not to reveal what the party's position in that referendum would be until after a general election -- was officially endorsed.It may be that this calculation to sit on the fence is the only thing holding Labour together -- stitching a fine line between Corbyn's longtime Euroskepticism and the desire of many within the party for Britain to remain in the European Union. But it probably doesn't do much in terms of Labour's appeal to voters. British voters are more entrenched in their Brexit positions than ever. They either want to get Brexit done as quickly as possible, or cancel it altogether. Labour appears stuck somewhere in the murky middle, risking losing its vote share to the Brexiteer Conservative party on one side and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats on the other.As shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry aptly put it -- Labour now finds itself trapped in a sort of \"Star Wars\" crusher, the walls closing in on either side.Labour shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry delivers a speech at the conference.How lucky for Labour, then, that events dramatically intervened to pull the focus elsewhere. On Tuesday, in what will go down as a landmark moment in British history, the UK Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's lengthy suspension of Parliament, just weeks before the Brexit deadline, was unlawful. As news of the ruling rippled through the conference hall, Labour members chanted \"Johnson out! Johnson out!\"Corbyn leapt to his feet, and, in front of the cheering crowd, said that the government had demonstrated \"contempt for democracy and an abuse of power,\" calling on Johnson to resign.The suspension of UK Parliament has been ruled unlawful. Here's what happens nextTo an outside observer, watching the chanting of \"Oh, Jeremy Corbyn,\" that followed, this felt like an open goal for Labour.  But the stark reality is that, according to the most recent polling, Corbyn has a negative approval rating of minus 60 points -- making him the least popular of any opposition leader on record -- and support for his party is stuck in the mid-20s, well short of the level required to win a majority in the UK Parliament.The poll numbers reflect, among other things, concerns about how Corbyn has handled Brexit, and questions about how the party might pay for some of its bold proposals.\"It is a bubble of delusion really,\" said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. \"To lay out all these jam-tomorrow promises, when you are polling in the mid-20s and your leader is the most unpopular opposition leader we have ever seen in this country, does seem ... let's say a little ambitious or far-fetched.\"Jeremy Corbyn, with members of his shadow cabinet, on stage following his keynote speech Tuesday.There's also the economic risk that Brexit poses. \"If Brexit does occur, all economic forecasts suggest it will actually depress the GDP of the UK and therefore there will be less money than there is now available for Labour's spending pledges,\" Bale added.Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, however, many Labour MPs and members of the shadow Cabinet were reluctant to burst the bubble.Whether it was shadow business minister Laura Pidcock hailing the party's roll-out of a workers' protection agency, shadow early years minister Tracy Brabin vowing to close the disadvantage gap by scrapping \"tax loopholes\" for private schools, or shadow chancellor John McDonnell backing a 32-hour week with no loss in pay, the message was: \"no more tinkering around the edges.\" It felt as though anything was possible.How long can Boris Johnson cling onto power for?And their proposals -- from economic redistribution of wealth, to a fundamental shift back to central government control -- are policies that command wide support in the Labour movement. But there was also a palpable sense of fear that the opportunity to enact these radical policies could be blown apart by the deep divisions within the party.Delivering what felt like a sermon to a fringe event in a former church on Monday night, former Labour leader Ed Miliband urged the crowd to remember what they were fighting for and to seek common ground.\"I want radicalism without sectarianism,\" said Miliband. \"The irony of the situation we're in ... you've got people right across the Labour Party putting out incredibly exciting ideas and open thinking, if only we recognized how much we have in common.\"It does actually say that on our membership card... and we have to remember that as a party.",

The 32-year-old took legal action after a registrar told him that UK law required people who give birth to be registered as mothers on birth certificates.  This establishes the first legal definition of the term \"mother\" in English common law.In ruling with the government, Andrew McFarlane, the president of the High Court's family division, deemed that being a \"mother\" referred to being pregnant and giving birth, regardless of whether that person, in law, was a man or a woman.I'm saddened by the court's decision not to allow trans men to be recorded as father or parent on their children's birth certificates.

Whilst that person's gender is 'male,' their parental status, which derives from their biological role in giving birth, is that of 'mother.'\"McConnell, a multimedia journalist for UK newspaper The Guardian, started taking testosterone aged 25 and a year later had surgery to remove breast tissue.

Existing legislation and UK and European human rights case law, McFarlane said, did not directly engage with the central question. McFarlane ruled: \"The issue which has most properly and bravely been raised by the claimant in this claim is, at its core, a matter of public policy rather than law. It is an important matter of public interest and a proper cause for public debate.\" In July 2019, McFarlane had removed McConnell's right to anonymity after UK media organizations successfully argued that the publicity surrounding McConnell's film and the public interest in the question of how the state recognized parenthood meant his identity should be known.",

In these early days, according to Young, it was elite universities that were the most enthusiastic adopters of rugby and an All-American team was formed at the start of the 20th century. A narrow loss to Australia in 1912 stirred a developing love for the game, but ambitions were quashed as a 13-try rout by New Zealand soon followed. \"The only conclusion is that we have not yet learned how to play rugby,\" the San Francisco Post lamented at the time. \"It is still a foreign game.\"In 1920, the American Professional Football Association -- later known as the National Football League -- was founded with 10 teams from four different states.       The league provided structure for player recruitment and development as it took its nascent steps towards the multi-billion dollar behemoth that the NFL is today.By contrast, rugby remained amateur. A team representing the USA won Olympic golds at the 1920 and 1924 Games, beating France on both occasions. That, however, was the last time -- until the inclusion of sevens in 2016 -- that rugby was included on the Olympic roster. It would also be USA's final test match for another 52 years.READ: Samoa escapes double red card as it rallies to win against Russia\"American culture has always valued context,\" says Young, who is British and previously served as the general manager of the Rugby World Cup for the 2003, 2007 and 2011 tournaments.\"Global prestige, the chance to make your fortune, these are the things that motivate Americans.

I don't agree with the verdict.\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson arriving back at Downing Street after attending the United Nations General Assembly.While Bercow confirmed that there won't be Prime Minister's Questions, which normally takes place on Wednesdays -- where Johnson could have faced a grilling -- he said there was \"scope\" for urgent questions, ministerial statements and emergency debate applications.Read MoreAttorney General Geoffrey Cox began proceedings on Wednesday by defending Johnson's suspension -- which was done on the advice by Cox himself. He then launched a furious and animated tirade at lawmakers, calling Parliament a \"disgrace\" and \"dead.\"\"They could vote no confidence at any time, but they're too cowardly.

        "content": "(CNN)Australian rugby star Reece Hodge has been given a three-match ban for a dangerous tackle during his team's World Cup victory over Fiji.An independent disciplinary committee in Japan ruled Hodge's tackle on Peceli Yato should have warranted a red card for \"an act of foul play,\" though the Australian escaped on-field punishment at the time.Yato had earlier scored the opening try of the Pool D clash but later had to be substituted after failing a Head Injury Assessment (HIA) following the tackle.At the time, match referee Ben O'Keeffe and video referee (TMO) Rowan Kitt ruled the tackle was legal.Reece Hodge has been banned for three games for a high tackle.READ: Uruguay beats Fiji to win first Rugby World Cup game for 16 yearsRead MoreREAD: Samoa escapes double red card as it rallies to win against RussiaHodge's ban comes a day after World Rugby, the sport's governing body, openly criticized the standard of refereeing so far at the tournament, saying: \"The match officials team recognize that performances over the opening weekend of Rugby World Cup 2019 were not consistently of the standards set by World Rugby and themselves.\"The committee concluded that Hodge's tackle constituted foul play -- though reckless, rather than deliberate -- as there was contact with Yato's head and a high degree of danger.The minimum ban for such an incident is six games but the committee \"acknowledged Hodge's exemplary disciplinary record, good character and conduct at the hearing,\" meaning his ban was reduced to three games.Hodge will now miss Australia's remaining Pool D matches against Wales, Uruguay and Georgia but will be available for selection should the Wallabies reach the quarterfinals.The 25-year-old has 48 hours to appeal the decision.",
