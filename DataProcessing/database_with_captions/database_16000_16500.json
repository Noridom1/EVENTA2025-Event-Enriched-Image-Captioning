The fan experience has been as lively and colorful as ever, with attendance levels peaking at several venues as sevens continues to stretch to all corners of the globe.Las Vegas welcomed 80,691 fans across the three days -- the seventh consecutive year a record crowd has been recorded. And, in just its second year hosting sevens, it is estimated that 76,000 watched in Vancouver, up from 60,000 the previous year. Hong Kong, meanwhile, the world's biggest and most iconic sevens host, regularly attracts 120,000 visitors.READ: South Africa crowned sevens Champions in ParisRead MoreThis year, 733,000 are thought to have watched the World Series at its 10 locations; by way of comparison, 458,000 spectated the 2009-10 season. This growth owes not only to the feast of games on the pitch, but also the culture off it -- fancy dress and fan entertainment has long been a staple of sevens.Which begs the question...

Go to a tournament, and expect to see upward of 20 rugby games. \"I prefer sevens to the 15-aside game,\" said Wayne, 42, a South Africa fan at the London sevens. \"It's quick, you get to watch more games, and it's just more enjoyable -- a much faster sport.

I'm loving it, it's a great day out.\"Sarah, 28, confessed to not being a rugby fan, but regardless embraced the sevens spirit of fancy dress.\"It's my first time at the sevens. To be honest, I didn't really know what I signed up for -- I was just told that I'd dress as a whoopee cushions and have a fun day out. Which it has been, so i don't have any complaints.\"READ: Fiji rules in Hong Kong... againThe party atmosphere of the sevens has had its drawbacks. A few years ago, London introduced restrictions on alcohol and also stopped pushing a fancy dress theme as it had done in the past.In Wellington in 2014, around 270 spectators were removed from the Westpac Stadium for alcohol-related issues and 20 arrests were made. Organizers recently took the decision to move the New Zealand tournament North to Hamilton. Tickets used to regularly sell out for the Wellington event, but the clampdown on unruly behavior has seen ticket sales dwindle. This year, fewer than 15,000 tickets were sold in a venue with a capacity of 34,500.South Africa's season -- but trouble ahead?On the pitch, there were hints of a power shift.It was the first time neither 12-time winner New Zealand nor Olympic champion Fiji had featured in the top two spots of the overall standings, while South Africa -- dubbed the \"bridesmaids\" of the sport after four-straight seasons as runner-up -- set a hot pace at the front of the pack.

We need to kick on and work on what will make us successful in the future.\"But future success for the Blitzboks might rely on player retention. It's not uncommon to see stars from the sevens circuit snapped up by fifteen-aside teams. This season saw Powell's star man from the opening rounds -- Seabelo Senatla -- sign for South African Super Rugby side the Stormers. Powell says he is hopeful key players can be retained, but accepts that losing certain individuals is part of the way sevens has evolved. \"It's the reality, it's definitely the reality,\" he said. \"But most of our guys are signed up for another year. We should have all their services next year and then we'll have to renegotiate it then.

        "content": "(CNN)People in Britain are heading to the polls for a snap election, just two years after the last vote, and hot on the heels of the Brexit and Scottish independence referendums.While Brexit remains a core concern for voters, traditional issues such as the economy, immigration and healthcare have dominated.Here's how the UK stacks up against the rest of the world:ECONOMYThe economy is one of the issues British voters care most about, according to the UK polling service YouGov -- and it's at the center of the main parties' campaign rhetoric.Read More     The UK's economy -- the world's fifth-largest -- grew by only 1.9% in 2016, according to the UK's Office for National Statistics. But with departure from the EU looming, financial uncertainty abounds: investments are on hold, some companies have said they will move thousands of jobs out of the UK, and retail spending is low. For ordinary Britons, financial insecurity has been felt by poor wage increases and job insecurity for the last decade.As unemployment levels have dropped, wages have stagnated. The numbers of people on controversial zero-hours contracts (which don't guarantee any job security, benefits, or workers' rights) and short-hours contracts (which guarantee as little as one hour's work a month) have risen, according to the ONS. Nearly a million people in Britain were on zero-hours contracts by the end of 2016, according to the ONS -- a 13% surge on the previous year. The Labour party has promised to end zero-hours contracts and unpaid internships if elected in; Theresa May's Conservative party says it will \"review\" the practice. Read: Who is Jeremy Corbyn?There are more jobs on the books, and unemployment is at its lowest level in four decades, but many British workers are still facing a precarious balancing act to make ends meet. And to make it worse, income inequality is on the rise.     ONS figures show there has been a gradual decrease in income inequality in the UK over the last decade, but state benefits and tax credits are papering over the cracks. In real terms, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer -- though this is by no means unique to the UK.Income inequality in the world's richest countries is at its highest level in decades, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).IMMIGRATION Immigration is one of the issues that shaped the Brexit debate, a key subject in many parties' political manifestos and a daily topic of conversation in the UK.      Theresa May has vowed to cut net migration down to the tens of thousands, double the amount companies must pay to hire workers from countries outside the EU and raise the financial threshold required for British citizens who want to bring their non-EU spouses and families to live with them (currently set at \u00a318,600).Labour says it will scrap many of those policies, but there's at least one thing they can agree on: after Brexit, the free movement of people between EU countries and the UK will have to end.      More than a million migrants and refugees arrived in Europe in 2015, but since then many countries have begun tightening their immigration rules -- even as the fallout from war and bloodshed in the Middle East and Africa escalates. At least 70,877 refugees and migrants have arrived on Europe's shores since the beginning of 2017, according to the UN refugee agency. More than five million Syrians have fled their homeland since the start of the conflict in 2011. Many British voters have worried about an influx of Syrian refugees, but the UK is nowhere near resettling the number of people they promised to bring in by 2020, under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement Programme. So far, 7,307 of the 20,000 Syrians the UK said it would help have been given refuge. The Conservatives have promised to reduce asylum claims even further if they are re-elected in June.Analysis: Theresa May's UK election slogan backfiresLabour has stressed the difference between refugees and economic migrants, pledging that that they will not \"scapegoat migrants nor blame them for economic failures\" and promised to \"uphold the proud British tradition of honouring the spirit of international law and our moral obligations by taking our fair share of refugees.\"Germany resettled 158,657 Syrians in 2015 and 266,250 in 2016, according to the Federal bureau for Migration and Refugees. Canada welcomed 25,000 between 2015-2016. The US admitted just 1,900 Syrian refugees in the first four years of that country's conflict, although it took 12,486 in 2016, surpassing its original 10,000 commitment.HEALTHHealthcare is a top issue for many voters, and that's no surprise -- the UK's flagship public health system, the National Health Service (NHS), has been facing serious financial problems for years. The system, which is funded through tax and compulsory national insurance contributions, delivers free healthcare to anyone who needs it, across the UK.      The number of family doctors has barely increased in a decade -- but it's not all bad news for the sick and injured. Hospitals have seen an increase of around 20,000 doctors since 2006, according to the National Health Service.But with a growing, aging population, and cuts to health and social care budgets, a perfect storm of problems for an already overstressed and underfunded NHS continues to brew.  If elected, May's Conservative party has pledged to increase government spending on the NHS by a minimum of \u00a38 billion ($10.36 billion) over the next five years - but hasn't said where it will come from.      Globally, the UK spends about as much as the Canadians, who also have a government-run national health service.EDUCATIONAround 44% of British people have graduated from higher education -- in line with many countries with similar socioeconomic backgrounds.      Jeremy Corbyn believes higher education is a positive tool for increasing social mobility, and his Labour Party has promised to abolish tuition fees for university students. It says it will pay for education from general taxation. Read: Can left-wing populism win the UK election?May's vision for education is more traditional: she wants to bring back selective grammar schools and increase the number of free schools. Critics argue that May's plans to raise university tuition fees to pay for non-government-funded schools will perpetuate a cycle of inequality. HOUSINGBuying a house in the UK has never been more difficult -- especially for first-time buyers. Even renting has proved difficult for many in recent years.     Although housebuilding has slowly risen from its lowest level in 2010, construction on new builds remains at historical lows. Homelessness is also on the rise. Both the Conservatives and Labour have pledged to build a million affordable homes over the course of the next parliament (by 2022).CRIMEThe UK records far fewer homicides than many of its European neighbors.  But an epidemic of knife crime, particularly among young people in large cities, has been rising steadily in recent years. In 2016, 16,747 people in England and Wales were assaulted with a knife, according to ONS figures.     By contrast, gun crime is of little concern to most British voters: strict laws banning the sale and ownership of handguns have been in force since 1997, and shotguns and rifles require police-issued licenses. Across the pond, Americans carry more guns per capita than any other country in the world. Our calculations based on OECD data show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by gunfire than in the United Kingdom. ENVIRONMENTThe UK is one of 147 countries to have ratified the Paris Agreement, a landmark deal that asks every country to reduce their greenhouse emissions and hailed by then-US President Barack Obama as \"a turning point for the world.\" On Thursday, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris accord.     Globally, the UK ranks far below the worst polluters, China and the US. The UK is halfway to its 2050 target -- to reduce greenhouse gases by 80% from 1990 levels.Although the Conservative Party says it will continue to \"lead the world in environmental protection,\" May's commitment to the environment isn't clear.In one of her first acts as Prime Minister, she closed the Department of Energy and Climate Change -- folding it into the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.May has also supported fracking, a controversial oil and gas production technique that comes with serious environmental risks including earthquakes and water contamination.When it comes to air pollution levels, the UK -- along with Germany, France, Spain and Italy -- still have work to do, according to the European Commission, which sent them final warnings for breaching permitted levels of potentially deadly nitrogen dioxide.",

        "content": "London (CNN)It was meant to be the most predictable of election campaigns. A British Prime Minister with a comfortable lead in the polls calling an early election to strengthen her mandate to negotiate Brexit, up against a supposedly weak opposition leader from the unfashionable far left of his party.Can left-wing populism win the UK election?But with a week to go before the UK election, Theresa May's position is looking less than secure. Under her opponent Jeremy Corbyn, Labour is closing the gap in the opinion polls behind May's Conservative Party. His manifesto -- a raft of leftwing policies with renationalization of industry at their core -- has been well received by voters. Stories about Corbyn's past support for the Irish Republican Army and Hamas are failing to inflict serious damage. And in the wake of last week's suicide bombing in Manchester, the Labour leader's perceived weakness on security and counter-terrorism don't seem to have damaged him in the court of public opinion.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses supporters during a campaign event in Birmingham in May.At the start of the campaign in April, the Prime Minister set down a narrative that the June 8 election was a choice between her \"strong and stable\" leadership that would deliver a successful Brexit, and Corbyn's far-left brand of Labour. It is still highly likely that May will win next Thursday. But as the campaign enters the final stages, it is remarkable how Corbyn has managed to change the narrative and turn the election into a competitive fight.This shift has been achieved, say commentators, in part because Corbyn does not behave like an ordinary politician. While other party leaders adapt their policies to the changing times, his views -- including opposition to Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, and in favor of higher taxes on the rich to pay for healthcare and schools -- have not changed in more than 30 years.From trade unionist to politicianRead MoreCorbyn was raised in rural Shropshire in central England and was educated at a local grammar school before studying at a North London college, from where he left after one year, failing to finish a degree. After working for a number of trade unions he got his first break in politics at the age of 25 when he was elected to a council seat in Haringey, a borough in north London. Nine years later he became Labour MP for the London seat of Islington North, at the same time Tony Blair entered Parliament. Their career paths could not have been more different: while Blair rose through the Labour Party to become its leader in 1994 and prime minister in 1997, Corbyn remained a backbench MP, rebelling against Blair in hundreds of votes in the House of Commons and most prominently as a vocal critic of the Iraq war. Corbyn (center) marches with demonstrating steelworkers in London in 2016. It was after Labour's second electoral defeat in a row, in 2015, that Corbyn's name was put forward for the leadership contest as a \"token\" leftwinger, but was at first not taken seriously. He went on to win with nearly 60% of the vote.In the same way Bernie Sanders experienced an insurgent tide of popularity from younger voters, 68-year-old Corbyn is most popular among 18-34 year-olds. Read: Britain's young voters are angry, not apatheticThe success of Corbyn's anti-establishment pitch -- he saw off a challenge from the party's centrists in 2016 -- may also invite comparisons with the US president. Like Donald Trump, the Labour leader is prone to outbursts of tetchy, erratic and stubborn behavior. Corbyn at his home in London in last year. By coincidence, Trump and Corbyn have each been married three times. Yet the similarities perhaps end there: Corbyn has the unassuming manner and bearing of a high school science teacher and likes to spend his weekends on his community garden plot, not playing a round of golf in a lavish hotel resort.\"There is a certain freshness about the Corbyn campaign which is attractive to people who are fed up with the staleness and tiredness of political discourse,\" says Tom Baldwin, who was director of communications for the previous Labour leader Ed Miliband at the 2015 election. \"Corbyn himself doesn't look scared in interviews. He doesn't look scared of being found out.\"\"He has a really thick skin and he is very comfortable in it. As such there is an 'x-factor' to him which it would be churlish not to acknowledge.\"Race to the finishOn Monday evening, during a Sky News/Channel 4 program in which Corbyn and May were grilled by a studio audience and rottweiler interviewer Jeremy Paxman (separately, because the PM has refused to take part in a TV leaders debate), the Labour leader laughed off critical questioning and held his own. The Prime Minister, by comparison, appeared rattled by tough questions. Corbyn answers questions from a studio audience during a televised debate, \"May v Corbyn Live: The Battle for Number 10\" in London this week.Yet Corbyn's thick skin showed signs of vulnerability on Tuesday morning when, in an interview for BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, he sounded flustered as he failed to answer a crucial question of how much Labour's plan to offer free childcare from the age of two would cost. This incident highlighted two major weaknesses of the Labour leader: that his agenda will cost taxpayers a lot of money, and that his circle of advisers lack the experience and professionalism to have ensured Corbyn had the right figures in front of him.This shaky grasp of figures can cut through to the opinion polls. So far, the Conservatives' lead has steadily narrowed since May called the election. Six polls taken since the Manchester attack showed a gap of between five and 12 points, down from between 15 and 20 points two weeks ago.Analysis: Theresa May's UK election slogan backfiresIn the past two weeks, newspapers have highlighted Corbyn's links to the IRA and Hamas, including his appearances at events commemorating both organizations. But voters appear to be unmoved.Baldwin says Corbyn has benefited from an absence of the kind of intense scrutiny normally applied to potential prime ministers because, unlike Miliband in 2015, \"at the start of this campaign everyone thought Corbyn had a cat in hell's chance of winning\". Opponents had not really had a chance to hone their attacks on Corbyn until now, he added.Corbyn stands next to British Prime Minister Theresa May at the annual Remembrance Sunday Service in London last year. But according to Baldwin, the narrowing in the polls is more as a result of failings in the Conservative campaign, including pinning so much on May as a \"strong and stable\" leader, which backfired because she was forced to perform a u-turn over a major policy on funding for elderly care. There has also been little effect in the polls from her position as an authoritarian, security-minded prime minister in the wake of Manchester.\"The Tories have been running a terrible campaign - that is the single most important factor in this election so far,\" says Baldwin. \"They dropped the ball and it is very difficult to turn their line around. They have tried to make this all about her and have managed to tarnish her brand in the course of three weeks.\" Now it is Corbyn, in his refusal to budge from his old fashioned brand of leftwing politics -- and perhaps because expectations of him, as the underdog, were already low -- who now appears to represent stability.While it remains unlikely he will be prime minister next week, the Labour leader has turned the most predictable election in recent British political history into an unexpectedly dramatic race to the finish.",

The crowd of 127,621 that watch Real Madrid beat Eintracht Frankfurt 7-3 on a windy day in Glasgow is treated to football in its highest form, with then Scotsman football reporter Hugh McIlvanney writing of a \"strange emotionalism\" overcoming those in attendance.  The Germans are no pushovers -- beating Rangers 12-4 on aggregate in the semifinals -- but that only adds to the majesty of Real's win, with Puskas and Di St\u00e9fano scoring all seven goals between them.Star playerDi St\u00e9fano.

The so-called \"reluctant genius\" goes on to guide the Reds to 20 trophies in nine seasons, playing a free-flowing 4-4-2 with flying wingers and a succession of prolific center forwards, from Kevin Keegan to Ian Rush.

Leo Varadkar, the 38-year-old Minister for Social Protection, was elected leader of the ruling Fine Gael party on Friday. He will be confirmed as Taoiseach, or prime minister, when the Irish parliament reconvenes on June 13.The outgoing Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, stepped down as party leader in May, a position he held since 2002.Varadkar's sole opponent, Housing Minister Simon Coveney, whose roots in the party run deep, won the backing of nearly two-thirds of the party's regular members. But in the system for electing Fine Gael's leader, their votes only made up 25% of the total. Varadkar was backed by a majority of the Fine Gael's local council members and, crucially, 51 of its 73 parliamentary colleagues, whose votes counted for 65% of the total. Read MoreVaradkar said he was \"delighted and humbled\" at the result.Read: Who is Leo Varadkar?Varadkar, the son of an Indian-born father and Irish mother, became a doctor before first entering Irish parliament at the age of 27. In 2015, as Minister of Health, Varadkar came out on Irish national radio, joining a handful of other openly gay politicians in Ireland in support of the Marriage Equality Bill, which allows same sex couples to marry. Varadkar might seem to be an unexpected pick for leader of Ireland -- a country that's still finding its secular European footing after years of church influence over the state. But Varadkar's policies signal a sharp move towards the right.Ireland's futureIn his leadership campaign, \"Taking Ireland Forward,\" Varadkar's fiscally conservative politics took center stage. He fiercely campaigned against benefit fraud with the slogan \"welfare cheats cheat us all.\" He pledged to invest in large infrastructure projects, reform tax laws for the self-employed and has proposed to ban \"essential\" public workers from going on strike.Varadkar smiles at supporters during the launch of his leadership campaign, \"Campaign for Leo,\" in May.  Varadkar also promised to represent the \"people who get up early in the morning,\" in an effort to harness the support of Ireland's rural farmers, the middle class and elderly -- rhetoric that critics say both alienates and demonizes a large chunk of Ireland's casual workforce, who have been hit by increased austerity measures. He has also pledged to hold a referendum on abortion in 2018.Varadkar is expected to officially take up the role as Taoiseach on June 13 after a formal confirmation from parliamentary members.",

The wedding of Etienne Cardiles and the late Xavier Jugel\u00e9 was held in the town hall of the 14th arrondissement in Paris on Tuesday. Mayor Anne Hidalgo and former President Francois Hollande attended the ceremony, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Jugel\u00e9 was shot dead by an ISIS-inspired attacker on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es shortly before the French election. Cardiles delivered an emotional tribute to his partner at police headquarters following the attack.\"When the first messages were issued informing Parisians that a serious event was taking place on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and that a policeman had lost his life, a little voice inside told me that it was you,\" Cardiles said. Cardiles (L) shakes hands with then-candidate Emmanuel Macron at a ceremony for Jugel\u00e9 in April. Addressing Jugel\u00e9's killer during the eulogy, Cardiles said: \"You will not have my hatred.\"Read More\"This hatred, Xavier, I don't have it because it is not like you. Because it does not correspond to anything that made your heart beat, nor why you entered the police force,\" Cardiles said.\"Because public service, helping others and protecting everyone was part of your education and your convictions. And tolerance, dialogue and patience were your strongest weapons.\"Cardiles could not be reached for comment.Jugel\u00e9 was a dedicated LGBT activist and had twice volunteered in Greece, aiding migrants, BFMTV reported.In April, shortly after his death, Jugel\u00e9 was awarded the Legion of Honor, one of France's highest honors.  What is a posthumous wedding? Posthumous marriage is legal in France, under Article 171 of the country's civil code, according to the French government's website, though it rarely occurs. Applicants are required to demonstrate sufficiently serious grounds and to establish the deceased's willingness to be married.  Permission is granted at the discretion of the French President and was given by then-President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande before he left office. France isn't the only country to have such a practice. A variation of posthumous marriage is practiced occasionally in China, where \"ghost marriages\" can be arranged for the deceased, with partners living or dead. In his April eulogy for Jugel\u00e9, Cardiles reflected on the life they had led together. \"A life of joy and laughter, in which love and tolerance were your uncontested masters,\" he said. \"You lived like a star, you leave like a star.\"Matou Diop contributed to this report from Paris.",

        "content": "Story highlightsSame two teams are meeting in the NBA Finals for third straight seasonFirst championship rubber match in any North American professional team sportWarriors lead this year's best-of-seven Finals series 1-0 (CNN)This NBA Finals is in uncharted territory.For the third consecutive year, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors are facing off with the title on the line. The Cavaliers, who in 2016 ended a sports title drought the city of Cleveland had been living under since 1964, are aiming to repeat. The Warriors, who won the title in 2015, are out for revenge.This is the first time in NBA history that the same two teams are meeting in the NBA Finals for three straight seasons. To take it further, never has there been a championship \"rubber match\" -- the third installment between two teams that would break the tie -- in any other North American professional team sport. Until now.This trilogy, which is scheduled to end in mid-June, will leave either Golden State or Cleveland with bragging rights.JUST WATCHEDLeBron James' home painted with racist graffitiReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLeBron James' home painted with racist graffiti 01:21\"It's definitely unique,\" Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue said. \"It's nothing you can take for granted. Even though we have the best player in the world (LeBron James) on our team, you still can't take it for granted. Health plays a part, a lot of things play a part in this. So going to The Finals three straight years, you have to enjoy it. You have to relish the moment.Read More\"But now that we are here, we have business to take care of.\"How rare is it for the same two teams to meet three years in a row with a championship on the line? It's only happened once in each of the other major North American professional sports -- and the last instance was more than half a century ago, when the Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens battled for the Stanley Cup from 1954-1956. The Red Wings won the first two Cups, while Montreal hoisted the third.In the NFL -- before the Super Bowl era began -- the Detroit Lions topped the Cleveland Browns in 1952 and 1953, with the Browns getting retribution in 1954.You have to go back even further for a Major League Baseball trilogy, and it all took place in New York City. The New York Giants got the best of the New York Yankees in back-to-back seasons, winning the World Series in 1921 and 1922. Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersFor the third straight season, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors meet in the NBA Finals. Who will be the difference in this much-anticipated rubber match? Both teams are stacked with talent. Here are the projected starting lineups, which include seven All-Stars.Hide Caption 1 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersLeBron James, Cleveland, forwardIs \"King James\" the greatest of all time? Maybe he hasn't reached Michael Jordan's level just yet, but he's certainly entered the conversation. He put his hometown team on his back last year as the Cavs rallied from a 3-1 series deficit to win in a dramatic Game 7. It was his first title with Cleveland and the third of his career after winning two in Miami. Perhaps even more amazing is that he's been to seven straight NBA Finals. James led the Cavs in points, assists and steals this season.Hide Caption 2 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersKevin Durant, Golden State, forwardDurant is the newest face of this modern-day rivalry, as he signed with the Warriors in July after nearly a decade with Oklahoma City. He's been one of the league's marquee players for years, winning four scoring titles and a league MVP award, but he's still looking for his first championship. Some have criticized him for joining his former rivals to get that elusive title, but he says he has no regrets.Hide Caption 3 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersKyrie Irving, Cleveland, guardA fractured kneecap knocked Irving out of the playoffs in 2015, so he missed the first time the Cavs and the Warriors faced off in the Finals. He returned in 2016 and played a crucial role, hitting this 3-pointer that lifted Cleveland to victory in the deciding Game 7. Irving, a four-time All-Star, is second on his team in points, assists and steals.Hide Caption 4 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersStephen Curry, Golden State, guardCurry has been the face of the Warriors during their transition from league cellar-dweller to world champions. He was the league's MVP in 2015 and 2016, and even with the addition of Durant he remains Golden State's leading scorer. Many call him the best 3-point shooter in the game today -- some think he's the best ever. But Curry is more than just an outside threat. He can also get to the basket and defend. He led the NBA in steals last season.Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersKevin Love, Cleveland, forwardLove is the third All-Star in Cleveland's starting lineup. He led the team in rebounds this season and finished eighth in the league in rebounds per game. He is also the team's third-leading scorer, capable of scoring around the rim or behind the 3-point arc.Hide Caption 6 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersDraymond Green, Golden State, forwardGreen is one of the league's best defensive players, making two All-Star teams and leading the league in steals this season. He is the prototypical \"glue guy\" who does a little bit of everything, and he provides the team with a fiery, physical presence. But sometimes his emotions can work against him. He was suspended for Game 5 of last year's Finals after his fourth flagrant foul of the postseason. The Warriors lost that game as well as the next two.Hide Caption 7 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersTristan Thompson, Cleveland, centerThompson holds down the paint for the Cavs, giving them offensive rebounds and blocks. He is not expected to score like the rest of the starting lineup, but he can chip in there, too. He has been a dependable player for the Cavs, playing 447 consecutive games -- a franchise record -- until spraining his thumb earlier this season.Hide Caption 8 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersKlay Thompson, Golden State, guardGolden State's Thompson is a much different player than Cleveland's Thompson. While Tristan does his work inside, Klay's doing his on the perimeter. Klay won this year's 3-point shootout during NBA All-Star Weekend, and in 2014 he and fellow \"Splash Brother\" Stephen Curry combined for a league record in 3-pointers made. Thompson is a three-time NBA All-Star, and he was one of four Warriors on this year's All-Star team.Hide Caption 9 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersJ.R. Smith, Cleveland, guardYou never quite know what to expect from Smith, a mercurial shooting guard with a penchant for hitting clutch shots. He can heat up quickly, but he's also been prone to shooting slumps. He missed half the season with a fractured thumb.Hide Caption 10 of 11 Photos: NBA Finals: The key playersZaza Pachulia, Golden State, centerPachulia, a journeyman playing on his fifth NBA team in 14 seasons, is the only Warriors starter who is not an All-Star. This is his Finals debut, having signed with Golden State during the offseason. He will share minutes with JaVale McGee at the center position.Hide Caption 11 of 11But in 1923, the Yankees, playing their home games in the original, brand-new Yankee Stadium, got the best of the Giants, winning the World Series in six games. That Yankees' roster was packed with Hall of Famers Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Waite Hoyt and Herb Pennock.Which brings this back to present day. Unbelievably, this already-loaded Warriors' roster from last year -- led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green -- got better by adding superstar Kevin Durant. He's seeking his first title and is second for the Warriors in scoring with 25.2 points per game this postseason.\"I can't go out there and do everything on my own, or I can't go out there and just let my teammates do all the work for me,\" Durant said. \"I got to do my part and we all got to make it come together as a group.\"The Warriors also have a likely healthier Curry, their leading scorer. In the first round of the 2016 playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Curry suffered a sprained MCL, and he didn't look like himself in the NBA Finals.JUST WATCHEDNBA star says he was detained overseasReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNBA star says he was detained overseas 01:20Ahead of this year's series, Curry says he has some swelling in his right elbow and will probably wear a shooting sleeve. But he has downplayed it, saying that the elbow doesn't hurt and that he feels \"totally different\" physically heading into this year's NBA Finals compared to 2016.\"Obviously not really dealing with any bumps or bruises really besides this elbow, that's not really a factor,\" Curry said. \"So other than that, feeling fresh.\"Like the Warriors, the Cavaliers enter this year's Finals healthy. For the third time in a row, they aren't favored, but they have a deep bench and several great 3-point shooters. When those shots are falling, it opens things up for James, giving him the option to drive to the basket or post up.In 2015, James carried the Cavaliers on his back when Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injuries. James again led the way in 2016, but he had their help, including Irving's dagger three to close out Game 7.James, who took home NBA Finals MVP honors last year, is the only non-Boston Celtic to reach the NBA Finals seven years in a row, that in its own a massive feat. He's going for his fourth title.JUST WATCHED5 stunning stats about the NBAReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH5 stunning stats about the NBA 01:47\"I don't like to be satisfied too much,\" James said. \"Because then you become complacent. But it was a reward because when you set out a goal and you're able to achieve that reward or achieve that goal, like all of us, then it's rewarding and you feel good about it.\"\"But I'm not a complacent person. After we were able to accomplish that last year and we celebrated for a few days, I got right back to work, mentally and physically get my body ready because I wanted to be able to put myself and put our teammates and put our franchise in position where we had an opportunity to do it again.\"The Warriors are 12-0 in these playoffs, becoming the first NBA team to accomplish the feat, and the Cavaliers are 12-1. The NBA hasn't had a championship series in which both teams reached The Finals with one loss or fewer in the playoffs since the 1950s, when teams played far fewer postseason games before The Finals.It's tough to get more even than this. And with these star-studded teams, this may not be over even after this NBA Finals \"tiebreaker.\" Could these teams return in 2018? Right now, the way the league is constructed, it just might happen.",

This once-proud team nestled in the luxurious Cote D'Azur boasts such luminary alumnus as Zinedine Zidane, Arsene Wenger and Patrick Vieira.Follow @cnnsport\n\n Zidane, who will manage Real Madrid in its second consecutive Champions League Final on Saturday -- the Spanish side play one of the Frenchman's old clubs Juventus -- left his hometown of Marseille at the age of 15 to become a Cannes youth academy recruit. He was recommended to Cannes AS by Jean Varraud, who Zidane credits as being a key influence on his development, so much so that he attended his mentor's funeral when he died in 2006.Read MoreBy the 1991-1992 season, the 19-year-old midfield magician had guided Cannes to an impressive fourth place finish in Ligue 1 and a berth in the coveted UEFA Cup. \"It feels like a dream,\" says longtime AS Cannes fan Emmanuel Fagart, as he walks around the unremarkable grounds of the Stade Pierre de Coubertin, which sits in the relatively unglamorous Cannes La Bocca section of town. It's a world away from the red carpet of the recent Cannes Film Festival.\"Now it is impossible to see such a small club play in European competition, unfortunately.\"READ: Bale's bitter-sweet homecomingREAD: Buffon ventures into wine businessJUST WATCHEDGareth Bale excited for UCL final in CardiffReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGareth Bale excited for UCL final in Cardiff 02:53Putting Cannes on the mapFagart, a retired 64-year-old, became a fan once he moved to Cannes from Paris in 1984, shunning neighboring afterthought OGC Nice and rivals AS Monaco. That same year a young assistant named Arsene Wenger cut his teeth in the coaching ranks, burying his head in video footage. Wenger would later pluck another Cannes graduate, former player Bora Primorac, as his right-hand man, first in Japan and then as an Arsenal assistant coach for the past 20 years. But it was Zidane who put Cannes on the map in the modern era.The club's strong finish in 1992 brought Zidane to the attention of bigger clubs, and a then-extraordinary transfer fee of nearly $9 million from Bordeaux. RARE FOOTAGE  #Zinedine #Zidane - AS #Cannes \u2022 #Overall 1989 - 1992 \u2022 #Skills, #Goals, #Assists \u2022 Young Zidane \u2022 https://t.co/Cft6uRVk69\u2014 SVEditing \u23ef (@SV_Editing) May 22, 2017\n\"I saw him back when he had hair,\" says Fagart, still somewhat in disbelief. \"He was a very good player, and it was clear that he had the chance to become the best player in the country.\" Zidane would later be honored with the naming of a town square in nearby Pegomas, where he lived with a host family as a teenaged Cannes apprentice. It was also the place where he met his wife Veronique.Born to Algerian parents, Zidane came to Cannes from Marseille's tough La Castellane district. The transition wasn't easy.Reportedly Varraud early on had to discipline Zidane, assigning him intensive cleaning duties after he punched an opponent who had mocked his origins.\"I have so many memories here. Thank you for thinking of giving my name to this little garden,\" he said during the town square ceremony in 2007.\"I spent a lot of time there, especially in the telephone booth where I was calling my parents.\"READ: The legend of Totti in 10 chaptersREAD: The match that changed footballZinedine Zidane (L) poses next to former hosts Jean-Claude (R, second row) and Nicole Elineau (Second from right, second row) during a naming ceremony of a square in Pegomas, France, in May, 2007. The couple hosted Zidane while he was a youth player with AS Cannes in 1987. Immortalized in bronzeWidely regarded as one of the finest footballers to have ever played the game, Zidane is arguably one of the few players to have transcended his sport.The 2006 film \"Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait\" was devoted to following his every move on a football field, while his infamous headbutting of Italy's Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final was immortalized in bronze.Zidane's headbutt on Materazzi was immortalized in the bronze statue titled \"Coup de Tete\"  made by French Algerian born artist Adel Abdessemed.Zidane's playing career was defined by two other notable moments.He scored twice as France beat Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup final of 1998 and he's also remembered for the stunning goal which won Real a ninth European Cup in 2002, when he converted a Roberto Carlos cross with a stunning volley against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park.Zidane, who retired immediately after the 2006 World Cup final, was crowned FIFA World Player of the Year on three occasions.Remarkably, Zidane the manager is on pace to eclipse the trophy mark of Zidane the player -- at least in La Liga. His five-year spell as one of Real Madrid's galacticos yielded a disappointing count of one La Liga title, one Champions League title and two Spanish Super Cups.But after just a season and a half in charge, Zidane could haul in his second Champions League title as a coach on Saturday to compliment this season's La Liga success. JUST WATCHEDGigi Buffon: Juventus's heart and soulReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGigi Buffon: Juventus's heart and soul 01:26Greener PasturesZidane's departure from Cannes allowed the emergence of another Cannes prodigy, Johan Micoud, who would later star for Bordeaux and Werder Bremen while making 17 caps for the French national team. He returned to Cannes in 2016 as club's new president. Micoud, a Cannes native and notable football pundit on French television, summarized his commitment to Cannes, which recently secured a rise to the fifth tier of French football. \"It is first of all a great pride,\" he said after his appointment last year. \"I was trained here and I really love this club, so I hope to give back to it what it has brought me.At Cannes, Micoud teamed with future World Cup winner, Patrick Vieira, during the 1994-1995 season. The current New York City FC manager was another prodigy of the Cannes youth academy, and would later be the lynchpin of Arsene Wenger's three Premier League titles at Arsenal. Wenger also has the distinction of plucking the last Cannes youth academy player of note, Gael Clichy, who Arsenal purchased for less than $500,000 in 2003. The current Manchester City left back was sold for roughly $19 million in 2011.But hard times have fallen on the club since, with Cannes reportedly in need of a $2.5 million bailout in 2014. The club's website still features a link asking for donations. Who do you think will win Saturday's final? Have your say on our Facebook page. AS Cannes' home ground, the Stade Pierre-de-Coubertin, struggles to stay half-full.  'Real challenge'Former club president Ziad Fakhri was in control at the time, and explains that French FA rules that scrutinize teams which lose money made it difficult for Cannes to stay competitive. \"When I took over the club (in 2009), we were in the third division,\" says Fakhri, a Senegal-based Lebanese businessman who purchased 90% of the club with his late father. \"The problem was that we had to put money in every year.\"\"At that time we wanted a real challenge,\" he explains, adding that his family became familiar with the club after summering in the South of France.\"A real challenge was a known club, that had history, a real story that we could try to make even better, bring it to its best. \"We always looked at that club because it was part of a very small division, but with great potential,\" Fakhri says.\"Everyone always knew Cannes -- because of Zidane and many great players -- and said that it had to get back to the first division, but we never succeeded in getting it back up.\"The death of Fakhri's father made it difficult for him to manage the club's finances. After a ban from the French FA for failing to balance the team's books on time, Fakhri was forced to sell in 2014.

Its rusty older stand fields a few hundred fans on most game days. PinnacleAS Cannes' home ground reached its pinnacle in 1993 when it hosted 17,401 spectators in a match against Marseille.Today it struggles to attract a fraction of those fans. A modern stand featuring a banquet room and VIP section was fitted in 2000, but remains closed for most matches. Outside, the club's parking lot has been commandeered by a motorcycle training school, while the mini pitches nearby were used to train five and six-year-olds on a recent weekday. Graffiti bearing the team's red dragons logo festoons the outside of the old stand, which is adorned with littered stairwells and poured cement with all the charm of an old prison.

More than 5,000 sailors from the Baltic, Black Sea, Northern, Pacific fleets and the Caspian Flotilla participated in the parade.\"Russia's history is inseparable from the victories of its courageous and fearless Navy,\" Putin said in a speech that drew heavily on naval history, in which he outlined the continued importance of the country's fleet. \"Much is being done today for the development and renovation of the Navy. New ships are being commissioned, the fleet's combat training and readiness are being perfected,\" he said.

In July, Turkish authorities arrested German human rights activist Peter Steutdner and nine others, charging them with \"committing crimes in the name of a terrorist organization without being a member.\" The high-profile arrests have stoked fears that Turkey is holding Germany citizens as \"political hostages,\" according to Germany's Green Party co-chair Cem Ozdemir.Related: Erdogan says 'behead traitors' Turkey arrests 'threaten everyone,' says partner of detained German activistGermany is demanding the unconditional release of both Yucel and Steudtner, threatening travel and trade restrictions in retaliation. In June, the German Foreign Ministry issued a warning to its citizens to exercise caution while traveling in Turkey, a popular destination for German tourists. Last month, Germany's Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel interrupted his own vacation plans to address the situation: \"We need our policies towards Turkey to go in a new direction ... we can't continue as we have done until now,\" he told reporters.\"We need to be clearer than we have been until now, so those responsible in Ankara understand that such policies are not without consequences.\"A complex relationshipTurkey's relationship to Germany is complex. Around three million Turkish nationals live in Germany. Supporters of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have demonstrated en masse on German soil, but several Turkish NATO military personnel have also sought asylum in Germany since the failed coup attempt against Erdogan last year. Turkey is an important NATO ally and is a key partner in Germany's strategy to restrict the number of refugees from Syria's ongoing conflict spilling into Europe.Turkey: Opposition newspaper journalists go on trial in IstanbulYet Turkey has recently denied German parliamentarians from visiting troops, stationed in Turkey, who are participating in NATO operations in Syria.German authorities also prevented top politicians, including President Erdogan, from addressing Turkish rallies in the country in the lead up to the April 2017 referendum, a vote that handed Erdogan sweeping powers.These latest arrests may be a tipping point in the two nations' increasingly fraught relationship.Opinion: Erdogan will regret alienating Angela MerkelA bond of resilienceDilek Mayaturk moved from Munich to Istanbul to be closer to Yucel. She now sees her husband once a week, but is only able to communicate with him through a thick pane of glass. Once a month he is allowed an \"open visitation\" -- the only time the two are able to embrace one another and hold hands. Although the visits are exhausting, Mayaturk says they are the happiest part of her week.A year after failed coup in Turkey, Erdogan says 'behead traitors'She says she takes time to check on her husband's physical and mental health during their strictly-controlled visits.\"It's a very alienating place,\" she says. \"More than that, I use that time to observe him: Does he look okay? Is he keeping healthy?\" \"He doesn't see anyone else. He can't exercise. Today, he's strong and patient. But tomorrow? Isolation is meant to break you in the long term.\" As evidence of \"propaganda\" in his case, Turkish authorities have presented the newspaper articles Yucel wrote for Germany's respected Die Welt newspaper. According to Die Welt, Yucel was initially detained after he reported on a series of hacker-released emails that demonstrated alleged Turkish government support for Syrian jihadist rebel groups and state attempts to control the media. Last week, Die Welt's publisher filed a complaint to Turkey's constitutional court to challenge his arrest.JUST WATCHEDTurkey accuses journalists of terror plotReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTurkey accuses journalists of terror plot 03:16Mayaturk says the allegations against her husband are \"absurd.\"But through his isolation, Yucel's resilience has shone, she says.\"Deniz said from the start: 'I went in as a journalist.

The University of Florida student on Saturday became the first swimmer to win three golds in one night at a major international meet and went on to end a remarkable World Aquatics Championships in Budapest with seven world titles, equaling a record held by Michael Phelps. Follow @cnnsport\n\nSo bright is Dressel's future that, according to former world champion Mark Foster, the American can not only dominate his sport like Phelps -- the most decorated Olympian in history -- but add a \"sexiness\" to the pool which Usain Bolt has brought to the athletics track.It is Dressel's command of swimming's blue riband event, the 50m freestyle -- an event Phelps did not compete in -- which draws the comparisons with Jamaican Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion and the 100m and 200m world record holder.\"He's definitely the new face of world swimming,\" Foster, a former 50m freestyle world record holder, told CNN Sport. Read More\"Clearly, Michael Phelps has left a huge hole, that's not saying someone needs to fill it. \"But 50m free is the glamor event, the most entertaining and exciting race. The man who wins the 50m free is the fastest swimmer on the planet. \"This guy is going to dominate in the same way as Phelps, but is also the fastest man on the planet so it's also a bit like Usain Bolt. He's going to bring a bit of sexiness to the sport.\"READ: Pool tips: Don't be afraid, just relaxREAD: Mark Foster: From 'chlorine boy' to golden boy 'I've never seen anything like it'On his record-breaking Saturday night, Dressel raced three times in two hours, winning the 50m freestyle, 100m butterfly and helping the US triumph in the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay. By the end of the championships, Phelps -- the only other man to win seven world titles at the same meet having done so in Melbourne in 2007 -- was welcoming another member into his elite club. Dressel told reporters that comparisons with Phelps, winner of 23 Olympic gold medals and 26 world titles, were \"probably inevitable\" before stressing that he was \"not the same person as Michael.\"But Foster, one of the most successful British swimmers of all time, described Dressel as a \"phenomenal\" talent. \"His start is amazing, I've never seen anything like it,\" added the Englishman. \"I used to have the fastest start in the world, but he's obliterating people. \"Everyone will try to break it down and copy it. I'm not saying they won't be able to break it down, but there's also a natural ability that goes with it.\"Dressel is doing it better than anyone else has done it before and that's probably because of his athleticism. He's so powerful and springy, he's like Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. He's got that X-Factor. \"Michael Phelps dominated because he was a little bit special and this guy is a little bit special. \"He's still 20 and, generally, in sprint you don't get to your prime until 25 or late 20s because you're constantly getting stronger. He'll get faster and will continue to push things forward.\"(Left to right) Nathan Adrian,Mallory Comerford and Caeleb Dressel celebrate after winning the mixed 4x100m freestyle at the World Aquatics Championships How good can Caeleb Dressel be?

With the introduction of mixed relays at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Dressel could potentially bid to win seven gold medals at the next Olympics, putting him one short of Phelps' all-time record of eight Olympic individual golds at a single Games. \"He'll never win eight golds in one Olympics, he can't do as many events as Phelps did, but he could potentially win seven, which is pretty special,\" said Foster. \"It really will hopefully bring a lot more focus on the sport and the more focus it gets the bigger they [the swimmers] become. There still is a hole after Phelps and I'm not saying Caeleb is going to fill that, but he could do. The world of sport needs him.\"",

There had been suggestions that the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, favored a post-Brexit transition period during which immigration would remain broadly the same as before. \"The Prime Minister's position on an implementation period is very clear and well-known,\" said a spokesman for the Prime Minister in a press briefing.\"Free movement will end in March 2019. We have published proposals on citizens' rights, \" he said.Read MoreLast week Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a major analysis of the impact of EU immigration on the British economy.In her letter to the independent committee carrying out the inquiry, Rudd said made it clear that she also favored a transition period.\"As part of a smooth and orderly transition as we leave the EU, the second phase of our immigration proposals is based on a temporary implementation period to ensure there is no cliff-edge on the UK's departure for employers or individuals,\" she wrote.Business leaders have expressed concern that a \"cliff-edge\" exit from EU immigration arrangements would have a detrimental effect on the UK economy, due to a sudden drop in the arrival of skilled workers from Europe.British media reported Hammond as having reassured UK business leaders on the issue.Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd arrives for a Cabinet meeting at 10 Downing Street in central London on July 4, 2017. Those seeking a swift clean break for the EU include International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis.May's spokesman nevertheless indicated that there could be some flexibility. \"Other elements of the post-Brexit immigration system will be brought forward in due course,\" he said. \"It would be wrong to speculate on what these might look like or to suggest that free movement will continue as it is now.\"The spokesman said most of May's positions on the immigration aspects of leaving the EU were laid down in a speech last January in Lancaster House, London. \"She said \"It's in no-one's interest for there to be a cliff edge for business or a threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new partnership with the EU\", the spokesman said, directly quoting from the PMs speech. \"She also said: \"By this, I do not mean that we will seek some form of unlimited transitional status, in which we find ourselves stuck forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory. That would not be good for Britain, but nor do I believe it would be good for the EU\".

        "content": "Elvo River, Italy (CNN)Dario Zanetti squints into his black plastic pan, tilting it into the sun. There are three tiny yellow specks, and a slightly larger one, the size of a small bread crumb.\"It's a lovely piece,\" he says with smile.This English teacher is ankle deep in Italy's Elvo River, just south of the Alps, panning for gold. \"I'm relatively new at this, a freshman,\" he laughs. Dario is also studying for his PhD in archaeology, specializing in kitchens in medieval castles. He isn't doing this for the money, though he readily admits he has caught gold fever. Two years ago, as a Christmas present, his mother paid for him to attend a gold-panning course in Germany. Read MoreApproximately $4 of gold is seen in this bottle. Around two hundred of these gold flecks make a gram.\"It's also about the adventure,\" he tells me. \"It's like, you know, being in America in the gold rush period.\"Dario is just one of a growing number of people who have joined the Association of Gold Seekers of Biella, this province in northern Italy. The gold here has washed down from the melting glaciers of the Alps, deposited in the sand along the banks of the Elvo. 33 of the most beautiful places in ItalyThis area was once part of a vast Roman gold-mining operation dating back to the second century BC, says Arturo Ramella, who is also the president of the World Goldpanning Association. The hills just above the Elvo are all man-made, composed of millions of tons of rocks and stones that thousands of local inhabitants separated from the gold-bearing sand. The mine was active, says Ramella, for around two hundred years, and the gold found here helped finance the Roman Republic's conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Arturo Ramella, president of the World Goldpanning Association, looks over hills of stones displaced from an ancient Roman mining operation.Long gone, however, are the days of forced labor. The atmosphere on this bend of the river is light-hearted, almost picnic-like. The sun is shining, it's warm but not hot and the eight or nine people here to pan for gold spend half their time chatting.Eight-year-old Giacomo came with his grandmother. He helped her carry the pans full of sand to the river, did some panning himself, and showed me two flakes he had managed to separate from the dark sand.  \"It's fun!\" he exclaimed with a toothy smile.His concentration waned as the morning wore on.  \"Look at all of those!\" he said, pointing to the finger-long sand-colored fish darting between the stones in the shallow water. \"I want to catch some and cook them for lunch!\" Clearly Giacomo no longer had images of gold nuggets dancing in his head.Bruno Martini helps run the association in Biella, and he taught me the basics of panning. First you have to figure out where gold is most likely to be found, which is where the river widens out and the heavier gold flakes are deposited in the darker, iron-rich sand. Then you fill your pan with that sand, removing the larger rocks, and take the pan to the river to slowly rotate the pan, letting the lighter particles wash away. Eventually, if you're lucky, you'll have three or four tiny specks of gold.  The province limits daily takings to five grams, or 0.176 of an ounce, but the gold panners say the chances of finding that much gold even after a full day are slim at best. By my calculations I may have managed to get about $4 of gold.Giancarlo Rolando, a 65-year-old pensioner in a straw hat and sleeveless T-shirt, is the group's veteran gold seeker. He's been panning since the 1980s, and recalls that back in the day, he managed to find enough gold to pay for a six-month vacation to the British Virgin Islands. Giancarlo Rolando is the veteran gold digger.Since then, however, his earnings have helped pay for occasional car repairs and the odd dinner with a girlfriend. \"It makes a difference because my pension is a bit low,\" says Giancarlo.He comes here once or twice a week, and is proud of the tan all that time in the sun has left him. \"My friends think I got this at the beach,\" he quips.As he sits on the riverbank panning away, he explains the attraction.  \"Yes, it can be tiring carrying around buckets of sand, but you hear the sound of the water, there is the sun, the wind, tranquility. If you're tired, you take a nap under a tree. When you're hungry, you eat, and when you're done, you go home. It's not like a job where you're subject to a schedule. You do what you like. You're free.\"Gold or no gold, there's no rush here.",

The 26-year-old man grabbed a long kitchen knife at a supermarket Friday afternoon and stabbed three shoppers, killing one, before attacking four others on the street.Eyewitnesses said he shouted, ''Allahu akbar,'' or God is greatest. Amateur video showed young men throwing chairs at the suspect to subdue him.One of the injured was a Turkish man who helped others overpower the attacker, authorities said. Some of the injured were hurt seriously.''We are shaken, horrified,'' Hamburg Interior Minister Andy Grote said at a Saturday news conference. He called it a ''barbaric'' attack and praised the citizens who overpowered the man as ''very courageous.''Read MoreThe attack was the latest in a series linked to Islamists in Germany, including a December truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people.A woman places flowers  near the scene of the attack Saturday in Hamburg. Grote said the attacker appeared to have Islamist motives but was also ''psychologically unstable.'' He was known to be undergoing radicalization, and authorities were monitoring him but didn't consider him to be an Islamist militant. Authorities searched his living quarters at an asylum shelter in Hamburg overnight.Torsten Voss, Hamburg state's chief of the Constitutional Protection Office, said the suspect was one of 800 registered Islamists under observation in Hamburg, but that he was so far not linked to any extremist network.Voss said the attacker, according to an informant, was known in the past to enjoy drinking and partying, but had changed recently and increasingly spoke about the Koran. The suspect speaks Norwegian, Swedish and English, he said.Police cordon off the area around the Hamburg supermarket where the attack occurred Friday.  Two German security officials said the suspect in the Hamburg knife attack was on the radar screen for expressing pro-jihadi views.The state domestic intelligence service in Hamburg had flagged him, the officials told CNN, but the suspect was not considered a priority cause for concern because the depth of his radicalization was not clear.One official said the attack appears to be the latest in a series of \"borderline cases\" in Europe and the United States where it is difficult to untangle mental health problems from terrorist motivation. Nationality is unclearHamburg's mayor was to lay flowers at the site of the attack in the city's Barmbek area, Grote said.The suspect was to appear in court Saturday on one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder, said Joerg Froehlich, Hamburg chief prosecutor. He won't talk because of a head injury sustained during the attack, Froehlich said, adding that the case will go to the federal prosecutor. The suspect, whom the authorities did not identify by name, had previously been arrested for shoplifting. Authorities are trying to determine the man's nationality but said he had a birth certificate from the United Arab Emirates and was seeking papers from the Palestinian Authority mission in Berlin.Grote said the man intended to leave Germany and had been at a government registration office for foreigners earlier Friday to see if his papers had arrived.CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.",

By defeating Saudi Arabia 1-0 in the Asian Cup final in Jakarta, Indonesia, Iraq's national team had confounded the odds and claimed the continent's most prestigious competition for the first time.Read MoreThey had also, however briefly, united a nation that was tearing itself apart.Looking back at that period, Iraqi midfielder Hawar Mulla Mohammed who played in all six games of the 2007 tournament finds it hard to comprehend just how violent his country had become both during and after the invasion.\"The national security HQ was close to where I lived and when it got bombed the building would swing left and right,\" Mohammed said. \"It was indescribable, we used to practice while the airstrikes were going on.\" Mohammed said that between 50 and 60 people from his clan, including five of his cousins, died as a result of the Iraq conflict and its aftermath.In 2007 alone, more than 26,000 civilians were killed according to figures from the Iraq Body Count monitoring group.      A history of violenceYet violence was nothing new for the Iraqi national football team. They'd been ruled by fear from within their own locker-room for many years.Uday Hussein, eldest son of Iraq's late tyrannical dictator Saddam Hussein, ensured that the consequences for failure on the field were brutal.Tales of his cruelty were legion: beatings, torture, imprisonment. But by 2007, Uday was long gone -- killed along with his brother Qusay in 2003.Still, on the eve of the Asian Cup four years later, the Iraqi national team was in disarray. With just weeks to go until the start of the tournament, they didn't even have a coach.The Brazilian journeyman Jorvan Vieira was a last-minute call-up.     According to Salih Sadir, who played in the early rounds of the 2007 tournament and was an unused substitute in the final, such haphazard preparation ensured expectations remained low.\"We were expecting that it would be mere participation and then we'd leave the competition,\" Sadir said casting his mind back. An opening match draw against unfancied Thailand did little to alter that theory. But in the second game against Australia everything changed. A 3-1 defeat of the pre-tournament favorite transformed the belief among the Iraqi players. More importantly, it made people back home take notice.\"Every time we won, we return(ed to the dressing room) to listen and watch the response, and reaction from our families,\" Sadir said.As the tournament progressed, that response became increasingly excited.Unity and togetherness In a country that was fracturing along religious and ethnic lines, its soccer stars had begun to offer an example of how Iraqis could work together.A team of Sunnis, Shias and Kurds could easily have been divided, just like their countrymen. But the players agreed to leave religion at the door. They found a way to unite. Not only that, they inspired. \"People's support for us started increasing. We started seeing that we are unifying the people,\" Sadir said. As such, \"the players became determined to bring the cup back to Baghdad.\"     James Montague, a journalist and author of the book \"When Friday Comes: Football, War and Revolution in the Middle East,\" spent some time with the team before they flew out for the tournament.He recalls a group of players who had all been deeply impacted by the conflict in their homeland.  \"Many had lost loved ones while some had threats of violence directed against them or their families by insurgents. There was also the threat of kidnap by criminal gangs,\" he said.But Montague also detected a strong determination among the players to put aside religious and cultural differences. He describes a camaraderie, humor and unity between teammates.On top of this, Coach Vieira had decreed that the players would not pray together in the dressing room before the game or at half-time, something teams from the Middle East commonly do, Montague said.Yet small measures such as this were only part of the reason this Iraqi team would write an underdog story more unlikely than \"Leicester City winning the English Premier League or the Red Sox breaking the 'Curse of the Bambino,'\" Montague added. 'Giving happiness to the people'Iraq finished top of their group, and a win against Vietnam in the last eight took them into the semi-finals.A virtual unknown when he arrived, coach Vieira had worked wonders to bring his charges even this far. The Brazilian had been able to instill a belief and togetherness in his squad. Living in each other's pockets as they prepared and trained certainly helped.  But as the tournament progressed, Vieira began to understand what he described in 2007 as his players' \"pain\" and desire to \"give  happiness to their people\" who were suffering back home.JUST WATCHEDEmotional coach recalls Iraqi sporting triumphReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEmotional coach recalls Iraqi sporting triumph 04:34Talking to CNN again earlier this week, Vieira said \"it was very difficult to manage the psychological side of things\" given the situation back in Iraq. Vieira recalled that before the competition began when the team was preparing in Jordan, the team's physiotherapist had requested to go home to Iraq be with his wife who was due to give birth. As he went to collect his ticket to return to be with the team, he was killed by a car bomb. When something like that happens \"you don't know (whether) to cry with them, to try to explain to them to be strong,\" Vieira said.Sadir describes a manager strongly focused on the emotional side of the game.\"He was very close to the players, that was his main thing,\" Sadir said. \"Not the tactics or the physical status, his main focus was how to get to be close to the players, make them love him and support him. He was very successful in doing so.\"By the time of the semi-final against South Korea, Iraq were the darlings of the competition and support for their pursuit of the trophy had spread around the world.When they beat the Koreans in a penalty shoot-out, it seemed that nothing could stop them -- except, perhaps, a violent jolt of reality.

A short while later, in the southeastern neighborhood of Ghadir, a second car bomb killed 20 and wounded at least 60.It was rumored that some of the players didn't want to go on, considering the risk of further bloodshed a price too high for a simple football trophy.Yet Sadir cites the reaction of one bereaved mother, whose son was killed while supporting the team, as providing the motivation for those who doubted whether they could play in the final.Read: Spaniards rediscovering their nation's Islamic heritageRead: Could biofuels for planes be grown in desert?Read: Saving Beirut's crumbling architectureRead: Does Dubai frame depict ugly picture? This particular woman had appeared on Iraqi television after her son's death and refused to bury her child until Iraq had returned home as champions.\"The biggest thing that impacted our morale and persistence and confidence to continue playing for the team ... was the incident that took place, the woman who lost her son,\" Sadir said. \"This was a turning point.\"Vieira becomes emotional, shedding a tear when he recalls the players meeting after hearing the words of this bereaved mother. Despite the doubts and difficulties, \"we decided to continue (and that) we had to win this competition,\" he said. And so, on 29 July 2007,  Iraq took on regional heavyweights and three-time Asian Cup champions, Saudi Arabia, for the biggest prize in the country's sporting history.     Throughout the tournament, Iraq had been defensively sound, conceding only two goals. In the final, they were again resolute.

Iraq continues to be a dangerous, violent and divided place.In recent years, the emergence of ISIS has plunged major cities like Mosul and large swathes of the country into chaos. The sectarian murders have also continued with 15,000 people killed in 2014 alone. According to Iraq Body Count, there were 4,000 violent incidents across the country in 2016. That's seven times as many as were recorded in 2003, the year of the US and allied invasion.     Unsurprisingly, the football team has barely played within the country's borders in the decade since. But thanks to the likes of Vieira, Mohammed and Sadir, Iraqis will always have the memory of 2007. Ten years on, it's a story still generates powerful emotions for those involved.\"There was fire inside each of us,\" Mohammed said. \"The explosion, the people who died, hearing about friends who died -- we had to give this happiness to the Iraqi people,\" he added.Illustrations and graphics by Kate Chan",

Guclu is also accused of belonging to what the Turkish government refers to as the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization (FETO). Gulen, the reclusive Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of hatching the military coup attempt, has said that his supporters could have been involved in the coup attempt but has always denied any direct connection.Turkey arrests 'threaten everyone,' says partner of detained German activistAn investigation into Guclu -- and his choice of courtroom clothing -- was soon launched.Read MoreGuclu's sister sent him the T-shirt while he was in jail awaiting trial and prison authorities allowed Guclu to wear it to the hearing, according to state news media Anadolu.The prosecutor's office is now investigating Guclu's sister and the government agencies responsible for running the prison where Guclu is incarcerated, according to Anadolu.

The brand has since halted sales of the now-controversial top, according to Turkish daily Cumhuriyet. Turkey: Opposition newspaper journalists go on trial in IstanbulMore than 20 people have been detained in Turkey for wearing the T-shirt, according to Turkish media reports. While most have been released, at least one person has been arrested after he tried entering a courtroom wearing it, according to Anadolu.Two university students who were detained told police that they bought the T-shirts not knowing they were associated with the FETO trials, according to Anadolu.Speaking to police, the two students said: \"We don't follow the news.

But in the case of the \"HERO\" top, there are no legal grounds for detention.\"It is completely outside the law,\" Cavli said. Guantanamo-style uniformsIn mid-July, Turkey's Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag announced a new rule that prohibits suspects from appearing in court wearing anything that has text on it.  \"People will not be allowed to wear in court anything that has a picture, sign, text or any sort of message from now on. It is a rule now,\" Bozdag said.President Erdogan has taken it a step further, recommending a \"uniform\" dress code for those on trial for alleged FETO offences. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Istanbul on July 15, Erdogan said: \"From now on let's make them appear in court wearing uniform clothing like they do in Guantanamo.\"",

Now retired, he's writing for CNN during the 2017 World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. (CNN)There's often a fear factor for people returning to swimming.It's a bit like going to the gym for the first time; you think everyone is going to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.But in my experience of the pool, there's a genuine respect for people willing to give it a go.And for that reason, the best piece of advice I could give someone about improving their technique is to join a club program.Most of us had lessons in the past -- as kids growing up -- but it's worth having lessons if you're starting back.Read MoreIt's a bit like golf; you might be practicing bad habits and not getting better in the pool.Have a lesson to iron those things out.

In fact, they are most likely worrying about themselves.It's also true that swimming isn't like running, where you can just lace up your trainers and you're out the door. It takes a little more planning.That's why going to a club or teaming up with a friend is better as it forces you to go so you don't let someone else down.Once you're in the pool, it's important to make sure swimming doesn't become a burden. First and foremost, it has to be something that you enjoy.'It's like yoga on water'For me, swimming is almost like meditation. The sights, sounds and the overall feel is very therapeutic.It allows you to completely switch off, or it gives you time and space to work something out in your head.I lose myself, a bit like yoga, and that's whether I'm doing a big workout or just slowly doing lap after lap of the pool.JUST WATCHEDKatinka Hosszu: Meet swimming's newest starReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKatinka Hosszu: Meet swimming's newest star 03:16READ: Turning iron into goldIt's an obvious thing to say but the more you do, the better you get. You'll hear the elite swimmers talk about \"feel\" and that's such a big part of being in the water.The more often you can get in the water, the better you'll get.There's also a misnomer in swimming that the bigger you are, the faster you'll swim. That's nonsense.Look at the elite swimmers. Sure they're in good shape but they're not big and bulky. That bulk isn't necessarily going to help you push through the water any faster.But it is a good idea to mix swimming with other training. I still do that, whether it's time in the gym, yoga or cross training. It's good to have variation within exercise.Foster still swims in retirement, using it as a form of meditation for himself.'Floating on water's the key'People often ask about how often you should swim per week. Time is precious and making space for it can be difficult, but -- even if you're just doing half an hour -- that's better than nothing.Ordinarily, I would do 45 minutes to an hour in the pool but there's no hard and fast rule.The pros will have eight to 10 sessions per week, but aim to go two or three times a week.Get yourself into a routine. Once you have, it becomes a lot easier.And then there's the question of what to do once you're in the water. There are so many different drills you can try. Firstly, just the basics of just pushing and gliding through the water.JUST WATCHEDThe sport that's 'like rugby in the water'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe sport that's 'like rugby in the water' 02:25READ: How \"chlorine boy\" became golden boyLearning to float will give you a full understanding of your body in the water.Then you can work up to single arm drills, or holding a float and just working your legs. Try paddles on your hands to help you hold more water, or try swimming with a pull buoy between your legs.It's good to have a target. That might start with just 50 meters of the pool, or it might be a one kilometer open-water swim. It's good to have something in the distance.There's even masters swim meets, which might sound intimidating but they're not. You get the occasional former pro turn up but you'll benefit from the competition.But the most important thing is to just enjoy it as much as you can. The health and well being benefits are massive, and you can have fun at the same time.",

The conclusion was made after large-scale tests of buildings' cladding, or insulation systems. The structures have a combination of materials in their wall cladding systems that does not meet \"current building regulation guidance,\" government officials said.At least 80 people were killed on June 14, when a blaze engulfed a residential tower block in North Kensington. To date, only 42 of the victims have been formally identified.Officials also announced an independent review of building regulations and fire safety.Read MoreThe review will be led by Dame Judith Hackitt and will look at current building regulations and fire safety, with a focus on high-rise residential buildings. It will report to Communities Secretary Sajid Javid and Home Secretary Amber Rudd.\"This independent review will ensure we can swiftly make any necessary improvements. Government is determined to make sure that we learn the lessons from Grenfell Tower fire, and to ensure nothing like it can happen again,\" Javid said.The review will focus on the \"regulatory system around the design, construction and ongoing management of buildings in relation to fire safety, \"related compliance and enforcement issues; \"and \"international regulation and experience in this area.\"\"Reasonable grounds to pursue charges\"Campaigners for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire say individuals as well as local authorities should be held accountable for the disaster, after police confirmed there are \"reasonable grounds\" to pursue corporate manslaughter charges.On Thursday, London's Metropolitan Police sent a letter addressed to those \"directly affected by the fire\" to update them on the progress of the investigation.The letter, which has been seen by CNN, says police have \"seized a huge amount of material\" and after an \"initial assessment\" they believe there are \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect that the local council and the tenant management organization \"may have committed the offense of corporate manslaughter.\"\"Our residents deserve answers about the Grenfell Tower fire and the police investigation will provide these. We fully support the Metropolitan Police Investigation and we will cooperate in every way we can,\" Elizabeth Campbell, the new leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, the group responsible for the management of the building, said in a statement sent to CNN. \"It would not be appropriate to comment further on matters subject to the police investigation,\" she added.Grenfell Tower as it appears today.The Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization told CNN in a statement, \"Following the tragic events at Grenfell Tower, we made it an immediate priority to cooperate fully with the investigation process.

The UK government even appointed a task force to take over parts of the council.Some residents of Grenfell Tower say they had made multiple complaints to the council about the fire safety of the building.A few days after the disaster, the UK Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond said he believed that the cladding apparently used in a recent refurbishment of the building is banned in Britain for buildings above a certain height.Protester Michael Bradley leads the Grenfell Tower demonstrators down Regent Street in central London.Samples of insulation from the tower and equivalent aluminum composite tiles sent by police for analysis have failed safety tests, according to Detective Chief Superintendent Fiona McCormack from the Metropolitan Police.The government is conducting a full public inquiry into the disaster, and Prime Minister Theresa May apologized for what she called \"a failure of the state.\"\"Trust in the authorities across the entire community has been seriously undermined by events since the fire, to say nothing of everything that happened in the years before the disaster,\" the Justice4Grenfell statement says.\"This announcement will go someway towards the rebuilding of trust.\"CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Seb Shukla and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.",

Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"I know that, from the aesthetic point of view, it's a big impact, it's a change, but I don't want to have any more fatal injuries,\" Alonso told CNN's The Circuit. \"I don't want to have any more friends struggling after accidents like Jules (Bianchi) or Justin (Wilson). I want to make the most horrible (looking) car if it is safe and will save one life.\"Sebastian Vettel in his Ferrari, fitted with the halo, during practice for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2016READ: 'Halo' prompts mixed response from fansRead MoreShould F1 use the halo safety device system? Have your say on our Facebook page. Bianchi died in July 2015 from head injuries sustained at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix the previous October. The 25-year-old Frenchman's death was quickly followed by Justin Wilson, who was killed when flying debris hit his helmet during an IndyCar race at the Pocono Speedway in Pennsylvania in August 2015. Alonso is no stranger to life-threatening crashes himself. At the 2016 Australian Grand Prix the 35-year-old emerged with only minor injuries after his McLaren car went tumbling into the barriers following a collision with Esteban Gutierrez.Prior to that, at Spa, the Spaniard narrowly avoided catastrophe when Romain Grosjean's out-of-control Lotus came within inches of his head at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix.Alonso tested the Halo at last year's Singapore Grand Prix and says he is \"happy with a halo or no halo.\"    \"We need to test it at more circuits, with more different type of corners. Maybe we have to test it in wet conditions so there is still some things we need to improve,\" he said.Romain Grosjean's Lotus car narrowly avoids Fernando Alonso at the 2012 Belgium Grand Prix. The announcement that all 20 cars on the 2018 grid will be fitted with the safety device was confirmed by motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, on July 26.A number of F1 drivers have spoken out in opposition to the halo -- Dutchman Max Verstappen said there needed to be a \"certain element of risk\" in the sport -- but four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel offered his support, saying the sport would be \"ignorant and stupid\" to ignore it. Uncertain future   While the halo is a certainty for next year, Alonso's future at his current team McLaren is far from settled. \"I haven't made a decision yet,\" said Alonso\"I'm talking to McLaren, of course, because it's my team and I think we have unfinished business together to win in F1.\" Photos: Alonso's ups and downs Fernando Alonso will stay at McLaren in 2018.

Expect local rivalries to be as fierce as ever. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt is arguably Japan's biggest motorsport race and unique in that both MotoGP and World Superbike riders pit their wits against one another.For the likes of Honda and Yamaha the marathon race which runs for 220 laps is almost as important as winning a MotoGP championship.For the riders the race presents one of the biggest physical and mental challenges they face all season.Read MoreLast year, Alex Lowes was part of the winning Yamaha entry and the Englishman is clear about what makes Suzuka uniquely challenging.British rider Alex Lowes is racing for Yamaha in the 2017 race. \"Suzuka is unlike anything else that we do,\" Lowes told CNN.\"Typically we wait on the grid for fifteen minutes before a race and you try to focus on the task at hand. In this race though we're on the grid for one hour because they go through the national anthems and the pageantry of the event. \"You are standing there in all of your leathers in 30\u02daC and high humidity. The sweat is dripping off your back and down your leathers. It's the most unpleasant moment of the entire season!\"Two years ago, the enormity of the event hit Lowes as he led the field into the pit straight on the opening lap of the race.\"Coming across the line I could see a mass of pitboards, tens of thousands of people in the grandstands and I knew that this was one of the most magical moments of my career.\" Lowes' start to the race may have been \"magical\" but his joy turned out to be short-lived as Yamaha went on to clinch its first win since 1996 with the team of Bradley Smith, Pol Espargaro and Katsuyuki Nakasuga.The following year, he was luckier, replacing Smith at Yamaha who were victorious once again.Riders rush towards thier motorbikes at the start of the 2016 Suzuka 8 Hours race.READ: The curious case of MotoGP's missing AmericansCan Honda challenge Yamaha?Chasing three in a row is a massive target for Yamaha and with Lowes and Nakasuga this year joined by Michael van der Mark, a two-time winner, they have an enviable rider lineup.Standing in the way of victory will be Honda, winners of the race a record 27 times since its inception in 1978. While their all-new-for-2017 Fireblade has endured disastrous campaigns in WorldSBK (World Superbike) -- they are bottom of the manufacturers' championship -- Honda is still expected to be a major contender at Suzuka.MotoGP race winner Jack Miller will be one of the star attractions for Honda and having tested the bike, he can't wait to get started.\"I'm really excited to get the opportunity to race over there,\" said the Australian. \"Suzuka is something I've wanted to do for a while and to go over there with one of the best teams, it's a big opportunity for me.Australian rider Jack Miller is competing for the Honda team in the 2017 Suzuka 8 Hours raceREAD: F1 meets MotoGP\"I'm looking forward to the challenge. It's going to be a long, hot summer for me but it's going to be good!\"Racing alongside three-time winner Takumi Takahashi and Moto2 race winner Takaaki Nakagami, Miller will be part of a strong team.Former Moto2 world champion Stefan Bradl will also be on the grid for Honda. The WorldSBK racer has struggled on a Superbike this year but enlisting his services shows that Honda are doing all they can to make sure all bases are covered to be able to take the fight to Yamaha.Kawasaki and Suzuki are both doing the same with their rider lineups.Kawasaki don't put quite the same level of resources into their Suzuka program as some rivals, but with Leon Haslam paired with Kazuma Watanabe, the Team Green effort could be a good outside bet.Haslam, a two-time Suzuka winner, has bags of experience and plenty of confidence having been a podium man as a wild card in WorldSBK, in addition to winning in the British Superbike Championship. Suzuki will have their all-new GSXR-1000 on track and with Josh Brookes, Vincent Philippe, Josh Waters and the factory's MotoGP test rider, Takuya Tsuda, riding they have the potential to challenge for a podium finish.The victorious Yamaha team celebrate on top of the podium at the 2016 race.READ: Dovizioso clinches maiden Mugello winTheir biggest name on a Suzuki will be 2014 WorldSBK champion Sylvain Guintoli, with the Frenchman adding Endurance duty to a season that has already seen him line up on the grid in British Superbikes and MotoGP.Suzuka is a challenge unlike any other. One of the most important things for teams and riders is to have as many of their bases covered as possible prior to the start of the event.Visit cnn.com/motorsport for more news and videosWith testing completed, the key task becomes maximizing productivity during practice and qualifying before the start of the race.A lot can happen in two minutes on a racetrack, and over the course of eight hours, 1,300 kilometers and 220 laps, another compelling chapter in motorcycling history will be written in the heat of the Japanese summer.",

The Prime Minister was not made aware of the breach until January 2017.The Transport Agency said its former director-general, Maria \u00c5gren, had approved the outsourcing contract even though it breached security and privacy laws. \u00c5gren has since been fired and fined 70,000 krona (about $8,500).\"We have no indications pointing at that data was disseminated improperly, so we do not see any direct cause for concern,\" the Transport Agency said on its website.Read MoreAccording to Expressen, \u00c5gren's line of defense at an official hearing in March was that the \"departure from current legislation,\" which she approved, was acceptable and that such decisions \"had been made before and that it was part of a process you could apply when needed.\" She also contended that she had not been sufficiently briefed on the security aspects of the role and had done her best under those conditions.An alliance of opposition parties called this week for a vote of no confidence, targeting three government ministers affected by the scandal, to be held in 10 days' time. Two of them, Interior Minister Anders Ygeman and Infrastructure Minister Anna Johansson, have now resigned, Expressen said. However, Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist remains in his post and is still under threat from the no-confidence motion.IBM declined to comment to CNN.CNN's Henrik Petterson contributed to this report.",

But Haftar, who rejects Sarraj's government, remains in control in the eastern city of Tobruk, and his forces took the city of Benghazi last month after three years fighting Islamists.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Ahmad Joudeh is no stranger to dancing in dramatic locations: from rooftops overlooking the rubble in Yarmouk to the ancient ruins of Palmyra, he has defied death threats to perform. Now Joudeh has entertained crowds at the Eiffel Tower and outside the Paris Opera, leaping, whirling and pirouetting to \"Dance or Die,\" a song created especially to help spread his message of peace and cultural understanding. \"I had the opportunity to come to Paris to work with (French singer) Sanga on the song,\" Joudeh told CNN. \"He wrote it for me and for my motto in life, which is 'dance or die.'\"\"I was expecting good things to happen, but not such great and wonderful thing that are happening now.\"Dance or die: These are the words tattooed in Sanskrit on the back of Joudeh's neck. They are both a promise to himself, and a challenge to his enemies.Read MoreThe 27-year-old grew up in Yarmouk, a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus, Syria, overcoming conservative backlash, civil war and even terrorists for his art.While others from his community would describe themselves as a Syrian refugee, or a stateless Palestinian, for Joudeh the two words that constitute his identity are different: ballet dancer.\"I felt when I danced for the first time this is who I am,\" he explains. \"I was born as a refugee in a camp. Now the whole world calls me the dancer. That's what I always wanted to be: the dancer.\"Death threats from ISIS Few supported Joudeh's passion as a child.\"When my dad found out, he came to me and said 'We don't want this. You are not going to be a dancer,'\" Joudeh recalls. \"He tried everything. He was beating me.\"Joudeh studied ballet and taught dance while living in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus.But Joudeh refused to give up dancing, and his father eventually left the family. His departure meant Joudeh was financially responsible for his mom and brother, but he persevered, completing his ballet education while teaching dance classes for money.  The pianist of Yarmouk: From rubble to record dealHis talent earned him a slot on the Arab version of \"So You Think You Can Dance\" -- but his success also made him a target. In 2015, ISIS stormed his neighborhood and began sending Joudeh threats, telling him dancing was punishable by death.Joudeh's response was to have his message of defiance inked permanently into his skin.Before he left Syria for Europe, Joudeh danced amid the ruins in the ancient city of Palmyra.\"I did my tattoo, 'Dance or die,' because if they wanted to cut my head I want them to see this as the last thing they can see,\" he explains. He lost family members and his home in the Syrian conflict, but remained unbowed, resolute. He danced on. A new life in EuropeThen, a year ago, Joudeh's life changed forever when the Dutch National Ballet offered to sponsor him to study and live in Amsterdam.The move to Europe means he is safe and thriving, but his mind is never at ease. He says his family has been attacked twice since he moved to Europe, because of his art.Joudeh performs to 'Dance or Die' on the Human Rights Square, near the Eiffel Tower.\"When I think of my family it's hard to breathe, especially while I am dancing,\" he says, tears welling in his eyes. \"I was doing the repetitions and at a certain point my country and my family they came to my mind and I couldn't even move and I couldn't breathe.\"Sergei Polunin, inked: Ballet's rebel on his life in tattoosJoudeh's journey has changed at least one mind, though: That of his father, now living as a refugee in Germany.\"I was visiting him in Berlin just five days ago, and he was dancing in his house!\" Joudeh laughs, shimmying as he recounts the story.His father's dramatic transformation has reaffirmed Joudeh's belief that ballet can warm the darkest hearts, and open long-closed minds.\"It gives me the proof I can change the whole world if I really believe in myself,\" he says. \"When I could change my father's mind, I could change maybe a lot of fathers' minds in the Arab world.\"Joudeh grew up in the Yarmouk refugee camp, but now lives and works in Amsterdam.WhatsApp messages from Raqqa: 'Mama, save me'Joudeh says that now that he has come through them, he doesn't even regret the tough times he experienced.\"I am so thankful for my life. I am thankful for the war, for ISIS, for all the bad things, because they were the reason that gave me this strong personality,\" he says, vowing: \"I will reach the whole world to tell them we can be artists. The good way to fight is art, dance, music, painting.\"\"I know myself as the luckiest Syrian in the world.\"",

Like his work? Why not go behind the lens with an award-winning sailing photographer?Hide Caption 15 of 15You'd be hard-pushed to find a greater contrast between a camera and its subject. Before making the transition to F1, Paul used his 104-year-old device to shoot firefighters coming out of the rubble of Ground Zero for the New York Times, in the aftermath of 9/11. Now he spends his day capturing the world's fastest drivers, following the likes of Lewis Hamilton around the world.\"I was inspired to pick up the camera again ahead of the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix,\" Paul explains, singling out the street circuit as his favorite race on the calendar for its accessibility and atmosphere.\"Most of the images I got from that shoot were blurry, out of focus and didn't quite work. \"I think I've taken the camera to maybe 30-40 races around the world in the last four years, and now it's coming together. \"I'm really used to it, I'm anticipating the focus and it's more like an extension of my body.\"Nobody captures Formula One races quite like American photographer Joshua Paul. The photographer has to be proactive, anticipating a situation before it has occurred. While he accepts it can be frustrating to forgo many of the shots a modern day camera could obtain, he's gradually catching the eye of F1's leading stars. Paul regularly gives out prints of his favorite images to the drivers, mechanics and team principals he depicts -- something he says other photographers simply don't have time for. \"A lot of the guys are like 'Nobody's ever given me anything before!'\" he laughs. \"I just say 'Thanks for letting me walk into your garages and pit lanes.'\"\"I try to let the drivers know I'm trying to do something different and often they'll indicate they like what I'm doing,\" Paul adds. \"It could just be a nod or gesture, but it means a lot to me.\"It takes years for a team to say yes to a portrait, so I just thought: 'Let's take beautiful pictures that might appeal to someone that's not necessarily a racing fan, but who might then take an interest and see [F1] through childhood eyes. WATCH: Take a lap of the Monaco Street Circuit in 360\u00b0F1 cars to camerasHaving grown up fixated by the \"magic\" of F1, the photographer will never forget the moment he first felt truly embraced by the sport.\"The camera broke in 2015 during my second season when I was in Budapest,\" Paul recalls. \"One of the Lotus mechanics asked to see the camera and I said 'sorry it's broken.'\"He said 'Oh bring it in, we'll fix it.' \"The Lotus mechanics took the camera apart and we found all sorts of different pieces, tapes and screws, and we basically rebuilt the camera. \"In the meantime, Pastor Maldonado had crashed his car in one of the pre-practice sessions so it came in damaged and basically had to be completely rebuilt for the next morning session. \"But for about 30 minutes the Lotus guys and I hung out and talked about the shutter curtain and what it's made of, what the best tape it would be for it, and then he took some out... \"It's been working ever since!\" WATCH: The latest episode of CNN The Circuit'Romanticizing the sport'Midway through Paul's fourth season in F1, his project is gathering pace. The photographer now produces an expansive, award-winning magazine called Lollipop that takes a behind-the-scenes look at who's who in F1. For him, it's all about \"romanticizing\" the sport, making it \"more about the people than just the cars and the racing.\"\"Some people don't get what I'm doing,\" he says, \"but it's not about perfection. It's about what might make you smile.\" Photos: Shutter speed Monaco GP \u2013 Red Bull Racing driver Daniel Ricciardo in action at Monaco.Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: Shutter speed Monaco GP \u2013 Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen glimpsed through the palm trees lining the track.Hide Caption 2 of 8 Photos: Shutter speed Monaco GP \u2013 Sunrise over the Monaco track.

        "content": "(CNN)Parts of the French Riviera were evacuated late Tuesday and into Wednesday as forest fires burned swathes of land and threatened thousands of people, according to local police.More than 10,000 residents and tourists were moved after a forest fire started near the coastal commune of Bormes-les-Mimosas, around 40 km (nearly 25 miles) from Toulon, one of the country's southernmost towns.Beachgoers in La Croix-Valmer, near Saint-Tropez, watch as the fire spreads.Sunbathers lounging on a beach near Saint-Tropez looked on as a wildfire raged nearby. Children played in the sand, while others snapped pictures on their phones, as flames engulfed pine trees and sent plumes of black smoke billowing overhead.A combination of strong winds, high temperatures, and a lack of rain have fueled the fires, which took hold in the French Riviera and on the island of Corsica, off the southern French coast. Similar conditions have sparked blazes in Portugal and Italy.     Paul Adriaansens, a tourist visiting from Antwerp, said he was having lunch with his family on the beach in La Croix-Valmer on Wednesday when the wind changed. They rushed back to their rental house to beat the blaze.Read More\"We are fully packed and ready to go the minute we need to,\" Adriaansens told CNN in a phone interview. \"As soon as we see flames we'll get out.\" The conversation was cut short as police and firefighters arrived to evacuate Adriaansens' family.It's peak holiday season for the region.Travel pictures shared by tourists on social media captured firefighting planes circling over sandy beaches and pink sunsets punctuated by smoke clouds.Anna Tomlinson, a British tourist, shared a photo on Instagram of the sunrise in Bormes-les-Mimosas, a village in Var, after what she said was an \"intense morning.\" Tomlinson was evacuated from her campsite at around 3 a.m. and spent the next several hours watching from a nearby beach as firefighters battled the blaze, according to her post.People evacuated from homes and campsites take refuge on the beach in Bormes-les-Mimosas.A woman inspects the damage following a fire in Bormes-les-Mimosas.Over 100 firefighting operations have been launched since the blazes broke out, with planes flying over the Bormes area since early Wednesday morning, dropping water bombs on the wildfires.Around 3,000 campers were among those evacuated from Bormes, La Londe, and La Lavandou, the prefecture of Var said in a statement. Many ended up sleeping on the beach at Cap B\u00e9nat, a rocky peninsula in Bormes-les-Mimosas, as smoke rose in the distance.Matthieu Dany, a 23-year-old French designer who has been coming to the area for vacations since he was a child, says he's never seen fires like this.People watch smoke billow over Carros, southeastern France.\"From our villa in the mountains we can see smoke everywhere. We can see homes burning,\" Dany told CNN. \"I was on the beach earlier, but came back because the fires were getting worse.\"\"Almost everyone on the beach was looking to the hills, taking photos and videos of the fires,\" he added.Late July and August are when many French residents head out \"on holiday,\" and visit the Riviera (or the C\u00f4te d'Azur, as the Riviera is known in French).In Londes-les-Maures, fires began to burn just before 11 p.m. local time and, despite the dispatch of 540 firefighters, have not yet been brought under control.Firefighters try to extinguish a fire burning in Artigues.A firefighting plane drops water over a blaze in Mirabeau, France.The areas of Croix-Valmer, south of the famed resort of Saint-Tropez, and Artigues, east of the regional hub of Aix-en-Provence, saw hundreds of hectares -- around 12 square miles -- of land burned but those blazes are under control, the statement says. A total of nine firefighters working on those two fires were injured.  In all, more than 4,000 firefighters and soldiers have been deployed to the region, France's Interior Ministry said in a statement.President Emmanuel Macron shared his support for the firefighters battling blazes on Wednesday.\"Admiration and courage for those who are fighting tirelessly against the fire ravaging some of our territories,\" Macron said on Twitter.",

Early on in the rescue operation when Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms started to move the migrants out of the boat and into the safety of the rescue craft, they found bodies strewn across the bottom of the vessel.\"We are here to rescue people... and when you realize people died, you are there, you know their real situation, you feel the strong reality of the situation,\" Proactiva Open Arms mission leader Riccardo Gatti told CNN.Read More Photos: Hide Caption 1 of 2 Photos: Hide Caption 2 of 2During the rescue, some of the survivors said that another three bodies had been thrown overboard the night before due to overcrowding. Those bodies have yet to be recovered.It was one of the worst conditions of overcrowding the rescuers said they have seen. Hampered by rough waters, they first spotted the boat floating adrift around 15 miles north of Sabratha, a coastal city in northwest Libya.Volunteers passed life vests to the surviving migrants against the pull of the choppy sea.\"They were so nervous and just wanted to get out of the boat as soon as possible,\" Gatti told CNN.Six young children on board were rescued, the eldest of whom was five years old.The youngest migrants -- exhausted and in shock -- slept all day and night.Of the 167 rescued survivors, 40 were female. Two women told medical staff on the rescue mission that they were sexually abused several times and \"completely beaten\" before leaving from Libya, according to Gatti.Since the start of this year, 2,361 migrants have died on the treacherous route, according to the International Organization for Migration; 112,018 reached European shores. Last year, at least 3,800 migrants died on the same route -- the highest number recorded since records began.CNN's Clint Alwahab contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe case was brought by Syrian and Afghan nationals who were part of a mass influx of migrants into EuropeThe ECJ ruling upholds a law requiring refugees to seek asylum in the first EU country they reach (CNN)The European Union's top court has ruled that refugees must continue to seek asylum in the first European country they reach, even in exceptional circumstances like the migrant crisis of 2015.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled Wednesday that Austria and Slovenia were entitled to deport two Afghan families and a Syrian who applied for asylum to Croatia, the first EU nation they entered.The court's decision opens up the possibility of a deportation of hundreds of asylum seekers who arrived in Europe in 2015 and early 2016. An EU law known as the Dublin regulation typically requires asylum seekers to apply in the first European country they enter. But in 2015, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suspended the regulation for Syrian refugees in the face of the migrant crisis. Merkel rules out limiting number of refugees in GermanyHundreds of thousands of people followed the so-called western Balkan route -- an overland path taking migrants from Turkey through Greece and other southern European nations toward more prosperous northern \"destination countries\" such as Germany -- before it was closed off in 2016. Read MoreIn 2016, Afghan sisters Khadija and Zainab Jafari, with their respective families, and the Syrian national crossed the border between Croatia and Serbia even though they did not have appropriate visas. They were transported onward to the Croatia-Slovenia border by Croatian authorities with the aim of helping them to seek asylum in other EU states, the court said.The Syrian national subsequently made an asylum application in Slovenia, while the two Afghan families did so in Austria.Austria and Slovenia argued that it was up to Croatia to examine the applications of the Afghan families and the Syrian national since they had entered its territory unlawfully first.But the applicants challenged their decision before the courts, contending that their entry to Croatia should not be considered irregular and that the Austrian and Slovenian authorities should consider their requests for asylum.Croatian police officers round up migrants close to the Serbia-Croatia border in 2015.Court: Responsibility remains with state of entryThe ECJ on Wednesday supported the argument of Austria and Slovenia over that of the Syrian and Afghan nationals.It ruled that their crossing of the Croatian border had to be considered irregular under the Dublin rule. While one EU member state can permit the entry of an asylum seeker on humanitarian grounds, this is \"not tantamount to the issuing of a visa even if the admission is explained by exceptional circumstances characterised by a mass influx of displaced people into the EU,\" a court statement said. Report: EU mission tackling migrant smuggling 'has failed'Under the Dublin III Regulation, the first country of entry retains responsibility for considering the non-EU citizen's application for asylum even if it allows the person to transit to another member state under exceptional circumstances, it said.\"A Member State which has decided on humanitarian grounds to authorise the entry on its territory of a non-EU national who does not have a visa and is not entitled to waiver of a visa cannot be absolved of that responsibility,\" the statement said. The court added, however, that an asylum applicant must not be transferred to the member state responsible \"if, following the arrival of an unusually large number of non-EU nationals seeking international protection, there is a genuine risk that the person concerned may suffer inhuman or degrading treatment if transferred.\"Lawyer urges dismissal of Hungary, Slovakia caseSeparately, the advocate general for the ECJ has recommended that a case brought by Hungary and Slovakia against the mandatory relocation of asylum seekers be dismissed, according to a press release Wednesday. The case was brought against the Council of the European Union's decision to assist Italy and Greece in tackling the inflow of migrants in 2015. That decision meant EU member states had to take in 120,000 people in clear need of international protection over two years.\"That mechanism is actually a proportionate means of enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis,\" Advocate General Yves Bot's statement read.  The advocate general's opinion is not binding on the Court of Justice; a legal judgment will be given at a later date.CNN's James Gray, Katie Polglase and Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsFormer Jungle migrant camp site at Calais is returning to nature, and will become a bird sanctuaryRefugees and migrants living there were forced to leave last October and the makeshift village was torn downCalais, France (CNN)Calais is changing fast. A year ago, the Jungle camp on the town's outskirts was a bustling makeshift village packed with migrants and refugees.Then its tumbledown shacks were torn down or set alight. The camp was closed and those living there were bussed to other parts of France, or sent home.Today, where tents and shelters once stood, only grasses and scrubby bushes remain. The site is being turned into a sanctuary of a very different kind: one that offers refuge to migrating birds.This site was once home to thousands of migrants and refugees hoping to reach the UK.Lying directly on the path of birds making the lengthy journey to and from Africa, the site had long been earmarked for this project -- the migrant crisis merely put the plan on hold, until now. By October, a year after the Jungle's demolition, visitors will be able to enjoy the wildlife here, from specially designed observation areas, close to one of France's busiest ports. Read MoreAlready, nature has taken over. Wild flowers and rare plants have sprung up in the sandy soil, and swallows have begun nesting in the field's dunes.The site had long been earmarked for a nature reserve, but the migrant crisis delayed the project.\"The swallows ... come here to mate, and when it's time to leave they'll travel thousands of kilometers to get to Africa,\" explains Loic Obled, the man overseeing the jungle's transformation. \"It was such a shame to see in the media that Calais was always mentioned with the problem of migrants or unemployment,\" Obled says. \"We try to offer another way to think of Calais.\"READ MORE: Migrants left without shelter after fireMonument to resilienceIt is difficult, standing in the middle of this site which is gradually returning to nature, to believe that it was, until recently, a temporary town. Those who called it home may have been on the move, but a life of sorts existed there -- with barbershops, restaurants and even a hotel. The Jungle was a monument to the resilience of man. A strange sort of ruthless order reigned here, an economy was built, codes created. JUST WATCHEDLife after the 'Jungle' of CalaisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLife after the 'Jungle' of Calais 01:56But the smells of the backstreets of Kabul, where many of the camp's former inhabitants had fled from, have vanished -- as has the help the migrants received.The dramatic pictures of the Jungle's demolition marked the end of a headache that had blighted the northern French town for more than a decade: camps that grew from a desire to help those in need, then mushroomed into shantytowns that were a nightmare for both migrants and locals. Before the Jungle, it was Sangatte, a Red Cross-run camp some 10km west along the coast from Calais. No sooner was one site cleared than another sprang up. Migrants are continuing to arrive in Calais, despite the closure of the Jungle camp nine months ago.This time around, the French government decided on a different, tougher approach. Its strategy now is to give migrants no help at all. When France's Interior Minister Gerard Collomb visited Calais in June, he explained \"what we want most of all is that it doesn't happen again ... that's why we don't want a new center here because every time we're built one, there was a call to migration.\"In June, the government won a court case against humanitarian groups who wanted somewhere to help the 600 or so migrants living rough on the streets of the town. The ruling means there will be no new Jungle, no new Sangatte. READ MORE: Calais mayor bans food distributionMigrants fearful, desperateInstead, there is a strong police presence around Calais, while a few grassroots organizations do what they can to help. The organizations are only allowed to distribute much needed food, blankets and wi-fi from a small field in the middle of an industrial estate not far from the old Jungle site.Migrants queue to receive food distributed by an NGO on an industrial estate in Calais. A small army of volunteers works in a large hangar nearby to sort through donated clothes, cook meals and get the bare essentials to the distribution point. But even here, in the one place they are allowed to gather, the migrants speak of heavy handed treatment by the authorities, which has created a climate of intimidation and fear. A police officer chases a youth suspected of being a migrant in a lorry park on the outskirts of Calais.Patrick, who left Guinea in West Africa to head north in 2014, arrived in Calais a week ago. He told CNN he has seen enough to know that he has to move on quickly.\"The police came and chased us away. They bothered us, they took our bags, they chased everyone away, they hit people, they beat them,\" he says. \"It's pitiful. I thought in France everyone was equal, but the reality is that I see lots of racists in France.\"Patrick, 21, is living rough in Calais after the closure of the city's Jungle migrant and refugee camp.\"I didn't think France was like this,\" he says. \"In England, everything will be better.\"READ MORE: How Europe is tightening refugee policiesSite returning to natureFor now, Patrick relies on the kindness of people like Sylvain de Saturne, who works part time for the aid organization \"Help Refugees.\"As he walks through the distribution point near the former camp, sharing cigarettes and jokes with the migrants, de Saturne explains that the remaining migrants are the most desperate -- those left with no money and no alternative but to brave these conditions in the hope of one day sneaking onto a truck headed across the Channel to France. Sylvain de Saturne volunteers with the NGO Help Refugees in Calais.The loss of the Jungle means \"no roof at all, no toilets, no showers, no water points, nothing,\" he adds. \"The only food, the only water, electricity they can find is from our grassroots organization, so I believe we have only tired people, who really want to reach the UK.\"\"The trouble is that the Jungle may be gone, but England is still just across the water.\"READ MORE: Life after the Jungle: One happy endingThe nationalities of those trying to make it across the Channel haven't changed much: East Africans, a few West Africans, some Pakistanis and, still, many Afghans. The name for the camp, the Jungle, was theirs. Over the years, it came to sound like a description of what life inside was like, but it was in fact, the Pashto word \"Zanggal,\" which means \"woods\" -- a phrase the Afghans used to describe the place they were hiding.Authorities hope the Jungle site will eventually look like this nature reserve at Oye-Plage, near Calais.That place will soon be handed back to nature. What was once a camp for humans will soon be a pit stop for birds traveling the same routes. But Loic Obled says visitors will be reminded of what went on here: It's as important to understand the site's human past is as it is to understand its ecological future.",

Wenzel's parents first alerted the police to her disappearance last July. Wenzel was named on Monday by the German Foreign Ministry, which said a second German national was among those detained.\"From what we know, she is physically fine,\" Dresden prosecutor Lorenz Haase told CNN when asked about Wenzel's condition. \"However we do not know how she is psychologically.\"Read MoreHaase does not yet know if Wenzel will return to Germany and said she could be put on trial in Iraq.\"If she is proven to be a member of ISIS her case will go to the general federal prosecutor in Germany,\" he said.Iraqi troops pose with an upside down ISIS flag in Mosul on July 8.Wenzel's parents first alerted the police that Linda had gone missing in July last year, Haase confirmed.When police learned that the teenager might have converted to Islam and ran away to join ISIS, the case was handed over to the prosecutor in Dresden.However, the investigation was dropped after Wenzel's whereabouts could not be determined.\"Now that Linda is identified as the missing girl from Pulsnitz, we will reopen the investigation today or tomorrow on the suspicion that she may have been supporting a terrorist organization or was planning an attack against a foreign state,\" said Haase.\"However, we do not know what happened to Linda after she disappeared in Istanbul last year in the summer. We do not know who she was in contact with, what she was doing or whether she was involved in criminal acts or even fighting with [ISIS].'I just want to leave'Wenzel lived in Pulsnitz, near Dresden in eastern Germany.Iraqi journalist Amir Musawy visited Wenzel last week as part of an investigative team reporting for German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung and public broadcasters NDR and WDR. According to Musawy, he was the first journalist to gain access to the teenager since she was discovered.Wenzel had a gunshot wound on her leg but was able to talk and answer questions, Musawy told CNN. He witnessed her being offered medical treatment.\"It seemed to me as she didn't fully understand what happened to her or what she did,\" he said.\"I just want to leave,\" she said, according to the report published in the Suddeutsche Zeitung (SZ). \"I want to get away from the war, away from the many weapons, the noise.\" She also said she was ready to testify.ISIS brides flee caliphate as noose tightens on terror group According to the report, Wenzel was a good student who was radicalized quietly.She suddenly began listening to Arabic music instead of rap and eventually started wearing a headscarf, the report says.The report says that Wenzel met her future husband -- an ISIS fighter -- online. After traveling to Istanbul in early July 2016, she says she was taken against her will to Mosul. She married an ISIS soldier who was killed soon after, according to SZ.   More than 930 people -- including children -- have left Germany to fight alongside ISIS in Iraq and Syria, according to the German domestic intelligence service. Authorities estimate that 20% of them are young girls and women.Wenzel's hometown of Pulsnitz is a quiet place with just 7,500 inhabitants, the town's mayor Barbara Luke told CNN.And her family is a \"quiet, totally normal German family,\" she said, with no connection to radical Islam or even Islam at all.CNN's calls to the Wenzel family have not been returned. They have made no public statements since she went missing. The Mayor believes the teenager must have been radicalized online as she does not know of anyone in Pulsnitz who could have been Wenzel's contact.CNN's Nadine Schmidt, Laura Goehler, Hamdi Alkhshali and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",

'The world's top horses'The KRA visited the United States for the Pan America Racing Conference this May.No US-trained horse has ever raced in South Korea, but officials are confident such a breakthrough is imminent \u2014 approaching several trainers with a view to entering September's Korean Cup.Sheikh Mohammed: Dubai World Cup will be 'No. 1' again \"We are inviting high-quality horses from overseas so Korean-bred horses can compete with foreign horses,\" says Tae Park, contending the move will raise standards.The infrastructure and interest are certainly there. South Korea's three main venues \u2014 situated in the Seoul suburb of Gwacheon, Busan and Jeju \u2014 have seen total annual attendances exceed 15 million in recent years.Two decades on from hosting equestrian events at the 1988 Olympics, LetsRun Park Seoul features towering grandstands, called Happy Ville and Lucky Ville, capable of accommodating 77,000 people.According to Tae Park, the domestic industry already boasts an annual turnover 6.4 billion dollars \u2014 the seventh largest in the world -- and it's only going to get bigger. \"Right now, the racing surface is sand and that is off-putting to many of the world's top horses,\" says Middleton. \"However, a turf track will soon be installed at Seoul Racecourse.\"WATCH: White Turf Races - The horse race with an alpine edgeA two-way processBut the KRA's plans aren't limited to luring the world's best racehorses to East Asia. Reaping the rewards of internationalization, Korean-bred horses are increasingly racing in foreign lands and proving they can cut it at a high level. Five South Korean runners competed in this year's Dubai World Cup Carnival, three are set to line up at Singapore's Kranji Racecourse in July and two to three more are scheduled to run in Japan's Interaction Cup. This year saw the first major international win by a horse born and trained in South Korea, as Main Stay romped to victory in January's Dubai World Cup Carnival 1200m dirt handicap. The four-year-old bay gelding, trained by YK Kim, beat far more established competitors to earn the winning connections over $100,000.\"Main Stay winning in Dubai gave us confidence to develop the racing quality,\" says Tae Park.\"Main Stay made horse racing more attractive in Korea. Many media outlets carried news of his victory.\"Triple Nine, another South Korean runner, was second behind Hunting Ground in the 2000-meter handicap earlier in the night. This, Tae Park contends, is just a sign of things to come. By the year 2019, the KRA claims it will send its horses to all-weather track races in Hong Kong.By 2022, Tae Park foresees Korean runners competing in the best EU turf races and best dirt track races in the States.Middleton admits Korea is starting from \"a long way behind the leading countries\" but says significant progress is already being made and compares the influence of international runners to that of stars in baseball and football. \"Korean sports fans love seeing the likes of [LA Dodgers pitcher] Ryu Hyun-jin and [Tottenham Hotspur footballer] Son Heung-min performing well in overseas leagues,\" says Middleton. \"Hopefully they will start to follow Korean horses too.\"Whinny World In the meantime, the KRA is striving to reach new demographics in South Korea. If race days have traditionally enticed an older, male audience -- with many regarding the sport as a medium for betting -- the KRA is \"endeavoring to attract young people and ladies.\" To that end, a horse theme park, situated in the center of the Seoul Racecourse, opened its doors in September 2016 -- playing host to a number of K-pop acts, including girl group I.O.I.The attraction, named Whinny World, claims to offer guests an \"interactive and inspirational experience,\" educating young families about Korea's horse racing tradition.  With pony riding, racing simulation machines and ice rinks in winter, there's hope it can persuade people who wouldn't ordinarily consider visiting the racecourse to attend. \"Right now horse racing has a bad perception among some Korean people,\" says Tae park. \"We are trying to change that perception.\"LetsRun Park Seoul's Whinny World: where you can meet different breeds of ponies!! \ud83d\udc34\ud83e\udd84 Cuteness overload\u2763 pic.twitter.com/2B1ATioEDu\u2014 JO Kim (@krbc_jo) September 29, 2016\nVisit cnn.com/horseracing for more news and videosWhile the horses run, the young families are turning out in force.Don't bet against seeing a South Korean horse on a racetrack near you soon.",

Sticher described him as a 190 centimeter-tall (6 feet 2 inches tall) bald white man, while police described him as a man of \"untidy appearance.\"       Authorities are seeking the public's help in locating Wrousis. Schaffhausen police released a photo of him taken before the incident on CCTV cameras. He appears to be wearing a green windbreaker and black trousers, police said. He is carrying a big black bag that may have contained the chainsaw.Read MoreThe attack began in an insurance office, Sticher said, and a Volkswagen van that belongs to Wrousis has been found.  Christina Wettstein, a spokesperson for the insurance company CSS, said two of the company's employees were injured, one seriously. They have undergone surgery, she said, and their lives are no longer at risk.Wettstein said the suspect has a health insurance policy with the company.A major police operation was underway Monday for the attacker.\"The suspect targeted our company, he wanted to harm our employees,\" she said. \"But we cannot say exactly what the motive was. All we know is he wanted to harm our employees.\"The company is concerned that the suspect will approach one of its offices and embark on another attack. Wettstein said security guards are being deployed at CSS offices in the region.Wrousis has been charged twice in the past for having illegal weapons, in 2014 and 2016, but he wasn't sentenced to prison, according to Sticher.

Officials from Acea in the Lazio region, which contains Rome, are meeting the environment ministry today to discuss the possibility of rationing the water supply to about half of the city's 3 million residents, Italian newspapers reported. The Lazio region is to put a stop on water being drawn from Lake Bracciano, about 20 miles from Rome, an important supplier of water to the city, because of a risk to aquatic life as it dries up, Lazio said on its website. Lake Bracciano is an important supplier of water to Rome. But while the water crisis in Rome and its surroundings has grabbed most of the headlines, the rest of Italy is also suffering from the effects of one of the hottest and driest springs in decades followed by searing summer heat and storms.According to the Italian farmers' lobby group Coldiretti, two-thirds of the country's farmland has been affected by the harsh weather.\"Violent thunderstorms and hailstones on farmland exhausted by drought in a crazy summer marked by extreme (weather) events has driven up the financial losses in the countryside to more that 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion)\" Coldiretti said in a statement Tuesday. Coldiretti said forest fires have also taken their toll on the environment and economy in rural Italy.   Meanwhile, in neighboring France, wildfires across the south of the country and the island of Corsica have burned thousands of acres of woodland.A spokesman for the Var told CNN that hundreds have firefighters have tackled more than 60 fires since yesterday in his region alone. He said the wildfires, while not unusual for the season, were being made worse this year because of drought.

        "content": "Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The trial of 17 staff members from Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper -- one of the country's last remaining opposition publications -- began on Monday in what many are calling a crucial test of press freedom.Charged with terror-related offenses in the wake of last year's failed coup, the defendants -- journalists, executives and lawyers -- made their first appearance in court since they were put in pre-trial detention nearly nine months ago. Each faces lengthy prison sentences of up to 43 years if convicted. Prosecutors are expected to argue that the newspaper aided members of US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen's movement -- whom Turkey says was behind the coup attempt -- in addition to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. Gulen has denied involvement in the failed 2016 coup.Related: A year on, Erdogan says 'behead traitors'Demonstrators hold banners reading \"Freedom for the press - Justice for the country\"But rights activists have condemned the trial as \"politically motivated,\" accusing the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government of using the coup to muzzle opposition.Read More\"This case is highly symbolic. Cumhuriyet newspaper is one of the few remaining independent media outlets -- that's why they are on trial,\" said Johahn Bihr of Reporters Without Borders, outside the hearing. \"Today press freedom is on trial. The situation in Turkey has never been as difficult as it is now.\"\"We are sick and tired of these mass trials ... In Turkey journalists are being jailed chronically for their journalism. Articles they have written are taken as evidence in the indictments,\" he added. Supporters also released balloons during the demonstration The government has heavily restricted the media, shuttering around 150 media outlets and jailing an estimated 160 journalists, according to Reuters, which cites the Turkish Journalists' Association.In an ironic turn of events, the trial kicks off on one of the country's three press freedom days. Journalists have historically recognized July 24 as the day censorship was lifted in the Ottoman Empire. Turkey is ranked 155 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Post-coup purge on free speechOne of those in the dock on Monday was Ahmet S\u0131k, a well-known and fiercely independent investigative journalist who was previously arrested and imprisoned for more than a year in 2011 for supporting a terrorist organization through his journalism. JUST WATCHEDMedia and military targeted in TurkeyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMedia and military targeted in Turkey 02:16At the time, courts banned his book \"The Imam's Army,\" which took a critical look at the Gulen movement -- then an ally of Erdogan's -- before it was even published. Sik's wife, Yonca, called her husband's latest detention another attack on free speech. \"Ahmet is not superman or a hero. He is in prison because as a journalist he asks the right questions, speaks the truth and reflects reality,\" she told CNN. \"He is in prison because others have been silent,\" she added. \"That is why his voice is the one people hear. But what he does in his work is just natural. This just goes to show us there is no rule of law in this country.\"Other prominent names on trial include the daily paper's editor-in-chief, Murat Sabuncu, and Kadri Gursel, a highly-respected columnist who became a household name in Turkey when he was kidnapped by the PKK while reporting in Kurdish areas in 1995. Former editor Can Dundar is being tried in absentia after fleeing to Germany.A man holds a portrait of jailed investigative journalist Ahmet Sik outside Istanbul's courthouse'These are political trials'Outside the courthouse, CNN saw police checking identification, allowing only those with government-issued press IDs to proceed inside. Dozens of supporters gathered outside Istanbul's Caglayan Justice Palace holding signs and placards reading \"Freedom for the Press,\" \"Justice for the country\" and \"Free journalists.\"Some held photographs of the detained journalists while others released balloons, calling for their imprisonment to end. Turkish police stand guard outside the courthouse during the trial Inside, the room was packed with journalists, friends and family -- many of whom broke into spontaneous applause as the defendants were brought in. Friends of the accused were seen waving and trying to speak to their colleagues during breaks in the proceedings, with court police forming a barrier. Thousands trek in 'Justice March' from Ankara to Istanbul Throughout their pre-trial detention, the defendants were only allowed weekly visits from close family members and hour-long meetings with their lawyers. They remained under guard and monitored by security cameras that were in operation. Former prosecutor and opposition MP Ilhan Cihaner, present in court on Monday, also questioned the government's agenda in putting the Cumhuriyet staffers on trial. \"When you look at the agenda of prosecutors, you see that they are not independent,\" he told CNN. \"The prosecutors' actions overlap with the wishes of the administration. The administration or their proxies point their fingers at opposition journalists and the prosecutors go to work. These are political trials.\"Erdogan will regret alienating Angela Merkel Turkey has come under fire for its clampdown on civil liberties across the country in the last 12 months, straining relations with neighboring countries in the European Union. As part of the purge -- which Erdogan says is targeted at those who rose against him -- state media agency Anadolu reports that more than 169,000 people have faced \"judicial action.\"",

Now retired, he's writing for CNN during the 2017 World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. (CNN)When you first get into a swimming pool, no one sets out to be a world champion.Not me, not Michael Phelps, not any of the swimmers currently at the World Championships in Budapest. It generally just starts with being taken to the swimming pool as a kid.I was sporty and my mum wanted to keep me busy, whether that was basketball or swimming or whatever. But there comes a point in your life when your sport chooses you and, for me, it started to get serious when I was about 10 years old.Read MoreMy mum would wake me up at 5:15 am and, I'm not going to lie, there were days I hoped she would sleep through the alarm. She never did.I'd eat breakfast on the way to the pool and I'd do two hours training before school. \"Chlorine boy\" is one of the many names they gave me.JUST WATCHEDJoseph Schooling: Singapore's swimming hopeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJoseph Schooling: Singapore's swimming hope 03:47READ: The man who took on his hero and wonMy mum never made a fuss and my older sisters never complained when weekends were taken up by swimming competitions. They got their revenge; these days they call me \"golden boy.\"But there were sacrifices, for both my family and me, and that will be the same for the current crop of elite swimmers. The one that still haunts me 25 years on is missing my sister's wedding.At the time, there was a competition that was offering money and we agreed as a family that I'd compete. Looking back, did the money make much difference to my life? Maybe not but it seemed important at the time.Mark Foster won six world championship gold medals between 1993 and 2004.'It's hardly going down a coal mine' As for other sacrifices, I have never looked at swimming like that.I was 11 years old when I competed at my age group championships, winning five out of six events. I looked at similar results in the US, China and Australia in the Swimming Times and compared myself to the fastest in the world, which was pretty cool.And as I grew older and eventually turned professional, my morning starts, mercifully, became later -- 8am, which was very manageable. And when people talk about sacrifices, I used to go to Australia every January for a six-week training camp. It's hardly going down a coal mine, is it?! I didn't know any different. Swimming was the bubble I lived in and it was all I knew.JUST WATCHEDKatinka Hosszu: Meet swimming's newest starReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKatinka Hosszu: Meet swimming's newest star 03:16READ: Turning iron into goldOkay, we beat our bodies up but that was out of love and passion for the sport, for your job. I genuinely loved it.And that's the same for swimmers today. Much has changed from the early part of my career but a lot is still the same, too.They still work in a four-year Olympic cycle and, outside of that, there are national, European and World Championships as well as the Commonwealth Games. And the current generation still have the same goals. Much of the day-to-day stuff remains the same and is still every bit as grueling.When I was younger, the training I struggled with most was swimming something like 60 or 80 kilometers in a week.I had a short attention span -- I still do -- so that's why sprinting suited me. It also played to my physiological strengths.I loved doing 25 or 50-meter sprints, then having a break before going back in.I know long-distance swimmers think the sprinters are lazy because it looks like we're standing around the pool talking a lot. Sure, that did happen, but in between short, intense bursts.Foster won his final world title in the 50m freestyle at the 2004 championships.Training on the track with a world-class hurdlerMy obsession was doing anything to get quicker. I would run on the track. World and Olympic champion hurdler Colin Jackson trained me for a time and I would run 200 meters in 25 seconds, not dissimilar to what I was doing in the pool.Admittedly, there's a greater sacrifice involved in being a distance swimmer, pounding length after length of the pool -- or \"counting tiles,\" as I used to refer to it. I'm sure all distance swimmers would like to be sprinters but, if your body isn't made that way, there's not much you can do about it.To me, all that mattered was 32 strokes in 21 seconds -- that's what my event was about.So, I needed to get as much power as I could any way I could. But I had to balance being as strong as possible with being as light as possible.JUST WATCHEDThe sport that's 'like rugby in the water'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe sport that's 'like rugby in the water' 02:25READ: The swimmer Michael Phelps wouldn't want to race As a kid, I was burning off so much energy I could eat what I wanted. As I got older, I ate a lot of protein, salad and vegetables, and not so many carbohydrates.The idea of paying special attention to my diet wasn't a thing for me. Eating healthily is a common thing throughout society now but that's what I wanted to do 20 years ago. It's how I am out of the pool now.As for things like drinking alcohol and going out, there's still the chance for swimmers to do that.We've seen some of the top names let their hair down. There's a break to go out, go on holiday and have some fun after one season ends and before the next begins.The low points Whatever you do out of the water, staying in peak condition is important.Although I had some niggles in my career, I only had one major injury -- tearing the muscles under my armpit before the Olympic trials in 2004.That's one galling part of being an elite sportsman or woman and there are some dark days as a result.  That was one of mine, perhaps the darkest time as I failed to qualify for the Games.And sports psychology is more prevalent now for when those dark times arrive. I was always thought I didn't need a mental coach. They'd never stood on the podium so what could they tell me? But, if it doesn't sound too strange, I did learn how to relax, how to not be so aggressive on my first strokes but to count them instead. I appreciate that every swimmer is different but, for me, I always thought it was the best job in the world. And I wouldn't have changed it for the world.",

        "content": "Warsaw, Poland (CNN)Polish President Andrzej Duda has surprised observers by vetoing two bills that would have given his populist government sweeping powers over the country's courts.The controversial bills are part of a package of judicial reforms put forward by the ruling right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS) and passed by both houses of Polish parliament last week.  The proposed reforms have prompted huge protests in the capital Warsaw and across the country.\"This law would not strengthen the sense of justice\" in society, Duda said in a televised declaration Monday, the AFP news agency reported.Duda's decision to veto the Supreme Court bill was unexpected.Crowds began to gather outside the presidential palace on Monday morning, waving Polish flags and chanting: \"we did it\" and \"thank you!\" The President's veto is a victory for Poles who turned out to protest in over a hundred cities over the weekend.Read MoreCritics had condemned the legislation as a blatant power grab by the PiS, which repeatedly insisted that it was simply carrying out needed judicial reform. Key to the legislation was that current Supreme Court judges would be forced into early retirement and new judges appointed by the Justice Ministry. Duda's announcement came just two days after Parliament's upper house, the Senate, approved the bill following 16 hours of debate. The lower house had voted the measure through on Thursday.  Protesters rally in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw on Sunday.The legislation was described by protesters as the beginning of the end of democracy in the Eastern European country, one of the first former communist nations to join the European Union.  In his speech, Duda appealed to the opposition to \"change tack,\" urging protesters not to turn to violence. \"People can demonstrate in the streets, can show their dissatisfaction, but not resort to violence,\" Duda said. \"I admit, that my decision can be controversial. But, I'm stating here that this law, which has been passed through parliament, will not come into effect,\" he added.A poll conducted by CNN affiliate TVN last week found that 55% of Poles said Duda should veto the court laws; 29% said he should not.What's next?Parliament has the power to override the President's veto, but it would require a three-fifths majority, which would be impossible for the PiS to achieve without the support of other parties. The ruling party will now have to go back to the drawing board and re-envision its package of reforms.Just before news broke that Duda would veto the legislation, Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Warchol voiced his concern that rejection of the bills could halt changes to a judicial system which he says is corrupt and inefficient.Protesters rallying on Sunday against the proposed judicial reforms.\"If the President vetoes the law we will have to discuss the new shape of the disciplinary procedures against the judges,\" Warchol said. \"We can talk about the new law, but one thing is certain -- the ethical standards will have to be restored, and the Supreme Court must stand guard over those standards, instead of moving a corrupt judge to a different court.\"Later on Monday, the President's spokesman confirmed that Duda would in fact sign a third bill, which will give the Justice Minister the power to select the heads of Poland's lower courts.EU warningThe President's unexpected decision on Monday comes after both the European Union and US State Department voiced concerns over the legislation. The EU said that it would erode the judiciary's independence.Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission, last week threatened the use of Article 7, a mechanism that would allow for sanctions against Poland and possible suspension of its voting rights in the bloc. The measure has never been used before.Protesters hold posters reading \"constitution\" during a demonstration in front of the presidential palace on Sunday.European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish Prime Minister from the opposition Civic Platform Party, warned last Thursday of \"dangerous consequences\" for Poland's standing on the world stage and said he had asked Duda for an urgent meeting.\"Bringing the courts under the control of the governing party in the manner proposed by the Law and Justice Party ... will ruin the already tarnished public opinion about Polish democracy,\" he said.A Trump effect?The public outcry over the plans had been partly overshadowed by recent high-profile visits to Poland by US President Donald Trump and the British royals.But the US State Department tweeted a warning Friday to Poland \"to ensure that any judicial reform does not violate (the) constitution & respects judicial independence.\"US urges #Poland to ensure that any judicial reform does not violate constitution & respects judicial independence. https://t.co/TwkCcm8Jnu\u2014 Department of State (@StateDept) July 21, 2017\nWhen asked whether the Trump administration would urge Duda to veto the measure, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: \"I am not aware if we will ask him to do that.\"CNN's Antonia Mortensen reported from Warsaw, Eliza Mackintosh reported from London.",

Key to the legislation is that current Supreme Court judges would be forced into early retirement and new judges would be appointed by the Justice Ministry.Protesters hold posters reading \"constitution\" during a protest in front of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.Read MoreThe President has 21 days to sign or veto the legislation. He is widely expected to approve it, but protesters are calling on him to reject it.Parliament's upper house, the Senate, approved the bill just before 2 a.m. on Saturday after 16 hours of debate, sparking mass protests in more than 100 cities across the country and a wave of condemnation from abroad. The lower house voted for the measure on Thursday.The move to control one of the last remaining independent government institutions has prompted concern in Washington and triggered warnings from the European Union that it is putting judicial independence at risk.Protesters on Sunday demonstrate in front of the Presidential Palace.The bill's passage could mark a turning point for the Eastern European country, one of the first former communist nations to join the European Union. A poll conducted by CNN affiliate TVN found that 55% of Poles said Duda should veto the court laws; 29% said he should not.Clock starts tickingAdam Bodnar, Poland's human rights ombudsman, described the law as the most important decision of Duda's term. Thousands of protesters gathered in Warsaw on Sunday evening. He and other critics of the bill admit the judiciary needs reform but disagree about the way in which the PiS has gone about it.\"It is a situation (where) you should repair your house, mend windows, paint walls, seal the leaking roof,\" said Bodnar. \"But you should not put explosives under foundations of the house.\"Since coming to power, the Law and Justice party has eroded other institutions and freedoms: The right to peaceful assembly has become more restricted, and new media laws have made it more difficult for the press to operate independently.'Dangerous consequences,' EU warnsA top EU official earlier this week threatened the use of Article 7, a mechanism that would allow for sanctions against Poland and possible suspension of its voting rights in the bloc.

He has 21 days to sign or veto the legislation, which would also give the justice minister the power to pick the judges' replacements.Protesters have poured into the streets in cities across Poland to denounce the measure, with many fearing the country's position as a Western democracy is hanging in the balance.\"This is the most important decisions (sic) of (Duda's) term; it's one of the most important decisions in the new Poland,\" said Adam Bodnar, Poland's human rights ombudsman.  A poll conducted by CNN affiliate TVN found that 55% of Poles said Duda should veto the court laws; 29% said he should not.Read MoreCritics of the bill point out the President does have an out, as the bill has glaring errors in its directives. The biggest mistake has one article saying the President elects three judges, while in another article it says the President elects five.Demonstrators came out and chanted \"traitors!\" and \"disgrace!\" shortly after the Senate approved the bill -- just before 2 a.m. local time -- following a 16-hour debate, TVN reported.\"This is a protest to a great extent about the future,\" Bodnar said. \"They've managed to make such huge protest because they were based on values and ideas and not under a particular party or banner.\"  Protesters demonstrate Friday outside the Polish Parliament as senators decide on the judiciary bill. Three protests are planned Sunday in Warsaw ahead of what is expected to be a big demonstration Monday evening urging Duda to veto the bill. He is due to meet the high court's chief justice Monday, a Senate statement said.The bill's passage could mark a turning point for the Eastern European country -- one of the first former communist nations to join the European Union. The move by the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, known as the PiS, to control one of the last remaining independent government institutions has prompted concern in Washington and triggered warnings from the European Union that it is putting judicial independence at risk.The party insists it is simply carrying out needed judicial reform.Protesters vow to carry onWarsaw resident Marcin Banaszkiewicz has been participating in protests since the proposal came to Parliament.\"I remember how my parents protested in 1989,\" he told CNN on Saturday, proud of the demonstrations. \"This is the same moment.\"  Banaszkiewicz, who's not a member of any political party, now waits to see whether the President will sign the measure.\"We will continue to meet in protest,\" he said. \"Until it is signed, there is hope.\"Andrzej Tomasz Celinski  said he was marching for the future of his 1-month-old son, Tomasz.  Celinski said Saturday he was not surprised the bill passed and that he had little hope it would be vetoed.  \"Some still hope that President Duda might veto this change in our judicial system,\" he said. \"But in the past he also showed that he is totally obedient to (the ruling party).\"But he said he sees a silver lining to the situation -- in an awakened millennial generation that is active in politics and may help vote in a new government in the future. Banaszkiewicz agreed, saying that if Duda signs the bill, the focus needs to be on upcoming elections.However, he and others said they worry that removing the judiciary's independence could compromise free and fair elections.Poland's Supreme Court determines the lawfulness of elections, and Bodnar, the human rights ombudsman, said \"it is quote probable that this changes that.\"Protesters hold candles  during a demonstration Friday night outside the Polish Parliament.  EU: Judicial independence at riskIn a sign of the growing concern, a top EU official on Wednesday threatened the use of Article 7 -- a mechanism that would allow for sanctions against Poland and possible suspension of its voting rights in the bloc. The measure has never been used before.\"Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary,\" said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission. \"Collectively, they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.\"European Council President Donald Tusk, a former Polish Prime Minister from the opposition Civic Platform party, warned Thursday of \"dangerous consequences\" for Poland's standing on the world stage and said he had asked Duda for an urgent meeting.\"Bringing the courts under the control of the governing party in the manner proposed by the Law and Justice party ... will ruin the already tarnished public opinion about Polish democracy,\" he said. Polish Ombudsman Adam Bodnar addresses a session of the Polish Senate on Friday. But Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected such concerns. \"The judicial reform bill in question will not affect the independence of courts or judges and seeks only to regain the citizens' respect for the judiciary,\" the ministry said. \"Reforms proposed in Poland are in the spirit of judicial systems in other European countries.\"In a televised address Thursday, Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo explained her party's effort toward what it says is judicial reform. \"We know the courts are performing badly. That's why we are answering the expectations of the Polish people, who want them to perform well and fairly,\" she said, according to state media. \"Today, this is not the case.\"If Duda does sign the measure into law, it sets up his government to clash with the European Union in Brussels. The bloc is set to reconvene to discuss Poland on July 26.Poland does have an EU ally -- Hungary -- and its support could derail attempts to pressure the country in corral the judiciary measures.\"Because of our own national interest, because of Europe's and Poland's interest, we must make clear that the inquisition offensive against Poland can never succeed because Hungary will use all legal options\" in the European Union to show solidarity with the Poles, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Saturday.'A political coup d'etat' The measure passed in the Senate early Saturday is one of four aimed at changing the judiciary. Last week, Duda approved the first law, which allows Parliament to appoint 15 of 25 members to the National Council of the Judiciary. The lower house of Parliament passed the latest bill Thursday.Protesters hold candles and shout slogans as they demonstrate Friday in front of the Polish Parliament.Grzegorz Drobiszewski, president of the Young Democrats Association, a youth group connected with Poland's largest opposition party, accused the PiS on Saturday of \"making a political coup d'etat\" and attempting to take full control over the judicial system.\"This is a clear violation of the principle of a tripartite power,\" he said. \"Legislative, executive and judicial power in one hand is a dictatorship.\" Wojciech Mosiejczuk, a game designer and filmmaker, posted an image on Twitter of the Senate vote count, describing it as the \"penultimate nail\" in the coffin of Poland's judicial system.This is the penultimate nail to the coffin of Polish judiciary #sejm #senat #Poland pic.twitter.com/w92WxGmDzh\u2014 Wojciech Mosiejczuk (@mosiejczuk) July 22, 2017\nGuy Verhofstadt, a Belgian lawmaker who leads the liberal grouping in the European Parliament, tweeted Saturday that he was confident those opposed to the bill would continue the fight.\"Polish citizens know Poland can only be strong & prosperous if democratic and part of the EU.

Despite patches of rain, brightly-colored crowds danced as music blared from trucks along the parade route with partygoers holding multi-colored banners and placards and others donning elaborate costumes. The annual Christopher Street Day parade recognizes the 1969 New York riots sparked by a police raid of a gay bar in the city. Seen by many as a turning point in the fight for gay rights, it has been celebrated in Germany since 1979.The Bundestag, Germany's parliament, recently passed a law that allows marriage between same-sex couples, finally giving them the same rights by marriage as for heterosexuals. Many had doubted if the day would ever come when same-sex marriage would be recognized. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her conservative CDU party had long opposed legalization, promoting \"traditional\" family values instead. But Merkel signaled a shift in her position last month, triggering a chain of events that lead to a vote.

It was also the fifth Tour de France victory for Britain's Team Sky, which first won the title in 2012 with Bradley Wiggins before Froome took it in 2013, 2015, 2016 and again this year. Froome received 500,000 euros ($583,000) for winning cycling's most grueling race, a 3,540km trek across four countries, 635 cities, over 23 mountain passes or climbs and watched by up to 12 million spectators.READ: What riding the Tour de France does to your legsREAD: 'A man with no platform is a lost man,' says Lance ArmstrongTough fightUnlike previous years, Froome's fourth title wasn't a given from the start, with the general classification going down to the wire and only being decided on the penultimate time trial on Saturday in Marseille. But Froome, who had entered the time trial with a narrow 23-second lead over Bardet and a 29-second lead over Uran, dealt his rivals a decisive blow when he finished third with a powerful ride in Marseille, extending his lead over Uran to 54 seconds. Bardet faded badly, slumping from second place to third in the overall standings at two minutes, 20 seconds behind Froome. \"Each time I've won the Tour, it's been so unique, so different, such a different battle to get to this moment,\" Froome said. \"They're all so special in their own way.

And if I win it has nothing to do with that, either.\"Victory Sunday would place Spieth alongside Jack Nicklaus as the only men to win three majors by the age of 24 -- he turns 24 Thursday.

'Emotionally draining'The 39-year-old Kuchar, who is regarded as one of the best current players not to have won a major, has had eight top-10 finishes in majors and was fourth in the Masters in April.

He found the green with an audacious drive on the par-four fifth but left his eagle putt agonizingly short. From then on the early fireworks petered out and he could only must a 69 for two under.Spieth's surgeSpieth, meanwhile, was forging ahead. Animated, always chuntering -- to caddie Michael Greller and himself -- and quick to acknowledge the outstretched hands of fans as he swept past, Spieth pushed his lead back to two over playing partner Kuchar with a second straight birdie at the eighth.The afternoon sun was being elbowed out of the way by a bank of deep purple clouds and an amber weather warning for thunderstorms was put in place.

He'd been watching the morning's coverage on TV and was full of trepidation, given the forecast of downpours to add to the wind.\"It wasn't a great feeling knowing we were coming into something harder than what we were watching,\" he said.The first drops of rain fell while he was on the third green -- about 3:30 p.m. -- but they were shortlived and only a hint of what was to come.

Spieth's white ball shone in the gloaming as it flew towards the sixth green. It caught the upslope and rolled back into a cavernous trap. Disbelieving, he bent down to grab some grass to throw again. He looked at his caddie with outstretched hands and they engaged in a lengthy discussion. The wind was still wreaking havoc.He splashed out and made par but just before 4:30 p.m. the sluice gates opened from above.Walking off the seventh green, umbrellas formed a virtual tunnel either side of the path. Despite the damp, Spieth first-bumped a row of beery American fans leaning over the ropes.Playing partner Henrik Stenson, however, was in a darker mood, a combination of the weather, a bogey four and the fact his rental house was burgled Thursday.

Poulter was inspired by the rousing home support, but particularly a small boy of \"about five or six\" who followed him all the way.\"He was in a little yellow jacket, it was pouring down with rain, he didn't have an umbrella, but with his dad,\" said Poulter, who is bidding to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992. \"And he kept saying, 'Come on, Poults. Come on, Poults.' \"I mean, that's nice. These fans are hardened. For them to stay out in those cold, windy, rainy conditions, it's special.\"'Nervous'Spieth was still out there, drawing on his experience from 12 months ago when he played through \"sheets of sideways rain\" on Friday afternoon at Royal Troon. These conditions weren't as bad, he said, and with the wind dropping he was able to make an eagle on the par-five 15th to get to seven under for a spell, \"a place he didn't think he would get to.\" READ: How a car crash shaped Koepka's US Open destinyKoepka couldn't make any inroads as the rain continued to fall, leaving Spieth once more in pole position.

        "content": "Story highlightsTurnberry 1977 remembered as the \"Duel in the Sun\"Watson & Nicklaus battled in a final-round shootoutThe Championship was decided on the last hole (CNN)The red-hot summer of 1977, the year a gap-toothed twenty-something from Kansas took down golf's greatest in a final-round scrap like no other. Forty years on and it is a battle which is still regarded as one of the finest sporting duels in history. Follow @cnnsport\n\nLast year's British Open thrilled and captivated as Henrik Stenson versus Phil Mickelson unfolded at Royal Troon in an extraordinary contest where records were broken. It is Stenson versus Mickelson which has the numbers, the history-making scores. Stenson's 20-under 264 is the lowest score in major history and the 41-year-old Swede's final-round eight-under-par 63 equaled the lowest score for a major championship round. But that shootout did not come down to the final putt. It did not involve Jack Nicklaus, the most decorated player in history, being taken down by a player who would become the greatest links golfer of them all. Read MoreTurnberry 1977, a golfing bout so good that it is fondly remembered as the \"Duel in the Sun.\" Mention it to golf fans not even born four decades ago and they will knowingly nod. Books have been written about it, a restaurant named after it and the 18th hole at Turnberry has been renamed after this never to be forgotten contest. As the Open takes place in Britain this week, we remember the match that made history. Watson was a two-time major winner up against Nicklaus, winner of 14 major titlesREAD: Links, lies and ladybirds: The Open 2017 READ: Beacons of beauty -- the world's greatest golf links Scorched earth on a July Saturday \"I remember every one of his shots. And every one of mine.\" Tom Watson. The 27-year-old Watson and Nicklaus, 10 years his senior, had matched each other in the third round, shooting 65s to go into the final day three shots clear of Ben Crenshaw in third place. All eyes were on the American pair. There was only one show in town.  Such was the scramble to get to the course to watch the fireworks, a few players needed police escorts through nearby farms to avoid the early-morning traffic jam on the single road that led to Turnberry Golf Course. (L-R) Watson plays from the ninth fairway, watched by Jack Nicklaus and his caddieWould it be Nicklaus or Watson? Nicklaus, the blond statesman who had won 14 of his 18 majors by this time, had affectionately become known as the \"Golden Bear.\" Watson had won the Open in Carnoustie in 1975 and his first Masters earlier that year, seeing off Nicklaus down the last stretch. They were premier performers of their time and would, in the final 18 holes on Scotland's west coast, produce a show for the ages.Contributing to the sense of theater was the British weather. Rain had become an unfamiliar sight in this part of the world during that sticky summer. The course had been scorched; the rough was wispy straw, footsteps created dust clouds which hung in the air on an already chokingly-tense day. A famous photograph of Nicklaus, Watson and their caddies sitting on a rock as a storm passed over during the third roundA stampede, caddies fearing the worst\"I thought for sure Jack was going to get trampled.\" Angelo Argea, Nicklaus' caddie. Nicklaus started in sparkling form, going three shots clear after four holes. Would class prevail?Watson, the young talent retaining his poise despite being in the company of greatness, clawed himself closer to the 14-time major winner, sinking a 15-foot putt for a birdie on the 5th and following it up with another monster putt on the 8th. Kerpow! This was golf resembling the opening strip of a Marvel comic. A bogey on the 9th put the Missouri-native one behind, but it was game on and the crowd knew it. Thousands jostled for prime position, necks craned, eyes were as wide as novelty-shop eyeballs. Fans knew they were witnessing something special and, on the 9th hole, the masses spilled onto the fairway. Crowds gather during the final round at Turnberry 1977\"I feared for my man,\" Nicklaus' caddie, Angelo Argea, would later say, describing the scene as a stampede. Watson described the crowd as \"out of control\" as they attempted to dash in front of the players, readying themselves for the next shot. Nicklaus, sporting a canary yellow jumper and navy trousers for the finale, refused to play until the gallery retreated behind the cordon and Watson waited with him. For 15 minutes they held their friendly fire before resuming their epic battle. \"It was certainly not the genteel, well-behaved galleries you always heard about at the Open,\" Roger Maltbie, who would finish 21 shots behind that day, would tell Michael Corcoran, the author of \"Duel In The Sun.\" WATCH: Living Golf -- the Open preview 'This is what it's about'\"You've got him now, sir, you've got him now,\" Alfie Fyles, Watson's caddie. Though all around them was a wild frenzy, Watson and Nicklaus kept their calm. Nicklaus, already a two-time winner of golf's oldest major, skipped ahead, draining a 22ft birdie on the 12th to regain a two-shot lead before Watson struck back on the 13th. Two holes later, Watson -- who in a garish green T-shirt and checked trousers stood out for his attire as well as his play -- produced the shot of the day. Having missed the green, Watson had left himself with a 60ft birdie putt. On and on the ball rolled and rolled until, astonishingly, it dropped into the cup. The pair were level, tied on 11-under par with three holes to play. The crowd roared in approval. Jack Nicklaus watches the ball roll towards the hole on the 15th green  \"It changed the momentum of the round for Jack and it changed the momentum of the round for me,\" Watson would later say. Onwards they marched, onto the 16th tee, and it was here that Watson looked at his rival and uttered the often repeated words: \"This is what it's all about, isn't it?\" \"You bet it is,\" came Nicklaus' response. For another 40 minutes, the knee-knocking tension continued.       With one hole to go, Nicklaus missed a birdie chance and, for the first time, Watson edged ahead. It would all come down to the 72nd hole of the tournament.Nicklaus got his big stick out of the bag on the 18th, but pulled it into the rough, near a gorse bush. His approach shot with an eight-iron came to the rescue, the ball magically kicking onto the green, but the great champion had left himself a 35-yard putt. \"You've got him now, sir, you've got him now,\" said Watson's caddie Alfie Fyles, who had badly sprained his wrist in the stampede. The final hole, the championship decider\"I don't know what game those other two guys were playing,\" Hubert Green. The new pacesetter, who had just sent a 178-yard 7-iron two feet from the cup, was not one to tempt fate. He told his caddie that Nicklaus would hole the putt, and he was proved right. Birdie for Nicklaus. Over to Watson. Could his nerve hold?Watson waited for the crowd's din to subside, but on an on the spectators roared as they marveled at Nicklaus' artistry. As Watson lined up, the fans were, in Watson's words, \"still going wild.\"But Watson could wait no more. He picked up his marker and that is when Nicklaus raised his hands to silence the crowd. Within seconds it was quiet enough to hear a pin drop. Watson beat Nicklaus by a shot\"I hit it right center and the Open Championship was mine,\" Watson reminisced. Nicklaus put an arm around the shoulder of the new champion and told his conqueror: \"I gave you my best shot, but it wasn't good enough.\"Visit cnn.com/golf for more news and videosThe pair strode off, immortality assured. They had lapped the field, finishing 10 and 11 shots clear of the third-placed player. \"I won this golf tournament,\" Hubert Green, that player in third, would famously say. \"I don't know what game those other two guys were playing.\"",

After a couple of near-misses, he finally broke his major duck when he won the US Open last year and is now the world's top-ranked golfer and joint-favorite to win the Open, which began Thursday at Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England. He has become one of the sport's richest players with a string of lucrative endorsement contracts, including German sportswear company Adidas and Swiss luxury watch brand Hublot. Johnson doubled his annual earnings from endorsements and prize money to $40 million on the back of winning his first major and becoming world No. 1, Hambric said.'Accidental sports agent'Although Hambric has been a golf agent for 40 years, his entry into the world of sports was \"almost accidental.\"Rocky HambricA tax accountant based in Dallas, Texas, Hambric had become friends with pro golfer Larry Nelson, who had asked him for some business advice in the late 1970s.\"After doing a couple of years of that, Larry came to me one day and said 'I think you should be doing this as your primary occupation,'\" Hambric recalled.When Nelson won the second of three majors at the 1983 US Open, Hambric decided to take the plunge. He sold his financial advisory business to his partner to become a full-time golf agent.\"It grew fairly quickly,\" said Hambric who, at one stage, represented the four winners of the major championships held between the 1986 and 1987 PGA Championships.How to find the next big thing?JUST WATCHEDDustin Johnson wins 2016 U.S. OpenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDustin Johnson wins 2016 U.S. Open 02:26Fast-forward to 2017, Hambric Sports represents 33 golfers, including this year's US Open winner, Brooks Koepka, and Scotland's Martin Laird.

        "content": "Story highlightsMichael Phelps in awe of British swimmerPeaty tipped to be unbeaten all careerLikened to \"Ed Moses of the pool\" (CNN)Olympic champion Adam Peaty remembers the turning point in his life as if it were yesterday. That moment when he morphed from a teenager preparing for a night out drinking with friends to an elite athlete determined to become an unstoppable force in the water. Five years ago, Peaty was a 17-year-old about to set off for a night in his hometown of Derby when he checked his mobile phone. It was then that he noticed that Craig Benson, a fellow Brit whom he had competed against throughout the age levels, was about to compete at the London 2012 Olympics. Follow @cnnsport\n\nIn that instance, Peaty changed.\"It was then I realized I wasn't taking it seriously enough,\" the 22-year-old tells CNN. Read More'One of the grossest swims I've ever seen' By Rio 2016, the Briton's transformation was complete. He made such waves at the Rio Olympics, that Michael Phelps -- the most decorated swimmer of all time -- was opened mouthed at his world record-breaking performance in the 100m breaststroke. READ: I locked myself in a room for four days - Phelps\"It's one of the grossest swims I've ever seen. I'm just glad I don't have to race him,\" said the American, the owner of 23 Olympic gold medals. Peaty has some way to go to match Phelps' achievements, but the Englishman has made no secret of his desire to be the Phelps of the breaststroke.In the final of the 100 meters in Rio, Peaty won by 1.56 seconds in a race often decided by a fingertip. A mere second separated the remaining seven swimmers in the final.Five-time Olympian Mark Foster believes his fellow Briton is so good, he will remain a dominant force in the pool until he decides to hang up his swimming goggles.\"As long as he stays fit and injury free, I can't see anyone touching him until he retires,\" Foster told CNN ahead of the FINA World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. \"He's that good.\"Physiologically giftedREAD: How turning 'iron' propelled Hosszu to gold READ: The boy who beat childhood hero PhelpsIt was during London 2012 that Peaty and his coach Mel Marshall, who by then had been teaching the swimmer for three years, devised a plan to ensure he would be the best in the world in four years' time. For Foster, he argues the talent was always there but the hard work was the missing ingredient.\"He's obviously physiologically gifted,\" adds the former world champion. \"He's not a coordinated athlete necessarily, but breaststroke was just what he was born to do and he works incredibly hard at it.\"At 1.91 meters and with a monstrous wing span, Peaty is the perfect shape for elite breaststroke. But he stands out because of what he does underneath the surface. At major championships, he has grown accustomed to rival coaches following his every stroke from pool side. His body becomes an almost inverted bend from shin and knee, which he calls \"a hyperextension of sorts.\"READ: Five reasons to watch the World Aquatics ChampionshipsHe jokingly describes himself as \"a bit of a freak,\" but his performances are other worldly and no one has even got within 1.3 seconds of his best 100m time. No small feat in an event which lasts 57 seconds.The Ed Moses of swimmingPeaty celebrates winning gold and setting a new world record in the men's 100m breaststroke at Rio 2016Peaty might not have broken his 100m breakstroke world record in Monday's final at the ongoing World Aquatics Championships, but he easily retained his title.When it came to the 50m breaststroke on Tuesday, the Briton broke the world record twice in a day, becoming the first person to go under 26 seconds as he clocked 25.95 secs to reach Wednesday's 50m breaststroke final. \"This morning I came in nice and relaxed,\" he told the BBC following the first heat. \"I wasn't even up for it that much so it is crazy.\"In comparing Peaty with Ed Moses -- the 400m hurdler who won 107 consecutive finals between 1987 and 1997 -- Foster prophetically told CNN before the championships: \"He'll win and he'll be quick, and he'll continue to make this his event. It's a bit like Ed Moses, really.\"OLYMPIC CHAMPION pic.twitter.com/l4Kjyj0UbE\u2014 Adam Peaty (@adam_peaty) 8 August 2016 Peaty does not lack confidence but it stops short of arrogance.\"My coach wouldn't let me get arrogant nor my family -- Mel shoots me down every day,\" he explains.He likes to downplay his achievements in the pool by saying \"I'm no good at anything else,\" but Britain's first medalist of the Rio Games can also talk for Britain.In the immediate aftermath of Rio -- Team GB's most successful ever Olympics with a total of 67 medals -- people would congregate outside Peaty's family home, hoping to get a glimpse of the world record holder. He has since moved out, having bought a home of his own. \"The hardest thing was adjusting to what I'd done,\" he says of the post-Rio haze, in which he took two months off and embraced his penchant for eating burgers.Visit CNN.com/swimming or more news and videosBut despite having achieved the long-burning ambition of Olympic gold, he insists he is as motivated as ever.\"It's who works the hardest that wins,\" he says, downplaying his natural talent and freakish leg kicks. \"You see people fall off after a Games, but that won't be the case for me. I think I can do it again.\"",

Mayor George Kyritsis told CNN Greece that at least two people -- a Swedish and a Turkish national -- have died. The quake's epicenter was just 16.2 kilometers (10.1 miles) east-northeast of Kos, in the sea between Greece and Turkey, the US Geological Survey said.     At least five people on Kos were seriously injured after the quake hit, South Aegean region Gov. George Hadjimarkos told Greek TV channel Skai.Hadjimarkos said that the two fatalities occurred when the roof collapsed at a bar in a 1920s building in the old part of Kos. That area of town is known for its bars and is popular with tourists. Cracks are seen at the main port on the island of Kos on Friday following the 6.7-magnitude earthquake.Tourists wait outside the terminal at the airport on Kos. Read MoreAbout 200,000 tourists were on the island at the time of the quake, according to Konstantina Svinou, president of the Hoteliers Association of Kos. Svinou told local broadcaster ERT that ferries are currently unable to dock at the port of Kos due to damage and that local authorities are working to restore services. Over the strait in Turkey, the Kandilli Research Center at Bogazici University reported that 80 people had been injured in the country, but said there had been no fatalities.A man in Bitez, a resort town west of Bodrum in Turkey sleeps on the beachfront following the earthquake in the early hours of Friday morning. A Kos cafe is littered with rubble following the strong earthquake.Vactioners across the region abandoned their hotel rooms -- as seen here in Bitez, a resort town west of Bodrum in Turkey -- amid the aftershocks on Friday morning. English holidaymaker Mary Marioni, 73, had been staying on the island for the last two weeks with her husband when the quake hit.\"The hotel is still standing but we can't get to our rooms as many were badly damaged, so we are still around the pool. We slept on sunbeds from 1:45 a.m. under the stars,\" Marioni told CNN. \"Everyone is still very shattered. We were rocked in our beds twice, then we all went outside. We have been experiencing small tremors all the time since the two big ones but it's nothing in comparison.\"A damaged mosque on the island of Kos.The quake's epicenter between Kos and Bodrum mean that many in Greece and Turkey felt the powerful tremors. The USGS estimated that approximately 200,000 people in Greece and Turkey felt strong to very strong shaking from the earthquake. Video from Kos shows rubble in the streets and shops trashed. Photos and video from the area show that a number of the island's historic buildings have suffered extensive damage.A toppled column is seen in the harbor area on the island of Kos.Cracks are seen on the facade of a church on the island of Kos.An eyewitness, identified only as Eva, said she saw a mosque that had been razed by the quake. She added that there were \"many\" people injured who were covered in blood. \"The table started to shake,\" at 1:31 a.m., she told CNN affiliate CNN Greece, adding that the situation was \"chaos.\"\"Never before had I experienced something like that,\" she said. \"I was in Athens during the 1999 earthquake but it was not like this one. The sea began to rise and everybody started to run toward higher ground.\"She said people in the streets were running in panic. \"What else they could do? They were falling over each other.\"On Friday morning, emergency crews were already working ot assess the damage to historical and religious structures, like this mosque, on Kos. Seaside resort struckThe epicenter was also close to the Turkish port city of Bodrum, a seaside resort popular with tourists and Turks alike. It is also a major transit point for migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe. A video posted to Instagram by Firuz Anl\u0131 shows people in Bodrum experiencing the tremor. The group is celebrating a birthday on a seaside patio, when the lights appear to go out and several centimeters of water spill onto deck.    Depreme yakaland\u0131k.... Allah beterinden korusun.... A post shared by Firuz Anl\u0131 (@firuzanli) on Jul 20, 2017 at 5:26pm PDT\nCNN Senior International Correspondent Arwa Damon, who was staying in a village about half an hour away from Bodrum, said she felt the quake strike at about 1:30 a.m. (6:30 p.m. ET) and that it lasted for about ten seconds. At least a dozen aftershocks shook the area over the three hours following the initial quake, she said.  Damon added that there were no reports of collapsed buildings, although she did see some families camped outdoors, fearful of buildings weakened by the quake and possible, subsequent aftershocks.A hospital was reportedly evacuated, she said, as its mezzanine was damaged. A car is enveloped in rubble on Kos in the wake of the earthquake. Bodrum Mayor Mehmet Kocadon, speaking to Turkey's state news agency Anadolu, said one road had collapsed and some boats were damaged as the lines holding them were snapped by strong waves.Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes, with smaller ones taking place in the country on a regular basis. This one, however, was jarring \"not only because of the intensity of it but also because the aftershocks went on for so long,\" Damon said. Firefighters assess damaged buildings in the early hours of Friday morning in Kos. Bodrum is about 700 kilometers (435 miles) from Istanbul and also from Ankara. A quake with a magnitude of between 6.0 and 6.9 is classified as \"strong.\" According to the USGS, there were at least six aftershocks of magnitude 4.0 or greater.CNN meteorologist Karen Maginess said that the tremblor, which occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km (6 miles), is considered a major earthquake. Aftershocks will continue for weeks, maybe months, she said. CNN's Steve Almasy in Atlanta and Arwa Damon in Turkey contributed to this report. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou reported from Greece.",

Even when she got to an academy, Kaur says she continued to play against the boys. Though if she always harbored hopes of eventually wearing India's iconic blue kit, surely even Thursday's history-making innings were beyond her wildest dreams.With her team faltering on 35-2 in the 10th over, Kaur made her way to the crease in an attempt to stabilize the batting and set a reasonable target for Australia to chase.What followed was a performance of flair, elegance and incredible skill, as the 28-year-old eventually posted a score of 171 off just 115 balls, including seven sixes and 20 fours.It proved to be a match-winning knock, as India amassed a total of 281-4. In reply, Australia were bowled out for 245. While from the outside onlookers knew they were witnessing something truly special, at the crease Kaur says she was truly unaware as to the enormity of her achievement.Kaur's unbeaten 171 from 115 balls is being talked about as one of the most spectacular innings in limited-overs cricket.\"At that moment in time I was just so focused on batting and playing the next ball. You don't think about anything else really.\" She accepts the women's game has languished for perhaps too long behind the men's, partly due to the lack of flamboyance and characters at the crease.But a new generation of female cricketers, now spearheaded by Kaur and her take on the Sehwag-inspired \"see ball, hit ball\" approach to batting, are beginning to change all that.From only 51 balls, Kaur scored the remaining 121 runs.The fact remains, however, that England are favorites to lift the trophy. The hosts have prevailed in their previous two World Cup final appearances, beating New Zealand in 1993 and 2009.India, conversely, has never tasted victory -- they came closest in 2005, finishing runners up to Thursday's beaten opponents Australia.An Innings of a lifetime , Harmanpreet Kaur . What wonderful clean hitting. More than 60% of India's runs.Fan ! Over to the Bowlers now. pic.twitter.com/xZlIB2SW4x\u2014 Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) July 20, 2017\nKaur, though, believes her team has reason to be optimistic going into Sunday's showdown at the home of cricket.\"We are confident going into the final,\" she says. \"We've beaten England in One Day (format) already this year so that helps us a lot.\"In fact, that defeat against India was England's sole ODI defeat of 2017.Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosKaur grew up idolizing India's former captain Sehwag. Now she knows victory against England could make her and her teammates idols to millions.\"I think we've done really well to get to the final anyway,\" she says. \"But of course winning the final will provide a great opportunity to inspire the future generation of young girls in India.\"",

It is the latest attempt by state media to explain away youth protests that have gripped the nation in recent months. The anti-corruption demonstrations held in March and June, organized by opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, were the largest in Russia in years. In late May, Navalny was captured on camera spinning the small hand toy while awaiting trial in Moscow.  Russia's consumer protection agency, Rospotrebnadzor, urged parents in a statement to be vigilant when buying the \"aggressively promoted\" fidget spinners and to supervise children playing with the toy. The watchdog has apparently teamed up with researchers to \"study the influence\" of the device on young people.Fidget spinners -- a small gadget that started as an aide for children with attention disorders like ADD -- have become a global phenomenon among middle school-aged students. The toy, which has reached Tamagotchi-level popularity, has been banned in some schools in the United States as a distraction.Young Russians are fed up, and the Kremlin has taken noticeRead MoreThe Russian statement was released on the heels of a report on state-owned Rossiya 24, which claimed that the popular toys have been sold at anti-corruption rallies to lure in young supporters.\"Probably it is not a coincidence that they started selling the spinners at events by the opposition,\" Rossiya 24 host Alexey Kazakov said.In the report, Kazakov cites an Omsk-based journalist's suggestion that the gadget could be used as \"an instrument for zombifying\" users, triggering a kind of \"hypnosis.\"It was not the channel's first segment on the device, which featured in another news broadcast that aired last month.Fidget spinners \"were already seen in the hands of a non-systemic opposition,\" Kazakov claimed in the piece. Kazakov's co-anchor, Nikolay Sokolov, raised suspicion over the provenance and dissemination of the toy.\"It's a mystery why it only recently became so popular in Russia. Who is pushing it into the masses?\" Sokolov asked, suggesting that fidget spinners had been sold at an opposition protest against corruption on June 12.Russian independent journalist Alexey Kovalev was among those to call the bizarre broadcast into question, tweeting: \"Fidget spinners are used by opposition to pacify followers and distract them from real issues. Because that's what opposition usually does.\"CNN's Mary Ilyushina and Yon Pomrenze contributed to this report from Moscow.",

Still an outcast to the race, instead he has set up a daily podcast recorded from a small office at the end of the garden of his Austin home, and at occasional other venues nearby.Does Lance Armstrong still deserve a platform in cycling? CNN readers respond\nThe 45-year-old is as knowledgeable as you'd expect for a veteran of 13 Tours. Topics have ranged widely from criticizing race organizers for ending the Tour's Queen stage on a treacherous descent to having a hangover as a result of too much ros\u00e9 wine during his July 4 celebrations.Fresh off the airwaves of his latest podcast, known as \"Stages,\" Armstrong tells CNN: \"I had two platforms before [his public mea culpa to doping four years ago]: cycling and cancer.\"I'm not saying it's right or wrong but they went overnight, not just the cycling but the cancer. A man with no platform is a lost man.\"Read MoreThis is not Armstrong's first podcast. For the past few months, he has had one called \"The Forward\" [disassociating himself from the past] in which guests have ranged from the author Malcolm Gladwell to the former NFL quarterback  Brett Favre.But while that has been well received, Armstrong has been blown away both by the listening numbers and the positive feedback of his latest venture over the airwaves, in which he shares the stage with radio host JB Hager.READ: Prudhomme - The race must go onAt the time of speaking to CNN, he was averaging 300,000 listeners a day -- double that of \"The Forward\" -- with the numbers rising. Much to the chagrin of the Tour organizers no doubt, it has been something of a hit of the race.'Not concerned by negativity'Surely with his past doping indiscretions on the bike there has been some negative feedback?\"The team deal with the emails and I'm sure there are plenty of emails that tell me to 'go f* yourself',\" he says.\"But I'm not overly concerned by the negativity. If someone wants to fire off and make a personal attack, it doesn't affect me. If it's a comment on the accuracy of the show then I'd try to fix that.\"The feedback on Facebook Live, Twitter and Instagram's been good.\"Lance Armstrong: He was a 'tragic hero'\"Stages\" is just part of Armstrong's return to cycling. In the months leading up to it, he was getting back on his bike more and more for general fitness, as well as paying closer attention to the professional peloton.Armstrong lists off some of the comments he has received. \"I had one saying 'I didn't want to listen but I did and it's good',\" or you have people saying 'I shouldn't like it'. One guy called it 'his guilty pleasure'.\"READ: Armstrong back at the Tour de FranceBut the seven-time Tour winner, whose race victories have since been erased from the annals for his doping past, knows his cycling return will not be received well by everyone.\"It's the first time in years that I've got something to give me a platform,\" he said. \"People can choose not to listen but I'm my own boss with this and nobody tells me what to do.\"The question is what next -- platform wise -- for Armstrong? He has had some talks with parties about his future.But taking his podcast to France next year is not on the agenda. For one, he knows in all certainty he would be blacklisted.Is this the world's toughest bike race?\"Hey, it's never say never isn't it?\" he says. \"But I have very little interest in doing that. I can watch the Tour in my house and then walk across to my studio. \"God bless those on the Tour having to drive three hours every day between the stages. That's miserable -- you need a vacation at the end of it. This works perfectly for me right now.\"READ: Day-to-day life is positive for ArmstrongBut of the wider question of his future, Armstrong has no idea what lies ahead, with a $100 million lawsuit looming from the US government for fraud for doping while racing in the US Postal Service colors.\"There's one thing left that you all know about, that's a significant fight so to speak,\" he says of a case which begins on November 6. \"That's looming and I've got no choice but to fight the case.

It was fun to do, like 'Stages.'\"Have your say From the peloton to the podcast, Armstrong continues to prove a divisive figure.Asked if the 45-year-old still deserves a platform in the sport, here's what social media users around the world had to say. \"Lance brought a lot of good to the world of cycling and cancer,\" said Katrina Kraus. \"Let the world forgive, let him return to cycling and let LiveStrong have their hero back.\"Vanessa Baumann asked why the public is ready to forgive the actions of some athletes and not others, adding: \"That inspiration and the will to be strong and live that he has given me can never be taken away.\"Others contended his doping merely \"leveled the playing field\" in an era when cheating was rife. But, six years on from his retirement, not everyone was ready to forgive the fallen star.Nancy Pope conceded it was Armstrong that initially got her interested in the sport, but stressed \"What he does with himself couldn't matter less to me.\"\"He has to live with it,\" posted Tom Cole, saying the cyclist's downfall was \"his own doing.\"\"Maybe all his sins can't be forgiven, but one should also remember his contributions,\" said Bernd Ingram.Do you think Lance Armstrong still deserves a platform in cycling?

In 2017 it's all about ice baths and kale.Yet for all the detailed pre-race preparation and recovery after each day's stage, there's one mystery cycling can't solve: the phenomenon of \"good legs\" -- or \"bonne jambes\" in French.On any particular morning, seemingly for no real reason at all, a cyclist will wake up feeling especially sprightly.Read MoreThe legs don't tire as quickly, if at all, and even the steepest of mountain climbs seemingly flatten as the rider begins their ascent.For amateur cyclists, it's said \"good legs\" can occur as little as five times throughout their riding lives -- each time is a blessing and the day is fondly remembered for years.READ: This is what pro cycling does to your legsOf course, for the professionals it's a more common occurrence -- though not by much -- and riders at this year's Tour de France will need as many \"good legs\" as they can get.The 104th edition of cycling's most prestigious race sees the riders tackle a grueling 23-day, 21-stage, 3,540-kilometer route that takes in 23 mountain climbs and affords competitors just two rest days.This includes five of France's mountain ranges: the Vosges, Jura, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, Massif central and the Alps.Some of Le Tour's most iconic climbs include:Col du Tourmalet (2,115m): Introduced in 1910, French rider Octave Lapize was the first to go over its summit.Col d'Izoard (2,360m): Introduced in 1922, Louison Bobet of France was victorious in 1950, 1953 and 1954 and this year's race sees the climb's first ever summit finish.Mont Ventoux (1,912m): Introduced in 1951, three-time winner and current yellow jersey holder Chris Froome made history last year by running up the mountain after a crash forced him to abandon his bike.Alpe d'Huez (1,860m): Introduced in 1952, Frenchman Thibaut Pinot won the last summit finish in 2015.

Often his palm-down hand gesture would will the ball to slow as it charged holewards. The longer game, too, was occasionally off kilter, mainly blown about by an early Irish Sea wind, which has permanently bent the Birkdale trees to its ferocious will over the years.On the 10th, Spieth -- black puffy vest over grey, longsleeve shirt -- pulled his second shot onto a grassy bank left of the green. A little girl spotted it and handed it to her dad. The father was mortified and ordered her to drop it. The ball was replaced before Spieth arrived, but recognising a sticky spot he told caddie Michael Greller, \"Let's just get out of here with a five.\" But he pulled off a miraculous recovery for a tap-in to save his par four and remain three under.'Red-faced'From the lofty tee looking down over the 13th, Spieth carved his drive right. \"Fore,\" he bellowed, shocking oblivious passers-by. The ball found the right rough, and while Spieth was assessing his options at its side, an orange-jacketed marshal, trying to stop the gallery using camera phones, trod on it. Spieth threw his hands in the air, shook his head and called over the match referee. He was awarded a free drop.Preparing for his shot, he kept up the perpetual conversation with Greller, a former maths teacher. \"Wind 45 degrees off the right? No need to be aggressive here. I like this club, huh?\"JUST WATCHEDHenrik Stenson goes jet-skiing with the Claret JugReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHenrik Stenson goes jet-skiing with the Claret Jug 10:08He fired the ball forward with a nine-iron, a beauty onto the green, to gasps and cheers from the crowd. They've taken to the young master over here.The offending marshal's red face clashed with his jacket, but he told CNN he hadn't seen the ball. Did Spieth say anything to him? \"He heffed and jeffed, as they do. Never mind, he'll get over it. He's on the green now.\"He more than got over it, and added further birdies at 14 and 17 either side of a stunning par save from the bunker on 16 -- his \"shot of the day\" -- for a two-stroke lead over the then clubhouse leader Ian Poulter of England.\"Things are in check. It's just about keeping it consistent,\" said Spieth, who fueled himself up on a breakfast of eggs, bacon, avocado on toast and orange juice.  His meeting with Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, occurred on a recent vacation to Cabo San Lucas with a crew that also included NBA legend Michael Jordan, former Masters champion Fred Couples and NFL star Dwight Freeney.READ: Spieth renews Tiger Woods comparisons with 10th title before 24 Photos: Best Open golf coursesThe British Open rotates around 10 of the best links golf courses in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Some had experienced both.Read More\"Reasons (for physical violence) were misconduct or poor performance of the students, but also arbitrariness by the educators,\" the report said.Forty-nine people, including school staff, are alleged to have taken part in the abuse, nine of whom are accused of sexually interfering with the children. It is not known if a criminal investigation will begin.Reports of abuse at the German school first emerged in 2010.The boarding school of the famed Domspatzen choir taken in 2010.Former musical director at the school, Georg Ratzinger, the brother of former Pope Benedict, apologized to the victims in a newspaper interview at the time, saying he wasn't aware of any sexual abuse.However, Ratzinger admitted he, too, slapped children as discipline. \"I did have a very bad conscience doing it, though,\" he said in the interview.'Musical bests'The Domspatzen, which literally means \"cathedral sparrows\" in German, is a centuries-old Catholic boys choir, based at St Peter's Cathedral in Regensburg, which has performed all over the world.\"The whole educational system was based on musical bests and thus the success of the choir. Victims reports were not taken seriously,\" the report's authors wrote.Lawyer Ulrich Weber presents his report during a press conference on July 18, in Regensburg.The German school has yet to release a statement on the report's findings, but the report said efforts have already been made to remedy \"former organizational weakness.\"\"The transparency and willingness to cooperate between the leaders of the Domspatzen and the bishopric in relation to this investigation is evaluated very positively,\" the report said.Many of the offenses occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, with 98 victims from 1960-69 and 168 victims from 1970-79, the report said.It suggests the majority of the abuse took place in the pre-school, or Vorschule, which moved to Etterzhausen in the late 1940s, then to nearby Pielenhofen from 1981 to 2013. A boarding school in Regensburg has catered for students aged 11 to 18 since 1952.Many victims described how moving from Etterzhausen or Pielenhofen to Regensburg was a big relief. \"After Etterzhausen Regensburg seemed almost like paradise,\" said one victim. \"In Regensburg there was somehow the feeling that we'd got out of the ghetto,\" wrote another.\"In all three areas of the Vorschule -- school, choir/music education and boarding school -- violence was used daily,\" said the report. \"As well as physical violence, forms of psychological and social violence were constantly present.\"Diocese: 'We have learned a lot'Regensburg diocese did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, but Michael Fuchs, the Vicar General of Regensburg diocese since 2005, told a news conference Tuesday: \"We all made mistakes and have learned a lot. We see today that we could have done things better and sooner.\"Fuchs said he hoped that the abuse victims would be able to accept the diocese's apology.Timeline: A look at the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandals\"Reading the reports and the comments of the victims about what happened back then and having numerous conversations, we know how [the victims] are suffering to this day. It is something that weighs heavily and something that is very upsetting. All we can do is to apologize in the name of the perpetrators.\"Fuchs also told reporters that Ratzinger had said he failed to understand the scale of the abuses.\"He is and was a passionate musician, priest and educator and he's an emotional person, who also slapped students, especially in the beginning. He also stated that in an interview and regrets it,\" Fuchs said.\"He said multiple times that he wasn't aware of sexual abuse, except for a case in 1958. He said he wrongly assessed the scale of these abuses that occurred in pre-school. He received hints over and over again but he didn't pay enough attention to them. He apologized to the victims in an interview and I can't see that he changed his view on this.\" 'Important step forward'Father Hans Zollner, a Jesuit priest from Regensburg who is a member of Pope Francis' commission to protect children, set up in 2014 to help combat clerical sex abuse, told Vatican Radio that the independent report was an \"important step forward.\"The investigation showed that Bishop Rudolf Voderholzer of Regensburg \"has taken seriously all the allegations, that he did not shy away from all that would ensue,\" Zollner said, and his actions \"will bring at least the chance of some justice for the abused.\"Allegations of historic child abuse in Catholic institutions have repeatedly emerged across the Western world in recent decades.In early 2017, an Australian report estimated about 7% of Australian priests had been accused of abusing more than 4,000 children in Catholic churches and schools between 1950 and 2015.CNN's Judith Vonberg, Sally Manuela Eshun and Milena Veselinovic contributed to this report.",

Marcelin, 40, and Francine, 37, Dumoulin went missing on August 15, 1942, after leaving to milk their cows in a meadow near their home. They never returned to their family, including their six children. A worker found the frozen bodies of a man and a woman last week during routine maintenance. The corpses were preserved in the receding Tsanfleuron glacier, near a slew of trendy ski resorts at 2,600 meters (8,500 feet) above sea level. \"From afar, it looked like small rocks, but there were too many in the same place,\" noted nearby Glacier 3000 resort director Bernhard Tschannen in an interview with Radio\u00a0Television Swisse.Francine (left) and Marcelin Dumoulin went missing from their Swiss farm in 1942.\nWhen he got closer, he noticed a collection of frozen accessories -- backpacks, watches, mess kits, a glass bottle and boots -- all of which dated back several decades. Read MoreDecked in World War II-era clothing, the duo was frozen close together. Their bodies have since been airlifted from the Alps. An inspector examines the belongings found alongside the couple.The couple's youngest daughter, 79-year-old Marceline Udry-Dumoulin, told Swiss paper Le Matin their children had never stopped looking for them.\"We spent our whole lives looking for them, without stopping. We thought that we could give them the funeral they deserved one day,\" she said. Another daughter, Monique Gautschy-Dumoulin, told Radio Television Swisse (RTS) her parents were walking to the valley the morning of their disappearance. It was a nice day, she says. Her father was singing. Francine Dumoulin (far right) went missing with her husband in 1942.But that was the last Monique would see of her parents, whose disappearance left her to care for her young sisters and brothers.Their mother, a schoolteacher, and father, a shoemaker, likely fell into a crevice of the glacier, where their bodies were preserved.The Institute of Forensic Medicine will seek to formally identify the bodies, through DNA tests, but the couple's children are convinced they are their missing parents.\"I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm,\" Udry-Dumoulin said. \"Now, I know where my parents are.\"  CNN's Merieme Arif and Sophie Jeong contributed to this report",

A year on, aged just 14, Schooling moved to the US to follow his dreams.      \"The more mature I got, I knew that was what I wanted to do,\" he says. \"That it would be my ultimate goal in life: to win Olympic gold and, you know, race against Michael in that final.\" The London 2012 Games presented Schooling his first opportunity to achieve his Olympic ambitions.

I'm only 17 and I have a long way to go.\"Schooling was granted deferment of his Singapore National Service to continue training, and traveled to Rio four years later as the top seed in the 100m butterfly firmly focused on gold.He was flanked by Phelps once again, only this time as a direct rival rather than a fan.Schooling and Phelps, side by side.

Woods was blockbuster, of course, and brought huge amounts of money to the game.The sport -- fans, sponsors, tournament organizers, TV executives -- had become used to a dominant figure.Even in the era of the Big Three -- Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player -- there was a rivalry.But when the likes of David Duval, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson had a nibble at Woods he swatted them all away.Since Woods' record streak of 281 weeks at world No.1 came to an end in 2010 there have been nine different top-ranked players flip-flopping for No.1, including Woods himself again for a 60-week spell in 2013-2014.

It's very tough to do. And you have to have a lot of things go right at the right times.\"When Woods had to miss the second half of 2008 for knee surgery after winning the US Open, Ireland's Padraig Harrington stepped into the breach, winning the last two majors of the year, including the Open at Royal Birkdale.But Harrington's flame blew itself out and his US PGA win sparked a run of 16 different major winners, nine of whom hadn't won one before or since, as Woods battled off-course issues and an ensuing loss of form.'The One'Rory McIlroy snapped this streak with his second major, the 2012 US PGA to add to the 2011 US Open.And when McIlroy won the British Open and the US PGA within three weeks in 2014, it cemented his status as \"The One.\" Only he, Nicklaus and Woods had won three, and then four, majors by the age of 25. The Northern Irishman needed just the Masters to become only the sixth player ever to win all four of golf's major titles at some stage in his career.But the Masters became McIlroy's nemesis, and as he faltered in his Augusta quest, Spieth stepped forward.JUST WATCHEDWhat's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat's the best shot Tiger Woods ever hit? 01:01A record-breaking Masters win at the age of 21, second youngest only to Woods, followed two months later by a US Open suggested golf had been too hasty in naming McIlroy as Tiger's true successor. Spieth was set to confirm as much at the 2016 Masters as he stood on the 10th tee with a five-shot lead in the final round. Back-to-back titles at Augusta, both won wire-to-wire, would arguably eclipse anything McIlroy had achieved. But, like McIlroy himself in 2011, Spieth suffered an infamous meltdown, putting two balls in the water on the 12th to ultimately miss out to Willett.'Not normal'Meanwhile, Australian Day had finally fulfilled his potential with victory at the 2015 US PGA. A formidable end to the year ushered him to No. 1 spot to end the Spieth-McIlroy horsetrading. A new \"Big Three\" was emerging. The trio all enjoyed spells of brilliance, but none could quite sustain the highs. Golf had become used to Woods' win ratio -- 18% in the majors and nearly 25% in PGA Tour events.  It's taken a while to realize that wasn't normal. The next best of those with more than 10 wins in regular events is McIlroy at about 10%.JUST WATCHEDJason Day: If I want it, no one can beat meReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJason Day: If I want it, no one can beat me 02:56READ: How a car crash shaped Koepka's US Open destinyLiving proof that winning is difficult comes from the greatest of them all, Nicklaus. Behind the record 18 major titles lie 19 second-place finishes. With Spieth, McIlroy and Day misfiring, Johnson finally crossed the threshold after a raft of near misses with his maiden major at the 2016 US Open.\"I was just fed up with, you know, being good. I thought I could be a lot better,\" Johnson told CNN of the catalyst behind his success.Three straight tournament wins heading into Augusta in April suggested the powerful American was emerging from a fledgling \"Big Four\" to be the dominant No.1.But a slip down stairs on the eve of the Masters put him on the sidelines, and he missed the cut at the US Open. Spieth, meanwhile, is still looking to add to his major tally, although he recently rekindled comparisons with Woods with a 10th title before the age of 24. McIlroy missed a spell with a rib injury and is suffering a mini slump after a spectacular end to 2016. And Day is also struggling to rediscover the form that took him to No.1 in September 2015. His mother's lung cancer has been a major distraction, too. \"Golf is like life, there's ups and downs,\" said McIlroy Wednesday. \"It's never that linear sort of direction.\"Spieth even suggested there was no such thing as a Big Four in the current game. \"I'm not sure who it would be,\" he said at Royal Birkdale.JUST WATCHEDSergio Garcia reflects on Masters winReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSergio Garcia reflects on Masters win 01:23READ: Sergio Garcia -- Masters win was my destiny Of the 164 players to have won one of the 320 majors since the Masters was introduced in 1934, only 35% have gone on to win more.Indeed, Garcia's breakthrough win at the Masters came in his 74th major.Spieth added: \"I think it's going to be a very exciting time going forward. You'll see a group of ten to 12 guys over the next 15, 20 years that are going to have a lot of different competitions that come down the stretch with each other.

A world where big money is being spent on foreign talent, but that limits opportunities for young English players.Sure, England's clubs still have youth academies, but the percentage of players that make it through to the first team is small. Even smaller is the number that go on to enjoy a fruitful career in England.Match Report: @LAGalaxyAcademy finish their season vs Texans SC in the #AcademyChampionships U-18 Final. https://t.co/cuSoeIxcMd pic.twitter.com/ZWc9Oba4dD\u2014 LA Galaxy (@LAGalaxy) July 17, 2017\nThe Galaxy's theory is that many players have slipped through the cracks, been unlucky or not quite made the grade for the world's most competitive league.Combined with a struggle to find young footballing talent prepared to skip education in the US \u2014  many young American athletes pursue their sporting dreams through university scholarships \u2014 that leaves a gap for bringing young talented players into its ranks.That's led The Galaxy to Barnet, a suburban area of London that's also a terminus for one of the capital's underground lines.Timed at the end of the English football season, Galaxy has opened its doors for those wanting a second chance, or even a first chance, to impress.For those that do impress, a career in America is waiting. The Galaxy realizes there are thousands of players that are looking for opportunities, and they are prepared to give them that opportunity.By holding trials in both London and Manchester this summer, the California-based club is making a point of wanting to make youth their focus.Galaxy has their second-string side, LA Galaxy II in the USL league and it's there that they see as the perfect nurturing ground for the kids.READ: The secret to managing OGC Nice star Mario BalotelliREAD: From Ligue 1 strugglers to Champions League challengersDavid Beckham and journalist and editor Anna Wintour arrive to take their seats in the Royal Box on Centre Court at Wimbledon.OpportunityTo find players between 18-years-old and their early twenties, Galaxy want to take talent in and build them up to be first-team regulars.Of course, there will still be room for future Beckhams and Steven Gerrards \u2014 but every MLS club can do that. Where can you find kids that will one day win you trophies? And where will those talented kids be? The bottom of England's football pyramid seems like a logical place to look. Chidi-James Williams is one example.

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May has urged senior ministers to come together and keep the details of their meetings private in an effort to halt the leaks emanating from government officials. May made the plea Tuesday after a week in which British media has been awash with stories quoting unnamed cabinet sources as well as constant speculation over her leadership.May's position has been under scrutiny ever since she lost her governing majority in last month's disastrous snap election -- an election she called to secure a mandate for negotiations to leave the European Union.Theresa May's first year was a disaster. Her second will be even worseWhile there has been constant speculation over which members of her cabinet may be jockeying to replace her, the most recent leaks have hinted at infighting between cabinet ministers.\"There is a need to show strength and unity as a country and that starts around the cabinet table,\" the Prime Minister told ministers.Read MoreMay: End the 'backbiting' and 'carping'May told her cabinet that the recent stories that included details of cabinet meetings were \"a case of not taking their responsibilities seriously,\" said the Prime Minister's spokesman.The move comes after a Daily Telegraph report on Sunday quoted one unnamed minister claiming that Chancellor Philip Hammond was trying to \"f* up\" Brexit.There were also reports that Hammond was reprimanded by May for saying that women could \"even\" be train drivers -- an allegation he vehemently denies.Britain's secret Brexit weapon: The royal familyOn Sunday, Hammond appeared on UK television and accused cabinet rivals of attempting to undermine his plans for Brexit.May has grown tired of what she termed \"backbiting\" and \"carping\" that have plagued her cabinet over the past week.Speaking at a Conservative Party event on Monday, she told her members of Parliament to prepare for \"serious business\" after Parliament's recess.She is also reported to have told lawmakers that any mistakes could allow Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to seize power.May under pressure at home and abroadMay remains in a volatile position, with her government propped up by the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.The \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) deal that secured the 10 votes of the DUP in the House of Commons has been widely criticized by her opponents.Theresa May reveals she shed a 'little tear' on election nightMay is also under pressure abroad, with the second stage of the Brexit talks taking place in Brussels this week.European leaders have been critical of Britain's approach to the negotiations and of May's plans for the three million EU citizens currently living in the UK.But speaking to ITV on Tuesday, Home Secretary Amber Rudd insisted May enjoyed the full support of her cabinet.\"She is respected by the cabinet, she is our Prime Minister, we do have 54 more seats than Labour and we are getting on with the job in hand.\"",

I did not understand how big a deal this was,\" she said Tuesday, reflecting on the process.And she quickly gathered support. Jennifer 8. Lee, a member of the Unicode emoji subcommittee, put Alhumedhi in touch with Aphee Messer, who worked with the teenager to design the emoji. Although many people were supportive, some described the emoji as \"unnecessary\" and a \"part of patriarchal constructs that oppress women.\"Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, also backed her proposal and hosted an online discussion where Alhumedhi talked about her idea and responded to critics.

Even if only in terms of representation. It's only an emoji. It's not a game changer. But it will make people happy. I hope so.\"And she hopes it will promote tolerance too.

        "content": "(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel has ruled out setting an upper limit on refugees coming to Germany, defying her long-term coalition partner on an issue that threatens to open up a rift between the country's ruling political parties just two months before federal elections.\"On the issue of an upper limit, my position is clear,\" Merkel said in an interview broadcast live on Germany's ARD on Sunday. \"I won't accept one.\"Merkel will need the support of the Christian Social Union -- the more conservative sister party to Merkel's Christian Democratic Union -- in order to remain Chancellor after September elections.'I no longer feel secure' in Germany, Syrian refugee saysOn Monday, CSU leader Horst Seehofer reiterated his party's pledge to make the limit on refugees a reality.\"The cap is and remains a goal of the CSU,\" Seehofer said, although he refused to make the issue a red line in a coalition deal -- a softening of his previous stance.  Read MoreIn an interview in December, Horst Seehofer, head of the CSU, promised a cap of 200,000 refugees per year if his party is in a coalition government after the election. 'Division of labor'It's the second public disagreement between the two parties in less than a month. Merkel abandoned her long-held position against same-sex marriage in June, opening the door for a vote on the issue in the German parliament, which passed just a few days later. Some CSU politicians responded angrily. Hans Reichhart, member of the regional parliament in Bavaria, southern Germany, told Deutsche Welle that the CDU and CSU had made an agreement not to act on the issue during this parliament, which lasts until the election in September. \"This agreement was broken,\" he said.German parliament voted to legalize \"Ehe fur alle\" in June. Merkel voted against the bill.Carsten Koschmieder, political scientist at the Freie Universitat in Berlin, sees these spats as part of the parties' campaign strategy rather than signs of fundamental disagreement.\"We're seeing a good division of labor between the CDU and the CSU,\" he told CNN. While Merkel makes her appeals to more liberal voters, the CSU can take the more conservative position on these controversial issues and appeal to a different group of voters.The CSU can market itself as the \"conservative corrective\" to the more liberal CDU, he said.German lawmakers vote to legalize same-sex marriageAnd the parties do agree on the basic principles behind these issues. Both want to preserve traditional family structures and to reduce the number of refugees coming to Germany.After rejecting the idea of a cap, Merkel highlighted the common ground she shares with the CSU. Both parties want to reduce the numbers and to \"fight the causes of migration,\" she said. \"And I believe we will achieve what we want. And without any kind of cap.\"As long as the number of asylum seekers entering Germany remains relatively low, there will be no major clash between Merkel and her sister party, Koschmieder explained.\"But if Italy opens its borders and allows refugees to travel north through Europe, then we will have to see how Merkel and the CSU react,\" he said.A 'useless debate'?A survey conducted last September found that 47% of those polled were in favor of an upper limit on the number of refugees, including 69% of CSU supporters.Refugees and integration continues to top the list of concerns among German voters. Nearly half of Germans surveyed on July 7 in a weekly poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen said that the issue is among the most important for them, with the next most common issue (social inequality) mentioned by just 14% of respondents.Some Germans have expressed their frustration with Merkel's latest comments on social media.\"Whoever votes for the CDU with Merkel is supporting further flooding of Germany,\" wrote Twitter user Anny's World.Nach Merkels Interview gestern gibt es bei Ihr keine Obergrenze.Wer weiter CDU mit Merkel w\u00e4hlt unterst\u00fctzt die weitere \u00dcberflutung D.lan\u2014 \ud83d\udc99Anny,s World \ud83d\udc99 (@ICHundS04) July 17, 2017\n\nFor others, a cap doesn't go far enough. \"No upper limit,\" wrote Gerd Luck. \"If there was an upper limit for refugees in Germany, it wouldn't solve the problem.\"Keine Obergrenze Wenn es in Dtl eine Obergrenze f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge geben w\u00fcrde, ist das Problem auch nicht gel\u00f6st. Wir schaffen das nicht!!!!\u2014 Gerd Luck (@luck_gerd) July 17, 2017\n\nBut for Karl Kopp, director for European affairs at Pro Asyl, a German charity that advocates for refugees, any discussion of a cap is \"a useless debate.\"International law prohibits any kind of quota, Kopp explained. \"Every asylum seeker has the right to have his claim addressed.\"And he's convinced that the ongoing debate about the number of refugees is disguising the real problems facing refugees in Germany and across Europe.Hundreds of refugees and migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe and many thousands have been rescued.\"There are 2,000 refugees in Greece living in desperate situations waiting for family reunification to Germany,\" Kopp said. \"But the government has created a lot of obstacles and is trying to slow the process down. People wait there for years to join their family in Germany.\"Meanwhile, hundreds of people are drowning in the Mediterranean as they try to reach Europe.\"We're losing a lot of time and energy talking about a quota that is not in line with international law,\" he said.

(CNN)The boxing purists are utterly dismissive of the fight as a total mismatch but the fans seem to love the idea, turning out in their tens of thousands just to glimpse the fighters on their promotional tour. And the increasingly probability is that when that peerless old boxing master of defense -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. -- meets the young Irish mixed martial arts prince -- Conor McGregor -- on August 26 in Las Vegas, it'll turn out to be the most profitable boxing match in history. Well at least for a month or so.Follow @cnnsport\n\nMayweather, who has always liked talking money and is liberally rounded with his figures, told me that he expects to make $300 million (to add to his $800 million career earnings) from this -- his last fight. McGregor says he expects to \"quadruple\" his net worth.No wonder Mayweather's long-time business partner, Leonard Ellerbe, has been beaming like the proverbial \"Cheshire Cat.\" Business is looking very good. This is a fight -- so the promoters say -- that the fans demanded and it is evidently selling.About 10,000 fans turned out at London's Wembley Arena on Friday, largely to see McGregor and salute him on his 29th birthday.Read MoreIt was a carnival atmosphere -- lots of Irish flags to welcome the former plumber's mate from Dublin -- as well as masks and T-shirts bearing the image of their open-mouthed bearded hero.A lot of beer was quickly drunk.

August x McGregor COMING SOON pic.twitter.com/TyKTgN7nSV\u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) July 16, 2017\nOne man had flown over from Dublin just to see McGregor strut his promotional stuff. A friend had already secured him a $2,000 seat (one of the cheaper seats) for the Las Vegas bout.They just love their man and think he has more than a puncher's chance. Another fan was going to bet heavily on McGregor. He wouldn't say exactly how much, quickly adding \"as much as his wife would allow.\"McGregor's unshakeable self-belief is clearly infectious. And as the fans all know -- and as the Daily Telegraph boxing correspondent Gareth A Davies put it -- McGregor didn't \"just kiss the Blarney Stone, he swallowed it.\" He can walk the walk and talk the talk.Mayweather and his entourage needed three 12-seater jets to ferry them around -- from Los Angeles to Toronto, then to New York and finally to London. McGregor and his team had to make do with just one jet.Almost everything about the tour was predictable -- loud rap music to introduce the warriors, a bit of dancing and posturing by each of them and a welter of expletives. Hardly two sentences were uttered without use of the F-word.And to ensure perhaps that the media continued to pay attention they cranked up the racial and sexual insults as the tour progressed.

What was genuinely surprising, particularly to Mayweather's PR people, was how many fans turned out -- estimates of 10,000 in Los Angeles, 15,000 in Toronto and 13,000 in New York -- and all of this without a single punch being thrown.UFC president Dana White splits  Mayweather and McGregor apart at Wembley Arena.Everything is very much on Mayweather's terms.He's the promoter of the fight. This will be a boxing match in a boxing ring (as opposed to Mixed Martial Arts Octagon cage), using 10 ounce gloves and abiding by Marquess of Queensberry rules.McGregor has never stepped into a boxing ring as a professional. And he hasn't got much time to study \"the Sweet Science\" as the boxing writer A.J. Liebling famously referred to it.    \ud83d\udcb0in the \ud83c\udf92#mayweather #tbe #moneymayweather A post shared by Floyd Mayweather TBE (@mayweathertbe) on Jun 14, 2017 at 5:13pm PDT\nHe won't be able to use his legs to kick his opponent or grapple with him on the ground or use the more concussive four ounce gloves he normally uses.We can safely assume that we won't be allowed to see McGregor sparring in the gym as he prepares for the fight. If Mayweather has never been beaten in 49 fights and remains the most elusive of boxers -- he's never been knocked down -- he talked up his own apparent vulnerability. He's 40, hasn't fought in two years and is \"ring rusty.\" He cheerfully points out that McGregor is younger, taller and has a longer reach.Stephen Espinoza, vice president of Showtime Sports, which will broadcast the fight in the US, told me that five or 10 years ago -- when Mayweather was at his peak -- this fight would've been unthinkable.Mayweather hasn't stopped any opponent since 2011. But on interview he seemed entirely comfortable with the situation and rather more articulate and thoughtful than the stage trash talk suggested. He remains a calculating boxer and promoter.If the bout itself matches the fighters' trash talking, boxing fans could be in for a real treat come August 26.Serious \"Benjamins\"The fight remains both fascinating and potentially farcical. Sylvester Stallone -- no less -- has called McGregor \"a real life Rocky\" and therein lies the fight's appeal.New #MayweathervsMcGregor vlog is up!!! https://t.co/x4ne2MQsFS pic.twitter.com/RHrtrZJ770\u2014 Dana White (@danawhite) July 12, 2017\nCould McGregor shock us all and do what every boxer has failed to do -- and knock Mayweather out?\"Mark my words,\" said McGregor, on the first tour stop in Los Angeles, \"I'm going to knock him out in four rounds.\"However, boxing aficionados remain skeptical. Indeed they're rather more intrigued by another middleweight fight at the same Las Vegas venue -- on September 16 -- between two of the sport's biggest stars, Gennady Golovkin from Kazakhstan and Mexico's Canelo Alvarez.Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videosThe promoter, Oscar De La Hoya has damned the Mayweather and McGregor fight as a farce \"that will hurt boxing.\"But there's a sense here of trying to reach an audience beyond boxing and mixed martial arts. Espinoza was unapologetic -- he likened the Mayweather-McGregor fight to an event movie -- a summer blockbuster like ' Transformers.\"So if works -- if it entertains and makes serious \"Benjamins\" --  could there possibly be more like it? The fight game could be subtly changing.  Roll Up! Roll Up! for a new kind of circus.",

Spain's Guardia Civil, in coordination with Europol, the European police agency, charged the individuals with crimes including animal abuse, document forgery, perverting the course of justice, crimes against public health, money laundering and being part of a criminal organization, the press release says.The investigation is related to 2013's horsemeat scandal, which came to light after the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA.In one sample from Tesco -- Britain's largest grocery chain -- the horsemeat accounted for about 29% of the burger. A French supplier, Comigel, which supplies products to customers in 16 countries, was at the time implicated in the scandal. Some frozen products labeled as beef contained as much as 60% horsemeat. Samples of horsemeat are collected by investigators in a Guardia Civil/Europol joint investigation into horsemeat smuggling throughout Europe. Read MoreThe investigation in the wake of the scandal let to \"the identification of a Dutch citizen known in the horsemeat world,\" Europol says. The suspect was later identified as the ringleader of an operation investigated in 2016 in which horses unfit for human consumption were being killed in two abattoirs in northern Spain and then sent to Belgium after their paperwork and microchips were altered. After analyzing samples of the meat found in the Spanish slaughterhouses, investigators concluded that the meat was mostly sold abroad. The Dutch suspect oversaw operations from Alicante, Spain, and had a network of \"his most trusted men in charge in every country affected by the scam.\"The leader of the criminal group was arrested in Belgium, and police actions were carried out across the continent, including in France, Portugal, Italy, Romania, Switzerland and the UK.",

The course fans seaward, with the two nines returning to the clubhouse, with flat fairways and fair greens rewarding accurate shots. Ireland's Padraig Harrington won the last of the nine Opens at Royal Birkdale in 2008.Best course nearby: Hillside is a hidden gem and shares the same stretch of sandhills, while  Southport & Ainsdale is a two-time Ryder Cup venue which winds through rollings links land.Royal Birkdale, Waterloo Road, Southport, England PR8 2LX;  +44 (0) 1704 552 020Green fees: From \u00a3165-245 ($213-316)Royal Birkdale in northwest England hosts the 2017 British Open Championship.St. AndrewsKnown as the \"Home of Golf,\" the game in various forms has been played over the St. Andrews links since the 15th century.The historic seaside and university town north east of Edinburgh on Fife's east coast is home to seven golf courses with the Old Course at its heart.The venerable layout occupies a windswept triangle of dunes, hills and gorse bordered by the West Sands Beach to the east and sandwiched between the New Course (1895) and the Eden, with the Jubilee, Strathtyrum and Balgove also occupying the venerable links.  The Old Course begins from in front of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club clubhouse and winds out to the Eden Estuary before turning for home, with many blind shots over seas of gorse and fearsome pot bunkers with names like \"Hell\" and \"The Coffins,\" which require careful navigation.St. Andrews squeezes six courses, including the Old Course, onto its venerable links. The course features an iconic finishing stretch -- the \"Road Hole\" 17th passing the Old Course Hotel and the 18th across the Swilcan Bridge back up into town. Playing the Old Course is a bucket-list item for most golfers and a ballot, drawn 48 hours in advance, is the most common means of entry, although there are limited advance bookings.  St. Andrews has hosted 29 Opens stretching back to 1873,  and has seen some of the game's biggest names lift the Claret Jug, including Tiger Woods in 2000 and 2005.\"I fell in love with it the first day I played it.

The setting and the views out to the Aisla Craig rock and the Isle of Arran are still sublime. Turnberry's redesigned Aisla course features a new ninth green at the foot of the iconic lighthouse. Turnberry hosted its first Open in 1977, a tournament which became famous for the \"Duel in the Sun\" between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson.The course last held the Open in 2009 when American Stewart Cink beat the 59-year-old Watson in a playoff.

The challenging, heavily bunkered track is arguably the toughest on the Open rotation, particularly when the wind blows. It is also the longest Open course at 7,421 yards. It was known as \"Car-nasty\" during the 1999 Open because of its thick rough, narrow fairways and a potent spell of bad weather. That year, Frenchman Jean van de Velde famously contemplated a shot out of a stream while leading on the final hole before Scotsman Paul Lawrie won a playoff.Frenchman Jean Van de Velde looks at his ball in the burn on the 18th hole during the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie.Carnoustie has hosted seven Opens, most recently in 2007 when Padraig Harrington beat Sergio Garcia in a playoff.

Wind is its major defense -- the breeze in your face coming home presents a formidable challenge.Royal Troon is famed for the \"Postage Stamp,\" its infamous 123-yard par-three eighth hole, and \"Railway,\" the 11th which runs next to the train track with a blind drive over a sea of gorse.Awarded Royal status in 1978 to honor its centenary, Troon has hosted nine Open Championships, most recently in 2016 with an epic final-day duel between Phil Mickelson and eventual winner Henrik Stenson of Sweden.Best course nearby: Prestwick hosted the first Open Championship in 1860 and the next 11 until the tournament moved briefly to St. Andrews.

Royal Lytham and St. AnnesThe Lancashire course was opened on its current site in 1897 on a pocket of duneland south of Blackpool.Unlike other Open venues, it is hemmed in on all sides by houses but it retains a linksy charm, though with a sting in the tail.There are 206 bunkers which require players to thread their way around rather than try to overpower the relatively short 7,118-yard course.Royal Lytham hosted the last of its 11 Opens in 2012 when Ernie Els triumphed. It's also famed as the course where legendary European golfer Seve Ballesteros hit a shot from a car park on his way to his breakthrough major victory in 1979.

The club has been the center of controversy in recent years after first voting not to allow women members in 2016 before reversing its decision and changing its membership policy this year.

It is a testing mix of undulating fairways, slick greens and daunting bunkers, none more so than the towering \"Himalaya\" on the fourth hole, at 40ft tall the highest bunker in the UK.The course is also the setting for the famous golf match between James Bond and Goldfinger in the Ian Fleming novel. Fleming, who named the course Royal St. Marks, was a member of Royal St. George's. It hosted the last of its 14 Opens in 2011 when Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke won his sole major title.Best course nearby: In the dunes to the south lies Royal Cinque Ports, an equally compelling historic links which hosted the Open in 1909 and 1920.Royal St. George's, Sandwich, Kent CT13 9PB; +44 (0) 1304 613090Green fees: From \u00a3100-190 ($129-245)Royal Liverpool\"Hoylake,\" as it is commonly known, was built in 1869 on the racecourse at Liverpool Hunt Club and retained a dual function for the first few years of its life.Located on the Wirral peninsula on the seaward side of the River Mersey from Liverpool, it presents a classic links challenge next to the beach and overlooking the Irish Sea at the mouth of the Dee Estuary.Famous golf scribe Bernard Darwin once wrote: \"Hoylake, blown upon by mighty winds, breeder of mighty champions.\" Past winners of the Open here include Tiger Woods during a firm and fiery week in 2006, and Rory McIlroy, who led from start to finish in winning his third major in 2014.Best course nearby: Wallasey is another jewel of seaside golf just up the coast from Hoylake.

In 2014, there were 166 filed incidents, rising to 261 in 2015, and 454 in 2016. Police have told CNN that trend has continued this year.Read MoreOne of the proposals being considered by the government is to ensure that acid and other corrosive substances will be considered as a dangerous weapon.The review will also ascertain whether it could impose measures on retailers to restrict the sale of such substances.\"Acid attacks are horrific crimes which have a devastating effect on victims, both physically and emotionally,\" Rudd said in a statement Sunday.\"It is vital that we do everything we can to prevent these sickening attacks happening in the first place.\"We must also ensure that the police and other emergency services are able to respond as effectively as possible, that sentences reflect the seriousness of the offenses and victims are given the immediate support they need.\"Rudd's announcement comes at a time where the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) suggests that more than 400 acid or corrosive substance attacks were carried out in the six months up to April 2017, based on figures provided by 39 forces in England and Wales.According to the Home Office, Bleach, ammonia and acid were the most commonly used substances.On Monday, the House of Commons will hold a debate on acid attacks.Acid attacks in London have so far been largely concentrated in the city's east.Read: More than 450 acid attacks in London last yearSimon Laurence, chief superintendent for Hackney borough in east London, called on retailers to question youths buying household chemicals alone that could potentially be used in attacks.\"It's drain cleaner, oven cleaner, ammonia -- different types of household products which can be bought. My plea is to sellers to have moral responsibility, social responsibility, to ask the questions,\" he told CNN in an interview on Saturday.CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.",

However, there's also the fact that if you do not combat and fight against these pieces we cannot fight and overcome those who are manipulating them.  Therefore, we are going to behead these traitors.\"\"If parliament passes a bill on resuming executions in Turkey., he said, \"I will sign it.\" If Turkey does so it would likely scuttle its longtime effort to join the European Union, whose member countries have abolished the death penalty.People in Istanbul gather to commemorate the failure of last year's coup.Read MoreState of emergencyTurkey: Anti-Erdogan marchers 'scream' for justice in Istanbul The country has remained in a state of emergency while allowing Erdogan to tighten his grip on power and oversee a massive purge of those who he says rose up against him.Over the past year, Erdogan and his government have clamped down on civil liberties across Turkey, gutted public institutions and universities, heavily restricted the media and ordered mass arrests of activists, journalists and the political opposition.Since the coup attempt, more than 169,000 people have faced \"judicial action\" ranging from travel restrictions and detentions to arrest warrants,, the justice ministry said, according to Anadolu.The clampdown stoked widespread unease in the country.Martyrs mournedBut the sea of Erdogan supporters packing the streets waved flags and cheered on their popular and outspoken leader. The commemoration ceremony started at July 15 Martyrs Bridge with the national anthem. Then it was followed by a Quranic recitation, Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said.The names of those people killed were read out and their pictures were also shown on big screens. A monument honoring those killed while fighting the coup attempt near the bridge was unveiled. Erdogan praised those who lost their lives in the fight against those carrying out the attempted putsch.\"I wish this bridge were able to speak about the heroic acts on this bridge,\" he said. \"I express my gratitude to these martyrs. They have defended their freedom, their calls to prayers, their flags, their motherland, their state and their future.\"After the address, he traveled to Ankara, the capital, where he spoke  to throngs at the parliament building early Sunday, repeating the same themes that he did in Istanbul, sympathy for the people who died trying to stop the coup attempt, respect and confidence for the Turkish people, criticism of the country's opposition leader, and anger toward the people who tried to overthrow the government.'I can't forget that night'Wary of terror Speaking in Istanbul, Erdogan warned of groups that are using terrorists as \"manipulation.\"He cited followers of exiled cleric and former ally Fetullah Gulen. Erdogan has claimed Gulen was behind the coup attempt, a charge that Gulen denies. Gulen is the leader of a popular movement called Hizmet, but the Turkish government refers to his group as the Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organization, known as FETO.Turkey senses 'willingness' from Trump admin to take action against GulenThe government has said that the Gulen group \"is behind a long-running campaign to overthrow the state through the infiltration of Turkish institutions, particularly the military, police and judiciary,\" according to the state-run Anadolu Agency.\"How dare you can attack this motherland? There will be those days that you will account for what you have done,\" Erdogan said in Ankara. \"Hey FETO, is there anywhere you can safely go? Is there anything you haven't done to damage this nation. Is there any door left that you haven't knocked at?\"You have been allocated some land in Pennsylvania to use, now you are governing these places from there. Those who made calculations for a coup d'etat completely forgot that you cannot make calculations before God and they have hit the wall of the national will as a result,\" Erdogan said, referring to where Gulen now lives in the United States.Erdogan also mentioned the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a designated terror group in Turkey, the US and Europe. Known by its acronym the PKK, it has been engaged in a 30-year conflict with the Turkish government.   He also cited Daesh, another name for ISIS, which Turkey also views as a foe.\"We know very well that FETO is not just FETO. PKK is not just PKK. Daesh is not just Daesh on itself. These terrorist organizations and other are not only comprised of what you can see when you look at them, we know this very well,\" Erdogan said. The President said many enemies were \"waiting at bay ready to attack.\"\"We are not uttering their names but we know all about them. We know who they are,\" he said. \"You will not be able to succeed. You will not be able to divide our nation. You will not be able to bring our flag down.\"Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, center, in Istanbul to commemorate the anniversary of the coup.A year agoThe attempted coup took place July 15, 2016, undertaken by a faction of the military Tanks rolled into the streets of Turkey's two largest cities, Ankara and Instanbul.

Kilicdaroglu kicked off the march after the imprisonment of one of his party's parliament members.In his Saturday address, Erdogan slammed Kilicdaroglu for repeatedly claiming that the government knew about the coup attempt in advance but it failed to stop it and called those remarks disrespectful and insulting.CNN's Mayra Cuevas, Gul Tuysuz and Alper Tugra Cakici contributed to this report",

I was so afraid that night and I don't think its been cleared completely yet. I still feel like there might be another coup. I don't feel totally secure, either for myself or for my family. Nothing has been done to make me feel more secure. The state of emergency is not making me feel more secure. And I don't approve of any of the decisions. I'm not hopeful.

I see on TV that there will be planes flying overhead in Ankara for the commemoration, but I find that wrong. There are so many people who lost their loved ones that night who are in pain, families in pain. It's not right to have them remember that night, it's not right to have them relive such a bad day. \"I am not very hopeful, I don't want to say it but I don't find our way of being led to be correct, the system is wrong. I'm not happy unfortunately. For example, I am a journalism student but I don't want to get into political [reporting] in the future because it seems to me that every journalist ends up in prison.

Let's hope for better days. But I don't think so. I don't see things getting easier. People can't go out on the streets and express their views. I was at home. I was drinking tea and then the planes started flying overhead. I wasn't afraid. I want more freedom for people. But so many innocent people have lost their jobs. Sure there are people who are guilty among them but you have to sift through it and give the innocent their jobs back.\"Ali Calar, a 33-year-old flag sellerAli Calar says he stands firmly behind President Erdogan and his policies.\"The last year has been always politics, constant politics. I was out selling flags at a bazaar that night. I was returning from that when it happened. If Erdogan goes we will miss him sorely. He does everything he can to help us. My child goes to school I can't afford the books, but the President provides for it. I get so sad to think about it. Innocent people died. I hope this never happens again.

Another incident involved a robbery.     A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and robbery, and is currently in custody at an east London police station. A 15-year-old boy was later taken into custody on the same allegations, according to police, who appealed for witnesses to come forward.Four of the attacks happened in the eastern borough of Hackney, and one other in Islington, in the city's north. All five victims were taken to hospital.Emergency services attend the scene at Hackney Road.Read MoreAttacks are on the riseAccording to a report released by the Metropolitan Police Service in March, acid attacks are on the rise in London. In 2014, there were 166 filed incidents, rising to 261 in 2015, and 454 in 2016. Police have told CNN that trend has continued this year.Acid attacks in London are largely concentrated in the city's east. Simon Laurence, chief superintendent for Hackney borough in east London, called on retailers to question youths buying household chemicals alone that could potentially be used in attacks. \"It's drain cleaner, oven cleaner, ammonia -- different types of household products which can be bought. My plea is to sellers to have moral responsibility, social responsibility, to ask the questions,\" he told CNN in an interview.London's police chief, Cressida Dick, said police were concerned by the spike in acid attacks, which she called \"completely barbaric.\"\"We will arrest people. We will enforce the law as we can. We are working very closely with the Home Office to try to see whether there's any changes in the law required,\" she told LBC Radio.London Ambulance Service issued advice Friday on what to do after an acid attack on oneself or others. This includes wearing gloves or using a towel for protection while removing the chemical, taking off contaminated clothes or jewelery to prevent further burns and rinsing the burn immediately under a cool tap or shower for 10 minutes or more, taking care to protect the eyes. Loosely apply a dry bandage, gauze or clean cotton clothing to the area and take a mild pain reliever for minor burns that don't affect the face.'Ministers need to act'Sarah Newton, an official from the Home Office, told the BBC that tighter restrictions on acids and tougher penalties for their misuse were being discussed. \"I and my colleagues in the Home Office have been increasingly concerned about the escalation of instances -- especially in London. So, we've been working with the Metropolitan Police and community policing some months now,\" she said.Parliament is due to debate the issue on Monday next week at the request of MP Stephen Timms from the main opposition Labour Party.\"Too many people are frightened of becoming a victim. Ministers need to act,\" said Timms in a statement before Thursday assaults. Corrosive acids are still quite easy to purchase from local, everyday stores around the UK. Acid was in the past more commonly used in personal disputes, often perpetrated by men against their female partners. Several other recent acid attacks in London have appeared to be racially motivated.Following an attack in June on 21-year-old aspiring model Resham Khan and her cousin Jameel Muhktar, a petition on Change.org demanding that the UK Parliament require individuals purchasing acid to hold a special license now has almost 370,000 signatures.CNN's Simon Cullen, Lindsay Isaac, Alla Eshchenko and journalist Zoha Qamar contributed to this report.",

Then, with Muguruza serving to stay in the first set at 5-4 down, came a 19-shot rally that changed everything. Follow @cnnsport\n\nWilliams lost it as she dumped a forehand into the net, and was never the same player again.

On July 8, Florida police said a newly surfaced video showed Williams \"was acting lawfully\" when she steered her car into a crossing before the fatal collision with another car on June 9, the Reuters news agency reported at the time.\"I try to do the same things you do, but I think there will be other opportunities\" Venus said at the trophy ceremony, when asked if she missed her sister and last year's winner, Serena Williams, who is at home awaiting the birth of her first child.

In 1994, Martinez spoiled the party for Martina Navratilova, who had been trying to win her tenth Wimbledon crown at the age of 37.\"She just told me to go out there and forget about all of this,\" Muguruza said in a news conference. \"Try to think it's another match.\"With Muguruza's traveling coach, Sam Sumyk, absent from Wimbledon, Spanish Fed Cup captain Martinez had guided her at the All England Club.It appeared Martinez had a calming influence on the 14th-seeded Spaniard, one of the game's hardest hitters who is capable of beating anyone when she in full flow but had struggled with pressure since winning her first major at the French Open last year. READ: Why Rufus the Hawk rules the roost on Center CourtREAD: From being paralyzed by shame to coaching SerenaWhen Muguruza was dethroned in the fourth round of the French Open in a tempestuous match against by France's Kristina Mladenovic, not many experts would have expected her to recover this quickly. But her confidence increased with each round won and, after beating women's top seed Angelique Kerber in the fourth round in a thrilling encounter, Muguruza started to believe. JUST WATCHEDVenus Williams sued over fatal crashReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVenus Williams sued over fatal crash 01:08Missed opportunitiesWilliams had started off the final with an ace and easily held with a blistering forehand down the line, as the sound of  her shots reverberated under the roof of Centre Court on a rainy day in southwest London. Playing in her first final since she won Roland Garros last year, Muguruza started nervously as she produced a double fault in her first service game. With both women playing first-strike tennis, Williams stood slightly closer to the baseline, thumping winners as she held to love for a 3-2 lead and then set up her first break point with a forehand passing at full stretch in the next game. But she was unable to convert it, dumping a forehand into the net, and Muguruza ended up holding.In the next game, Williams held despite serving three double faults, saving a break point with a 106 miles-per-hour second serve.  Serving to stay in the set at 5-4 down, Muguruza gifted Williams two set points with a couple of forehand errors. Yes!!!! pic.twitter.com/evqTlwOaRf\u2014 Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza (@GarbiMuguruza) July 15, 2017\nTargeting her opponent's forehand relentlessly, Williams failed to take the first set point as she put a forehand into the net after the longest rally of the match at 19 shots. After Muguruza saved the second set point with a huge serve, she held with an error and all of a sudden, Williams started to look vulnerable.\"Definitely would have loved to have converted some of those points,\" Williams, who made 25 unforced errors, said in a news conference. \"But she competed really well.  So credit to her.  She just dug in there and managed to play better.\"Completely losing her way on the forehand, Williams, who had been diagnosed with the energy-sapping Sjogren's syndrome in 2011, got broken on the second break point with a wayward forehand that sailed over the baseline. Serving for the set at 6-5, Muguruza set up two set points with a defensive backhand lob that seemed to go out. Williams chased it, but then let it go, and saw it land on the baseline. \"Vamos!\" shooted Martinez from the players' box. Muguruza missed the first set point as Williams drilled a forehand she failed to control, but took the first set when the American hit her 15th unforced error of the match.  \"When I had those set points against me, I'm like, Hey, it's normal,  I'm playing Venus here,\" Muguruza said. \"So I just keep fighting.  And I knew that if I was playing like I was playing during the two weeks, I was going to have eventually an opportunity.  So I was calm.  If I lose the first set, I still have two more. Let's not make a drama.\"\"Not ideal\"The momentum now completely with the Spaniard, she went up a double break in the second set as Williams struggled to find her range and sunk to the grass, holding her head in her hands after she crossed the finish line on a challenge. \"Not an ideal scoreline,\" said Williams about losing her first set to love at Wimbledon in 20 appearances.\"Very satisfied because I never knew how it was going to go because I was very nervous,\" Muguruza said. \"I wanted it to go my way.  I was doing everything I could to be prepared. Once you step on the court, you see the crowd, you see the final, you see I'm here playing another Wimbledon final.  So very satisfied the way I handled it.\"Williams believesAs for Williams, also a losing finalist to her sister in Australia in January, she will leave Wimbledon in the knowledge she is back in the mix when it comes to playing for the sport's biggest titles. The US Open starts at the end of August, and there is no reason to think she won't be competing for the trophy once again.Visit our tennis page for more news and features\"I'm in good form,\" she said. \"I've been in a position a lot of times this year to contend for big titles.

A patchwork of nationalities, from India, Lebanon, America, on a summer pilgrimage to worship the most successful male tennis player in history. These are Roger Federer fans. But his admirers have taken their devotion to a new level of intensity at this year's Wimbledon, descending in heavyweight numbers in a quest to watch their heavenly hero perform in his Centre Court cathedral. Follow @cnnsport\n\nSome are dressed in the red and white of the Swiss flag, others are sporting the \"RF\" monogram somewhere on their person -- on earrings, t-shirts, bags, caps, tattooed on body parts.

But this doesn't feel like previous editions of the old tournament. Federer fans at Wimbledon READ: Federer reaches Wimbledon semifinalsREAD: Federer - The making of a sports great READ: Inside the wonderful world of the Wimbledon QueueWaiting in the snaking Wimbledon queue, a perplexed Novak Djokovic supporter asks why every Federer fan on the planet has descended to SW19. \"But this is not all of us,\" laughs 25-year-old Myriam Khalil of Lebanon. She is still recovering from the shock of arriving at Wimbledon Park -- a recreational ground where the famed queue for on-the-day tickets starts -- at 3am only to discover a few hundred people had already beaten her to the front of the line. A chance to be part of history\"It's been crazy. Ever since we arrived, we noticed a greater amount of Roger fans everywhere. \"It's great but, at the same time, it's stressful because everyone wants to see Roger on Centre Court. This year, in particular. It's been special.\"Myriam Khalil has been a famlliar face at this year's Wimbledon queue. It's no secret that Federer has always been popular. He has 7.5m followers on Twitter, nearly 15m on Facebook and last year won the ATP World Tour's Fans' favorite award for the 14th successive year, even though he had played just 28 matches. The 35-year-old has been the biggest draw at tournaments for over a decade, but Federer in 2017 has an added allure. Cocooned from the normal ravages of age, he's winning again and is favorite for the men's title. In beating Milos Raonic, a man nearly 10 years his junior, in straight sets, the father-of-four is now a match away from a record eighth Wimbledon crown -- eclipsing the seven won by the Pete Sampras.Federer is ranked world No.5 With Federer turning 36 next month, the sand is falling to the bottom of the hourglass all too rapidly, though the \"R\" word (retirement, not Roger) is rarely whispered among his disciples. \"Oh no, why think about that?\" says Karen Wilson, red and white \"RF\" earrings dangling from her lobes. The American-born grandmother-of-four jokingly describes herself as \"Grannie the Groupie.\"But, like it or not, Federer is in the autumn of his career. And the reality of the situation is writ large as his fans camp, sit, stand in line for days in the hope of watching him play. They want a chance to witness one of the final \"I-was-there\" moments.'I could watch him play every day 24/7'Like Khalil and Wilson, Sunita Sigtia is a member of the official Federer fan club -- Fans 4 Roger. She has been making the 7,966km journey from Calcutta to Wimbledon to watch Federer's feather-soft volleys and beautiful backhands for the last 10 years, but has never felt pressure such as this in her mission to watch him in the flesh. Not even an \"RF\" tattoo, subtly inked on the back of her neck, or the great man's signature -- permanently marked on the inside of her forearm -- can help her gain access into The All England Club. For those curious about the tattoos, Federer's initials were added in 2010 to show she \"still believed in him\" despite a quarterfinal defeat at Wimbledon. (He occasionally loses, though only twice this year.) The signature is a celebration of the player's 18th grand slam title, secured at the Australian Open in January. The great man himself has seen the tattoos. He did not comment.Throughout this tournament, Sigtia has narrowly made the cut to watch Federer on Centre Court, but this does not stop the Indian businesswoman from worrying about what could lie ahead. Her mind is racing with queuing strategies for the matches which may come. \"It's basically for Roger this year. That's why it's tougher,\" she says, giving her own take on why the masses are queuing. \"I could see him play every day 24/7. Just watching him play is amazing. \"We used to be able to come the day before, maybe noon, and we'd be okay for Centre Court, but now we're not so certain. \"More and more people are camping for two nights just to see Roger.\"Roger Federer is bidding to win a record eighth Wimbledon title.READ: Bringing 'rebellion' chic to SW19 READ: From being paralyzed by shame to coaching Serena'It's like a symphony'Only a Beatles reunion on Wimbledon Common (which, admittedly, would require two resurrections) could match the fervor for Federer at this year's event. Is this devotion rational? For many, this is the sporting equivalent of watching Vincent Van Gogh paint in broad strokes or listening to Mozart perform his concertos.Federer has won 92 titles, taking his career earnings to over $103m \"The way he plays tennis nobody ever played tennis like that,\" Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams' coach, tells CNN. \"It's so natural. It's like a symphony. Nobody will ever play tennis like that ever, impossible. \"It's just perfection. The movement, the timing, everything is prefect and that's incredible.\"For those spending a fortnight at Wimbledon this summer, sleeping under canvas whatever the weather, using their annual leave, draining their bank accounts, the opportunity to watch a once-in-a-lifetime talent is no sacrifice at all.  His serene progress through the tournament -- combined with victory at January's Australian Open after a six-month break -- has given his fans added impetus. Roger Federer by the numbers302 weeks \u2014 Total time spent at the top of the ATP rankings75 miles per hour \u2014 Average forehand speed60 miles per hour \u2014 Average backhand speed$320 million \u2014 Estimated net worth (Forbes)18 \u2014 Grand slam titlesFederer as Religious ExperienceNot that Federer's supporters have ever lacked motivation.Among the first to analyze the Federer phenomenon was the acclaimed author David Foster Wallace in his New York Times essay \"Roger Federer as Religious Experience.\" In 2006, the late writer wrote of \"Federer Moments,\" describing how the player hit shots that were \"impossible.\" JUST WATCHED18 reasons to love Roger FedererReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH18 reasons to love Roger Federer 02:02He described the Federer forehand as a \"great liquid lip,\" and wrote of the player's otherwordly anticipation. The genius of his game, Wallace explained, was lost on television, though the sight of a Federer forehand gloriously curling onto the line against Raonic Wednesday would have caused jaws to drop however the moment was consumed. Ask Federer fans why they adore him and they will pause, then smile, as if remembering a first kiss, which sums up the man himself: memorable and never to be repeated. For Doris Loeffel, one of the original members of the official Federer fan club, founded by a Swiss radio station following his third Wimbledon title in 2005, her love is a result of a combination of factors: his hypnotic style of play, his unmatched success, the alchemy of his personality. His ability to communicate in English, German, Swiss German and French contributes to his global appeal, too. Loeffel says she has lost count of the number of times she has watched her compatriot perform.\"He does recognize me and he chats and asks stuff,\" says Loeffel, who admits following the player has become a hobby. \"That's what makes us fall in love with him. You're not just a number. You get recognized.\"When he talks to the fans he's so natural and he recognizes the most crazy ones, the ones who follow him around the world. That gives you a feeling of being a family.\"He's a big part of my life. I work for the fan club, organize meetings. It's Roger Federer every day in one form or another. It's a lot of fun.\"I could've bought a really nice car with all the money I've already spent to watch Roger Federer, but it's been worth every second of it because you get so much back.\"Like Muhammad Ali Fans speak of a debt of gratitude to the player.

They shared another extended handshake as they parted ways, each man gripping the other's arm as they paced the cobblestones of the stately plaza.

Unlike past French presidents, Macron speaks nearly perfect English and could converse easily without a translator.Added to his earlier meetings with Trump last month, Macron is now the foreign leader who has spent the most time with the US leader since he took office in January.In brief remarks following the ceremony, Macron channeled some of Trump's populist strains, declaring that France's values must be preserved and underscoring a militaristic effort to uphold personal liberties.

Formula E, the world's first, and only all-electric racing series, is hitting the streets of the borough's Red Hook district on Saturday and Sunday -- the first time an international motor race of any description has been staged in The Big Apple. The addition of New York to Formula E's race calendar represents an important milestone for the sport which already boasts an impressive roster of city-center venues including Paris, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires and Montreal -- which will host the season three finale at the end of July. \"We think this race in New York is a turning point for Formula E,\" says Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag. \"It shows how far the championship has come -- New York is basically the capital of the world.\" WATCH: Supercharged's Tesla challenge -- Part 1Read MoreWATCH: Supercharged's Tesla challenge -- Part 2 The series has visited American shores before -- Long Beach has hosted two ePrix and Miami featured in the inaugural season -- but racing in New York raises Formula E's profile even higher.\"It's unreal to be in New York to race,\" Felix Rosenqvist, driver for the Mahindra Racing team, told CNN. \"It's the first time that anyone has done it and I'm happy to be part of that.\"The Swede currently lies third in the drivers' title race behind arch rivals Lucas di Grassi and championship leader Sebastian Buemi -- although the latter will not feature at this weekend's races.

If Walker had been married to a woman however, she would receive \u00a345,000 (about $58,000) annually for life. John Walker and his then partner at their civil partnership ceremony in 2006. This image, obtained by CNN, was originally blurred by Walker in order to protect the identity of his husband.Walker had worked at the multinational chemicals company for more than 20 years and had made mandatory pension scheme contributions like the rest of the company's employees.After retiring in 2003, Walker and his partner entered a civil partnership in 2006 -- which they later registered as a marriage. When Walker went to the pensions department to inform them of the change to his paperwork, he was told his partner wouldn't be entitled to the same financial protections as a heterosexual spouse.Read More\"It completely blew my plans apart,\" Walker told CNN. \"You've got to make sure that the person you love is going to be provided for.\"Company argued legal exemptionWalker's former employer Innospec was using a legal exemption in the Equality Act to exclude same-sex partners from receiving spousal benefits paid into pension funds before December 2005, when civil partnerships became legal in the UK.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) supported the company in the argument against Walker. But on Wednesday, the high court unanimously ruled that companies such as Innospec can no longer take advantage of that exemption, calling it a discriminatory practice that breaches EU law.Innospec told CNN they would not be commenting on the case. Thousands of gay men in UK to be pardoned for now-abolished sex offensesWalker was overjoyed with the decision and called it \"a huge step for the LGBT couples,\" but added that he was \"saddened\" that the decision had come too late for a lot of older couples who had had their pensions paid out at the lower rate. Walker also said the ruling demonstrates that companies don't need to differentiate between same-sex marriage and heterosexual marriage anymore. \"One is simply married and it should be treated exactly the same,\" he said.Emma Norton, a lawyer with human rights organization Liberty who took on Walker's case, said: \"We are delighted the Supreme Court recognized this pernicious little provision for what it was -- discrimination against gay people, pure and simple.\"Norton noted that as the ruling was made under EU law, it's unclear if and how it will stand when the UK leaves the European Union, calling on the government to protect the decision. \"[This ruling] is a direct consequence of the rights protection the EU gives us. We now risk losing that protection. The Government must promise that there will be no rollback on LGBT rights after Brexit -- and commit to fully protecting them in UK law.\"How else can John be sure he and others like him have achieved lasting justice today?\" she added.",

Blazer, a large, bearded figure, was involved in US soccer for years. At one point, he was the number two for the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF). He died at a hospital in New Jersey, according to his lawyer, Mary Mulligan.\"During his twenty years as CONCACAF General Secretary, Chuck Blazer was instrumental in bringing the federation into the modern age. His misconduct, for which he accepted full responsibility, should not obscure Chuck's positive impact on international soccer,\" Mulligan said in an emailed statement to CNN. \"He devoted thirty years of his life to soccer at all levels of the game, with his involvement ranging from coaching his children's youth teams to serving on FIFA's executive committee.\"Read MoreBlazer had been in ill health for some time. At a court hearing in 2013, Blazer told a judge he had rectal cancer and had undergone 20 weeks of chemotherapy at the time, according to an unsealed transcript of the proceedings. He said he also had diabetes and coronary artery disease.Bruce Arena, the head coach of the US Men's National Team, offered his condolences to Blazer's family, according to the team's Twitter account.ARENA: \"I'm sorry for the passing of Chuck Blazer. I know his family and I pass along my condolences to them.\"\u2014 U.S. Soccer (@ussoccer) July 13, 2017\nGuilty pleaReports in 2015 surfaced that Blazer said he didn't even fill out tax forms, yet alone pay them. Blazer amassed $11 million in unreported income according to Richard Weber, the director of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division at the time, and eventually pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and income tax evasion in 2013. He forfeited nearly $2 million at the time and the US Justice Department said he agreed to pay an undisclosed second amount at the time of sentencing.FIFA's ethics committee then handed him a lifetime ban.

        "content": "(CNN)A Russian military court has sentenced five Chechen men found guilty in the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov to lengthy prison terms, Russian state media agency Tass reported Thursday. Nemtsov, a vocal Kremlin critic and deputy prime minister in the late 1990s to President Boris Yeltsin, was shot dead in February 2015 as he walked with his girlfriend in central Moscow. Former Chechen soldier Zaur Dadaev, who investigators say acted as the gunman, was handed a 20-year sentence. Four other Chechens -- all of whom were convicted of being accomplices in the same court last month -- were handed terms ranging between 11 and 19 years. All five will serve their time in a high-security penal colony.Zaur Dadayev (C) is seen in court after being handed a sentence of 20 years in a high-security prison colony on Thursday. Zaur Dadayev had initially confessed to his role and that of the others in the crime, according to Natalia Mushnikova, the judge in the case. However, he later retracted his confession after telling human rights activists from Russia's federal watchdog, the Public Observation Commission, that it was given after being tortured, state news agency RIA Novosti previously reported.The four accomplices -- Anzor and Shadid Gubashev, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev -- all proclaimed their innocence throughout the case. Read MoreMoscow's District Military Court also fined each man 100,000 rubles ($1,670). The trial of the five men began in October 2016, seven months after the suspects were arrested. Related: The complicated life and tragic death of NemtsovA Russian court last month found the five men guilty of involvement in Nemtsov's killing. A sixth suspect wanted in connection with the murder blew himself up in a standoff with police in Chechen capital of Grozny, according to reports on state-run television at the time.Investigators said forensic evidence found in the getaway car and telephone records linked the suspects to the crime. But the lawyer representing the five men told Tass that they will be appealing the verdict \"in the coming days.\" Boris Nemtsov speaks during an opposition rally in central Moscow on December 5, 2011. Russian authorities also suspect another former Chechen military officer of being the mastermind behind the assassination. Ruslan Mukhudinov has been on an international wanted list since November 2015 and has been charged in absentia, according to Tass. A criminal case against him is being investigated separately, Tass said.Nemtsov's family said they \"will continue to seek legal action against the organizers and the individuals\" in the targeted killing. The family is unhappy with Dadaev's 20-year sentence, according to one of their lawyers, who criticized the decision not to hand him the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, Tass reported.CNN's Emma Burrows and Elizabeth Roberts contributed to this report.",

Destroying hundreds of smugglers' boats -- one of the approaches used in Operation Sophia -- prompted less secure vessels like dinghies to be used, according to the report from the House of Lords' European Union external affairs sub-committee. \"This change in the business model has made the crossing more dangerous for migrants,\" the report notes. At least 4,581 people died while making the journey between Libya and Italy last year, up from 2,876 in 2015. In the current year up to July 2, 2,150 people have died.

When he saw it for sale at the flea market, he immediately realized what it was and was \"compelled to purchase it,\" he explained.According to Georgescu, the previous owner simply did not realize the significance of the item -- he thought it was just a normal typewriter.Winston Churchill's watch symbolizing 'peace and unity in Europe' to be soldOnce it was in his possession, the mathematician \"started trying to figure out how the machine worked\" and spent time cleaning and repairing it.\"He took great care of it,\" said Georgescu. And he is not surprised that the machine -- which had a starting price of 9,000 euros ($10,300) -- sold for such a large sum. \"These machines are very rare, especially entirely functional ones,\" he explained.Many women were conscripted into work at Bletchley Park during World War II, where the Enigma code was cracked.In 2011, an Enigma machine which featured in a Hollywood movie about the Bletchley Park codebreakers sold in London for \u00a3133,250 ($208,137), breaking all previous records.World War II memorabilia of all kinds continues to attract bidders. Earlier this year, Adolf Hitler's telephone was sold in the US for $243,000 and a watch owned by Winston Churchill -- British Prime Minister during the war -- fetched \u00a3162,000 ($208,000) at auction in London, six times more than the estimate.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Hamburg concert hall that hosted Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, and Vladimir Putin last week will open its doors for free on Thursday to some of the 20,000 German police officers who were deployed during the G20 summit.All 2,000 seats in the Elbphilharmonie will be taken by police officers from the region and their partners for a concert featuring pianist Sebastian Knauer and other performers.According to Hamburg Police, 476 officers were injured during the three days of rallies and riots, when thousands of protesters converged on the summit of world leaders to demonstrate against capitalism and demand action on key issues including climate change and migrants' rights.Rallies, riots and ravesThe concert \"is a marvellous signal of recognition and respect for the extremely tough service the police had to through during the G20 summit,\" protest organizer Nicholas Hill from the 'Hamburg zeigt Haltung' (Hamburg shows attitude) march told CNN in an email. \"And it shows the attitude of the real Hamburg: a true, peaceful and solidarity city.\"Read MoreA 'symbol of gratitude'A petition was launched Saturday calling for the Elbphilharmonie to put on a \"special concert\" for the police deployed during the summit. Regional newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt is now organizing the event. Many of the anti-G20 protests were peaceful, but some demonstrators turned to violence.A back-page photograph of some of the police deployed in Hamburg with the headline \"Danke\" (Thank you) in Monday's edition prompted hundreds of emails and phone calls from locals and foreigners alike offering thanks and support, according to a spokesperson for the newspaper. A Hamburg department store is offering police a 20% discount on all goods, while hotels and restaurants around the city have announced free accommodation and special offers. Officers can enjoy a free visit to a local driving range, a zoo, a tropical aquarium and the Hamburg dungeon. 1/3 Auf Initiative des @Abendblatts gibt es Do. unter dem Motto \u00bbRespekt!\u00ab bei uns ein Konzert f\u00fcr 2000 Polizisten des ganzen Bundesgebietes pic.twitter.com/MmKH8FrDRK\u2014 Elbphilharmonie (@elbphilharmonie) July 10, 2017\nThe Elbphilhamronie announced news of Thursday's concert via social media, tweeting an image of Hamburg with the word \"Respekt!\"But not everyone is happy about the event. \"This concert is an unbearable audacity for all those who experienced severe police brutality during last week's protests,\" Nico Berg, the organizer of the Block G20 protest, told CNN in an email Tuesday. \"Such gestures hide the fact that the police risked people's lives in their operation during the 'Welcome to Hell' protest on Thursday. It disregards the fact that dozens of people were seriously injured.\"Hamburg Police told CNN on Saturday that a full assessment of the overall police response at the anti-G20 demonstrations would come at a later time. Left has been 'tarnished'The announcement follows several days of intense debate in Germany. Many politicians and journalists have criticized the police operation and suggested that Hamburg was not prepared for the scale of the protests.The regional branch of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party in Hamburg has called for the city's mayor Olaf Scholz to resign in the wake of the riots, according to CNN affiliate NTV.On Monday, Merkel promised funding for 15,000 more police officers if her party is re-elected in September's federal election, while another senior CDU politician has called for the launch of a European database to monitor violent left-wing extremists, according to NTV.G20 closes with rebuke to Trump's climate change stanceProminent left-wing politicians have condemned the violence of protesters last weekend, while urging against knee-jerk responses to the demonstrations.The violence used by some demonstrators and the extensive and often graphic media coverage have \"tarnished the image of the left,\" Hartwig Pautz, lecturer in social science at the University of the West of Scotland, told CNN.\"This violence is neither justified nor can it serve the objective of a radical critique of the conditions of society,\" Pautz said. Instead, Pautz said that the violence and the \"media frenzy\" it aroused have silenced legitimate criticisms of the G20 and of the police -- and that politicians on the left have been forced to distance themselves from the issues that the non-violent protesters were demonstrating about.Riot police and demonstrators clash during the \"Welcome to Hell\" rally last Thursday.And while Hamburg Police have released regular updates on the number of injured officers and detained protesters, the number of injured protesters is much less clear.CNN's reporters in Hamburg saw that many protest groups had self-organized paramedics and did not send injured demonstrators to hospital. Some protesters from groups such as the Black Bloc wore masks to conceal their identity and were unlikely to attend a hospital unless their injuries were severe.Medical spokesperson Franz Jurgen Schell from the Asklepios clinic in Hamburg told CNN on Tuesday that they had taken in 100 patients with injuries relating to the summit. But he could not confirm how many of these were police officers and how many were protesters.CNN's Nadine Schmidt contributed to this article.",

We've seen him on CNN. What happened?' And my parents said: 'We don't know, we've heard nothing!'\"Hock meekly made a call home three days later, leaving an answer phone message to say he'd had a \"little incident.\"'You're the guy'As the bull gored Hock, its horn tore off the travel wallet which was tied around his torso. It contained his passport, plane tickets and all his money.Bleeding, penniless and without a passport, Hock made his way to the US embassy in Madrid.

The 47-year-old's pulse used to quicken when he would watch Williams, one of history's greatest champions, compete. That was pressure. That was adrenaline.

Never before had the American worked with someone not sanctioned by her family. The father, the engineer behind Serena and sister Venus' success, needed to be swayed. He was quickly converted and Williams' decision to broaden her horizons proved to be a masterstroke.

He has had little sleep. His lack of shut-eye, he says, is a combination of boundless media commitments and late-night socializing with friends in England's capital.He gladly accepts a cup of so-so office-made coffee, although outwardly he doesn't appear to need an injection of caffeine. Wearing a jacket, white shirt and a pocket square, he is the personification of exemplary Gallic tailoring. And though 30 minutes early for the interview, he doesn't use the spare time to pause. Instead, the loquacious Frenchman is happy to talk at length about Williams -- her pregnancy, her return -- and his rise from an anxious, unhappy child to one of tennis' best coaches. This is a strange time for the father-of-four. He is at Wimbledon with no student to teach, but this summer, he says, is just the interval before one of the sport's most successful partnerships resumes next year. Mouratoglou did not know Williams was pregnant during the Australian Open in January, a tournament she won without dropping a set, but the news did not come as a surprise because the player had, he says, been looking forward to becoming a mother \"for quite a long time.\"Ever since Williams announced in May that she was pregnant, the 35-year-old --  the oldest player to ever be a world No.1, the most relentless accumulator of grand slam titles in nearly 50 years -- has maintained she will play tennis competitively again.She is a woman who thinks \"everything is possible,\" says Mouratoglou.

It later transpired she was about eight weeks pregnant.'Serena is in a permanent state of non-satisfaction'It was Williams who, in 2012, picked up the phone and called Mouratoglou to ask if she could use the facilities at his academy on the outskirts of France's capital. He has recently opened another academy in Nice. Williams had just suffered a surprise first-round defeat at the French Open and two years had passed since she had won a grand slam title. Confidence was low. Mouratoglou's strategy was to shift this once-in-a-generation talent's focus onto records, onto building a legacy.He introduced top spin to her forehand, made her play longer rallies and made sure his charge was mentally prepared for games, formulating tactics for each opponent, using his words carefully to inspire. \"It's the little differences,\" he says. \"When players think right it makes a huge difference and, with champions, it's even bigger.

She is a sporting icon. But what makes Williams a great champion, Mouratoglou explains, is her state of \"permanent non-satisfaction.\" Victories are forgotten, new goals are quickly set. She works as hard to maintain her greatness as she did to achieve it and, crucially, refuses to accept defeat. This is a player who has won three of her grand slam singles titles after being match point down. Mouratolgou remembers Williams' victory at the French Open final in 2013, a tournament she had not won for 11 years. \"After the trophy ceremony she looks at me and says 'I want to win Wimbledon,'\" he recalls, still impressed by her grit. \"There was zero celebration and, believe me, we tried. We were in the car and she just said 'drive me home.'\"The coach who couldn't connect with peopleAs well as coaching, Mouratoglou also works as a TV pundit.Mouratoglou is the son of a Greek-born businessman, but despite his family's wealth he remembers his childhood as one of being \"paralyzed by the shame of not being able to do better.\"An anxious, shy, \"puny\" kid, his early years were a \"disaster,\" which makes his evolution into an exceptional communicator all the more remarkable. \"I couldn't connect with people so I developed other senses. I had no other option,\" says Mouratolgou, who grew from an academic under-achiever into a talented singer and jazz guitarist, though tennis was his passion. \"I had to make those changes in order to live the life I wanted to live. Now, from my point of view, I have the ideal life.\"How long will that life involve coaching Williams not even he knows. \"One day she will wake up and she will tell me 'I don't feel like going to practice tomorrow.' She'll say the same the day after, the week after, and then she'll tell me it's game over, but when that is going to be I have no idea,\" he says.What Mouratoglu is sure of, however, is that Williams will be aiming to win grand slams when she returns to the sport. \"The goal is not to beat this record, or that record, the real goal is to set up Serena's record. Is it 23? 24? 25? 30? I don't know, but let's go, let's find out.\"Why would there be a limit? If, as a coach, I set limits for Serena I'm really a terrible coach because Serena doesn't have limits.\"READ: Williams tells McEnroe 'respect my privacy''McEnroe didn't mean to hurt Serena'She might not have played since the Australian Open final, but Williams is still making headlines.First her pregnancy caused waves, then she appeared naked on the front cover of Vanity Fair, and recently she's been involved in a spat with compatriot John McEnroe.

Manny Pacquiao and Jeff Horn at their weigh in ahead of the WBO title fight at Suncorp Stadium in early July.Even if Pacquiao had been declared the true winner, the WBO said that it didn't have the power to reverse the decision of the three judges, who awarded the fight to Horn, 117-111, 115-113, 115-113. Horn posted the WBO's decision on his Facebook page with the message \"Just FYI guys,\" tagging actor Samuel L. Jackson, retired basketball star Kobe Bryant, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith, boxing commentator Teddy Atlas and NFL quarterback Aaron Rogers -- all of who expressed their astonishment that Pacquiao had lost.The fight had a rematch clause in the contract, teasing the possibility that the two boxers may meet again, giving Pacquiao a chance for redemption. UpsetThe result has been called one of the greatest upsets in the sport's history. In his prime, the Filipino boxer, (59-7-2, 38 KOs), was considered by Ring magazine to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. It sparked a flurry of social media protest from boxing luminaries and fans alike, who perceived a bias towards the Australian fighter in both refereeing calls and the ultimate decision of the judges.Despite the outcry over the decision, Pacquiao was gracious in defeat.\"I didn't expect (him to be) that tough,\" he said after the fight. \"It's OK. Part of the game. That's the decision of the judges. I respect that.\"",

Others who arrive after an as-yet-undisclosed cut-off date will benefit from a \"grace period,\" expected to last two years.May has promised families will not be split up, but her government says that all EU citizens and their families must obtain an immigration status irrespective of when they arrived in the country.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nHere's five reasons why you shouldn't miss the event.No Phelps or LochteThese world championships will be the first major international competition since 2000 without either 23-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps or six-time Olympic gold medallist Ryan Lochte of the US.

Lochte, 32, is still serving a 10-month ban, which ends at the end of the month, for his role in an alcohol-fueled episode at a gas station in Brasil during the Rio Olympics with three teammates.Although he's not allowed to compete in the pool -- and lost a number of lucrative endorsement deals -- he has since taken part in the American version of \"Dancing with the Stars.\" READ: \"I locked myself in my room for four days,\" says PhelpsREAD: Ryan Lochte: 'I over-exaggerated' Olympics robbery storyREAD: Shark Week going for gold with Michael PhelpsHome favorite Katinka Hosszu is pictured with her gold medal after winning the 200m individual medley final at Rio 2016.Scenic locationThe Hungarian capital Budapest and the city of Balatonf\u00fcred, on Lake Balaton, will play hosts to the biggest sporting event the eastern European country has ever staged.Some 2,500 athletes will be competing in more than 200 events over a period of 17 days at five iconic venues. Hungary has a long and rich swimming tradition, so expect large and enthusiastic crowds cheering on their local heroes. \"We have a lot of water in Budapest and Hungary,\" FINA's Miklos Borsa told CNN Sport's Christina Macfarlane.\"Hungary is a country of waters; we have lakes, we have rivers, we have everything. We want to show it to the world, not only those who come to Budapest but to the spectators as well.\"After Mexico dropped out as hosts, Hungary stepped in, building the main venue for the world championships -- the brand new Dag\u00e1ly Swimming Complex in Budapest -- in less than two years.This state-of-the-art arena, which will stage the swimming and diving, has two Olympic-size pools and can accommodate as many as 12,300 spectators.

Named after its architect, who was also Hungary's first Olympic gold medal winner, this 7,000-seat venue has been home to the mighty Hungarian water polo team since it was first built in 1930. The squad, winners of three world championship titles and a record nine Olympic gold medals, will be trying to make amends for finishing outside of the medals in the past two Olympics.Synchronized swimming will be staged in a temporary pool by Heroes' Square, a UNESCO World Heritage site located next to the City Park ice rink, and in close proximity to  Vajdahunyad Castle. High divers will be able to take in views of Budapest's famous Parliament building when they compete alongside the river Danube by Batth\u00e1nyi Square. And finally, open water swimming will be held off the shores of Balatonf\u00fcred, in Central Europe's biggest fresh-water lake. \"All the venues are sold out,\" added Borsa. \"Altogether we're expecting 300,000 spectators.\"Synchronized swimming will be staged in a temporary pool by Heroes Square.New stars, old legendsWith Phelps and Lochte both absent, who will step up to become swimming's next big thing? Look out for whoever wins the 200 meter individual medley, an event Lochte and Phelps have dominated since the 2004 Athens Games.Can an American not named Phelps or Lochte keep the streak of seven consecutive world championship titles for the US alive? With four-time London 2012 Olympic champion Missy Franklin missing from the event because of two shoulder surgeries at the start of the year, all eyes will be on four-time Rio gold medallist Katie Ledecky on the American team.Hungarian veteran swimmers Laszlo Cseh and Katinka Hosszu, nicknamed \"The Iron Lady,\" will be looking for home glory. British diving super star Tom Daley will compete on the 10m platform in Budapest as he tries to make amends for missing out on the Olympic final in Rio, having clinched bronze in the synchro event with partner Dan Goodfellow.Daley won his lone individual world championship title in 2009 in Rome on the 10m platform when he was just 15 years old. Can he repeat the feat one more time? USA's Katie Ledecky in action during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.Tom Daley of Great Britain is another of the stars coming to Budapest.High velocity divingThe sport of high diving, which made its debut at the world swimming championships in Barcelona in 2013, has evolved from cliff diving.With a 27m platform for the men and a 20m platform for the women, this is not for the faint-hearted. Divers can reach speeds of up to 90 kilometers-per-hour and in the case of the men will have a free-fall of close to three seconds.This means divers will try and enter the water feet first instead of arms because of the impact. It's a high-risk sport, illustrated by the fact there will be at least two rescue divers present in the water to help in case of an emergency.If you've ever wondered what it's like to dive from 27 meters, roughly the same height as a nine-story appartment building, here's defending world champion Gary Hunt of Britain last year in Denmark:Briton Gary Hunt dives from the 27m platform in Dubai at the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series in October 2016.World records are set to fallAlthough this is a post-Olympic year, and some of the big guns are missing, historically swimming world records have been broken at this stage.A year on from the London 2012 Games, six world records were set at the world swimming championships in Barcelona.In 2009 in Rome, an astonishing 43 world records tumbled after swimmers were allowed to compete in polyurethane swim suits in what has since been dubbed the \"Plastic Games.\"Soon after, FINA banned the suits. Nine world records fell at the worlds in 2005 in Montreal, while six world marks were set in Fukuoka, Japan a year after the 2000 Sydney Games so it's highly likely we will be in for some exciting races at the Dag\u00e1ly Swimming Complex.",

Follow @cnnsport\n\nThis year the grass at what is considered to be tennis' most prestigious tournament is coming under scrutiny, especially after American Bethanie Mattek-Sands badly injured her knee in a fall while approaching the net in a second-round clash on Thursday against Sorana Cirstea. Those questioning the quality of the lawns aren't limited to competitors who have rarely played on the grass but include former Wimbledon champions, although Mattek-Sands' description of her injury in a Facebook live video suggested the grass wasn't to blame. No play on Sunday, as per tournament tradition, may have given the beleaguered grass a rest but that was tempered by a hectic Monday, which saw every player remaining in singles, men's doubles and women's doubles, on the schedule.   Novak Djokovic picks up a piece of loose turf from Centre Court during his third round match with Ernests Gulbis on Saturday. \"The first two matches I didn't see any significant difference,\" three-time Wimbledon winner Novak Djokovic told reporters Saturday, when asked to compare the grass to years past. \"But I was hearing a lot of comments from other players. They were complaining, especially on the outside courts. Read More\"But today I could see there is a difference in the grass, in the turf itself. It was a bit softer, I would say, especially around a couple of feet inside and outside, around the baseline area.

I mean, the courts are always perfect here.\" When the Serb referred to his fellow pros \"complaining\" about conditions on outer courts, he might have been referring to Kristina Mladenovic for one. On the same day Mattek-Sands sustained her terrible mishap, the outspoken 12th seed slipped at least three times on Court 18 -- the same arena where John Isner outlasted Nicolas Mahut in the longest match in tennis history in 2010 -- in a defeat to American Alison Riske. Bethanie Mattek-Sands receives treatment from paramedics following her fall last Thursday. According to Mladenovic, who slightly injured her knee and ankle, holes were visible on court. 'There's no grass'At one stage in the first set, play stopped as Mladenovic and Riske discussed the state of the turf with supervisor Pam Whytcross. In a briefing with reporters Thursday, Riske -- who generally likes to compete on grass, the most specialized of tennis' three main surfaces -- likened a part of the court to \"ice.\"\"There's no grass,\" Mladenovic told reporters. \"I don't know how to describe it. It's not even clay. It's not flat. \"It makes it, of course, tough to put your strong footwork. You kind of have to run light and be careful, I don't know, not to push or press too much, too hard, which is strange to play on. Kristina Mladenovic suffered several slips during her match against Alison Riske.\"I'm just honestly very happy and blessed that I didn't injure myself that much.\" This isn't the first time the grass at Wimbledon has drawn the ire of competitors. READ: Art of queuing...for Wimbledon queueREAD: Tomic fined after 'bored' commentsIn 2013, twice grand slam winner Victoria Azarenka slipped on the grass in a first-round victory, injured her knee and withdrew ahead of her second-round contest. And Maria Sharapova described the court as \"dangerous\" in an upset loss to Michelle Larcher de Brito, having taken a tumble three times. That year, more rain than usual in England in May, little sun during the first four days of Wimbledon and humidity, noted the New York Times, perhaps meant the courts hadn't sufficiently dried. But this year, the issue could stem from too much heat and a lack of rain. Most parts of England experienced a heat wave a week-and-a-half prior to Wimbledon, with several days of warmer than usual temperatures following last week. Meanwhile, rain only briefly surfaced one day of the first week, last Monday. Brown, or dead, worn-out grass that usually results deep in the second week was thus an earlier than normal visitor.  Federer weighs in\"It changes color,\" Roger Federer, chasing an eighth Wimbledon title, told reporters Thursday. \"And that bit can be slippery. So it makes moving hard. \"I don't know if that's tougher than just green grass, when it can slip out of nowhere, in my opinion. At least with the other one at least you know it's a bit different.

He denied that the courts this year were more slippery than usual. \"More slippery? I don't know if there's been more slips this year or there's just been a couple of high-profile ones,\" he said. \"I'm not sure. \"Well, obviously we listen to players,\" he added, \"because their feedback is important.

        "content": "London (CNN)Germany may soon be home to the UK's first satellite university campus on the European continent.King's College London (KCL) has worked closely with TU Dresden -- a technical university in eastern Germany -- for many years.But the relationship could now become even closer as the London university has announced it is considering opening a new campus in the German city. The announcement comes as UK universities fear falling staff and student numbers and a loss of funding as a result of Britain's pending exit from the European Union.A KCL spokesperson confirmed Monday that the project is in the early planning stages and said that the university values its existing links with TU Dresden, \"which demonstrate the success of cross-national and institutional links.\"Read More\"The plan is at an extremely early stage,\" Hans Muller-Steinhagen, Vice Chancellor of TU Dresden, told CNN, but \"there is significant interest from the senior university management at both King's and TU.\"Engulfed in chaos, UK government looks for success in Brexit talksMuller-Steinhagen spent seven years working at the University of Surrey in the UK and is bewildered by the UK's decision to leave the EU.And he expects to see proposals for satellite campuses \"all over Europe\" in the next months and years as a result.\"We are not prepared to let our strong cooperative links with UK universities suffer from these political decisions,\" he said.Students and young people have been some of the most vocal anti-Brexit protesters across Europe.Prospect of a 'cliff edge'Muller-Steinhagen sees satellite campuses as one possible solution to the potential problems caused by Brexit for UK universities.In March this year, prominent academics at the University of Oxford warned of a potential staff exodus if EU citizens lose their right to work in the UK after Brexit.Despite a recent proposal by the UK government to secure the rights of the more than three million EU citizens currently living in the UK, no deal has yet been finalized. And the European Parliament warned Monday it could veto the government's proposals.Singapore holds off competition from China to scoop Asia's top university title And the number of European students applying to study at UK universities is falling too. In December, the University of Cambridge announced that the number of applications from EU students had dropped by nearly 15%. \"We are concerned about the prospect of a 'cliff edge' for universities in which regulatory and visa changes have a sudden and damaging impact,\" the university wrote in a statement.UK universities are also facing the prospect of a loss of funding after Brexit, and UK students may no longer be eligible for the popular Erasmus scheme, an EU student exchange program that allows them to study in another Erasmus country for three to 12 months.'Cooperation not competition'According to Muller-Steinhagen, a satellite campus would offer exciting new possibilities for both researchers and students, acting as a catalyst for collaborative research as well as giving students the opportunity to study at a UK university but on European soil. \"When you have highly qualified people on both sides, and they work together, the results are much more successful,\" said Muller-Steinhagen. We want to see more \"cooperation not competition.\"And these two universities have already been working together for many years. KCL benefits from Dresden's position at the heart of \"Silicon Saxony,\" an association of over 300 commercial enterprises, research institutes and universities in eastern Germany, while TU Dresden is able to strengthen its links with the strong academic and research communities in London.In 2015, the partnership was formalized with the launch of the transCampus initiative.TU Dresden has worked closely with King's College London for many years.The aim was to \"create a partnership of scientific strength... able to compete with other leading institutions in the United States and across the rest of the globe,\" according to the initiative's website.Although the focus is currently on scientific research, there are plans to extend the scheme to embrace collaboration in the arts and humanities. A new satellite campus could help to achieve this.While concerned about the UK's decision to leave the European Union, Muller-Steinhagen is excited by the proposal and hopeful about the post-Brexit future of higher education across Europe. \"Academics are ingenious,\" he said. \"We will find solutions.\"",

Law! Justice!\" as he entered Maltepe Square. The square was packed to its seams and many attendees and marchers gave up trying to enter the rally, instead joining in on the chants from grassy patches outside the square. \"We need justice and democracy. That's why we have been in the roads for days,\" said Fadime \u00d6zbudak, a 47-year-old housewife. \"It's wonderful here. I couldn't even get inside, but I'm just so happy. ... I've never seen anything like this in Turkey.\"Another housewife, Yasemin Safak, a member of Kilicdaroglu's CHP, said she was impressed that so many people, who could have elected to do a variety of other things over the weekend, chose instead to be heard at Sunday's rally. Read MoreThe rally was so packed, some protesters had to sit outside Maltepe Square. \"I'm here for justice, rights and rule of law. I believe everyone needs justice. Some of the wrong policies need to end. Everyone knows what they are. We want a livable Turkey. The poor get poorer while the rich get richer,\" she said. \"The people say no to these injustices. This is the voice, the scream of the people for justice.\"It's not clear exactly how many people Kilicdaroglu addressed in and around the square, but the crowd was enormous. While some estimates pegged the tally at more than a million people, that number could not be immediately confirmed. Modest beginningThe \"March for Justice\" has mushroomed from a one-man protest led by Kilicdaroglu. He soon was joined by throngs of disaffected citizens -- many angry with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan -- as Kilicdaroglu kept his promise to walk from the capital, Ankara, to Istanbul after the imprisonment of one of his party's parliament members.Thousands of supporters cheer and wave flags while waiting for the start of the \"Justice Rally.\"Huge demonstrations unfolded in Maltepe, a district in suburban Istanbul that is home to the prison where Enis Berbero\u011flu is being held. They waved Turkish flags and banners bearing the word, \"adalet,\" or \"justice,\" and held up portraits of Turkey's founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.Berbero\u011flu was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in jail for giving an opposition journalist video allegedly showing Turkey sending weapons into Syria.Thousands of supporters hold a one-kilometer stream of Turkish flags in Sakarya on July 1 during the march.\"Turkey has stopped being a democratic country. It has become beholden to one man,\" Kilicdaroglu told CNN. \"This we cannot accept.\" Still reeling from coup attemptThe rally comes almost a year after a failed military coup radically changed the country's direction. Following the coup attempt, Erdogan and his government have clamped down on civil liberties across the country, gutted public institutions and universities, heavily restricted the media and ordered mass arrests of activists, journalists and the political opposition.The country has remained in a state of emergency for almost a year now, giving the Erdogan-led government extraordinary powers to detain anyone it sees as oppositional.

She sat on a grassy patch in Istanbul, exhausted, her shoes off. She and her friends wore T-shirts that read \"adalet.\" \"I'm marching for my rights, the law and justice. You can do something as hard as walking like this for so long when you believe in it, when it's for a cause,\" she said Saturday.\"March for Justice\" band plays to cheer the crowds. The march is in \u0130stanbul just 3k from Sunday's rally point. pic.twitter.com/uGPplETnBp\u2014 gultuysuz (@gultuysuz) July 8, 2017\nWhat will come of rally?Despite the fatigue, the final leg to Istanbul was festive, with bands playing along the way.Turkish protesters have regularly clashed with security forces over the past year, but the march has been peaceful, with police securing the protest from outside threats.It's unclear whether that harmony will continue in Istanbul, a city at the heart of Turkish liberalism, where rallies are now banned in historic Taksim Square.A protester waves a Turkish flag with the nation's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, superimposed on it. At least one protester who spoke to CNN wondered if the government would hear protesters' demands, forget the rally or dub the demonstrators terrorists once the flags were gone and the chants had died down. The long walk to Istanbul was difficult for many. Two people suffered cardiac arrests, one of whom later died, while others found the heat unbearable and rushed for water and shade at every opportunity. On other days, torrential rain was the enemy. No shortage of Erdogan backersThe protest is a sign that Turkey remains divided. While the march was cheered by onlookers, Erdogan's supporters also turned out to watch the protests, chanting his name in response to the marchers' chants of \"Rights, law, justice.\"Turkey's main opposition party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu began the march three weeks ago. Supporters of the protest drove by and made the peace, or victory, sign. But Erdogan supporters flashed the four-finger Rabia sign, originally used in support of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood but since adopted by Erdogan's fans.The division has persisted for some time. In April, Erdogan was granted sweeping powers after narrowly winning a referendum that transferred powers from parliament to the executive branch of government. The presidency in Turkey is traditionally ceremonial, but Erdogan has acted as the nation's leader and its head of government. International monitors slammed the referendum for being conducted on an uneven playing field.     Kilicdaroglu has tried to brand his protest as beyond politics. His supporters have displayed no political logos, and he has called for Turks of all political affiliations to join.CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

She said the other 19 members of the G20, which includes the European Union, agreed that the Paris climate accord was irreversible and that they remained committed to it.Trump faced global outrage last month when he announced he would withdraw the United States from the agreement, which obliges countries to reduce their carbon emissions to ward off catastrophic global warming.Read MoreThe G20 declaration noted the US withdrawal from the accord but said the country affirmed its \"strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.\" After the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin called climate change a \"major issue\" and said Merkel had reached a \"good compromise.\"\"Although the US will withdraw, they are nevertheless still prepared to carry on now (with) discussions on this subject. It seems to me this is a very positive point and can be chalked up to the successes of Angela Merkel,\" Putin said.British Prime Minister Theresa May said that she was dismayed at the US climate stance and that she had urged Trump to reconsider.And Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that \"strong economic growth and environmental protection can go hand in hand.\"\"This is the narrative that we have been sharing ... and was enthusiastically supported by just about everyone here at the G20.\"Backtrack on tradeIn her remarks, Merkel appeared to come down hard on Trump's protectionist trade policies, saying she was glad that leaders agreed that \"markets need to be kept open.\"\"This is all about fighting protectionism and also unfair trade practices,\" she said. But the declaration made concessions for \"the role of legitimate trade defense instruments\" in a sign that leaders had given into the United States.Trump won the 2016 election on an \"America First\" platform and vowed to pull the country out of several multilateral trade deals and negotiations.The United States has threatened to impose new tariffs on steel imports, a position that prompted European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to threaten the same in return, raising fears of a trade war.Trump-Putin meetingMuch of the attention at the G20 was on Friday's bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin. Putin told reporters Saturday that Trump appeared to agree with Moscow's position that it did not interfere in last year's election.JUST WATCHEDPutin: I think Trump agreed Russia didn't meddleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin: I think Trump agreed Russia didn't meddle 01:13\"I repeat, he asked a lot of questions on this matter,\" Putin said at a Saturday press conference. \"I answered as many as I could answer. I think he took it into consideration and agreed with it. But you should ask him what his opinion is on that.\"On Friday, a senior administration official told CNN that Trump did not accept Putin's claim of noninterference in the US election.Regarding his personal relationship with Trump, the Russian President said, \"I think it was established. I don't know how this will sound, but I'll tell you how I see it. TV Trump is very different from the real person; he is absolutely specific, absolutely adequate in his perception of the dialogue partner. He analyzes things quickly, replies to the raised questions or new elements of the conversation. So I think if our future relations will unfold the same way as our meeting yesterday, there is every reason to believe that we can restore, at least partially, the level of cooperation we need.\"Protesters flood streets of Hamburg as G20 wraps upThe G20 summit has been marked by protests against capitalism, globalization, climate change and the concentration of power among the 20 nations in the group. They have been violent at times. The Hamburg police said that more than 200 police officers have been injured and that 114 people have been arrested. Another 89 were taken into temporary custody. It was not clear how many protesters were injured. Around 1,000 police officers arrived in Hamburg to support security forces.Future meetingsWith Trump aboard, Air Force One departed from Germany and was expected to arrive at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Saturday evening.In a declaration issued at the end of the G20 summit, the group announced that Saudi Arabia will host the conference in 2020.

The Ile de France prefecture said in a statement that 2,771 migrants and refugees were moved to temporary shelters, where they have been able to receive social and medical assistance.The prefecture characterized 161 of those relocated on Friday as vulnerable individuals including \"single foreign minors and women.\" More than 30 migrant relocation operations have been carried in Paris since June 2015, resulting in roughly 27,000 offers of shelter, the statement added. The makeshift camp is one of several that has sprouted up around the French capital.The number of migrants sleeping rough in the French capital has increased since the closure of the \"Jungle\" camp in the city of Calais in October last year. The site was demolished by authorities in an effort to halt the flow of migrants trying to cross into the UK through the Eurotunnel.

In a letter addressed to the GAB, the WBO agreed that it would appoint a review panel to watch the bout, round-by-round.\"We will appoint five (5) anonymous competent Judges from different countries to watch the bout without sound distraction,\" the letter said. \"Then, we will tabulate the results to ascertain clearly which rounds each fighter won using an average scale based on 60, 80 and 100 per cent.  This means that 3 of the 5 officials have to agree to determine which fighter won the round.\"Read MoreThe WBO has repeatedly said that it doesn't have the power to reverse the decision of the three judges, who unanimously awarded the fight to Horn, 117-111, 115-113, 115-113. It does, however, state that the fight had a rematch clause in the contract, teasing the possibility that the two boxers may meet again, giving Pacquiao a chance for redemption. The methodology was reproduced in a Facebook post on the WBO's page. In his statement, Pacquiao said he accepted the decision \"but as a leader and (a) fighter I have the moral obligation to uphold sportsmanship, truth and fairness in the eyes of the public.\"The GAB's letter said it also that it did not contest the result. \"I love boxing and I don't wanna see it dying because of unfair decision and officiating,\" added Pacquiao.

JUST WATCHEDTrump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nationsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump heads to summit amid disagreements with G20 nations 04:42A German government spokesman told CNN that Merkel herself selected the Ninth Symphony (\"a substantial part of German culture\"), whose final movement, better known as the \"Ode to Joy,\" is \"a hymn to humanity, peace and international understanding.\"After US President Donald Trump's first trip to Europe in May, is Merkel trying to make nice with music? Or is she looking to score points off a man who has previously conceded that symphonies aren't really his thing?Read More\"I have to admit that my knowledge of classical music is limited,\" Trump wrote in his 2004 book \"How to Get Rich.\" Instead, the US President's musical tastes tend more towards old-style crooners and middle-of-the-road rock \u2014 Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Elton John, the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith.Idealistic vision of unityCompleted in 1824, Beethoven's final symphony sets the idealistic words of German poet Friedrich Schiller to music; together, they look forward to a time of joyful unity, when \"All people become brothers.\"JUST WATCHEDHigh stakes for Trump, Putin at G20 summitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHigh stakes for Trump, Putin at G20 summit 02:31\"The piece was written ... at a time of repression and counter-revolution,\" says Nicholas Baragwanath, head of the music department at the UK's University of Nottingham. \"The [French] Revolution, this great experiment, had failed and it was a police state, effectively.\"Given the troubled times it was created in, the symphony has long been seen as \"a cry for freedom,\" Baragwanath says. But John Deathridge, emeritus professor of music at Kings College London, says the original poem was toned down to make it less revolutionary: \"In the original, it has the line 'Beggars become princes' brothers,' suggesting all levels of society come together. That becomes ... more abstract.\"The Ninth Symphony was Ludwig van Beethoven' final major work -- the composer was deaf by the time it was completed.And he says \"the idea that Beethoven was a democrat,\" using his music to argue that power should be in the hands of the people, is \"rubbish.\"\"He believed in a kind of benign authoritarianism,\" Deathridge says. \"He was a monarchist at the end of the day. He wanted everyone together, but not in the democratic spirit as we think of it today.\"Protest artworks appear in Hamburg for G20Music used for political endsWhatever Beethoven's original intentions, the 150-plus years since the Ninth Symphony's debut have seen it \u2014 and in particular the \"Ode to Joy\" \u2014 co-opted by a string of political causes, some of which would be considered far from utopian today.\"Few great works of art have spent so much time with such unappealing people,\" wrote music and arts critic Igor Toronyi-Lalic in The Times in 2009. \"For much of its history, the ode has been a companion to the most murky and murderous of political extremes.\"Everyone, from the Nazis to the Communists, from white supremacists in Rhodesia to anti-Pinochet activists in Chile, leftist guerrillas in Peru and student protesters in Tiananmen Square, has claimed this classical earworm, all of them insisting that it proves their point.JUST WATCHEDTrump attacks media ahead of G20 summitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump attacks media ahead of G20 summit 02:20That, says Deathridge, is both the work's genius and its weakness: \"It creates this empty space that you can put all sorts of things into. You can interpret the desire for unity as something authoritarian, or as a protest against authoritarianism.\"The piece has also been used at times of great celebration in Germany. During the early part of the Cold War (from 1956 to 1968) \"Ode to Joy\" was the de facto anthem of the combined East and West German teams at the Olympic Games.On Christmas Day, 1989, Leonard Bernstein conducted a performance of the symphony to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall, six weeks earlier. And in November 2014, musicians performed \"Ode to Joy\" at the Brandenburg Gate to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the wall's fall.Since the 1970s, \"Ode to Joy\" has also been the anthem of what is now the European Union, chosen because it \"expresses the European ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity.\" UK Prime Minister Theresa May, currently negotiating the terms of Britain's departure from the EU, may also be uncomfortable in her seat at such a celebration of European unity \u2014 some Scottish MPs have used the tune as a means of protesting Brexit.Trump could learn a lot from MerkelApt choice of music?US President Donald Trump's music taste favors crooners over classical tunes. So when conductor Kent Nagano taps his baton to signal the start of the performance, will Trump be in the auditorium? A recital of the Ninth Symphony typically lasts for over an hour, and its best-known section, the \"Ode to Joy,\" comes at final movement.Given the US President's infamously short attention span, the idea of him sitting through the whole concert is \"extraordinary,\" says John Deathridge. \"Perhaps he'll come late.\"JUST WATCHED'Zombies' march through G20 summit cityReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Zombies' march through G20 summit city 00:47It would be a shame for him to miss it, says Deathridge, insisting it is a very apt piece of music for Trump.\"I think there is actually something fitting about the choice,\" he says. \"Donald Trump is behaving like a monarch ... it's like going backwards to monarchical times when leaders had absolutely no conscience, so in a way it is a very suitable piece for him.\"The world vs. Trump at G20But if Merkel's US visitor doesn't enjoy his evening's entertainment, Trump's own history suggests he won't hesitate to show his displeasure.\"In the second grade ...

But about 30 minutes before midnight, police moved forward, firing teargas, water cannons and setting off flash-bang grenades.Protesters hurled bottles of looted champagne into the fires, Hamburg police said, causing popping noises that sounded like fireworks. At one store, residents of the area tried to stop people from stealing from the shop windows.From where a CNN crew was positioned, the mass of protesters appeared to stretch for at least 1 mile. CNN saw people who were injured but police tweeted there were no totals available for how many people were hurt.Read MoreIt was a much more aggressive atmosphere than earlier when police sought to prevent small groups of mostly anti-capitalist protesters Friday from disrupting the summit world leaders including President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin met for talks.Police said 197 officers have been injured since Thursday and reinforcements from outside Hamburg have been requested. At least 83 people were arrested and 17 have been detained since the protests began, police said on Twitter.Earlier, officers dressed in riot gear intervened as protesters tried to enter the red zone -- a blocked-off area close to the summit venue -- while other small groups staged sit-ins across the city.Fire on the streets in Hamburg's Sternschanze area now pic.twitter.com/sgtvEeHVFw\u2014 Kara Fox (@karadaniellefox) July 7, 2017\nAt one of the sit-ins, a little more than a mile from the summit security zone, water cannons were deployed against protesters who came armed with umbrellas and rain gear.

Other officers were attacked with fire bombs in Holstenstrasse, farther north, police said, and barricades were set afire.Festive atmosphereA big crowd, including leftist groups from elsewhere in Europe, gathered Friday afternoon amid a more festive atmosphere in Millerntorplatz, a square off the Reeperbahn.

Violence also flared earlier in the Altona district, a couple of miles to the west of the summit security zone.Past G20 protestsSome G20 summits have been marked by violence.More than 100 people were arrested during demonstrations at the G20 summit in London in April 2009. Tensions flared as police kept protesters \"kettled\" in the streets for hours.There were more than 80 arrests at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh later that year.Hundreds of protesters were arrested at the June 2010 summit in Toronto as violence and vandalism broke out.Since then, G20 summits have been largely peaceful. Some have been in more remote locations -- such as Brisbane, Australia -- or protesters have been kept far from the venue amid tight security. Last year, China ramped up security for the summit in Hangzhou and reportedly gave residents a week's vacation.Hamburg police said one of their helicopters was targeted with a flare that only narrowly missed it. Two police vehicles carrying officers were also attacked, with paint thrown and windows smashed. Bottles and fireworks were flung, injuring some officers, police said.The tires of a Canadian delegation car were slashed, police said, although a Canadian official disputed that account. Police earlier asked the public to avoid the area near the Hamburg-Altona railway station, where authorities said people had set vehicles on fire and thrown Molotov cocktails. Smoke could be seen across the skyline from fires said to have been lit by protesters.The latest round of demonstrations, though unruly, are smaller and more dispersed than Thursday night's violence, during which at least 111 police officers were hurt, according to police. Water cannons were deployed to disperse protesters, and 29 arrests were made. Police did not give the reasons for the arrests.Security is tight in the city of 1.8 million as leaders from around the world convene for the G20 summit.The Group of 20, which includes 19 countries and the European Union, accounts for about 80% of the global gross domestic product.

It's a shame. We have therefore decided not to proceed with Bravalla 2018,\" the festival's organizer said in a statement.The four-day festival draws approximately 50,000 visitors annually.

Just kick out the men.Knyckare tweeted in response to the news of the cancellation, \"What about organizing a really cool festival where men aren't allowed until ALL men learn how to behave.\"Vad tror ni om att vi styr ihop en asfet festival dit bara icke m\u00e4n \u00e4r v\u00e4lkomna som vi k\u00f6r tills ALLA m\u00e4n har l\u00e4rt sig hur en beter sig?\u2014 Emma Knyckare (@Knyckare) July 2, 2017\nAnd she was serious.\"I think it's appalling that half the population is allowed to walk around feeling unsafe. So there will be an alternative next year: A rock festival where women can feel completely safe,\" she told Aftonbladet.Bravalla has become a venue for frequent reports of sexual assaults. Bracelets with \"Don't Grope\" were handed out at last year's festival in response.\"Who is doing the raping? Well, it's men. So why not organize a festival without men?\" Knyckare told Aftonbladet.\"Surely it must be reasonable to shut out men for three days when women are discriminated against all the time. I don't think you can compare assault to not being able to attend a festival,\" she said.Knyckare isn't the first to suggest a female-only music festival. In 1997, singer Sarah McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour that featured only female performers.We may be seeing a successor to Lilith Fair soon, as Knynckare assured her fans, \"It's not yet clear when the festival is taking place, but it's happening.\"CNN's Jim Stenman contributed to this report.",

I mean what kind of state do we live in?\" she said about authorities' initial moves to control the protests.There were also periods of calm during the day, where demonstrators marched through the port city in northern Germany, home to some 1.8 million people. But after nightfall there were flames in the streets.As marchers reached the Rote Flora, a building that has been a traditional gathering spot for leftists, a pile of trash was set on fire in the street. Police used a water cannon to put out the blaze, which consumed bicycles, bags of trash, and other items found nearby. Protesters set fire to items in the street near the Rote Flora left-wing center.In another area of the city, one car was destroyed by a fire.Police said the windows of several shops in two districts were smashed. Protest breaks apartEarlier, the main body of protesters splintered and one group took over an intersection where a truck with a sound system blared music suitable for a house party. Police stayed on the fringes, backed by two trucks with water cannons. Mark Meyer is part of a grass-roots team of 100 or so lawyers who are volunteering to help protesters understand their legal rights if they are detained. He told CNN that the police \"wanted to crash and smash this demo from the beginning\" and were looking for any excuse to do so. He also said the red zone -- the no-go area near the summit -- is not legal and he will protest against it Friday.The anti G20 demo has evolved into groovy house party on the streets of Hamburg - with fireworks, not cops now providing the bang pic.twitter.com/z9s3gpJcsG\u2014 Kara Fox (@karadaniellefox) July 6, 2017\nG20 discussions to include climate change, migrationThe G20, founded in 1999, meets each year.

Read More\"I love boxing and I don't wanna see it dying because of unfair decision and officiating.\"In his prime, the Filipino boxer, (59-7-2, 38 KOs), was considered by Ring magazine to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.

If you can't get motivated at Wimbledon it's time to find another job,\" Navratilova told the BBC. \"The spectators paid good money to come here and watch Wimbledon and the guy shows up and doesn't try, he can't be bothered.

His best performance in a grand slam, perversely, came at Wimbledon in 2011 when he became the youngest player since Boris Becker to reach the quarterfinals -- losing in four sets to eventual winner Novak Djokovic. Still only 24, Tomic has already spent nearly a decade on the ATP Tour -- he burst on to the scene as a 16-year-old reaching the second round of the 2009 Australian Open. He has won three senior titles to date -- the last coming in Bogota, Colombia two years ago -- and amassed almost $5 million in prize money.  While Tomic's form has fluctuated he's had a number of issues off court to deal with -- notably his relationship with his father.Visit cnn.com/tennis for more news and videosTomic's first-round \"efforts\" at Wimbledon saw him walk away with \u00a335,000 ($45,000) nudging his year earnings towards $400,000. \"It's tough to find motivation out there -- I think this is my eighth Wimbledon already and I'm 24 years old,\" Tomic lamented. \"I've got to find a way to get back and enjoy tennis again.\"  Cash, meanwhile, has some advice for Tomic -- if he's serious about rediscovering his love for the game. \"He needs to go and work in a factory, do some labor and see what it's like to really work out there,\" Cash told the BBC. \"He is too rich, too early -- it's as simple as that.\"",

The march route stretches some 450 kilometers (nearly 280 miles) from the Turkish capital of Ankara to Istanbul. And that is what has driven Yucekan to her current choice of shoes -- a pair of men's slippers. They're not fancy but they get the job done while she walks roughly 15 kilometers a day in record high temperatures.On day 20, rain showers bring some respite to marchers.\"I tried sneakers for the first two weeks (of the march). That got too hot and so I tried sandals. Those hurt my feet. These are not very nice looking but I don't care, I'm comfortable,\" Yucekan said. Yucekan and her husband Yalcin have been walking since day one with Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the march and head of the main opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP. \"He's the Gandhi of Turkey and this is his march for justice, only justice,\" says Yalcin Yucekan.Read MoreDespite this endorsement, Kilicdaroglu's decision to walk from Ankara to Istanbul caught many by surprise. His calm manner and less-than-colorful personality have been a constant irritation for those who oppose Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But after putting on a pair of sneakers and leading the march, the bureaucrat of some 30 years has shed his old-school image.Kemal Kilicdaroglu photographed on day 20 of the march, rests in a small caravan.\"I am walking with conviction, with belief... I am going to walk every millimeter of those 450 kilometers,\" he said, speaking with CNN as the march stopped for a short break.There is a lot of support as marchers go by. People welcome them, clapping along the route and honking horns in support as the participants walk by. Elderly women dangle dangerously from windows to wave Turkish flags in a show of solidarity.Some from the Turkish Roma community join along the route with drums and clarinets, injecting music to the march. Old-time favorites are hummed, while others join in with a bit of dance. Football fans from the Galatasaray football team joined in the march, adding their stadium chants and songs. The marchers also routinely run into supporters of Erdogan who chant his name and hold up four fingers -- a symbol adopted by the President's supporters. A truck full of manure was dumped outside a motel where marchers stayed for a night. One man lunged aggressively at the marchers and screamed for them to be hanged. For their part, the marchers either ignore the insults or respond with applause.Critics of the march accuse participants of supporting terrorists and inciting chaos in Turkey. Erdogan has said that those marching for justice should instead focus on the victims of last year's attempted coup in July during which nearly 250 people lost their lives. Those who participate in the march could be viewed as \"willfully being a part of the crime of treason,\" Erdogan said last week in a speech.  A woman in traditional Aegean clothes participates in the Justice March. Kilicdaroglu announced his protest march from the Turkish capital to Istanbul after a CHP parliamentarian was arrested. The lawmaker was sentenced to 25 years in jail for giving an opposition journalist video allegedly showing Turkey sending weapons into Syria. But the march has become about more than that one arrest. Kurds and leftists have been walking with nationalists and some conservative Muslims who all have grievances against the Erdogan government.Kilicdaroglu says he is marching for jailed journalists, academics who have been fired, all those who he says have been unjustly purged in the aftermath of the attempted coup, and anyone else who is looking for justice. The long days pounding the pavement through the Turkish countryside have taken their toll. One person died from a heart attack and another was hospitalized. The police presence along the main E-5 highway heading towards Istanbul. Sixty-nine-year-old Kilicdaroglu says he would not describe himself as athletic.\"It would be a lie to say I don't have any trouble walking this much but if you told me four months ago that I would walk 450 kilometers to Istanbul, I would have thought you had gone mad. But we are the end of the line,\" he said. \"Turkey has stopped being a democratic country. It has become beholden to one man... This we cannot accept,\" he said.The march is expected to end with rally in Istanbul on Sunday. Whether authorities will allow the rally to take place is still unclear.",

She is perplexed. Never before has she seen an orderly procession such as this. She animatedly tells those nearby that she has flown from Melbourne to watch her beloved Roger Federer elegantly glide on Wimbledon's Centre Court, but did not expect to have to camp for two days in a park for such pleasure. Begrudgingly, she accepts her fate and joins the line. Follow @cnnsport\n\nFor 24 years this tennis fan would undertake an annual around-the-world trip to watch tennis greats compete in the sport's oldest tournament, but in the seven years since her last visit to this corner of south west London much has changed. She is now just one of thousands who set off to England's capital on a journey filled with tennis hope, joining a queue which is as much a fabric of Wimbledon as strawberries and cream and pristine all-white tennis kits. Hundreds of fans queue overnight for a chance to get tickets to the show courts.READ: Roger Federer -- The making of a sports great Read MoreREAD: My goal was to get in the top 100 -- Murray'The Queue'Hard as it may be to believe, this seemingly never-ending sluggish line can, at times, be as absorbing as any of the countless volleys, aces and glorious forehands that light up The All England Tennis Club. First-timers will gawp at it, countless camera crews film it and locals just roll their eyes. The Wimbledon queue is not a mere queue but, as the signs call it, 'The Queue.' It is an event, a feature of the championships since the early 20th Century. After all, standing one behind the other is, as they say, quintessentially British. Although, waiting in line was a phenomena Americans and Britons picked up from the French in the 19th century, with queue a French word meaning tail, which is what people looked like, according to David Andrews -- author of Why Does the Other Line Always Move Faster? -- when they were waiting in bread lines. But that is another story. There are currently more people in #TheQueue than Grounds capacity for today. We advise those intending to queue not to travel to #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/mYqnD2hxRK\u2014 Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 4, 2017\nWith almost 7,000 people queuing on Monday for tickets to the tournament's opening day -- the first person arriving nearly 40 hours before the start of play, at 1.30am on Saturday -- Richard Lewis, Wimbledon's chief executive, has admitted that The Queue had become a victim of its own success. Bigger with each passing year, tennis fans have become embroiled in an arms race: a dash to be the first, a battle of strategies to get their mitts on the limited amount of tickets available on the day for Centre Court, Court One and Court Two, the show courts.Stamina, patience and meticulous planning are required if you want to be top of the pecking order. The Queue has become a Wimbledon tradition.Understanding why the masses descend on Wimbledon Park, a grassy parkland which at any other time of the year is an inconsequential suburban recreational ground a stone's throw from the perfectly manicured lawns of SW19, is relatively straightforward. It is rare nowadays for ordinary sports fans to purchase on-the-day tickets for prestigious sporting events and so for hours, for days, tennis fans are happy to wait and wait. And wait. \"We're a bit weird,\" admits Elizabeth Verstappen, chuckling. The 31-year-old set off from the Netherlands on Sunday morning with her friend Michelle Bemelmans to sleep under the stars for two nights, a sacrifice they make with a smile for the opportunity to walk into Centre Court, the sport's most cherished arena.Both are Wimbledon veterans and wile away the hours playing cards, reading magazines and chatting to other fans who have set up camp beside them. \"I was up at 3.15am on Sunday morning. I really like the atmosphere and the people are very friendly. This is very special,\" says the 35-year-old Bemelmans. READ: Venus Williams left tearful by car crash question Golden TicketAs soon as one tent pops up, another is being assembled. By Monday afternoon The Queue for Tuesday is four rows deep and rapidly growing.For the uninitiated, there is an early-morning routine for everyone who queues overnight: at 6am they will be woken by stewards and asked to dismantle their tents --  empty bottles of Prosecco and pizza boxes will be cleared up too -- to form a tighter formation for that day's queue.At 7.30am stewards issue wristbands to those in the front of The Queue who want tickets for the show courts. As a 29-page guide, issued to each member of The Queue, states: \"The number of wristbands issued exactly matches the quantity of tickets available for each court on that day.\" Given the effort and wait to secure the wristband it must feel a bit like winning Willy Wonka's Golden Ticket. Maybe even better -- there were only five Golden Tickets. The Queue moves at a snail's pace. Honorary stewards in high visibility vests will bellow orders in polite plumy tones, handing out numbered cards to each new arrival to inform them of their place at the rear of this extraordinary human tail. On Tuesday, a gentleman joining The Queue at 8am was ranked number 8,850. A ground pass for $32 -- giving him access to the outside courts and the famous 'Henman Hill' where fans watch the action on a big screen -- would be his reward.A yellow flag with the letter Q, held up by a youthful volunteer, signals the end of The Queue. If the flag moves, the masses have been prodded into action. A Queue Code of Conduct must be followed.Wimbledon would not be Wimbledon without rules and so, unsurprisingly, there are strict do's and don'ts if you want to become an accepted member of this jamboree.Barbecues are not permitted, neither are gazebos and tents must only accommodate two people. Music? Ball games? Not after 10pm, please. There is freedom of movement, but in the steely words of The Queue Code of Conduct: \"Temporary absence from The Queue should not exceed 30 minutes,\" while queue jumping is akin to eating strawberries without cream. As the Code of Conduct says, it is \"not acceptable and will not be tolerated.\"A young man performs kick-ups with a giant tennis ball as tennis fans wait in line. Personal hygiene Security has been tightened for this year's tournament following a number of terrorist attacks in England over recent months.Concrete blocks have been installed along the queuing zone in the park to protect fans, but despite the visual reminder of the threats posed to a major event such as this there is still a cheerful atmosphere in this makeshift campsite. Concrete blocks are an added security measure at this year's Wimbledon Anti-vehicle barriers have also been put up around Wimbledon Park.The pleasant weather experienced in London this week has helped. Three friends camping overnight in Tuesday's queue form a circle and are attempting to stave off boredom by throwing a tennis ball at each other.Behind them a father and son have erected a makeshift net and are playing tennis, while a number of fans are sprawled on the ground, enveloped by exhaustion.Sitting on a blanket outside his tent while his wife attempts to sleep off a draining journey from Taiwan is 33-year-old Simon Juan.\"We left home on Wednesday (June 28),\" says Juan, who joined the queue for Tuesday's play at around 5.30pm on Sunday afternoon. \"It is my wife's big dream to come to Wimbledon.\"Lying on an airbed which is too big for the tent they ordered online and worrying about their personal hygiene is an American couple, Lindsey Joseph and Justin Shamoun.\"We flew from the States on Sunday night, landed Monday morning, dropped off our stuff at our hotel and came here and have yet to shower,\" said Sahmoun, a 23-year-old New Yorker.It is Lindsey's dream to attend all four of tennis' grand slams and this year's debut ticks Wimbledon off the New Jersey native's bucket list. 'Time passes really fast'Such is The Queue's celebrity, it has its own hashtag on Twitter, while ViewFromTheQ offers updates and advice to would-be joiners.     This is Tuesday's queue for Wimbledon. One or two tents already pitched up. \ud83d\ude2e #tennislife #wimbledon #queuing #tennis #instasports A post shared by Aimee Lewis (@aimeelewissport) on Jul 3, 2017 at 4:37am PDT \"Looking to pitch around 4pm today [Tuesday] for Wednesday queue, any chance of Centre Court or Court One?\" asks Robert on Twitter. \"No,\" comes ViewFromTheQ's succinct reply. By 9am on Tuesday morning, Wimbledon was tweeting that The Queue was exceeding The All England Club's capacity for that day and advising fans not to travel to Wimbledon for the second day's play. It will likely be a tweet organizers will repeat daily throughout the fortnight. But much like Wimbledon itself, a tournament which balances tradition with sport's commercialization, The Queue has changed over the years.Giant sponsorship signs line the path to the grounds of the golf club which takes fans ever closer to their paradise, while camping on Church Road, the main throughway to The All England Club, is no longer allowed because of health and safety regulations. \"You weren't allowed to put your tent up until 6pm and all you could do was sit around, surveying your suitcase, so there was no point to be there too early,\" remembers Swiss tennis fan Doris Loeffel.Advertizing boards have now been erected along parts of The Queue. \"It was enough to come by 3pm or 4pm to get tickets for the next day's play but then they changed the queuing system. It's more comfortable to camp on this huge lawn and you can stay there all day having a great time.  \"It's the cheapest accommodation you can get in London! I queued for 10 years. One year a friend of mine brought her knitting and was making Christmas gift while she was in the queue. Time passes really fast, you wouldn't believe it.\"Fans queuing on the Church Road in 2000.Visit cnn.com for more news and videos Enchanted worldOnce tickets have been purchased -- with cash only -- fans will enter a verdant land. They will walk into an enchanted world, an English country fete where royalty, the rich, the famous and everyday tennis fans watch the best of the best. It is a beguiling mix. Fans queue to enter an outside court before the start of playThose fortunate enough to step beyond the All England Club's threshold will also be able to queue again -- for strawberries and cream, for Pimms (the fruity tipple of choice in this prime piece of real estate), for oversized tennis balls, for resale tickets and for access to various outside courts.Royalty and special guests are excluded from this practice, of course.What has been your experience of the Wimbledon queue?

Riders traveling at high speed, like a swarm of bees, jostle for position in pursuit of glory before a winner finally emerges from the bedlam.But it's also a place of danger. And it took just a flick of an elbow for chaos to engulf Tuesday's stage of the Tour de France \u2014 arguably the world's toughest professional bike race.Follow @cnnsport\n\nArnaud D\u00e9mare won the stage which ended in Vittel \u2014 becoming the first Frenchman to win a bunch sprint at the Tour for over a decade \u2014 but it was the horror crash behind him that has dominated the headlines.With 200 meters to go of stage four, Peter Sagan veered to his right and appeared to elbow Mark Cavendish, forcing him into the barrier at speeds of 60 kilometers per hour (37mph) and leaving the Briton with a fractured right shoulder blade and subsequently out of the race.Compatriot Ben Swift and Germany's John Degenkolb were also thrown from their bikes, with Sagan escaping the melee to seize second place.Read MoreAs things became clearer, Sagan expressed sympathy for his rival but, having been expelled from the race, appealed to organizers and insisted he hadn't done anything wrong. \"It was a crazy sprint,\" he told reporters. \"It wasn't the first one like that; it won't be the last one like that\"The cyclist then took his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but his request to be reinstated in the race was rejected Thursday. Sagan and Cavendish had been expected to contest the Tour's sprint stages, but the absence of both cyclists has thrown the race for the event's green jersey wide open.\"I'm obviously massively disappointed to get this news about the fracture,\" said Cavendish, having crossed the line several minutes after D\u00e9mare and later confirmed his withdrawal from this year's event.\"I feel I was in a good position to win [the stage] and to lose that and have to leave the Tour \u2014 a race I have built my whole career around \u2014  is really sad.\"I get on well with Peter and a crash is a crash but I'm not a fan of him putting his elbow in like that.\"READ: Extreme Cuba -- 1,450 kilometers in 57 hoursREAD: Chapel that's a shrine to cycling's fallen and heroesREAD: Yorkshire spawns cycling revolutionSagan gives a kick of his elbow and Cavendish (L) falls near the finish line of stage four.'Completely outrageous' The 32-year-old Cavendish, who rides for the Dimension Data team, has 30 stage wins to his name, and had been bidding to reach Belgian Eddy Merckx's all-time record number of 34.That wait must now go on, prompting Roger Hammond, Cavendish's sporting director, to describe Sagan's actions as \"completely outrageous.\"\"Elbows fellow competitor in the head ... can only result in one decision,\" posted Hammond, in a tweet that would later prove prophetic.Causes a big crash at 1.5 to go, elbows elbows fellow competitor in the head 300 meters... can only result in one decision. #Goodbye pic.twitter.com/xeTB0llOPF\u2014 Roger Hammond (@rog10) 4 July 2017 Sagan himself was mainly concerned with the extremity of the measure, having initially been docked 30 seconds, 80 points and relegated to 115th place on the stage before the full extent of his punishment was revealed.\"Mark was coming really fast from the back and I just didn't have time to react and to go left,\" the Bora-Hansgrohe rider explained. \"He came into me and he went into the fence.\"When I was told after the finish that Mark had crashed, I went straight away to find out how he was doing.\"We are friends and colleagues in the peloton and crashes like that are never nice. I hope Mark recovers soon.\"Bora-Hansgrohe officials similarly rejected the claim the rider had \"caused, or in any way intended to cause, the crash.\"But the head UCI comissaire, Philippe Marien, stated the far sterner sanction was applied because the offender \"had put several other riders involved in the crash in danger\" and he had sensed a moment to \"set boundaries.\"  \"Before the Tour de France we warned the sprinters that we would look very closely at every sprint,\" said Marien. \"That is what we did today.\"\"It was not about Sagan, but about the act the rider made. What happens here, it looks like it was on purpose and it almost looks like hitting a person.\"It's not about Cavendish and Sagan; it could be anybody, the names won't matter.\"READ: Around the world in 80 days -- on a bikeCavendish (right) crosses the finish line after the crash.ReactionThe verdict has split opinion among commentators, fans and fellow riders. Retired Australian cyclist Baden Cooke, winner of the 2003 green jersey, expressed his opinion that it was \"unintentional.\"\"Sending Sagan home was a bad decision,\" he tweeted. \"You often use your elbows to give yourself space to avoid crashing yourself.\"Sending Sagan home was a bad decision. It was unintentional. You often use your elbows to give yourself space to avoid crashing yourself.\u2014 Baden Cooke (@badencooke) 4 July 2017 Former Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a champion Chris Horner, meanwhile, said he \"totally disagreed\" with the decision, urging organizers to reinstate the five-time green jersey winner.Just saw the finish of today's @LeTour stage. Totally disagree with the decision to DQ Sagan. Put @petosagan back in the race!\u2014 Chris Horner (@hornerakg) 4 July 2017  It was a sentiment shared by former rider Jens Voigt, who contended the disqualification was \"too much.\"So in my private opinion-the disqualification is too much.I am ok with -80 points in green jersey,last place today and timepenalty for sagan\u2014 Jens Voigt (@thejensie) 4 July 2017 But Dimension Data performance director Ralf Adag said: \"If it's in rule book that you can elbow someone with 200m to go, we need to rewrite the rules.\"Team Sky's Geraint Thomas, the early holder of the yellow jersey, also fell on stage four but reassured fans he was fit to continue, urging Cavendish to \"heal up quick.\"Cavendish, 32, is four Tour de France stage wins behind Eddy Merckx's all-time record number of 34.Do you think Sagan should have been disqualified? Have your say on CNN Sport's Facebook pageAs it stands, Sagan is the first world champion to be thrown off the race since 1998, when Frenchman Laurent Brochard was disqualified for his role in the Festina drug scandal.He is also the first rider of any standing to be removed from the competition since 2010, when Australia's Mark Renshaw -- then leading out Cavendish for Team HTC-Columbia -- appeared to headbutt rival Julian Dean during a comparable sprint finish.",

Russian people were embracing me more. So, I guess, one year before I left Zenit this wasn't happening anymore.\" 'I blew kisses to them'Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, then-manager of Zenit St. Petersburg, said the monkey chants Hulk was subjected to that season were a \"disaster\" for the perception of Russian football around the world.The offending clubs were sanctioned by the Russian Football Union disciplinary committee, with Torpedo fined 300,000 roubles ($5050) and ordered to play two home matches behind closed doors. Even so, the player himself doesn't believe fans were setting out to be vindictive. \"I don't think of it as malice,\" says Hulk. \"I think it's also slightly cultural.\"Instead the Russian Premier League's top scorer in 2014/15 puts the incidents down to supporters trying to \"distract\" opponents, and particularly star players.\"I paid a lot of attention to it and I got distracted from the game,\" he says. \"That made me sad inside.\" READ: Sulley Muntari would support player boycottA year on from his four seasons in St. Petersburg, the Brazilian is also quick to forgive.\"I'm a person who doesn't hold any grudges,\" says Hulk. \"With time, when it happened several more times, I began to relax.\"When the supporters tried to commit acts of racism or making monkey noises, I blew kisses to the supporters.

The club was quick to distance itself from the notice, but the incident arguably highlighted a wider malaise. Brazil great Roberto Carlos, who joined Anzhi Makhachkala in 2011, twice had bananas brandished at him that year.In 2013, Manchester City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure was subjected to racist chants from the stands at CSKA Moscow, and voiced his disgust after the match, saying \"I'm not just disappointed, I'm furious.\"There will be no racism at 2018 World Cup matches, says Russia's anti-racism chiefIn November 2014, Hulk himself alleged he was racially abused by Russian referee Alexei Matyunin during a 1-0 defeat to Mordovia Saransk.After Hulk's allegations against Matyunin, it was ruled that \"a serious personal conflict took place,\" but that there was no \"direct proof\" of racial abuse and the referee, who reportedly had denied the accusation, was cleared of abusing the Brazilian.More recently, Ghanaian Emmanuel Frimpong tweeted he had been \"racially abused for the game that I love\" following the first match of the 2015/16 Russian season, FC Ufa vs. Spartak Moscow. The Ufa midfielder, who now plays for Sweden's AFC Eskilstuna, was sent off for making an offensive gesture to the crowd and subsequently slapped with a two-match ban, describing the Russian Football Union's verdict that there was no evidence of racial abuse as \"beyond a joke.\"\"I'm going to serve a sentence for being abused,\" Frimpong seethed, \"and yet we are going to hold a World Cup in this country.\"Russian Premier League's security director, Alexander Meytin, said in Frimpong's case: \"The video cameras did not pick up any evidence of gestures.

The Syrian refugee was on a tram in central Berlin when he spotted two white men hurling abuse at a black passenger.\"I could not keep silent,\" he says. \"What really shocked me was that no one did anything. I simply felt I had to say something.\"Naem began filming the confrontation on his mobile phone -- drawing the attention, and the anger, of the man's attackers. In retaliation, they turned on him.When he tried to flee at the next stop, the men dragged him behind a shop and assaulted him. Bloodied and beaten, he went into the store to ask for help, but says he was ignored.Another man came to his aid. Naem says the man apologized, insisting, \"Not all Germans are like that.\" But the attack left him scared.Read More\"I lost my mobile phone. I was beaten. Especially psychologically, I was hurt,\" he says. \"And that was difficult. It was not the physical assault that bothered me most, it was more that there are people out there who have racist ideas in their minds and that people did not help me.\"Right-wing violence is on the rise in Germany. The country's Federal Bureau of Investigation (BKA) received more than 3,700 reports of attacks on asylum seekers and refugees in 2016, a dramatic increase of 200% from the year before. WATCH: Syrian refugees lead walking tours of BerlinFares Naem was attacked in Berlin. \"It was not the assault that bothered me [but] that there are people out there who have racist ideas in their minds and people who did not help.\"Physical and verbal attacks like the one Fares experienced are the most common, and they happen frequently on public transport, as his did.This is, in part, a backlash to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's brief open door policy that allowed almost a million refugees into the country in 2015. In 2016, 280,000 migrants applied for asylum. Most came from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Eritrea and Pakistan.      Merkel's policy proved polarizing -- large parts of the community initially embraced refugees, greeting them at railway stations, and offering them food and places to stay. But the welcome cooled after the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015, where police say scores of migrant men assaulted women during firework displays in the city's main square.Germany keeps tabs on known neo-Nazi groups -- and police keep an especially watchful eye on the north-eastern state of Saxony. Compared to other German states, Saxony has taken in fewer refugees, but has one of the highest rates of attacks on refugees in the country. It was here that the right-wing Pegida group was founded in 2013 to promote the so-called \"Peaceful Europeans against the Islamization of the West\" movement. Incidents like the Cologne attacks have provided fertile ground for neo-Nazi groups such as the \"Freital Group\" of violent extremists based in the small town of Freital in Saxony.       But German authorities are fighting back -- the group of eight neo Nazi activists is on trial; federal prosecutors argue that the group's attacks on refugee shelters and left-wing politicians in 2015 and 2016 are tantamount to that of a terrorist cell. And some former far-right extremists are turning their backs on violence. Enrico (not his real name) has been undergoing counselling through the \"Steig Aus\" (Get out) program in Saxony, which supports those who want to break free from the right-wing scene and start a new life. The 40-year-old former neo-Nazi recalls a time when hatred and violence were his everyday companions: \"I wanted to provoke and then I was provoked myself by these people. We attacked asylum shelters, threw explosives at their homes. I only thought about the consequences in hindsight,\" he says in a newly-released video aimed at combating right-wing extremism.Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution estimates that 22,600 people in the country hold far-right views.  At least 40% of those are thought to be willing to resort to violence in pursuit of their ideologies. Eben Louw, a psychologist at an anti-violence aid group in Berlin. The map behind him shows all the attacks on refugees and migrants recorded in the city. \"What is new is the level of brazenness.\"Eben Louw is a psychologist at Opra Gewalt -- an anti-violence aid group -- who counsels refugee victims like Fares Naem. He says threats can come from anywhere. \"One's next door neighbour can become a violent attacker within minutes because they don't want to see refugees in their country -- and not only refugees ... [but] any person who is perceived as a migrant.\" Naem does not know who his attackers were -- and may never get an answer to that question; the police have yet to make any arrests in the case. All that remains is a mental scar: \"I only want to stay in my room, I no longer feel secure to leave the house and sometimes I no longer trust Germans,\" he says. All he does know is that, having escaped the war in his own country only to be attacked in his adopted home, Germany has become less of a safe haven.",

On Monday, France's newly elected national assembly members and its senators will be meeting in the Palace of Versailles itself to hear Macron, deliver something new to French democracy: its first US-style State of the Union address.It won't be the first time the joint houses of parliament have gathered in Versailles in recent times. Nicolas Sarkozy gathered them there in 2009 to consider constitutional changes and Francois Hollande did the same immediately after the terror attacks of November 2015 to announce a state of emergency. But such events are rare and driven by particular circumstances. Macron has decided to make what was the exception in French politics, one of its new rules.Russian President Vladimir Putin looks around as he walks alongside Macron in the Galerie des Batailles.Read: Trump and Macron, friends or foes on Bastille Day?It will be good to hear from him. The French have not heard much from him since his election on May 7. Apart from one interview given to several European newspapers on the question of Europe, the new French president has been remarkably silent and intentionally so.JUST WATCHEDThe answer to Trump's handshake, a bear hugReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe answer to Trump's handshake, a bear hug 02:00His appearances have been infrequent, carefully choreographed, and his contacts with journalists limited and so tightly controlled that the \u00c9lys\u00e9e has handpicked the journalists allowed on foreign presidential trips.And last week the \u00c9lys\u00e9e went even further, announcing that Macron would break with tradition on Bastille Day this year by not giving the traditional televised interview. The reason given by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e to the French media? That the president's thought process is simply too \"complex\" to lend itself to the \"game\" of questions and answers with journalists. Besides, say those around him, he will have made clear his plans for the country in Monday's address.Strategy designed to avoid mistakesIt is typical of Macron's communications strategy so far. A strategy dictated by the desire to avoid the mistakes made by the overly talkative Hollande whose openness with journalists so spectacularly backfired.It led to an image problem that made him the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic. The French public never forgave him for not being \"un homme d'etat,\" a man who could be the embodiment of all the power that is invested in the French presidency.The role was reinvented at the founding of the Fifth Republic to fix the instabilities caused by an overly powerful parliament in the Third and Fourth Republic. French deputies and senators attend a special congress of both houses of Parliament at the Versailles Palace.Read: Macron, the 39-year-old strongman Europe needsIt is considered the most powerful position in the Western world. A position created by Charles de Gaulle for Charles de Gaulle and until now, one that has often represented a struggle for the successors who have sought to live up to its potential. But Macron has taken it one step further. His improbable presidential campaign all but eliminated the mainstream political parties and therefore any hope of a credible opposition for the foreseeable future.Historic majorityJune's parliamentary elections handed him an absolute and historic parliamentary majority. With both the executive and legislature in his hands, Macron is an incredibly powerful man. The danger now is that he becomes unaccountable.JUST WATCHEDMacron slams Russian news as Putin watchesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMacron slams Russian news as Putin watches 00:56Already there has been much grumbling within the French press about the president's lack of openness and proximity.On Monday, he will be speaking to the French public not through journalists but addressing parliamentarians -- most of them his own. Read: Macron's party wins majority in French parliamentHe will be doing so not from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e but from Versailles, which may be the birthplace of French democracy, but is a far more powerful symbol of what democracy replaced. Its scale, its carefully manicured gardens, its gilt corridors and mirrored banquet rooms are all reminders of what unchecked power can bring. Macron has the right to speak there and the power to make his speech an annual event. The danger is that by choosing as a backdrop the ultimate symbol of absolute power, he will be drawing attention to the very thing that many in France feel he may have too much of.",

        "content": "(CNN)ISIS is on the back foot.   Nearly three years since the group's elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a self-styled Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS is reeling from losses across its so-called \"caliphate.\" It is fast losing its grip on Mosul, its biggest hub in Iraq, and its de-facto capital in Syria -- Raqqa -- is all but surrounded. But it's not just territory that the militant group is losing.  Over the last six months, ISIS has seen its finances slashed, media operations crippled and several high-ranking leaders killed or captured.Read MoreThe Syrian Democratic Forces -- an alliance of Kurds and Arab tribes -- are approaching the outskirts of Raqqa, and the battle will begin within \"days,\" the French defense minister said Friday. While the fight against ISIS is far from won, the lines of this war are slowly being redrawn. As the group is driven from key cities and villages in what was once its self-proclaimed caliphate, ISIS is evolving from territorial to ideological threat.  So what could ISIS 2.0 look like? Going to ground Before he was killed in a drone strike last year, ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al-Adnani said that potential setbacks in Mosul and Raqqa would not spell the group's end: \"No: defeat is losing the will and the desire to fight.\" For some ISIS fighters, there will be no escape from the battles of Mosul and Raqqa. Nor do they want one. Urged on by the messages of al-Adnani and al-Baghdadi, they will embrace martyrdom in the alleyways of Mosul and the wide expanses of the Jazeera desert. Most of those who fight to the death are likely to be foreign fighters, if past experience is any guide. Moroccans, Tunisians and Chechens will be among them.       Since its inception, ISIS has prepared for the 'day after' the caliphate. Its battle cry has long been \"Baqiya wa tatamaddad,\" or \"remain and expand.\" While its expansion may take generations, the group's leadership is ready for a stateless Islamic State. Top commanders and hardcore fighters will likely remain in Iraq and Syria, forming an underground resistance. ISIS has cultivated deep roots in Sunni parts of Iraq (less so in Syria where many jihadists regard it as an interloper). Over the past decade, the group has developed networks skilled at raising money, obtaining weapons and clandestine organization across a wide swathe of Iraq -- from Diyala in the east to Rutbah close to the Jordanian border.  Even as it is under pressure in Mosul, ISIS remains active in many of these places, and is capable of carrying out suicide bombings in Baghdad, Tikrit and elsewhere. It has shown resilience in Syria, looking to establish footholds far from its Raqqa headquarters. In some ways, it is returning to what it does best -- agile attacks, mobility and surprise.  Switching allegiances As ISIS' fortunes decline, some militants may try to switch allegiance to other groups. In Syria, these include the former al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al Sham. But there's a long history of bad blood between the two groups, which had a bitter and public falling out three years ago. Few in the ISIS hierarchy would contemplate such a move.      In Iraq, there are precious few alternatives for ISIS militants because the group has systematically attacked rivals in the region. Even so, ISIS' decline is an opportunity for al Qaeda in Iraq, Syria and beyond. Terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman suggests some militants will see al Qaeda as the only option for continuing their struggle. ISIS traces its origins to an al Qaeda franchise in Iraq (AQI). Waging jihad in the West At least 75% of ISIS fighters have been killed since the US-led coalition launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, according to US officials. By last December, they estimate ISIS' ranks had winnowed to between 12,000 and 15,000. It is extraordinarily difficult to estimate how many foreign fighters remain in the region. But far fewer foreign fighters have been able to reach the 'promised land' in the last year than previously. The most worrying possibility for the West is that these foreign fighters, finding survival in Iraq and Syria difficult post-caliphate, might return home to carry out lone-wolf style attacks -- as well as recruit new members and revive underground networks. They will try to use migrant routes and often will travel alone. The travel patterns of those involved in the Paris and Brussels attacks uncovered deep flaws in the tracking of such individuals among European security services. While it's now much harder for foreign fighters to travel through Turkey, as migrant flows have slowed, an unknown number have slipped through the cracks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        Conducted by ISIS\n    \n\n\n            Inspired by ISIS\n    \n\n\n\nIt only takes a handful of individuals to cross the Mediterranean, or travel through the Balkans undetected, for a European city to be vulnerable to another devastating assault. As and when Raqqa falls, the logistical and financial help for such operatives will have to find another home. (Recent attacks in Brussels and Istanbul both appear to have been co-ordinated from Raqqa).Even so, in the age of encryption, sympathizers are able to find ways to communicate securely with ISIS leadership. The Uzbek national who carried out the New Year's Eve attack on a nightclub in Istanbul had never been to Syria, but communicated with commanders through the encrypted chat app Telegram, according to testimony he provided Turkish prosecutors. Turkey, given its proximity to Syria and Iraq and its use as a logistical rear-base by ISIS, may be especially vulnerable.\"Turkish government complacency has allowed the threat to grow, as have purges of experienced counterterrorism professionals, including those after last year's failed coup,\" according to Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey. Expansion of ISIS affiliatesRather than risk going home, some ISIS members may try to reach new jihadist pastures.  There's evidence indicating that hundreds have already reached other ISIS-controlled provinces, or wilayats, especially in Libya, which (until last year) appeared to be the leadership's Plan B.  Across the world, from Russia's North Caucasus to Nigeria, militant groups have pinned their flags to the ISIS banner over the last three years. Some comprise a few dozen men hiding in mountains and jungles; others have been sophisticated and well funded, with close links to ISIS' head office. Still others are hardened insurgent groups capable of inflicting heavy casualties on armies.      One such group is the Islamic State in Northern Sinai (ISNS), which has inflicted hundreds of casualties on Egyptian security forces since affiliating itself with ISIS in 2014. It recently told Christians to leave the Sinai and boasted setting up checkpoints in the middle of a coastal town, al-Arish. It also claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Russian airliner that exploded in mid-air, crashing in the Sinai Peninsula in November 2015.ISNS is unlikely to be able to seize and hold territory in Sinai, but does not seem close to defeat -- despite a determined offensive by the Egyptian military.  Some ISIS fighters now in Syria and Iraq may try to join ISNS and other active affiliates, much as al Qaeda fighters moved to Iraq and Yemen after 9/11. They will try to use migrant routes and often will travel alone. But they will take with them skills learned in years of combat.  'Islamic State' of mind Perhaps the least predictable among those who make up ISIS 2.0 are the virtual adherents, those radicalized online and nursing a range of grievances who turn to random acts of violence.  Two deadly attacks in the US -- on an Orlando nightclub and in San Bernardino -- fell into this category. As did the truck attack in Nice last year, and smaller ISIS-inspired attacks across Europe.  They were carried out by individuals with little understanding of ISIS' ideology, deep personal grudges and no direct contact with the group's hierarchy. But that didn't prevent ISIS from declaring the perpetrators \"soldiers of the Caliphate.\"  These individuals, radicalized by what they read and hear, pose a continuing danger, especially in societies where high-powered weapons are easy to come by.  These lone wolves pose a sporadic but serious challenge to the US and Europe. By definition, they have few if any co-conspirators. They take inspiration from social media sermons and lectures like those of Anwar al-Awlaki, who even since his death has inspired well over a dozen plots in the West. US President Donald Trump has promised to \"bomb the s*\" out of ISIS. This might be feasible amid the crumbling holdouts of the caliphate, but as the remnants of ISIS go underground or escape, the apocalyptic mindset they have come to represent will live on. It -- or something very similar -- will find a host among Sunni in the Middle East who feel persecuted, and among a few young and alienated Muslims in western societies who seek purpose and revenge against wrongs perceived and real.\"The Islamic State is on the back foot militarily, it's losing territory,\" Charlie Winter, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London, who has studied ISIS propaganda for years, told CNN. \"Even if ISIS loses Mosul and Raqqa, the ideology will live on.\" CNN's Eliza Mackintosh contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)There have been times even Roger Federer has thought of walking away from it all.A stage before his name was immortalized and the records fell; a period in his glittering career when defeat was more common than victory.\"It was tough,\" Federer tells CNN Sport, reflecting on his early years on the ATP Tour.  \"When I traveled internationally I would get beat up very often in the first round 6-2, 6-3. You go home and realize: 'Okay, you're good in Basel but you're not very good in the world.'\"READ: \"My goal was to make the top 100,\" Andy MurrayRead MoreFederer knew he had a bright future \u2014 a junior Wimbledon title at the age of 16 proved that \u2014 but it took him three years to win his first ATP final. As a boy he would often cry if he lost a match, hiding behind the umpire's chair. As he entered his adolescence, that sensitivity occasionally took the form of petulance.\"When I was 12 years old, I was just horrible,\" Federer admitted in a 2003 interview with the Telegraph. Onlooking parents were banished and told to \"go and have a drink.\" Rackets, on more than one occasion, were smashed. Federer, urbane idol to millions around the world, even walked away from one professional tournament on the Swiss circuit having made a financial loss, after the referee deemed he had violated the \"best effort\" ruling. It took time to master his emotions and reach the state of tranquility he emanates on court today. It also required sacrifice, with Federer having to decide between football and tennis as a teen.Now the 35-year-old is the world's fourth highest paid athlete, perhaps the only doubt concerning him is whether he can to add to his 18 grand slam titles.Asked by CNN Sport earlier this year what separates the great from the good, he takes a second to consider.\"His aura, his longevity,\" Federer replies. \"What did he bring to his sport? Did he change the sport forever? What was his impact? \"Popularity, style ... Was he a good role model? I think all of these things matter.\" Boy to manHis talent has never been in doubt. After emerging victorious in both the singles and the doubles on the 1998 junior circuit at the All England Club, Federer reached the final of the junior US Open and won Florida's Orange Bowl Championship \u2014 joining a prestigious group of former champions including Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Bj\u00f6rn Borg.\"I went from boy to man a little bit,\" he says. \"My body grew ... I realized I could serve big [and] all of a sudden hang with tour players.\"I knew there was nobody better than the tour players; that's when the dream became a reality.A teenage Federer is pictured relaxing on a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida.\"Who knows,\" the young man thought, \"maybe I could become top 100 in the world at one point?\"READ: \"I locked myself in my room for four days,\" Michael PhelpsFittingly enough the Bernese Alps were the scene of his first ever ATP tournament, with Federer traveling to the clay-court Swiss Open in Gstaad.The No. 702 bowed out in the first round in straight sets, but he wouldn't have to wait long before his first breakthrough. September 30, 1998: The day the best male tennis player of all time secured the first of over 1,000 career match victories on the ATP tour, beating world No. 45 Guillame Raoux at the Toulouse Open.Federer went on to reach the quarterfinals in what was just his second ever ATP tournament, losing to the eventual winner, Jan Siemerink.It moved him up over 400 places in the world rankings, and secured a wildcard spot at the upcoming Swiss Indoors \u2014 a tournament he'd been a ballboy at just four years before. There he faced none other than eight-time grand slam winner Andre Agassi in the first round \u2014 a brush with the big boys that lasted less than an hour. The Federer decadeAt the turn of the millennium, Federer was the youngest man in the top 100 and the tennis world was sitting up and taking notice. \"I was nervous,\" Federer says, admitting it was still a novelty trading shots with established stars. \"I'd always wanted to be in that position ... playing against the guys you knew from TV, it was super cool.\"The carpets of the Milan Indoors were the scene of Federer's first ever ATP trophy in February 2001, but the watershed moment of his early career occurred five months later at Wimbledon.The king of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras, is dethroned.Pete Sampras vs. Federer. The king vs. the young pretender. The first and only time the boy from Basel would ever play against his idol. A changing of the guard. Coming into the fourth round clash, Sampras had more grand slam singles titles than any man in history, and hadn't lost a single match at the All England Club for five years -- only failing to win the prestigious tournament once between 1993 and 2000.He left quietly, dethroned by a teenager.\"There are a lot of young guys coming up,\" Sampras reflected, \"but Roger is a bit extra special.\" Federer himself puts his success down to \"drive\" as much as transcendental talent. For while the young Swiss was knocked out by home favorite Tim Henman in the 2001 quarterfinal, and stung by Croatian grand slam debutant Mario Ancic in the Wimbledon first round a year later, he's been returning to Centre Court ever since like he owned the place.READ: How Simone Biles overcame body image\"When you're young, it's very important to have that drive \u2014 even when you're defeated \u2014 to go back and hit up against a wall or a cupboard like I did,\" Federer says.\"You do maybe take the hammer and the nail and put the racket up against a wall and say I'm going to walk away from it all ... but five minutes later you're going to pick it up again and you're going to play again. Hard work is key. Probably more than 50% of success at that point.\"After that shock defeat to Ancic, ranked No. 158 at the time, Federer didn't lose again on grass for six years. From July 2003 to September 2007, the game's undisputed star won 12 of the 18 Grand Slam titles on offer, sweeping aside all before him in Melbourne, London and New York. An Olympic gold medal followed in Beijing, but one final frontier still eluded him: Roland Garros. The career grand slam Clay was the domain of another man, Rafa Nadal, and between 2006 and 2008 Federer had fallen to the Spaniard in three consecutive finals.June 7, 2009: The day Federer finally lifted La Coupe des Mousquetaires, beating Sweden's Robin Soderling to equal Sampras's major record (14)  and complete the coveted career grand slam. Federer called it his \"greatest victory,\" breaking down in tears before a packed crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier, telling them \"now I can play in peace for the rest of my career.\" Roger Federer kisses the French Open trophy, having beaten Sweden's Robin S\u00f6derling (6-1, 7-6, 6-4) to complete the career grand slam.Detractors had questioned his desire, asking whether this elegant artisan was really up for the long slog on clay.But Federer sat down with CNN Sport that day with the proof in his hands. \"I always believed that I was good enough to get it,\" he said, \"but actually holding this trophy after all that I've been through is an unbelievable feeling.\" \"This victory comes at the right time because I've proved many people wrong.\" Asked what was left to motivate him after reaching the pinnacle of his sport, Federer alluded to his first ever Wimbledon victory. \"It was all I ever wanted,\" he smiled. \"But I kept coming back and won it again and again and again.\" \"That's what champions want to do: they want to come back and prove themselves over and again.\"I love the game too much to walk away from it; it's given me all I ever wanted.\"A rivalry revisitedIf Martina Navratilova had echoed the prevailing sentiment in 2009 when she said the newly-crowned French Open champion could now \"just go on and sip Margaritas for the rest of his life,\" Federer himself had no intention of letting up. His 2017 Australian Open final win against Rafa Nadal was a triumph of longevity \u2014 his first major title for five years and one that and that made him the oldest male grand slam winner since Roy Emerson in 1967. \"It's really strange to me,\" the 35-year-old told CNN Sport in January, having expected to reach \"a fourth round or a quarterfinal\" at best.\"The first time I actually believed I could win the title was maybe Saturday or Sunday morning; I just started seeing flashes of me with the trophy.\"Had Federer not fought back from 3-1 down in the fifth set \u2014 beating his friend and long-time nemesis in a major final for the first time in ten years \u2014 Nadal could have closed the all-time gap between them to just two grand slams with his favored French Open to follow. Now though Federer's tally of 18 looks unlikely to be beaten. Where does Roger Federer rank among the greatest athletes of all time?

It is likely to be extended once again when the current window expires in the middle of July.Macron is then expected to enact new terror legislation, despite it receiving criticism from pressure groups such as Amnesty International.The new legislation would allow French authorities shut down places of worship thought to be promoting extremism for up to six months.It would also allow authorities to act without requiring permission from the court in taking greater powers in securing areas or events which it perceives to be at risk.As Macron spoke, French police confirmed they had arrested a man planning to assassinate him at the Bastille Day celebrations on July 14. Political reformMacron's La Republique En Marche Party achieved a huge majority by winning 308 of the 577 seats in the Assembly at last month's legislative elections.Now he wants to cut their number by a third.Macron said the changes would have \"positive effects on the general quality of parliamentary work.\"  Under his plan, the number of Assembly members would be cut from 577 to 385, and Senate members from 348 to 232. Macron said he wanted to \"avoid half-measures and cosmetic arrangements.\"He said that if parliament rejected his plans, he would put them to the French people in a referendum.On EuropeOn the European Union, Macron said the body had \"lost its way,\" and pledged to launch a series of \"democratic conventions.\"JUST WATCHEDThe headaches of negotiating BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe headaches of negotiating Brexit 01:37He called for a \"new generation of leaders\" to lead a revival of the EU at a time where it is facing one of the most difficult periods in its recent history.\"The building of Europe has been weakened by the spread of bureaucracy and by the growing skepticism that comes from that.\"The last 10 years have been cruel for Europe.

Horn and Pacquiao clash in a fight dubbed the \"Battle of Brisbane.\"Suncorp Stadium, packed with 50,000 people, erupted in cheers as Horn was declared the winner on points: 117-111, 115-113, 115-113.However, it wasn't long before social media shot back with allegations the judges got it wrong.Read MoreThree-time world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis disputed the result on Twitter: \"This is what's wrong with boxing.

A tally by Compubox put Pacquiao ahead with 182 landed punches over Horn's 92, though 73 of those were power punches, according to the stats.Final Punch Stats: Jeff Horn def. Manny Pacquiao by Unan.

Part of the game. That's the decision of the judges. I respect that.\"Both said they were open to a rematch.Horn's boxing career started 10 years ago, according to his Facebook page, around the same time Pacquiao had chalked up about 45 professional wins and was defending titles in front of capacity crowds.Horn had his first bout in 2008, and in his third fight clinched the Queensland state title. In 2012, he made the quarterfinals at the London Olympic Games, making him the most successful Australian Olympic boxer in the past 20 years.Last year, at the World Boxing Championships held in Baku, Azerbaijan, Horn lost to the eventual gold medal winner Everton dos Santos Lopes. At 175 centimeters tall, Horn used his size to dominate champion Pacquiao.His Facebook page describes him as a \"very clean-cut, well brought up young man\" who earned a Bachelor of Education degree to become a Physical Education teacher.After the bout, Horn posted a message thanking his supporters.\"My team, one dream, we did it Brisbane! The new WBO Welterweight Champion of the world! Thank you for all the support.\"Before the bout, few thought Horn could take down the 38-year-old Pacquiao, whose last fight and win was against American Jessie Vargas in November 2016.Pacquiao said he'd trained hard for Sunday's fight, but it clearly wasn't enough.",

A Vatican statement released Saturday said the Pope thanked Muller at the conclusion of his five-year appointment as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which ends Sunday.Rather than being renewed in the role, Muller will be replaced by Monsignor Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer, a Jesuit and current second-in-command for the Vatican's doctrinal watchdog. Muller, 69,  a German, was appointed by Francis' predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who himself once headed the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.The Pope's 'blind spot' on sexual abuse A conservative, Muller was widely seen to be resistant to Pope Francis' attempt to open up the church's teaching, particularly on the issue of allowing communion for divorced and remarried Catholics. Read MoreUnusually, Muller gave a recent interview in which he said there should not be different interpretations of church teaching on the subject, putting him at odds with Francis' thinking. The issue is one that divides liberals and conservatives in the church.The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is also in charge of handling sex abuse cases involving the church.

Pell, who's considered the third-ranking official in the Holy See as its treasurer, has insisted he is innocent of the charges.CNN's Delia Gallagher reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

She also confirmed the 2022 election was in her sights. May doubled down on her stance Thursday when asked by a reporter to respond to the MPs' comments.\"I said I wasn't a quitter, and there's a long-term job to do. There's an important job to be done in the United Kingdom. We stand at a really critical time in the UK,\" she said.   \"Yes that's partly about Brexit and getting Brexit right, but if you think back to what I said when I became Prime Minister, when I stood in Downing street, there are many other issues that we need to address, long-term challenges in our country, ensuring that people don't feel left behind.\"Read MoreBritish Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at a press conference in Tokyo on Thursday.She added: \"I think for most members of the public they would say they want the government to get on with the job and that's exactly what I and the government are doing.\"May had, a day earlier, said \"I'm not a quitter\" when asked by ITV if she would contest the 2022 election. She also confirmed her plans to run for the next election with Sky News.MP: 'We ran a very poor election'May's leadership has been in doubt since an embarrassing election result in June, in which her political gamble to call an early vote backfired and stripped her party of its commanding majority in Parliament.May had called the election to widen her commanding margin ahead of tough Brexit negotiations with the European Union.Instead she was forced to form an alliance with the socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.Theresa May delivering a speech during an election campaign visit to Stoke-on-Trent, England, on June 6, 2017. Grant Shapps, a former Conservative Party chairman, was among MPs to air the party's disquiet over May's leadership, even comparing her to Margaret Thatcher. \"I think it is too early to be talking about going on and on, as Margaret Thatcher once said. Let's get some progress for the British people first, I think that's the priority,\" he told BBC Radio 4\u2032s Today program.  \"The truth is we ran a very poor election and you can't just brush that under the table and pretend it didn't happen -- not least because we went from having a workable majority to no majority at all ... You can't go pretending it wasn't anything other than a disastrous result.\"While Shapps said there were frustrations in the party with May, he conceded that there was little appetite for another leadership change among Conservatives.Boris Johnson backs MayBut some lawmakers have come out to defend the Prime Minister.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told CNN that he unequivocally backed May and that he believed she could win an outright majority in the next election.\"I've made it clear since June .... that I'm giving my undivided backing to Theresa May,\" Johnson told CNN while on a visit to Nigeria. \"We need to get Brexit done. She's ideally placed to deliver a great outcome for our country, get a great negotiation done and then deliver what we all want to see, which is this exciting agenda of global Britain. And I think she gets it, she really wants to deliver it, and I'm here to support her.\"Johnson added that he thought Britain was \"going to get a great deal\" in Brexit negotiations.Britain is in a third round of Brexit talks with the EU, but progress has been slow for May's government.Talks devolved this week into a brawl over how much Britain should pay to leave the European Union, an issue that must be settled before the parties discuss their future relationship.CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report from Nigeria.",

        "content": "(CNN)The French government unveiled ambitious labor reforms Thursday that could draw strong opposition from some unions and prove a critical test for President Emmanuel Macron.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, outlining the overhaul alongside Labor Minister Muriel Penicaud, said France had to increase flexibility in its labor market to counter decades of mass unemployment.\"Labor law is not the first cause of unemployment,\" Philippe said, but \"no one today can say that our labor law stimulates job creation.\"The reforms -- which will be debated over the coming days before being finalized -- will take the form of five executive orders, thanks to a law passed last month by the Parliament, where Macron's centrist party holds a healthy majority.The executive orders will be presented to the cabinet of ministers for adoption on September 22 and come into force in late September.Read MoreIn an interview with Le Point magazine, published Thursday, Macron -- who has seen his poll numbers tumble in recent weeks -- said the French people had backed his agenda for change when they elected him president in May.\"We turned the page of three decades of inefficiency to embark on the path of reconstruction that will enable reconciliation,\" he is quoted as saying.\"The reform of the labor market is a reform of profound transformation and, as I have committed myself, it must be ambitious and effective enough to continue to reduce mass unemployment and allow us not to return to this subject during the five-year term.\"French President Emmanuel Macron speaks at a special gathering of both houses of parliament in July.Union talksThe government's plans were hammered out following weeks of meetings with union representatives.Philippe said they had four aims: fostering dialogue among social partners; building legal security to foster job creation and greater transparency for employers; bringing tailored solutions for small and very small businesses; and strengthening the economic attractiveness of the country.Among the measures in the package are limits on the damages granted to workers in cases of wrongful dismissal. Currently, it is left up to individual tribunals to decide and the damages awarded can vary widely.JUST WATCHEDEmmanuel Macron reform plans at riskReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEmmanuel Macron reform plans at risk 02:34There will also be greater scope for individual labor agreements to be negotiated at a company and industry level, rather than on a sector-wide basis, Philippe said. This means, for example, that a small company with fewer than 20 employees could negotiate directly with an elected employee who is not mandated by a trade union.Workers will also gain new rights under the reforms, including a 25% increase in unemployment compensation.Cooperation between the government and unions in drawing up the plans may ease some public concerns, although the CFDT, France's biggest private-sector union, said it was \"disappointed\" overall and announced it would hold a demonstration in October.  The Force Ouvri\u00e8re said there were only a couple of \"points of disagreement.\"However, the CGT union, France's second largest, has accused the Macron government of being \"ultra pro-market\" and did not join the negotiations. It has called for strike action on September 12 to protest the proposed changes.ControversiesMacron has already weathered a number of controversies since he took office in May.Earlier this month he backtracked over plans to give his wife, Brigitte, official status as First Lady of France -- a role that would have included access to public funds and a staff -- amid widespread public opposition. The proposal came at the same time as the President was pushing for a law that would ban French parliamentarians from employing members of their own families. France's last election campaign was plagued by fake jobs scandals involving far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and conservative contender Francois Fillon. In June, Macron's own defense minister, Sylvie Goulard, resigned after becoming embroiled in a fake jobs scandal of her own.In July, Gen. Pierre de Villiers resigned as head of the French armed forces over a dispute surrounding the country's defense budget.Another controversy concerned Macron's reported high spending on makeup.CNN's Pierre-Eliot Buet contributed to this report.",

The boats will be inspected Saturday, skippers are briefed the following day, with racing starting on Monday.A record 52 yachts from 60ft and upwards have turned up for a week of inshore racing and coastal sprints along the spectacular Costa Smeralda and its notorious stretches of water with names like \"Bomb Alley.\" Sardinia's Costa Smeralda offers stunning sailing among rocky islands.Billionaire lifestyleThe sailors, globe-trotting guns for hire, exude an air of surf chic combined with preppy pro jock. The younger the sailor, the more disheveled the look. Much like life.   Hands are strong and coarse. Handshakes firm to crippling. Eyes crinkle into smiles, the effect of years sailing in sun and wind.

Among the traveling tribe there is a distinct hierarchy at work.  At the top, at least on shore, are the owners. High-achieving businessmen with big bucks to lavish on their chosen sport. A new mainsail costs north of $160,000 and just the running costs for a summer campaign can be anything between about $1.5 million and $5.4 million. \"It's highly competitive.

In 2013 I was on the road 300 days,\" said Henderson, who grew up sailing in Michigan.   Unlike the more cruising oriented Wally class, Bella Mente is a stripped-out racer, a black carbon shell with no frills down below.The toilet is of the \"bucket and chuck it\" variety. There is no galley in day-race mode, and sleeping facilities, should they be needed for longer offshore races, are pull down canvas shelves, operated on a \"hot-bunk\" basis for sailors on different watches.              Last year a storm in Porto Cervo meant Henderson and another had to sleep on board and take turns to keep watch as a big sea surged into the harbor, threatening to ram her onto the dock -- Bella Mente's keel is too deep to retreat further inside the marina.\"That was stressful. More so than the racing,\" said Henderson.'Dangerous'\u202f While the permanent crew are the workhorses, the stardust comes from the tacticians and other members of the \"brains trust,\" the big-money signings making the racing decisions.

How about another $10 million as a bonus for winning the PGA Tour's end-of-season FedExCup points tally?Follow @cnnsport\n\nThat's the prospect facing world No.1 Dustin Johnson after he beat Jordan Spieth in a playoff at the first FedExCup event Sunday to take his season earnings to $8.4 million.The 33-year-old Johnson leads the rankings with three events left in US golf's big-money run-in.Stay top, and Johnson will trouser a cool $10 million -- with $1 million deferred to his retirement account -- to add to any additional prize money. The winner's cheque at the Tour Championship is $1.575 million. Finish second in the FedExCup, and the bonus drops to $3 million. But Johnson, who missed the Masters with a freak injury on the eve of the event, won't have it all his own way. Open champion and 2015 winner Spieth lies second, with US PGA winner Justin Thomas third.Dustin Johnson beat Jordan Spieth in a playoff to win The Northern Trust at Glen Oaks Club on Sunday.Read More'Go nuts'Johnson, whose sole major so far came at the 2016 US Open, is not known for flamboyant celebrations -- he described his victory first-pump Sunday as \"weak\" -- but he told reporters at Glen Oaks: \"Maybe if I win the FedExCup or something, I'll go nuts.\"READ: Pitfalls of life as a PGA Tour wifeREAD: Justin Thomas -- 'The sky is the limit'READ: Golfer with cerebral palsy makes PGA Tour historyThe FedExCup series, which began in 2007, is designed to keep alive interest in the PGA Tour right up to the Tour Championship finale in Atlanta. Being crowned the best golfer over the season is a goal in itself, but with those sorts of bonuses knocking about, it's not hard for the game's elite to stay focused. The 125-man field from last week's Northern Trust tournament was whittled down to 100 for the Dell Technologies Championship in Boston with the top 70 reaching the BMW Championship in Chicago.The best 30 will contest the Tour Championship where points are reset to give the 30th-placed player an academic chance of still winning the title.     For the past seven years, the winner of the Tour Championship has also won the FedExCup, stretching back to 2009 when Tiger Woods won the overall standings despite Phil Mickelson's triumph in the final event.

But ultimately Federer's skill and experience won out over the course of the two-hour, 37-minute encounter.  The teenaged Tiafoe, who played with assurance in the five-set loss despite being outplayed by the world No. 3, has only advanced beyond the first round of a Slam twice. He showed signs of a fightback by winning the fourth set, breaking Federer's serve to go up 3-1, but it was too little, too late for the American. Tiafoe wins a point against Federer during their first round match.The Maryland native's first set win marked an improvement on the only other time the two have met on court, when he pushed Federer to a first-set tiebreak at the Miami Open in March. Read MoreFederer's win furthers anticipation that he'll meet his old rival, Rafael Nadal on the hard courts of Arthur Ashe stadium. The two are on course for a semifinal encounter after the Spaniard dismissed Dusan Lajovic 7-6 (8-6), 6-2, 6-2 in his opening fixture. While Federer avoided an ignominious early exit, day two did see a major upset as women's defending champ Angelique Kerber was dismissed by Japan's Naomi Osaka in straight sets, 6-3, 6-1. It's only the third time a defending champion has exited the US Open in the first round. The late-night crowd grew ever-more vocal as the match wore on, cheering on the young American as he snatched points from Federer. He broke Federer's serve late in the fifth set to raucous applause, denying him a match winner. But it was not to be, although on the strength of this hard-fought match, his will be a career to follow.Chris Evert on why Roger Federer is unlikely to win the US OpenTeen sensationReportedly a quiet, thoughtful teen, Tiafoe credits much of his development to his father, Constant Tiafoe, an immigrant from Sierra Leone. The elder Tiafoe helped build, and later became the custodian of, the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Maryland, where Frances has trained since he was a child. While working around the clock, his father was forced to move into a vacant storage room at the tennis center, where his two boys would stay with him, sleeping on a massage table, while their mother worked night shifts as a nurse.\"Obviously, I wasn't the wealthy kid, or wasn't having all the new stuff or whatever. But I was just living life. I could play tennis for free, the sport I loved,\" he told CNN in 2015.    I was a little hype in cinci. Thanks to the @cincytennis for the wc can't wait for next year. #moretocome #bentleywayy #dmvmentality @nikecourt @yonex_com A post shared by Frances Tiafoe (@bigfoe1998) on Aug 19, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT\nAt just 15 years old, Tiafoe won the prestigious Orange Bowl, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history -- a remarkable feat considering the list of previous champions, which includes Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Ivan Lendl, Jim Courier, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg.While many junior prodigies have come and gone, Tiafoe's unique background and work ethic set him apart from the rest. He said of his parents, \"with them trying so hard, I felt like I didn't want to let them down. I felt like I didn't want to let the opportunities go for granted.\"Tiafoe turned pro in 2015, signing as the first tennis player at Jay Z's Roc Nation Sports agency. \"Obviously, Jay Z definitely got my attention,\" Tiafoe told the New York Times in 2015. \"I thought it was pretty cool that he wanted me on the team.\"The US hasn't produced a men's singles champion at the majors since Andy Roddick in 2003, and many fans and sportswriters are hoping that the young Tiafoe can build on his remarkable five-set loss to take up the mantle. Frances Tiafoe is a rising star! \u2b50\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/K3N9KndcWp\u2014 Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) August 30, 2017\n\"What a night for Tiafoe. Faces a legend, giant crowd, plays so well, heart, guts, comeback, whole deal. Great show,\" tweeted the Wall Street Journal's Jason Gay.Federer escapes, but what a night for Tiafoe. Faces a legend, giant crowd, plays so well, heart, guts, comeback, whole deal. Great show.\u2014 Jason (@jasongay) August 30, 2017\n\"Hopefully this (loss) propels him,\" added USA Today's Dan Wolken. \"America needs a tennis star.\"Great effort from Tiafoe, even in a loss. Hopefully this propels him. America needs a tennis star.\u2014 Dan Wolken (@DanWolken) August 30, 2017\n'More than a test'Federer praised his opponent's game and acknowledged that Tiafoe had caused him trouble.\"It was more than a test, it was a good one. I think we both enjoyed ourselves out here... I'm very happy with the match, it was exciting and that is kind of why I came to new York as well, to experience these emotions. \"He's a great player and he has a great future ahead of him. The fifth (set) is a coin toss and it went my way. \"Referencing back issues that have caused him problems in the last few weeks, Federer said that he was happy to get through his opening match unscathed. \"To get through a five-setter you have to be OK somehow.\" Federer: Winning US Open would be 'a joke'The Swiss' appearance in Flushing Meadows marked his first Major appearance since lifting the cup at Wimbledon in July. Dropping the first set to the unfancied Tiafoe, ranked 70th in the world, meant that within his first hour on court he had dropped more sets at the US Open than he did during his entire tournament in Wimbledon. He didn't drop a set all tournament at the All England Club this year -- the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to do so.That victory handed the Swiss a record eighth Wimbledon singles title, and his 19th major overall. He's seeking to win the US Open for the first time since 2008. \"That would be a joke, if I won three slams this year out of nowhere,\" said Federer in July, looking ahead to Flushing Meadows.\"I know if I stay in shape there are chances for me to do well at the US Open, but to win it? Yeah, at some stage I almost feel like I have to be realistic.\"Every time the Swiss has won both the Australian Open and Wimbledon in a single season, he has also gone on to lift the US Open trophy (2004, 2006 and 2007).\"I'll definitely try and get myself organized, prepared and ready so that I'll have the best chance to do well at the US Open,\" said Federer.Follow Roger Federer example to avoid injury, says Serena's coach Patrick MouratoglouCNN's Will Edmonds contributed reporting.",

Relations between Berlin and Ankara have been in a downward spiral since last summer, when a failed coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sparked a crackdown on civil liberties and mass arrests of the political opposition, activists and journalists, including German citizens. Germany has accused Erdogan of attempting to silence his critics at home and abroad. Erdogan, in turn, has called on voters in Germany to reject the country's biggest parties in next month's election.

We therefore decided to take a new direction in our policy towards Turkey.\"Deniz Yucel, a German-Turkish journalist, was arrested in Turkey in February on charges of terror propaganda.  In July, Turkish authorities arrested German human rights activist Peter Steudtner and nine others, charging them with \"committing crimes in the name of a terrorist organization without being a member.\" Germany: Turkey may be using Interpol to hunt down political opponentsEarlier this month, a prominent Turkish-German writer who has been critical of Erdogan was detained while on holiday in Spain.Dogan Akhanli, who lives in Cologne, was released after a court hearing, but on the condition that he remain in Madrid, according to his lawyer.The incident prompted German government accusations that Turkey is using Interpol, an international police organization, to hunt down Erdogan's political opponents abroad.Merkel, who spoke for approximately 90 minutes on Tuesday, warned that relations between the two countries were going through a \"very complicated\" phase.Merkel said that any desire for improved ties must be based on upholding the principle of rule and law, adding: \"We do not see that guaranteed in Turkey at the moment.\" Gabriel: 'Turkey has left European values behind'Germany has threatened to impose travel and trade restrictions on Turkey if Yucel and Steudtner aren't released from prison.

        "content": "(CNN)Much has changed since the height of the refugee crisis that gripped Europe in the summer of 2015. Since the shocking images of drowned Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi went viral, the crisis has largely been out of international headlines.But it doesn't show any signs of stopping.Since 2015, Europe has scrambled to cope with the arrival of around 1.5 million people by sea.In an effort to stem this flow, many European countries have tightened their policies and borders. In 2016, the European Union forged a controversial \"one in, one out\" deal with Turkey to stop the tide of migrants and refugees fleeing to the continent from the Middle East. And, this year, Italy has adopted an aggressive approach to halting migration across the Mediterranean from North Africa, backing the Libyan coast guard's rescue efforts and cracking down on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating off the country's coast.     With each new twist and turn, the number of arrivals has dropped. But new migrant routes keep cropping up. People seeking alternative passages have moved westward -- seen in the recent spike in migrants arriving in Spain from northern Morocco -- while others are turning in desperation to new destinations such as Yemen. Read MoreFootage that surfaced on social media in early August showed stunned sunbathers watching as a dinghy packed with dozens of African migrants landed on a Spanish beach -- the latest sign of an evolving crisis. Here's what has been happening in the Mediterranean: Why are NGOs suspending migrant search-and-rescue (SAR) operations in the Mediterranean?Three aid groups operating in the Mediterranean -- Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Save the Children and Sea Eye -- suspended their rescue operations in August, citing security concerns after Libya blocked foreign vessels from a stretch of sea off its coast. The MSF said an increasingly \"hostile environment\" had made their efforts untenable, while Sea Eye alleged that the Libyan government had issued an \"explicit threat\" against NGOs.     What is the Libyan coast guard doing?Libya has extended its SAR zone into international waters, restricting access to humanitarian vessels. The Libyan navy, emboldened by its agreement with Italy, has recently fired warning shots at humanitarian aid vessels patrolling in this area. Libyan Navy spokesman Brigadier Ayoub Qassem told CNN: \"We are fed up with these organizations. They increased the number of immigrants and empowered smugglers. Meanwhile, they criticize us for not respecting human rights.\"A Libyan coastguardsman patrols the SAR zone between Sabratha and Zawiyah in July 2017.Libya has asserted its right to operate beyond the territorial limit of 12 nautical miles from the coast. According to Save the Children, Libya has extended its SAR zone to 70 nautical miles from its shoreline. The move has led to clashes with NGO vessels at the edge of Libyan waters.What assistance is Italy providing to the Libyan coast guard and why?In August, Italy announced it would deploy two naval ships to Libya -- a patrol vessel and a technical and logistical support unit -- in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe. The move came after Libya's UN-recognized government of national accord requested help. The initiative has been widely panned by NGOs, which have warned that the move will expose migrants to far more danger and abuse.A member of Aquarius, a rescue ship run by NGO SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and Doctors Without Borders, brings a young girl on board in August 2017.What restrictions has Italy imposed on NGOs?In late July, Italy's Parliament passed a controversial \"code of conduct\" for NGOs operating search-and-rescue missions in the Mediterranean. Among the measures are:\u2022 Ban on entering Libyan waters except in situations of grave or imminent danger\u2022 Ban on phone calls to help migrant departures\u2022 Ban on transferring rescued migrants to other vessels\u2022 Commitment to allow armed police onto vessels to monitor activitiesA child, who was aboard the Aquarius rescue ship, receives flip-flops upon her arrival in the port of Pozzallo, Italy, in August 2017.  Three of the eight humanitarian groups operating in the Mediterranean agreed to the terms, while Doctors Without Borders refused to sign, saying it could increase deaths at sea. The mayor of Catania, Italy, told CNN that he believes the code of conduct is behind the recent drop in migrant arrivals there; critics say it is too early to tell.What is happening to migrant arrivals in Italy?Migrant arrivals to Italy dropped in July -- cut in half from the same month last year -- figures from Italy's interior ministry showed. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 94,802 migrants have reached Italian shores so far this year -- 85% of all arrivals in Europe.      How is that affecting migrant arrivals elsewhere?The UN says over 9,000 migrants have arrived in Spain so far this year, most of those in the past two months. It's the most the country has seen since the start of the crisis. And it's flared in August -- with a staggering 604 migrants rescued in just 24 hours. Increasingly, African migrants are seeking a cheaper and easier path to Europe, setting sail for Spain from Morocco in toy dinghies and on jet skis. The average price to cross from the Moroccan coast to Spain is around 500 euros (about $590), according to Frontex.Rescued migrants arrive in the port of Motril, Granada, southern Spain, in August 2017. Why has the Italian government shifted its strategy on refugees?Italy's beefed-up approach to tackling the flow of migrants into the country followed local elections in June, which saw a wave of anti-immigrant mayors and local councilors ushered into office. Critics say the result has left the governing center-left party reeling, forcing Italian leaders to seek short-term solutions at the cost of migrants' lives.\"Our goal is to govern the migration flows,\" the Italian interior minister, Marco Minniti, said in an August news conference. \"A big democracy, a big country, doesn't endure migration's flow, but tries to govern them.\"What is happening to migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard?Migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are being returned to the north African country. Human Rights Watch, and other humanitarian organizations, have warned against returning migrants to Libya, a war-torn country where migrants are exposed to torture, slavery and detention, they say. Migrants react after being returned to a detention center in Libya. A report published in June by the UN Panel of Experts on Libya contained serious allegations that factions of the coast guard were colluding with smugglers, and abusing migrants they intercepted. The same report detailed inhumane conditions in multiple migrant detention centers. It echoed another report by the UN support mission in Libya and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, published in December last year, which included similar claims.What is the EU's strategy to address the refugee crisis, and how has it changed?Since the height of the crisis in 2015, governments across Europe have sought to fortify their countries' borders. In February 2017, EU leaders outlined plans to stem the flow of migrants traveling across the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy, and boost the ability of the EU to send people back. Members of the Aquarius crew attend to migrants rescued off the Libyan coast in August 2017. \"The key priority is reducing the flow without any consideration for the causes of migration,\" Nando Sigona, an expert in migration at Birmingham University's School of Social Policy, told CNN.  What about the anti-immigrant patrols in the Mediterranean? An anti-immigrant vessel has underlined just how fraught the debate on refugees has become in Europe. The Defend Europe group deployed its C-Star vessel to the Mediterranean this summer, vowing to stop the \"invasion\" of refugees attempting to sail to Europe. \"It's created pressure, pressure for the NGOs as we were here, always watching them, documenting them and basically paralyzing them. We've seen it, I think during our operation time, the whole thing has turned against the NGOs. They've lost most public support; many have given up,\" Martin Sellner, one of the group's leaders told CNN. \"We came and they went so definitely a success.\"Though the C-Star has been allowed to continue operating in Libya's SAR zone, the Libyan Navy's Qassem told CNN that the coast guard would not work with them directly.\"They combat immigration through a spiteful, racist standpoint,\" Qassem said. \"We don't work with racism.\"What is happening to the charities that are continuing their missions?The Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms is among several NGOs that have continued to conduct rescue operations in the Mediterranean despite restrictions. Its crew recently reported that the Libyan coast guard fired warning shots while the vessel was in international waters. Migrants watch sunrise from the Aquarius rescue ship after their transfer from the NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) in August 2017.\"They were warned and told that they could be detained. We gave them a chance to leave and they did,\" Libyan navy spokesman Qassem told CNN. \"They have to respect our sovereignty. They consider themselves above the law and Libyan sovereignty.\"According to Italian coast guard figures, nongovernmental groups were responsible for rescuing a quarter of all those saved in 2016, and a third of those pulled from the Mediterranean in the first three months of 2017.CNN's Lorenzo D'Agostino, Sarah El Sirgany, Saskya Vandoorne and Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report.

The Russian produced a dominant display which often combined agility with sheer power and athleticism, overwhelming the Romanian in three sets, taking the final one despite Halep's best efforts to fight back.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 30-year-old Sharapova's mental game was on point during the thrilling match as she stretched, screamed and powered her way to what was ultimately her competition to lose. In what was one of the most thrilling first-round matches in recent US Open history, the Russian continued her winning streak over her opponent -- she's never lost to Halep in a half-dozen previous head-to-heads.Halep, overpowered and outplayed for much of the two-hour, 43-minute match, refused to give up and clawed back sets beginning at 4-2 down in the second set, when she convincingly broke Sharapova's serve.

Fatigue was setting in as Sharapova held her nerve in the final set, feeding off the crowd's vocal encouragement of the Russian during her return to the Arthur Ashe Stadium.After Halep made a final, unforced error to hand Sharapova her final point, the Russian sank to her knees as the emotional toll of her long return to the Majors took hold.

Initially, she was given a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation, but it was reduced on appeal to 15 months.The Russian former world No. 1's ranking had plummeted during her enforced absence -- to No. 146 -- to the point where she wasn't good enough to reach the main draw of the US Open, necessitating a wild card entry. In May, the French Tennis Federation denied Sharapova a wild card entry to the French Open. Following that decision, Sharapova elected to enter Wimbledon qualifying in the final week of June instead of requesting a main-draw wild card.Before tonight, she had played only nine matches since the ban, winning six and losing three since the 2016 Australian Open. With this big win under her belt, her absence seems well and truly behind her. On the basis of this match, she is back to her top form. However, as she said in a post-match interview, \"there still is a long way to go\" before she can think of claiming another Major. Tennis fans and sportswriters agreed that she back to her best.

But the number of migrants landing on the country's shores in July was half the figure it was in the same month last year, according to the Italian interior ministry. Italy has adopted an aggressive approach to halting migration across the Mediterranean from north Africa, backing the Libyan coast guard's rescue efforts and cracking down on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operating off the country's coast.

Football transfers are now, more often than not, in the mindboggling millions, while Neymar's move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain last month for an eye-popping world record $261 million has set a new benchmark. English Premier League clubs have already spent over a billion in the market this summer -- and teams still have a few more days to spend as the transfer window in that league doesn't close until August 31. As well as French side PSG, Serie A's AC Milan, under new owners, have also been flexing their financial muscle, splurging nearly $250 million so far this summer in a bid to rejoin the higher echelons of European football. But is this summer's spending any different to previous years? Was Neymar's transfer an anomaly, a freakish fee for a rare talent, or has the Brazilian's move to France irrevocably changed football?Read MoreCNN Sport talked to some of the game's insiders -- an agent, a lawyer and a Premier League chief executive -- as well as fans to understand what is behind the spending. Neymar has impressed since joining PSG, scoring three goals in the three league games he's played.READ: Neymar signs for PSG READ: Can Neymar provide a financial return on PSG's investment?The Agent -- 'No-one is worth $261m'Michael di Stefano is a Football Association intermediary who works in Italy and the UK. He tells CNN that transfer spending, in the Premier League especially, is at its peak. \"The Neymar deal was an exceptional one. It's not really a transfer fee, it's the buying out of a contract. It's not the norm. By meeting the buyout clause, PSG had the right to speak to the player -- Barcelona couldn't refuse it, they had no choice.\"No-one thought they would meet the clause, but there was an appetite for the player. Maybe the Spanish are now realizing that there are a number of clubs able to meet these huge figures and it will probably raise the level of the buyout, but the buyout clause is unique to Spain. \"We don't really have those in the UK and in Italy, for example, there are no buyout clauses. \"The Neymar deal was just extraordinary, but it hasn't changed the game. Romelu Lukaku has scored three goals in three league games since joining Manchester United.READ: Is US tour the secret to Real Madrid's success? \"If you look at the fees in the Premier League, other than Romelu Lukaku's move from Everton to Manchester United for an initial $96 million, the fees are similar to last year. \"We're almost at our vertical limits for transfer fees, however, in England. Sky and BT paid a record $6.58 billion for Premier League rights, but those sorts of deals can't last forever and the clubs know it. \"Sometimes, you can offer people too much, you can spoil the viewer so much they don't watch anything. \"Maybe there might be one more deal that's a tiny bit higher, but unless we start transmitting to Mars I can't see the appetite being there for the quantity of football that is currently being broadcast. \"The Chinese and the Asian markets stimulated the demand for this Premier League viewing, but the Chinese are being smart by directing people to their domestic football, which is a good thing. If they drop out you can then take 150 to 200 million viewers off the package deal. \"But as long as these TV packages are here, the transfer fees are going to stay where they are now, around the $38-89 million mark. \"Footballers don't really look at the Neymar deal, they know what the standard wage is and each league is different. Players know their worth, mainly through word of mouth. It's no secret who's on what and they try to at least be on each other's coattails.\"Nobody is worth $261 million. Even the US President, regardless of who he is, is not worth that figure because somebody else can come in and do that job and it's the same with a footballer. \"Transfers are not sustainable at $261 million, but that was an exception.\"JUST WATCHEDNeymar speaks to CNN after joining PSGReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNeymar speaks to CNN after joining PSG 02:16The Lawyer -- 'Clubs can now afford to say no' Daniel Geey is a partner at sports and media law firm Sheridans. He has worked on a number of club takeovers and high-profile transfers.\"There's a dual narrative to this summer's window. In the Premier League, the money that has been spent to date relates to increases in broadcasting money, which means the top clubs are earning almost $192 million from central distribution. \"The Premier League clubs are continuing to spend big, but a counter-balance are the mega continental clubs that still have huge buying power and huge sway. Traditionally, that was Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich, but PSG are now in that group. Man City have paid a premium for their fullbacks this season. Kyle Walker is pictured.\"Particular players are now being valued depending on the system the club wants to play, and you can see that with Manchester City spending over $128 million on two fullbacks. \"Another phenomenon which differs to previous seasons is the sale of a number of players from Monaco to elite clubs, based on their fantastic run in the Champions League last season. \"But one of the things which may be becoming more prominent is that clubs have the ability -- as long as there is no release or buyout clause in contracts -- to keep players, even if the bid is a hugely significant sum. \"In the Premier League, the clubs outside the top six are now able to live within their means and can compete with most high-profile continental European clubs because they can afford the wages, the signing on fees. \"And I'm still not sure whether profit is the overall objective for owners. A lot of owners, chairmen and directors would say they want on-field success. Liverpool have reportedly had two bids rejected for midfielder RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita.\"Is it on-field success which drives commercial revenue and profit, or is it profit and greater commercial value which drives greater squad investment and consequent on-field success? It's probably a bit of both. \"Liverpool are said to have had two bids rejected for RB Leipzig's midfielder Naby Keita but Red Bull, the German club's owners, have very deep pockets. \"They have a long-term plan, and it's their first year in the Champions League. They want to maintain that approach to on-field success, which again drives commercial success and drives a longer term plan. \"It seems no means no, whereas maybe even a year ago talk of such eye-watering numbers may have enticed a number of owners or directors to accept those kinds of figures.\"Who do you think has been the best this summer's best signing?

Sky and BT paid a record $6.58 billion for Premier League rights.\"The transfer fees have gone up, but it's important to remember that revenues have gone up as well. Spending is proportional. \"In the Premier League, net spending has always been around 15% of the clubs' revenue and it's not deviated from that too much, which means clubs are spending within their means. \"The one big outlier is Neymar. Yes, PSG are wealthy but they've not got the biggest revenue. But that deal doesn't really affect many clubs, if any. \"It may impact Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, in the way they view transfer fees and spending in the future. It might impact the top end of the market, but it's a one-off case.\"It'll be interesting to see how his arrival impacts PSG commercially. Clearly, from a football point of view Neymar isn't worth $261 million, but from a brand perspective he may actually be worth that.

Manchester United broke the transfer record for Paul Pogba last year, but he isn't quite at Neymar's level. \"AC Milan have spent big this summer. They've got new owners which has facilitated that and they've bought marquee signings -- Leonardo Bonucci's signing from Juventus has the potential to transform them back into a top four Italian club, which they haven't been for a few years. \"But broadcast deals in Europe still pale in comparison to the Premier League, which is why it's the big Premier League clubs which mainly top the spending. \"The only thing that has really surprised me this summer is Manchester City spending so much on fullbacks -- $64 million on Kyle Walker and $67 million on Benjamin Mendy -- but fullbacks have increased in importance in the modern game. \"It's questionable whether they are worth that much, but there's no doubt they are good players and City can afford it. \"When you have Financial Fair Play there is always going to be a temperature check and I don't think anyone is going to want to play chicken with European football's governing body UEFA as they have a track record of clamping down on financial ill discipline.\"The chief executive -- 'Expectations increase'Brighton picked up their first Premier League point in Saturday's 0-0 draw with Watford.Paul Barber is the chief executive of newly-promoted Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion.

This summer's circus-like transfer window has been part and parcel of the entertainment.\"Unfortunately, the huge amount of money spent during the transfer window ultimately comes out of fans' pockets.\"Many fans have already been priced out of watching football in person due to high ticket costs. There's a danger that they are going to be priced out of watching football on TV, too. \"A football TV subscription is already an expensive luxury, and if costs continue to spiral than inevitably more and more fans will cancel.\"We may be close to a tipping point where a collapse in TV revenue will have a major effect on the transfer window, with fans no longer willing or able to subsidize huge transfer fees.\"",

I'm having a ball.\"Will he return to UFC? \"Of course,\" he said.Stars turning out for the spectacleThis was hardly viewed as a matchup against equals in the boxing ring. Sure, McGregor has held UFC championships in two weight classes. But the sheer thought of McGregor knocking out the veteran Mayweather felt borderline absurd.Additionally, the lead-up to the bout had a disturbing dark side.The two fighters embarked on a four-city media tour this summer spanning the United States, Canada and England. Though there were no physical blows at those, Mayweather, who has a record of domestic violence, and McGregor exchanged verbal jabs full of profanity, racism, homophobia and misogyny.Yet, despite the hatred on full display by both men, fans and celebrities expressed interest in this fight. The stars were out in full force Saturday at T-Mobile Arena, including LeBron James, Mike Tyson, Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Bruce Willis, Jamie Foxx, Olivia Munn, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven, Nick Cannon and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. Earlier this summer, estimates of 10,000 fans attended the media tour in Los Angeles. There were 15,000 in Toronto, 13,000 in New York and another 10,000 in London.And maybe the thought of McGregor pulling off the unthinkable was a reason why people shelled out $99.95 to watch the fight on pay-per-view in the United States. But not all viewing went smoothly. According to Showtime Sports, there were reports of \"scattered outages\" from various cable and satellite providers and the online offering. Showtime Sports delayed the start of the main event slightly to allow for systems to get on track. It was a short delay.But after all that jawing and waiting, did it really matter who won? Both fighters are expected to leave the ring with hefty paydays. According to CNNMoney, industry experts have speculated that the fight could surpass $500 million, which was a record set by the Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight in 2015.",

It's a true testament to the impact she's had on others,\" she said.\"She gave a voice to weak, vulnerable and marginalized people. It's a voice this world needed for years to come, but that has now been silenced.\"An ongoing mysteryMadsen, who has been charged with manslaughter, told a closed-door court hearing Monday that Wall had died in an accident and was buried at sea in an \"unspecified place\" in K\u00f8ge Bay, according to a statement.This image is thought to be the final photo of Swedish journalist Kim Wall. She's seen standing with Peter Madsen in the tower of his private submarine on August 10, 2017 in Copenhagen Harbor.  Madsen, 46, originally claimed he had dropped her off on land on the night of August 10, according to a police statement.But police later said Madsen had provided them with a \"different explanation.\"The inventor was charged with manslaughter on August 11 and ordered to be held in custody for 24 days. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told Denmark's TV2 at the time that her client \"accepts the arrest but still denies the crime.\"According to CNN's Swedish affiliate Expressen, the submarine -- which had sunk -- was found at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, August 11, 15 hours after it had departed Copenhagen.Police said there was no trace of Wall when the submarine was found by emergency services. Search intensifiesExpressen reporter Federico Moreno, speaking to CNN from Amager island near where the torso was found, said the search effort appeared to have intensified since Tuesday.Divers from the Danish Defence Command are seen preparing for a dive near Amager in Copenhagen on Tuesday.He said he could see about 10 divers searching the waters off the island, more than double the number he'd seen a day earlier. The spot where the torso was found is also not far from the location where the submarine sank, he said.Danes with whom Moreno has spoken about the case say the circumstances are very strange and that they have questions about Madsen's changing accounts of what happened, he said.Moreno said that Madsen's lawyer, Hald Engmark, had sent him a text message after Wednesday's police press briefing to say that Madsen maintained his innocence.Madsen was already famous in Denmark before his name hit the headlines in relation to this case, Moreno said. He had launched his submarine, the UC3 Nautilus, in 2008 with the help of crowdfunding.This family handout photo released on August 12, 2017 shows Swedish journalist Kim Wall.Wall wasn't a household name in Sweden, in part because she mostly wrote for English-language publications, Moreno said, but she was an experienced reporter and her family is well known in media circles. Wall, a graduate of Columbia University and London School of Economics, was based between Beijing and New York. Her work appeared in the New York Times, the Guardian and TIME among others. Her father was a photojournalist for Expressen for many years and her brother also works as a photojournalist for Swedish publications, Moreno said.

        "content": "Story highlightsKirill Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling more than $1.2 million of government fundsFriends say the case is politically motivated because Serebrennikov has spoken against censorship (CNN)A prominent Russian theater and film director and critic of censorship was charged with embezzlement on Tuesday, in what his supporters see as a politically motivated case.  Kirill Serebrennikov was arrested in St. Petersburg on Tuesday. He was later charged with fraud, Interfax news agency reported, citing Russia's investigative committee.  The committee, which investigates high-profile crimes, said Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling more than $1.2 million of government funds between 2011 and 2014, by taking money allocated for a theatrical project. The 47-year-old creative director of progressive theater Gogol Center in Moscow has denied wrongdoing.  Serebrennikov faces a hearing on Wednesday, where he will learn whether he will await trial in prison or under house arrest. Supporters plan to gather in protest outside the city center court at midday during that appearance. Read MoreReaction within Russia's cultural community was swift and outraged, with many expressing fears of a clampdown.   Andrey Saveliev, a prominent director and longtime colleague and friend of Serebrennikov, told CNN that people felt Serebrennikov was targeted because of his ''inconvenient and ideologically nonconforming'' work. \"Perhaps, if his art did not cause such a stir every time and did not cause such a stormy reaction, what is happening now would not be interpreted as an act that presumably has political reasons behind it,'' Saveliev said.  Opposition news site Meduza published an open letter in support of the director and condemning what it called a ''fabricated case,\" comparing his case and specific charges to that of dissidents who were persecuted during Soviet times. Referring to the estimated 4 million people prosecuted for counter-revolutionary activities under Article 58 of the Soviet penal code, the editorial said: 'We know that the article on fraud is nothing better than the infamous Article 58, it is the same effective and universal tool for punishing people, except no one gets shot.''  One of Russia's most famous actresses, Liya Akhedzhakova, wrote on her social media account that the situation was reminiscent of the dark days of those purges, likening Serebrennikov to theater director Vsevolod  Meyerhold, victim of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin's purges. Meyerhold was executed in 1940 after his experimental works were deemed anti-Soviet.  Investigative committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said authorities have substantial evidence against Serebrennikov, saying ''his guilt in committing large-scale fraud is confirmed by the testimonies of witnesses, the results of investigative activity, financial documents obtained during the investigation and other evidence.'' Long considered one of Russia's most gifted talents, Serebrennikov is known for his controversial productions and anti-censorship stance.  He was also an outspoken supporter of artistic freedom in Russia even as socially conservative forces gathered strength.  In 2015, he defended a colleague whose opera was canceled and investigated for desecrating religious objects, criticizing conservatives in an open letter.  ''Theater is a territory of freedom. If they wish to avoid being annoyed, offended, embarrassed or angry, let them sit in churches,'' Serebrennikov wrote.His film \"The Student,\" which won an award at the Cannes festival last year, explored the blurring of the lines between religion and state through a portrait of the growing fanaticism of a schoolboy. Last month the Bolshoi Theatre canceled his ballet about dancer Rudolf Nureyev days before it opened. The legendary institution denied at the time that the reason was the portrayal of Nureyev's gay relationships and battle with AIDS, both controversial subjects in the biography of the Russian cultural icon and contemporary Russia. On Tuesday, the director of the Bolshoi, Vladimir Urin, said Serebrennikov was a ''great artist'' and ''very gifted and talented.'' In May, Urin was one of a group of cultural figures who signed a letter in support of Serebrennikov, which was then delivered personally to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he was awarding one of them with a state medal. Serebrennikov was initially questioned in May as a witness in an embezzlement case, according to state news agency Tass.  He was released at the time but two colleagues were remanded in custody. One has reportedly been charged and testified against Serebrennikov.CNN's Darya Tarasova contributed to this report.",

Among the recent deaths were six Russian diplomats. Some of the deaths appeared natural and governments have ruled out foul play.In some cases, though, questions remain. That's either because the facts have changed over time, details are hard to come by, or the deaths are still under investigation.Self-proclaimed online sleuths and conspiracy theorists have filled the information void with speculation that the deaths were somehow related to Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. No evidence has surfaced to make such a connection. Here's a rundown of the nine deaths -- and one near-fatality:In this photo taken on Monday, Feb. 27, 2017, Denis Voronenkov visits a movie theater in Kiev, Ukraine.Read MoreRussian ambassador to Sudan dies while swimmingRussia's ambassador to Sudan, Migayas Shirinskiy, died in the Khartoum Wednesday August 23, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry.He died while swimming in the pool of his residence, according to state broadcaster Russia 24, after manifesting symptoms of an acute heart attack.Embassy spokesman Sergei Konyashin said the staff called an ambulance but doctors were not able to save the ambassador. He was appointed to the post in 2013.The Sudanese police have ruled out the possibility of an assassination attempt, Russia 24 reported, quoting local law enforcement agencies.Russian politician who fled to Ukaine shot deadDenis Voronenkov, 45, was gunned down Thursday outside a hotel in Kiev. Voronenkov and his wife both spoke out against Russian President Vladimir Putin after they left Russia for Ukraine in October. Voronenkov also helped Ukraine in its ongoing fight against Russian influence, testifying in a treason trial against ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was perceived as a puppet politician for Putin.Ukraine's president called the shooting a \"Russian state terrorist act.\" Russian authorities denied the accusation.Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin, at the United Nations September 25, 2016 in New York. Russian ambassador to the UN suddenly diesVitaly Churkin, 64, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, died on February 20 of an apparent heart attack. He was \"in his office fulfilling his duties\" when he died, according to a statement from the Russian mission at the UN.Russian ambassador to India dies after brief illnessAlexander Kadakin, 67, the Russian ambassador to India, died on January 26.A spokeswoman for the Russian embassy in New Delhi said that Kadakin died after a short illness and that there was nothing \"special or extraordinary\" about the circumstances that led to his death.Kadakin had worked in India since 2009. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as \"a great friend of India\" who worked hard to strengthen relations between the two countries.Russian diplomat found dead in AthensAndrey Malanin, a senior diplomat at the Russian embassy in Greece, was found dead in early January.Malanin, 54, was the head of the Russian embassy's consular section in Athens. Police sources told CNN that worried colleagues called authorities after Malanin didn't show up to work for a few days. Police entered his apartment on January 9 and found him dead on his bedroom floor.Initial reports from Greek police suggested Malanin died suddenly from natural causes. Two Greek police officials said foul play was not suspected. An investigation remains underway.Former intelligence official found dead in his carOleg Erovinkin, who had close ties to Russian intelligence, was found dead on December 26 sitting in his car on the streets of Moscow. Russian news outlets reported that he was 61 years old. Russian government agencies have not released an official cause of death.He was a former general in the Russian law enforcement and intelligence agency known as the FSB. He also served as chief of staff to Igor Sechin, the president of state-owned oil giant Rosneft. Sechin enjoys a close relationship with Putin that dates back to the 1990s.Because of Erovinkin's background, conspiracy theorists and Russia watchers have speculated that he might have been a source of information in the 35-page dossier that detailed alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. No evidence has emerged to firmly substantiate those claims.Graphic content / This picture taken on December 19, 2016 shows Andrey Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Ankara, lying on the floor after being shot by a gunman during an attack during a public event in Ankara.Diplomat fatally shot in backRussia's ambassador to Turkey, Andrey Karlov, 62, was assassinated in Ankara on December 20.

The paper said Polshikov's wife found him in their bedroom with a pillow over his head.

When they arrived, they found Sergei Krivov, 63, unresponsive. Emergency responders declared him dead at the scene.Krivov, who was born in Russia, had served in the consulate as duty commander involved with security affairs, according to Russian news reports.Russian consular officials first said Krivov fell from the roof. Then, they said he died of a heart attack.The initial police report filed on the day of the incident said Krivov was found \"with an unknown trauma to the head,\" according to a New York Police Department spokesman.However, after conducting an autopsy and finishing its investigation, the New York City Medical Examiner ruled that Krivov died from bleeding in the chest area, likely due to a tumor. Police sources said foul play wasn't suspected and that Krivov had been in poor health.Russian lawyer for whistleblower is nearly killedIn March, a private Russian lawyer on an anti-corruption crusade reportedly fell from the fourth floor of his Moscow apartment.Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, was near death with \"severe head injuries\" and remains in a hospital's intensive care unit, according to his friend, investor Bill Browder.Gorokhov represented Sergei Magnitsky, a fellow Russian lawyer who exposed Russia's largest ever tax fraud -- and was later jailed and beaten to death in a Moscow detention center.

Gathering at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York for a candlelight vigil Wednesday, former classmates sang \"Stand by Me\" and recalled Wall's distinctive reporting, charm and humor.For Matthew Claiborne, one of Wall's former classmates, coming together on Wednesday was as a reminder that \"she is more than what happened to her.\"Wall's former classmates attend a vigil at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism on Wednesday.A tragic return homeRead MoreFrom Haiti to North Korea, Wall gave a \"voice to the weak, vulnerable and marginalized,\" her mother, Ingrid Wall, said in a tribute posted on Facebook.A graduate of Columbia University and the London School of Economics, Wall reported on the tourism industry in post-earthquake Haiti and more recently, the underground online culture in Cuba.

It appeared that the head, legs and arms were deliberately cut off, Danish police chief investigator Jens M\u00f8ller Jensen said. The body had apparently been punctured to let the air out before sinking it, and it was weighted down in a presumed attempt to prevent it floating, he added.By Wednesday, police matched DNA taken from Wall's toothbrush and hairbrush to the torso. They also confirmed they had found Wall's blood in the submarine, M\u00f8ller Jensen told reporters.\"Naturally, the DNA match is a relatively large breakthrough in the investigation which will now continue until we have built all possible information in the case,\" said M\u00f8ller Jensen.As many as 10 divers were spotted Wednesday as part of an extensive search for \"remaining body parts and clothing\" in the waters off the island where the torso was found and police have asked for the public's help.\"The scale of the disaster is not yet fully transparent, and there are still a number of questions to be answered,\" Ingrid Wall wrote.Answers that only Madsen can provide.CNN's Evan Simko-Bednarski, James Masters, Jim Stenman, Sophia Chalmer, Laura Smith-Park, Hilary McGann, Euan McKirdy and Henrik Pettersson contributed to this report.",

When Hayward announced his decision to leave Utah, Jazz fans burned his jersey.Read More\"Gordon Hayward paid (his) dues as well and decided to do what's best for him and family,\" James said.He later continued his rant: \"If these guys weren't good, u guys would be the first to say 'get them up out of here.' Man beat it! When 'we' decide to do what best for us it's 'cowardly' 'traitor,' etc but when it's on the other side it's 'business' huh!?!?\"Boston Celtics' Isaiah Thomas: 'Mentally and emotionally I'm not here'James knows a little about fickle fans. In Cleveland, fans famously burned his Cavs jersey in 2010 after the then-free agent announced he was leaving for the Miami Heat. Four years later, they embraced him when he returned to the Cavaliers.The day of the Irving-Thomas trade, James retweeted a video from a fan showing Irving's Cavaliers jersey alongside a homemade sign reading, \"Thank U so much.\" In his retweet, James said, \"That's the only way to be to the kid! Special talent/guy! Nothing but respect and what a ride it was our 3 years together.\"Even though Thomas is one of the shortest players in the NBA -- he's listed at 5 feet, 9 inches -- he regularly comes up big. It started almost immediately with his namesake.Thomas was named after NBA legend Isiah Thomas when his father, James, lost a friendly wager on a Lakers-Pistons playoff game in 1989. He had the famous name, but because of his height, Thomas had to prove to the league that he belonged. He played three years for the University of Washington and was selected by the Sacramento Kings as the 60th and final pick in the 2011 NBA Draft.The Kings traded Thomas to the Phoenix Suns in 2014, and then he was sent to Boston as part of a trade in 2015. He thrived with the Celtics, leading the team in scoring, and became a two-time All-Star.",

Erin ticked off a \"bucket list\" VIP trip to the Kentucky Derby this year, while Mclain was able to meet his Nascar driver heroes when Jimmy attended the US PGA media day as defending champion. There's also the Masters tradition of partners and children donning the white suits to caddie in the Wednesday par-three competition.

In a propaganda video released by the SITE Intelligence Group Wednesday, an ISIS member describes the Barcelona perpetrators as \"our brothers,\" while another threatens \"Spanish Christians\" and promises to return the country to the \"land of the Caliphate.\" Soon after the Barcelona attack, ISIS' media wing, Amaq, issued a statement calling the attackers \"soldiers of the Islamic State,\" although ISIS did not explicitly claim responsibility.Reports: Terror cell planned to target landmarksFour men have been arrested since the attack -- one in Alcanar and three in Ripoll. Three were Moroccan citizens and another was Spanish; the men ranged in age from 21 to 34. None were on authorities' radar for potential terrorism links.Appearing in court Tuesday, one of the suspects said they planned to target \"monuments\" in Barcelona. Read MoreAll 12 members of the alleged terror plot are believed to be dead, including the suspected driver of the van who was shot by police Monday during an operation in Subirats, west of Barcelona. Terror cell baseEvidence of the planned attacks has alarmed many in Spain, highlighting the possibility the authorities knew nothing of an advanced plot to mount a terror attack until an accidental explosion at the perpetrators' base. A subsequent investigation has focused on that base -- a property in Alcanar, a coastal village southwest of Barcelona, that blew up last week before the attacks.The house is suspected of having been used as a base to make bombs that could have caused even more devastation had they not blown up prematurely.The debris of a house in the village of Alcanar, Catalonia, is seen Thursday after it collapsed due to an explosion.A source briefed on the probe told CNN a preliminary assessment indicated traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble. TATP was used in a series of deadly bombing attacks in Europe in recent years.The loss of those explosives meant the subsequent attack in Barcelona was \"more rudimentary than they originally planned,\" Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero said. Police believe Muslim cleric Abdelbakir El-Satty is among those who died in the Alcanar blast. Some Spanish media reported he shared a jail cell with one of the terrorists involved in the 2004 Madrid bombings that killed at least 191 people and left hundreds injured.Responding to those reports, Catalan Justice Minister Carles Mund\u00f3 i Blanch said \"we are not aware that this person had any communication with any inmate in any prison in Catalonia. He finished his sentence and went free.\"     How the attacks unfoldedThe first sign of the terror cell's activities -- although its significance was not immediately understood -- came the night before the Barcelona attack when the house in Alcanar was almost completely destroyed by an unexpected explosion.Thwarted by the explosion of ammunition and possibly alarmed at the attention it had drawn, it appears that the surviving members of the cell scrambled to mount an alternative plan. The next day at about 5 p.m., a rental van was driven at high speed from Barcelona's Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya deep into the teeming crowds on the city's most famous thoroughfare, Las Ramblas.At least 13 people were killed and 120 injured. Hours later, as details of the atrocity in Barcelona were still emerging, five attackers drove an Audi A3 into several pedestrians in Cambrils, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of Barcelona, early on Friday morning. Police engaged in a shootout with the attackers, and all five were shot dead, four of them by one officer.",

The judge forbade Serebrennikov from using the Internet or the phone to communicate with anyone other than his family during his detention ahead of a criminal trial.The award-winning director was arrested Tuesday in St. Petersburg and charged with embezzlement and fraud, Interfax news agency reported, citing Russia's investigative committee.The panel, which investigates high-profile crimes, said Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling more than $1.2 million in government money allocated for a theatrical project between 2011 and 2014. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years behind bars.Read MoreSerebrennikov's ''guilt in committing large-scale fraud is confirmed by the testimonies of witnesses, the results of investigative activity, financial documents obtained during the investigation and other evidence,\" investigative committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said Tuesday.  Serebrennikov, 47, has denied wrongdoing and called the charges \"absurd.\"Cultural community ralliesLong considered one of Russia's most gifted talents, Serebrennikov, the creative director of the avant-garde theater Gogol Center in Moscow, has been an outspoken supporter of artistic freedom in Russia. Reaction to his detention among the capital's cultural community has been swift and rife with outrage. Russian theater and film director arrestedSupporters outside the courthouse Wednesday shouted, ''Freedom!'' and chanted Serebrennikov's name, the Russian news outlets' video streams show.Some of Russia's most famous directors and artists, including some considered to be close to the government, wrote to the court or appeared in person Wednesday to vouch for Serebrennikov's character and to urge his release, social media posts indicated.By Wednesday afternoon, almost 15,000 people had signed an online petition calling for the charges to be dropped. The petition is addressed to the investigative body and to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

Police say that the head, legs and arms appear to have been deliberately cut off. DNA tests will need to be carried out before the person's identity can be confirmed.An autopsy is expected to conclude late Tuesday with police expected to announce the results Wednesday after comparing DNA from the torso with Wall's.     Wall, a freelance journalist, has been missing since August 11 after boarding a privately built submarine along with its inventor, Peter Madsen, for a story she was working on.Read More\"It is clear that the police, like the media and everybody else, is speculating whether this female body is Kim Wall, but  it is way too soon to tell,\" Copenhagen police spokesman Jens Moller told a news conference on Monday.An ongoing mysteryMadsen, who has been charged with manslaughter, told a closed-door court hearing that he buried Wall at sea in an \"unspecified place\" in K\u00f8ge Bay, according to a statement published Monday.Wall, 30, boarded the 17-meter Nautilus submarine on August 10 at Refshale\u00f8en island for a story she was writing about Madsen and the vessel.Peter Madsen, builder and captain of the private submarine \"UC3 Nautilus,\" is pictured in Dragoer Harbor south of Copenhagen.Madsen, 46, had originally rejected accusations that he was responsible for Wall's death, claiming he had dropped her off on land later that night, according to a police statement.Police later said Madsen had provided them with a \"different explanation.\"The inventor was charged with manslaughter and ordered to be held in custody for 24 days. At the time of Madsen being charged, his lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told Denmark's TV2 that her client \"accepts the arrest but still denies the crime.\"Swedish journalist Kim Wall is alleged to have stood next to a man in the tower of the private submarine \"UC3 Nautilus\" on August 10 in Copenhagen Harbor. \nAccording to Swedish newspaper and CNN affiliate Expressen, the submarine was found at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, August 11, 15 hours after it had departed Copenhagen.Police said there was no trace of Wall when the submarine was found by emergency services.This photo allegedly shows Swedish journalist Kim Wall standing in the tower of the private submarine \"UC3 Nautilus\" on August 10 in Copenhagen Harbor.\nWall, a graduate of Columbia University and London School of Economics, was based between Beijing and New York.We are deeply saddened to learn that Kim Wall is reported to have died.

Another suspect, Driss Oukabir, is taken into Madrid's High Court on Tuesday.Two other men arrested in connection with last week's terror attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils also appeared in court. Salah El Karib will be held for further questioning. Mohamed Aalla was released and has to appear in court every Monday, a court document says.Read MoreSalah el Karib, one of four suspects arrested in the  attacks, is escorted into court Tuesday in Madrid.The four suspected members of the cell were in court less than 24 hours after police killed Younes Abouyaaqoub, the suspected driver of the van in Barcelona.The attack killed 13 people and injured more than 100 others. Spanish authorities said they have identified the body of Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam who died in a house explosion in Alcanar last Wednesday night, a court document says. Chemlal was reportedly injured.Chemial told the judge that Satty planned to immolate himself in an attack on a landmark, the media outlets said. RTVE cited \"court officials.\"A second body at the house has not been identified. Investigators also recovered butane bombs, TATP and several ISIS-related documents inside the house, including plane tickets to Brussels, Belgium, the document says.  Audi caught on camera in FranceOfficials also revealed that a vehicle used in another deadly attack last week had been seen earlier in France.The car, an Audi A3, was caught speeding on camera in Paris in the days before Friday's attack in the Spanish town of Cambrils, French Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb said.One woman was killed when the vehicle mowed down pedestrians early Friday in Cambrils. The five assailants in the car were shot dead by police at the scene. An employee starts to tow away a car involved in a terrorist attack in Cambrils, south of Barcelona.The Cambrils attack came hours after the Barcelona attack.Collomb told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Tuesday he was unsure why the car in the Cambrils rampage had been in Paris and said the terror cell behind the attacks was not on the radar of French authorities.Also Tuesday, Moroccan security forces detained a 34-year-old man in Oujda, Morocco, near the Algerian border, state-run television reported, citing sources close to the investigation. The man was detained for possible links to the Barcelona attack, the station said. The man resides in Ripoli, Spain, north of Barcelona, the same town where eight of the 12 terror cell members lived. Moroccan security forces are working with Catalan authorities and have sent experts to Spain to assist with the investigation. Van driver shot deadPolice deployed a robot to remove what turned out to be a fake explosives belt from Abouyaaqoub's body before officers were cleared to approach it and make a positive identification, authorities said Monday.

Bomb factory in a beach town may be key to terror attacksAbouyaaqoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan, was the suspected driver of the van that sped down Las Ramblas in the center of Barcelona on Thursday, leaving dead and injured people in its wake.Investigators said Abouyaaqoub fled the scene on foot and hijacked a car to escape. Abouyaaqoub allegedly stabbed the owner of the car, Pau P\u00e9rez, as he parked the vehicle, and drove off with the man's body in the car. P\u00e9rez later was found dead in the vehicle, making him the 15th victim of the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.Police fired on the car after it rammed through a checkpoint, but Abouyaaqoub was able to flee a second time. Authorities said none of the 12 suspects had any previous link to terror activities.Imam linkThe investigation has focused on a property in Alcanar, a coastal village southwest of Barcelona, that exploded last week before the attacks. The house is suspected of having been used as a base to make bombs that could have caused even more devastating attacks had they not blown up prematurely.A source briefed on the probe said a preliminary assessment indicated traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble. TATP was used in a series of deadly bombing attacks in Europe in recent years. Police believe Muslim cleric Abdelbakir El-Satty is among those who died in the Alcanar blast.

Performers from 62 countries will visit the Fringe this year, hoping for success at the world's largest arts festival, which is held every August in the Scottish capital. As well as the Arab Arts program the event will host pieces from Korea and Taiwan, a Made in Adelaide showcase and a series of plays by Scottish writers. The festival is \"permit free,\" meaning that performers entering the UK don't need to apply for a work permit. But artists from outside the EU still need to secure visas.Actor Amer Hlehel performs in \"Taha,' a play featured at this year's Edinbugh Fringe Festival. Four of El Attar's producing team had their visa applications rejected, as did two dancers, Hamza Damra and Nagham Saleh, who remain in Jordan and Egypt, respectively. Read MoreDamra, a Palestinian dancer, was spotted by choreographer Yazan Iwidat at a workshop in Ramallah in the West Bank. Iwidat recalls him standing out despite being new to contemporary dance, so they put a routine together. Authorities cited concern that Damra would remain in the UK after the festival in their decision to reject his application.\"I find this approach arrogant,\" Iwidat said. \"People aspire to live in other parts of the world too, not just the UK. We create art in the Arab world too.\" A video of the dancer performing is being played at the showcase instead. \"I feel so bad about all the opportunities I missed because of these issues,\" Damra said. Saleh, a Sudanese dancer, was told that because she is unmarried, authorities had similar concerns, her choreographer Shaymaa Shoukry said.Edinburgh Fringe Festival: 13 funny female comedians to watch\"I find that quite unbelievable,\" Shoukry told CNN. The pair had worked on her performance for two years. After Saleh's application was rejected for a second time, Shoukry had five days to choreograph a new routine with Mahmoud el Hadad, a dancer she had previously worked with.El Attar called the decisions \"arbitrary.\"\"When you think of countries like Britain you imagine and you hope that there is a transparent visa system,\" he said. \"But even here it's just like dealing with an Arab government agency.\" The Edinburgh International Festival and the city's International Book Festival have also been affected by visa issues. Conchita Wurst, the Austrian singer and Eurovision winner, was supposed to perform at the International Festival on August 11, in a concert featuring collaborations between established and newly-arrived artists in Europe. Wurst's band, Basalt, is made up of three Syrians who all arrived in Vienna around three years ago. All three had their UK visa applications rejected. In response, Wurst pulled out of the show. A recorded introduction and performance from the group was screened instead. Basalt performs live in Vienna. The band, which performs with Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst, was denied entry to perform in Edinburgh. One of the Syrians in Wurst's band, Almonther Alshoufi, told CNN that UK authorities considered him financially unstable, though he earns around 600 euros a month, and that he doesn't have good family connections in Vienna, despite having a girlfriend there. Alshoufi said that the band didn't appeal as they had received their rejections only a day before the concert had been due to take place. A spokeswoman for the festival said organizers were \"very disappointed\" by the decision.Amal Omran performs in 'Your Love Is Fire,' a play by Mudar Alhaggi. Nick Barley, director of the International Book Festival, said it is hugely important for artists to be able to travel to the UK. \"If the government is operating a de facto travel ban from certain countries, they should admit it,\" Barley said. Any such ban would \"(deny) us crucial opportunities to share international dialogue.\" \"That's just not acceptable in an open country like the United Kingdom -- and certainly not in Scotland.\"A UK Home Office spokesperson said that all visa applications are considered on their merits but declined to comment on individual cases. Social media campaigns to reverse the visa decisions have had some success. Ehsan Abdollahi, an Iranian children's illustrator invited to the Book Festival, had his visa application visa turned down in July but the decision was overturned after a subsequent outcry. Mohamed Alarashi performs in 'Your Love Is Fire.'Barley took to Twitter to protest on the illustrator's behalf and a chorus of literary voices joined him before politicians got involved. Within days, the rejection was reversed. Why is UK government denying @edbookfest visas to Iranian authors for 3rd year in a row? https://t.co/arCOlWvkwz via @thebookseller\u2014 Nick Barley (@nickbarleyedin) July 20, 2017\nOrganizers want other artists affected by visa rejections to draw some hope from Abdollahi's case. \"We'd had success on this occasion, though I know that many other festivals are not so fortunate,\" Barley said. \"I hope [this] stands as a beacon for others: a small demonstration that non-violent public protest can actually change a government's behavior in a democracy.\"",

I decided it was a time for me to join my brothers who decide to take a knee and support them while they were praying.\"Kirksey, who led the prayer group, said the group felt like Monday night was the right time to do it. The game was broadcast on national television.\"With everything you do, you have to have respect,\" Kirksey said. \"We did it in a way that resembled prayer. We were just praying over the country and praying over things going on. We did it as respectfully as possible, and we respect everything that happened with things in the military. We respect all of that. We just felt it was the right time for us to do this and say a prayer for this country.\"First white NFL player to kneelDeValve is believed to be the first white NFL player to kneel during the anthem. After the game, DeValve, whose wife is African-American, said he didn't realize he was the first white player to do so.\"I, myself, will be raising children who don't look like me,\" DeValve said. \"I want to do my part, as well, to do everything I can to raise them in a better environment (than) we have right now. I wanted to take that opportunity with my teammates to pray for our country and also to draw attention to the fact that we have work to do. That's why I did what I did.\"Slavery and the national anthem: A surprising side of the NFL protestsLast year, Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, became a lightning rod when he refused to stand during the national anthem.The quarterback's decision to sit -- then, later, to kneel -- drew fierce criticism but sparked a national movement. Other athletes, from elementary schools to professional leagues, followed his lead.Kaepernick, a free agent, remains unsigned.Follow Jill Martin on Twitter",

        "content": "Story highlightsWoman called authorities after seeing photos of Younes Abouyaaqoub, police sayHe reportedly fled Thursday's attack scene on foot and hijacked another car to escapeBarcelona (CNN)Spanish authorities on Monday shot and killed the suspected driver of the van that plowed into crowds last week in Barcelona, according to Catalan police. Younes Abouyaaqoub was killed during an operation in Subirats, west of Barcelona, police said in a tweet. He was wearing a fake suicide belt.A robot was sent to remove the belt from before officers were cleared to approach and make a positive identification, in case the belt turned out to be real. The suspect also had knives in his possession when he was shot, said Jos\u00e9 Llu\u00eds Trapero, head of Catalan police.A woman alerted authorities after seeing police photos of Abouyaaqoub and becoming suspicious that the man was wearing long sleeves when it was about 85 degrees (30 degrees Celsius) outside, he said. Witness accounts suggest Abouyaaqoub was alone when police arrived, Trapero said. Police killed Abouyaaqoub in a rural area, sparsely populated and surrounded by pine trees. After  the gunfire, a police helicopter circled overhead. Several police officers and squad cars were nearby, but few onlookers. Read MoreAbouyaaqoub, a 22-year-old Moroccan national, is alleged to have been the sole driver of the van used to kill 13 people Thursday on Las Ramblas, a thoroughfare that's a popular tourist destination. More than 100 others were injured.The Spanish Interior Ministry released this image of suspect Younes Abouyaaqoub.Investigators said Abouyaaqoub fled the scene of Thursday's attack on foot and hijacked a car to escape. Abouyaaqoub allegedly stabbed the owner of the car, Pau Perez, as he parked the vehicle, and drove off with his body inside the car.Police fired on the car after it rammed through a checkpoint, but Abouyaaqoub was able to flee a second time. Perez was found dead in the vehicle, making him the 15th victim of the attacks in Barcelona and the Catalan town of Cambrils, where one woman died early Friday when attackers drove into pedestrians there.Police conduct more raidsSpeaking to local radio, Joaquim Forn, the Catalan interior minister, said all evidence pointed to Abouyaaqoub being the sole driver and that security services were working with other agencies around Europe to find him. Police carried out more raids overnight at homes in the town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona, where eight of the 12 suspects lived, Forn said.Abouyaaqoub was one of 12 terror suspects linked to the Spain attacks. Authorities have said none had any previous link to terror activities.On Saturday, Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoida said the terror cell believed to be responsible for the attack had been \"completely dismantled.\"Meanwhile, Catalan police said in a series of tweets that four suspected terrorists have been detained, and eight have been killed, \"but that does not mean that the investigation is over. We keep working.\"Confirmamos la muerte de Younes Abouyaaqoub, abatido en #Subirats /  We confirm the death of Younes Abouyaaqoub shot in #Subirats https://t.co/ZzpCBFZOGC\u2014 Mossos (@mossos) August 21, 2017\nSo far there are 4 detainees and 8 suspected dead terrorists regarding the attacks of #Barcelona and #Cambrils\u2014 Mossos (@mossos) August 21, 2017\nThe 12 initial targets regarding the attacks are dead or detained but that does not mean that the investigation is over.

He finished his sentence and went free.\"Bulldozer clears rubble in AlcanarIn Alcanar on Sunday, explosives experts brought in a bulldozer to clear rubble before conducting a number of controlled detonations at the site. The remains of two people have been found there.The debris of a house in the village of Alcanar may hold clues about the terror cell's plans.So far, police have discovered the remains of more than 100 gas canisters on the site.Alcanar Vice Mayor Jordi Bort told CNN the house belonged to a bank and the group had been squatting there illegally without its knowledge.The town is home to a mix of residents and others who spend holidays or weekends here, he said. Neighbors said they did not suspect any wrongdoing at the property.The septic tank of the house, which had only one floor, was used as storage for the tanks and explosives, Bort said.Source: Early assessment finds TATP at Barcelona attackers' bomb factoryA source briefed on the investigation said a preliminary assessment indicated there were traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble.TATP is made by adding acid to a mixture of acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution and can easily result in accidental detonation if mistakes occur in the preparation.TATP was used in the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings and the May bombing in Manchester, England.

Meera Andrews, center, waits in line to attend the memorial mass at Sagrada Familia cathedral on Sunday, August 20.A woman at the front of the queue cools herself off with a black lace fan. Beside her, a man in a crisp white shirt and fedora peers up at a statue of Jesus on the cross.\"This is something we've both wanted to see for a long time,\" says Meera Andrews, who is visiting the city on holiday from Wellington, New Zealand. The couple had planned to attend the 9 o'clock mass, then realized regular services had been canceled for the memorial. A group of nuns go through security at Sagrada Familia.Read MoreIn a nearby apartment block, two shirtless men smoke on their balcony as they look down at the scene below. One floor above, an armed policeman stands watch.The air is humid, the sky overcast, as the city comes together to grieve.Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were joined at the mass by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa, Catalan leaders and other officials, as well as members of the public.Cardinal Llu\u00eds Mart\u00ednez Sistach, center, speaks with Archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Joan Josep Omella, while awaiting King Felipe and Queen Letizia's arrival.Spain's King Felipe VI, center, speaks to officials before the mass, while his wife Queen Letizia looks on at the crowd outside.Inside, a mix of locals and tourists fill the pews, many snapping photographs of the cathedral's vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows on their cellphones. Large swaths of seats in the back of the cathedral sit empty as the Archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Joan Josep Omella begins his homily.The city's archbishop says those gathered are a \"beautiful mosaic\" of society, all united in a common goal: \"peace, respect, fraternal coexistence, and love.\"The mass procession begins inside the Sagrada Familia.Among the congregants were Freda Taah, 31, and Mathew Asuo-Asabere, 33, tourists visiting from Sydney, Australia.\"We had already planned to come to the cathedral, because we're Christians,\" Taah says. Freda Taah and Mathew Asuo-Asabere were visiting Barcelona from Sydney and attended the memorial mass.Barcelona is just one of a string of destinations the pair is visiting on a seven-week holiday that criss-crosses Europe. And while they say they want to make the most of their time here to see the sights, they also want to be respectful of the tragedy that struck this city.\"You could feel the unity, you could feel that people wanted to come together in defiance and move on,\" Taah said.READ MORE: Las Ramblas, the attack locals feared was comingWhile people prayed for the victims of the attack, outside the cathedral, a long line of tourists hoping to tour the famous landmark began to snake down the street.Tourists take a group selfie outside the Sagrada Familia.Annalotta Scheinin, 32, was waiting in the queue with her boyfriend; the couple were on a weekend getaway from Turku, Finland, where Scheinin works as a resident anesthesiologist. Back home on Friday, she was treating victims of another terror attack, which left two women dead.\"Somehow you get used to the idea that these attacks are coming more frequently now,\" Scheinin said.Annalotta Scheinin was visiting Barcelona from Finland, where she helped treat people involved in a stabbing attack in Turku over the weekend.As the mass ended and the congregation slowly trickled out, Henrique Sposito, 46, gingerly pushed his sleeping son down the steps in a stroller.Sposito moved to Barcelona from Brazil just four months ago.\"We chose this city to raise our son,\" he says, explaining that the city's liberty, multicultural energy, and safety were what attracted him and his wife here. Henrique Sposito checks on his son Davi in a stroller outside the Sagrada Familia.Their extended family was visiting from Brazil on Thursday when the attacker struck. They were walking on a street adjacent to Las Ramblas when a crowd of people started sprinting towards them. Sposito grabbed his elderly mother's arm and his son's stroller, and rushed into a nearby restaurant.\"People were running like it was a bullfight,\" he said.

One-year-old Davi was resting his head on a Barcelona Football Club ball, fast asleep.The sun breaks through dark skies over Sagrada Familia on Sunday morning.\"Probably the security is going to be more vigilant for some time, but look at this, we are here today and saw a king. It's the first time I see a king,\" he laughs.While the country's terror threat level hasn't been raised, the heightened security here is palpable. Nearby, police patrol the streets carrying assault rifles. Two men were pulled out of the crowd of tourists and searched.Police and fire vehicles parked outside the cathedral.Authorities pat down a man across the street from Sagrada Familia, while mass carries on inside.Tensions are also running high in the city's Gothic Quarter, where people have set up several makeshift memorials for the victims along Las Ramblas.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nIt's a change organizers of the three-week race, which started August 19, have made after much discussion in Spain about all-female podiums in sports including cycling and motor racing, which is increasingly seen as old-fashioned and sexist. \"We couldn't stay out of the debate because we are using all girls on the podium,\" Vuelta race director Javier Guillen told CNN by phone. \"But the first thing we want to keep is those jobs for those professional people who are doing very well,\" he said.\"We are not removing the ladies from the podium, but what we are doing is introducing a male host, we will combine a man and woman in an alternative way.\" Belgium cyclist Yves Lampaert celebrates on the podium after winning La Vuelta's second stage.Read MoreREAD: Why a race through Spain starts in FranceREAD: 'A man with no platform, is a lost man,' says ArmstrongGround-breakingAlthough Guillen stressed the move was a \"small change,\" the Vuelta is in fact the first of the so-called Grand Tours of cycling to end the decade-long tradition. The Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia continue using female hostesses to give the riders their prizes and flowers -- and often a peck on the cheek -- at the end of each stage.But at the start of the season, the UCI World Tour opener in Adelaide, Australia replaced its podium girls with junior cyclists on the request of the South Australian government, which partially paid for the race, Cycling Weekly reported at the time.

Have your say on our Facebook pageLanda added: \"This is a deeply rooted custom and nobody dares question it.\"And you have to admit that the women who go up on the podium are there because they are beautiful and have nice figures, and that's not the image you'd want to project,\" he said.Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a illustration.READ: Chris Froome bids to end 22-year wait in 'vicious' Vuelta a EspanaREAD: Is this the world's toughest bike race?'Elegant podium'Although Guillen emphasized the Vuelta podium is \"very elegant\" and has \"absolute dignity\" he said he didn't hesitate to make the change.\"When they say you have to introduce some men together with the women, it's something that we say, ok, no problem,\" said Guillen said.\"Because we have a stage for everybody. And this is something that is not bad for the race, I don't see anything bad to introduce these changes, so that's what we're doing, that's all.\"",

Its streets are frequented by drug dealers and occasional police presence.In the first two months of 2017, at least 182 people were killed during police operations in Rio's favelas -- a 78% increase on the same period in 2016, according to official figures, reported by Amnesty International.But Misenga, who ran away from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) team camp at the 2013 World Championships in Rio, remains eternally grateful the city gave him a home, helping him compete at the Summer Games last year. Read More\"My life really changed after the Olympics,\" Misenga told CNN. \"I have a good life now. I don't need to worry every day if I can feed my family. \"I've been supported by the IOC [International Olympic Committee] and Visa since last year,\" he added referring to the US financial services company.Popole Misenga in the Rio favela where he now calls home.Read: Rio refugee team a year onRescueJudo has given Misenga the life he has longed for since he was orphaned at the age of nine when his mother was killed.\"I was separated from my family when I was nine,\" said the 25-year-old. \"My mum got killed and I ran for days in the woods and I was rescued by UNICEF.\"It was at a training camp in the DRC that Misenga was first introduced to judo, where his robust physical frame caught the eye of the coaches.JUST WATCHEDLegends of judo: Teddy Riner, the best ever?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegends of judo: Teddy Riner, the best ever? 01:15He gradually rose up the ranks, although he confesses it was more under sufferance than because of any great love for the sport.\"I was entered for the national team but things were difficult back there,\" he says. \"They just wanted us to win medals and, if we failed, we would suffer.\"The DRC's Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment regarding Misenga's description of his treatment.Walking the streets in RioFour years ago in Rio, he finally saw the chance to escape. Another Congolese competitor, Yolande Mabika, made the decision to abscond from the team before returning to fetch Misenga a few days later.\"It was a very hard time,\" he says. \"I didn't have a home, money or food. Everything was missing in my life.\"I was hungry and it was a lot to suffer. So I decided to stay here, that I'm going to find a way, that someone will help me but I won't go home.\"The pair walked the streets until they met another refugee from Angola who introduced them to the Bras de Pina favela, and Misenga scraped around for any work he could get.That changed in 2015 when he was introduced to the Insituto Reac\u00e3o where he was invited to train by Brazilian judoka and Olympic bronze medalist Flavio Canot.The institute is run to help disenfranchised youth affected by poverty and crime. There, he benefited from the tutelage of the institute's co-founder and veteran Olympic coach Geraldo Bernardes.

        "content": "Barcelona (CNN)Police in Spain say they don't know the whereabouts of the suspected driver in the van attack in Barcelona that killed 13 people.Catalonia Police Chief Josep Luis Trapero told reporters Sunday that while the country's border with France had been reinforced, the suspect remained at large and could have eluded authorities.Speaking three days after a van plowed into pedestrians on Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona, killing 13 and injuring 120, Trapero said the search for Younes Abouyaaqoub was ongoing.Catalan regional police released this photo of suspect Younes Abouyaaqoub.\"If we knew that he was in Spain and where, we would go after him,\" Trapero said. \"We don't know where he is.\"Spanish media say Abouyaaqoub is a 22-year-old Moroccan national.Read MoreTrapero said police believe there was only one person inside the van that carried out the attack Thursday, though they are yet to confirm that person was Abouyaaqoub.He also said 12 terror suspects linked to the Barcelona attack did not have previous records or intelligence files related to terrorism.  A Spanish police officer deploys a \"spike strip\" at the border between La-Jonquera in northern Spain and Le-Perthus in southern France.United in griefThe news from police came hours after hundreds gathered at Barcelona's famous Sagrada Familia to mourn those killed. Spain's King Felipe VI  and Queen Letizia attend a mass to commemorate victims of the devastating terror attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia were among those who prayed for the 14 people killed in Barcelona and Cambrils.An American, three Italians and a Canadian are among the victims. On Sunday, Spanish authorities announced that a 7-year-old Australian-British boy was also killed. Julian Cadman was walking with his mother on Las Ramblas in Barcelona when the attacker's van veered into the crowd. His mother was injured and Julian had been reported missing until Sunday.The attack in Cambrils took place on Friday morning, when five attackers wearing fake suicide belts drove into pedestrians -- killing one and injuring six.Police shot all five assailants dead but said late Friday it was \"increasingly unlikely\" that the Barcelona driver was among them, Reuters reported.

Police released images of four suspects. Three are dead, but Younes Abouyaaqoub remains on the run.The terror cell involved in the attacks -- believed to number about 12 members -- has been \"completely dismantled,\" Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoida said Saturday.Eight of the 12 lived in Ripoll, a city north of Barcelona. Three were arrested, and one was Oukabir -- one of the dead suspects. Another arrest was made in the village of Alcanar. CNN reporters went to Oukabir's apartment in Ripoll. A neighbor, Raimon Garcia, said Oukabir was one of four siblings -- two brothers and two sisters. Oukabir's brother, Driss, was among those arrested. He turned himself into police when his identification was found in the Barcelona van, telling authorities he wasn't involved in the attack. A man who claimed to be a cousin of the brothers said Moussa Oukabir was \"brainwashed.\"A woman who lives next to a mosque in the neighborhood told CNN that she had witnessed the Oukabir brothers attending the place of worship \"every day for many years.\" Bulldozer clears rubble in AlcanarThe debris of a house in the village of Alcanar may hold clues about the terror cell's plans.The ruins of the house in Alcanar, a quiet beach town about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south of Barcelona, may hold the key to unraveling the plans and methods of the terror cell.Police said Sunday that the group inside the house had been planning for \"one or more\" attacks on Barcelona. The remains of two people have been found on the site so far, police said.Authorities suspect the property was being used as a base to make explosives that could have caused even more devastating attacks in Barcelona, Cambrils and possibly elsewhere had they not blown up prematurely.Explosives experts brought in a bulldozer Saturday to clear rubble before conducting a number of controlled explosions at the site in Alcanar's Montecarlo area.So far, police have found more than 100 of gas canisters on site.Bulldozer arrives #Alcanar to replace machine damaged yesterday in unexpected explosion at bomb-making factory connected to Barcelona attack pic.twitter.com/OUK8RBo71y\u2014 Sarah Tilotta (@stilotta) August 19, 2017\nThe city's vice mayor, Jordi Bort, told CNN the house belonged to a bank and that the group had been squatting there illegally without its knowledge.The town is home to a mix of yearlong residents and others who just spend holidays or weekends here, he said. Neighbors said they did not suspect any wrongdoing at the property.The septic tank of the house, which had only one floor, was used as storage for the tanks and explosives, Bort said.Source: Traces of TATP foundWednesday's explosion meant the attackers were unable to use material they were planning to deploy in the attacks, Trapero said Friday. The attack in Barcelona, capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia, was therefore \"more rudimentary than they originally planned,\" Trapero said. Trapero said the suspects in Alcanar had been trying to \"make explosives out of butane gas among other things.\" Source: Early assessment finds TATP at Barcelona attackers' bomb factoryA source briefed on the investigation said a preliminary assessment indicated there were traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble.TATP is made by adding an acid to a mixture of acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution and can easily result in accidental detonation if mistakes occur in the preparation.TATP was used in the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings and the May bombing in Manchester, England. Many of those who have successfully made TATP received some form of terrorist training.Inspector Albert Oliva, a spokesman for Catalan police, told CNN that investigators are still trying to determine what materials were in the home.\"We need to analyze carefully what caused the explosion, the elements that were inside the house,\" Oliva said. ISIS issued a formal claim of responsibility for the two attacks in Spain. However, the extremist group did not provide any proof it carried out the attacks or provide the names of the attackers or the number of them. There are also inconsistencies between ISIS' statement and the police version of events.CNN's Eliza Mackintosh reported from Barcelona, James Masters wrote from London.

        "content": "(CNN)Turkey may be using the multinational police organization Interpol to hunt down political opponents of the country's president abroad, a German government spokesman said Monday.The accusation follows the arrest and release of a prominent Turkish-German writer, the latest sign of the deterioration of ties between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Germany over what Germany perceives to be Turkey's interference in its political affairs.A 60-year-old critic of the Erdogan government, Dogan Akhanli was born in Turkey but has German citizenship. He was detained Saturday while on holiday in Spain. A resident of the western German city of Cologne since 1992, he was released Sunday after a court hearing, but on the condition that he remain in Madrid, according to his lawyer, Ilias Uyar.The warrant for his arrest was issued four years ago;  it is unclear why it has been acted upon now.  The reason for Akhanli's arrest was not immediately given, but Akhanli has written in the past about the mass killing of Armenians in Turkey in 1915. The subject is a controversial one in Turkey, which rejects the view of much of the international community that the killings constituted genocide.Jailed journalist remains 'patient' despite 150 days of solitary, wife saysInterpol calls itself the world's largest police organization. \"With 190 member countries, its primary role is to assist law enforcement agencies around the world in combating all forms of transnational crime and terrorism.\"Read MoreThe German government said it believes that Turkey is using its extradition treaty with Interpol to pursue Erdogan's opponents outside the country, the spokesman said Monday.A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"very glad\" that Akhanli has been released, but issued a warning to Turkey on the manner of the arrest. ''We must not allow the misuse of international organizations like Interpol,\" she said, marking a sharpening of her tone towards Ankara.Angela Merkel issued a stark warning to President Erdogan after the arrest and release of Dogan Akhanli.\"It would be bad if Turkey could ... have people who raise their voice against President Erdogan put in prison at the other end of Europe,\" Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a statement Sunday.It is not the first time Turkish authorities have acted against Akhanli, who was a political prisoner in Istanbul from 1985 to 1987, according to his website. He later fled to Germany and was granted refugee status. In 2010, Akhanli was remanded and spent several months in detention in Turkey before being released, according to his lawyer. Two years later, his acquittal was repealed. \"This arrest shows an attempt by Erdogan to extend his power beyond the borders of his country,\" Akhanli's lawyer Uyar said, \"and to act against those he doesn't like and who criticize him wherever they are in the world.\"\"We are happy,\" he wrote following news of Akhanli's release. \"Dogan Akhanli is free and Erdogan has not won.\"'Meddling,' arrests and Nazi comparisonsRelations with Turkey are a key battleground for Germany's political parties in the run-up to the federal election in September. Erdogan recently called for voters in Germany with Turkish origin to boycott the two biggest parties -- Merkel's CDU and the Social Democrats -- and the Green Party in the election, describing them as \"enemies of Turkey,\" according to CNN affiliate NTV. Turkish President Erdogan has \"left European values behind,\" accoring to German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel.Gabriel criticized Erdogan's \"crude meddling\" in the German election and was later personally attacked by the Turkish President. \"Who are you to speak with the President of Turkey?\" Erdogan said in a televised speech Saturday. \"Know your place.\"Turkey arrests 'threaten everyone,' says partner of detained German activistIn July, Turkish authorities arrested German human rights activist Peter Steudtner and nine others, charging them with \"committing crimes in the name of a terrorist organization without being a member.\" They remain in custody.Deniz Yucel, a German-Turkish journalist, was arrested in Turkey in February on charges of terror propaganda and has been held in solitary confinement for more than 170 days. The high-profile arrests have stoked fears that Turkey is holding German citizens as \"political hostages,\" according to Germany's Green Party co-chair Cem Ozdemir.Germany is demanding the unconditional release of both Yucel and Steudtner, threatening travel and trade restrictions in retaliation. In June, the German Foreign Ministry issued a warning to its citizens to exercise caution while traveling in Turkey, a popular destination for German tourists.\"Someone who detains law-abiding visitors to their country on the basis of outlandish, indeed absurd, accusations and throws them into prison has left European values behind,\" Gabriel said in July, while calling for Steudtner's release. \"We cannot continue as before.\"Erdogan will regret alienating Angela Merkel A few weeks earlier, an art installation in Berlin depicting Erdogan as a dictator -- installed to coincide with the G20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month -- was met with anger by Turkey's Foreign Ministry, which described it as \"a new example of rising racism and xenophobia in the country.\"Soon after, Turkey denied German parliamentarians from visiting troops, stationed in Turkey, who are participating in NATO operations in Syria.German authorities also prevented top politicians, including President Erdogan, from addressing Turkish rallies in the country in the lead up to the April 2017 referendum, a vote that handed Erdogan sweeping powers.In response, Erdogan likened the German government to that of Adolf Hitler. \"I thought that Nazism was over in Germany, but it turns out that it is still going on,\" he said. \"It is still going on, it is clear.\"CNN's Atika Schubert and Diana Macumba contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Alcanar, Spain (CNN)Nuria Gil had heard rumors of men squatting in a vacant property around the corner from her home, but she had never seen them herself.She had little reason to be suspicious -- the quiet Spanish beach village where she has lived for almost 20 years is filled with holiday houses. People come and go all the time.But on Wednesday night a deafening bang rocked Gil, 50, from her sleep. She ran outside to see smoke billowing from what remained of the property down the road. Armed police walk down a dirt road toward the scene of the explosion in Alcanar.The powerful explosion had leveled the one-story house in the Montecarlo neighborhood of Alcanar, leaving one person dead and another seriously injured.It wasn't until the following afternoon, when a van mowed down crowds of people in the heart of Barcelona, that authorities began to piece together the significance of the blast.    Read More     Center of investigationThe house in Alcanar is now at the center of a wide-ranging investigation into a previously unknown terror cell believed to be behind last week's attacks in the Catalan capital and in the coastal town of Cambrils.Police suspect the property was being used as a base to make explosives that could have caused even greater devastation, had they not blown up in what investigators believe was a premature explosion.A secondary uncontrolled blast on Thursday afternoon blew out a window in Gil's house and left rocks strewn across her yard.Standing on her front porch, tape from a police cordon fluttering nearby in the wind, Gil says she was shocked to learn that the suspects had been hiding in plain sight just meters away. Gil, standing under a palm tree in her front yard, says she can't imagine why the suspects chose her neighborhood as their home base.Rocks lie on Gil's manicured lawn -- scattered debris from the explosion.\"It was a surprise and we were very scared,\" says Gil. \"It's a good community, very tranquil, we never thought we would have terrorists here.\"She is exhausted following days of controlled explosions in the neighborhood, conducted by authorities as part of their investigation.  \"I feel very tired, it's a feeling of being powerless ... angry,\" Gil says, tears welling up in her eyes. \"This is the first time something of this magnitude has happened and I hope it's the last.\"An ambulance is seen through a neighbor's front lawn, where a hose dangles in a half-empty pool.The ideal locationThe municipality of Alcanar, 120 miles southwest along the coast from Barcelona, is made up of a string of sleepy beach towns, home to around 9,000 people -- a mix of year-long residents and others who spend the occasional weekend here.The tourists who pass through each summer are drawn to a sandy coastline dotted with orange groves and olive trees.For the suspects believed to be part of the terror cell, it offered an ideal location to plot their attacks away from prying eyes. Alcanar's vice-mayor, Jordi Bort, told CNN that the house the men were squatting in was owned by a bank, which did not know that people were residing there illegally. The house's septic tank was used as storage for the explosives, Bort said.A source briefed on the investigation said a preliminary assessment indicated there were traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble. Used in recent terror attacks across Europe, including those in Brussels and Manchester, TATP can easily result in accidental detonation if mistakes are made during its preparation.Police said Friday there were other \"biological remains\" found at the site, but it is unclear whether they belong to someone other than the one person confirmed dead.Jordi Bort, Alcanar's vice-mayor, stands in an olive grove near the bombmaking site.Red Cross set up a tent to support residents and tourists impacted by the blast.The roof of the nearby Hostal Montecarlo overlooks homes that were damaged in the explosion, their facades pockmarked and windows blown out. Bikers buzz past the scene of the investigation on the coastal road as armed police patrol the area. On the other side of the hotel, facing the sea, a pool sits idle. Inside the hotel, Cristina Bolz is standing behind the bar making espressos for a handful of journalists and tourists.Bolz, who has been working at Hostal Montecarlo for nearly 40 years, says that local residents frequent the hotel for drinks, mingling with tourists. A policewoman picks up debris in the olive grove surrounding the bomb site.The pool at Hostal Montecarlo, across the street from the blast site, sits empty. A few people sit at tables in the hotel's restaurant, watching the news, which is broadcasting the latest updates on the investigation.\"It's a small town, quiet, relaxing,\" Bolz says, in between taking orders. \"People are very nice.\"Cristina Bolz, originally from Germany, says she called the police after hearing the explosion Wednesday.Hills border the coastal municipality of Alcanar, known for its agriculture, fishing and tourism. Tourists react It's precisely the type of atmosphere that the Schenks -- tourists from Stuttgart, Germany -- were seeking when they booked a three-week holiday in Alcanar.Unknown to them, the Schenks' rental was just a few doors down from the suspects' property. They were sitting in their living room on Wednesday night when the blast rattled their rental home.\"We saw two big fire balls and heard a loud boom,\" Juliane Schenk, 17, says.\"It's been an adventure holiday,\" her mother Sabine adds with a cautious laugh.A taxi driver watches a press conference with Spanish authorities broadcast on a television in Hostal Montecarlo.A boy calls to his campanions from a ledge overlooking Les Cases d'Alcanar port, the southernmost point of Catalunya.Less than a mile down the road, retirees sunbathe and children play soccer on Playa Cementera, a beach that lies in the shadow of an imposing cement factory. When the explosion went off four days ago, many people here immediately assumed the factory was the source.Josep Romera, 30, and Elena Gonzalez, 36, are playing in the surf with their four-year-old son.They came to Alcanar for a getaway.\"This is a quiet area, more quiet than the area where we live in Girona, the beaches are very touristic there,\" Romera says.Josep Romera and Elena Gonzalez took their son to Alcanar for a peaceful family holiday.Romera and Gonzalez' 4-year-old son sketches in the sand on Playa Cementera.In the wake of the blast, Romera says that Alcanar's annual eight-day Festa Major has been canceled. The local festival, popular among tourists and which boasts its own running of the bulls, was shutdown as a precaution following the spate of attacks. \"It is very sad what happened in Barcelona and what happened here, and it is very scary,\" Romera says. \"There is fear... a lot of fear... it can happen here, there... you never know.\"",

They were not allowed to wear Nazi attire and display a swastika, the Nazi symbol.Funereal music played from a truck as the right-wing demonstrators marched to the prison site.Anti-fascist counterprotesters chanted \"war criminal\" at demonstrators, shouted \"all Berlin hates the police\" and advanced toward officers. Residents played loud music from balconies countering the demonstrators, such as a Michael Jackson song declaring, \"It don't matter if you're black or white.\"A black woman held up a sign with a heart, prompting neo-Nazis to shout \"go home.\" She replied, \"Berlin is my home.\" Charlottesville: A monumental week of debate over the nation's identityIn contrast with the restrictions in Germany, US law protects the right of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to hold public rallies and express their views openly.Cities across the United States are bracing for a wave of far-right rallies in the coming days. Local and federal law enforcement officials have expressed concern about the potential for more violence.At the Charlottesville rally last week, anti-Semitic and racist chants echoed through the city, and people openly marched with arms. Those demonstrators and anti-fascist counterprotesters skirmished. One counterprotester -- Heather Heyer -- was killed when a car rammed into a crowd of people; an Ohio man was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in her death.",

The source stressed the assessment was preliminary. TATP is made by adding an acid to a mixture of acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution and can easily result in accidental detonation if mistakes are made in preparation.  Spain attacks could have been bigger, police sayIt is a high explosive that is much more powerful than that used in the April 2013 Boston bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 250 others.  TATP was used in the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings, the May Manchester bombing and a failed bomb attempt by an Islamist extremist at the Gare Centrale in Brussels in June.

Officers took a suspect into custody after shooting him in the leg, police said. Friday night, state broadcaster YLE reported police had taken several other suspects into custody.Police have not revealed a motive and said it was too early to tell whether the attack was terror-related. \"We have a heightened awareness level of terrorism currently, but we did not have any specific threats to act upon,\" Turku Superintendent Stephan Sundqvist told CNN.The attack prompted police to boost patrols across the country, and security has been tightened at the Helsinki-Vantaa airport and train stations. Police said on Twitter that they were also patrolling a shopping mall.Read MoreFinnish Interior Minister Paula Risikko told YLE the identity of the attacker was still unknown.'There was blood everywhere'The attack occurred around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) at two marketplaces close to each other in the city center -- Kauppatori, known in English as Central Market Square, as well as the Puutori Market Square, police said. Kent Svensson, 44, of Sweden said he witnessed a man with \"a huge white knife\" running and stabbing people in his path.A body covered in a white sheet was photographed at the attack site. \"It was really horrible. We were sitting on a terrace just next to the square and this woman just screamed like hell and this guy was standing in front of her with a huge knife just stabbing people,\" he said. \"There was blood everywhere,\" he said, adding that he saw a victim lying on the ground.An emegency team cordons off the attack site on Friday.Finnish media published photographs of the attack site, and one showed a body covered with a white sheet. Others showed a small crowd around someone apparently bleeding on a cobblestone road and several ambulances around a cordoned-off area.Three people are now undergoing surgery, YLE reported, citing hospital sources.Police warned the public to stay away from the city center.Mayor urges calmTurku sits on the coast around 140 kilometers (around 85 miles) west of the capital, Helsinki. With a population of about 185,000, it's an important business and cultural center.     Police officers help evacuate someone after the attack.Sundqvist said police were on the scene within a few minutes of the first reports of the stabbings.\"There was only one shot fired and the aggressor was apprehended and brought to hospital,\" he said.The mayor of Turku, Aleksi Randell, said the city center appears to be safe now and urged citizens to remain calm.\"I want to say this to all our residents: It is difficult to understand that such violence would happen on this scale in Turku,\" he said in a statement posted on the city website. Occurrences that have been all too frequent in Europe and around the world have now arrived here, which is what (we've) been afraid of.\"The Finnish government convened Friday to discuss the attack and condemned it.\"The act is utterly deplorable and an exceptionally serious violent offense in the Finnish context -- it is deeply shocking for us all,\" Prime Minister Juha Sipil\u00e4 said on the government website.CNN's Lindsay Isaac, Schams Elwazer and Natalie Gallon contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Spain saw one of its most violent days in recent memory as a spate of incidents throughout the country appeared to be connected to a terror attack Thursday in Barcelona that left 13 people dead and more than 100 injured.Authorities said they are working under the assumption that two other deadly events, a terrorist incident in the seaside city of Cambrils and a house explosion farther down the coast in Alcanar, were linked to the van attack in Barcelona that had ISIS taking credit.Also Thursday, two police officers in Barcelona were hurt when they were hit by a car, but police were unsure whether that was related to the other incidents.The deadly events began in the early evening with a van plowing through crowds on the renowned Las Ramblas avenue, a popular tourist section of Barcelona. Authorities said of the 80 people taken to hospitals, 15 were seriously hurt.As police searched for the van driver, Spain's Prime Minister called it an act of \"jihadi terrorism.\"     Read MoreHere are the latest developments in a tragic day: \u2022 Two suspects -- one from Morocco, one from the Spanish enclave of Melilla --  were arrested in connection with the Barcelona attack, Catalan Police Chief Josep Lluis Trapero said.\u2022 One suspect in the Barcelona attack is on the run. \"The driver abandoned the van and escaped from the area,\" Trapero said. \u2022 About 115 kilometers to the southwest, there was a second attack early Friday.  Catalan police tweeted that five suspected terrorists were killed in Cambrils. Emergency officials said six civilians and a police officer were injured. \u2022 One person was killed in an explosion at a house in Alcanar, around 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Barcelona.\u2022 Catalan police said early Friday they are \"working under the hypothesis that the terrorists taken down in Cambrils were related to the events that took place in Barcelona and Alcanar.\" \u2022 A driver ran over two police officers at a security checkpoint in Barcelona, police said, and the driver was found near the city. The two officers suffered minor injuries and did not need hospital treatment, police said. It was unclear whether that incident was related to the terror attack. \u2022 ISIS' media wing, Amaq, said the perpetrators of the Barcelona attack were \"soldiers of the Islamic State.\" However, ISIS has not explicitly claimed responsibility. The Barcelona attack was one of the most deadly in Spain since more than 190 people were killed in a March 2004 attack against commuter trains.

Compare that to most major European leagues which run over nine months.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThen there are the considerable geographical challenges Greenland faces in putting on football matches. The country is as big as Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium combined but only 20% of the country is habitable.Moreover 80% of the country is ice sheet, the second largest in the world following Antarctica. There is also no flat land, few suitable grass areas and for nine months of the year no football can be played outside as the pitches are covered by nearly two meters of snow.The vast distances between cities and unpredictable weather conditions make travel at times near impossible, even in the summer, ensuring organizing games can be problematic.

There are currently 5,000 players in Greenland, that's 10% of the population.This year was the 47th year of the championships in its modern guise but up until 2016 football in Greenland was played on pitches of sand and rock. Which meant teams' physiotherapists were kept busy. It wasn't unusual for there to be several broken legs, noses, arms and various other bones after each game. It was actually expected and still people played.\"It was just basically a hard sand pitch,\" Johannes Groth, the captain of defending champions B-67 told CNN Sport. \"Sometimes there were big rocks so when you played hard it would hurt very much.\"   \"It was really dusty so we had to water the pitch just so we could control the ball,\" added B-67 midfielder Patrick Frederiksen. \"It was difficult to play on as you were never sure where the ball would land or bounce.\"The pitch was even worse for goalkeepers said former G-44 captain Johan Frederik Zeeb, who won the championship in 2013. \"In order to be a goalkeeper on those pitches you really had to give your full self,\" he said.\"You had to have several layers of clothing to be a goalkeeper on dirt ground. You got a lot of scratches all over your body.\"Even today many players choose to wear gloves and leggings to protect their bodies, a hangover from the dirt pitches they grew up on.

It has been a great success. \"It's a long journey but we've started it,\" added M\u00f8ller. \"The future of Greenland football is bright.\"READ: Ronaldo banned for five gamesDisko IslandThis year's tournament was played in Qeqertarsuaq on Disko Island.

If it's got the feeling of the land that time forgot, Greenland will always stand out for the brevity of its season.To qualify for one of the eight spots in the week-long tournament, 40 teams from all over the country competed in regional qualifiers during July.No wonder it's called the beautiful game ...READ: Female footballers break world record for highest ever football matchThe final took place between B-67, from the capital city of Nuuk, who had won the tournament six out of the previous seven years and their city rivals IT-79.It was a tense affair that threatened to be a rout at times as B-67 missed chance after chance, but their gung-ho tactics left them exposed at the back to IT-79's counterattacking football and after extra-time the score was tied at 2-2. Peri Fleischer was the man who made history, scoring the winning penalty to secure IT-79's first ever title. \"This is the club's first championship and it means everything to us,\" IT-79 captain Kaasannguaq Zeeb told CNN. \"Many of the players are crying, it's very emotional for us.\"The club only started up again in 2014 with only about four or five players.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)Bleary-eyed Barcelona residents left their apartments for work early Friday, as backpack-toting tourists began a day of sightseeing in the seaside city, a day after Spain was hit by its deadliest attack in years. As the sun rose, locals in Las Ramblas peered out from behind their shutters, onto the promenade where a white van mowed down crowds of people Thursday afternoon, killing at least 13 and injuring more than 100.In the outdoor caf\u00e9s below, full glasses of beer and sangria from the evening before were still on tables, left behind as people scattered in panic. Hours after the police cordon in the area was lifted, waiters began to pick up the pieces, righting overturned chairs and clearing away debris.Tables and chairs at pavement cafes on Las Ramblas offer hints to the chaos that erupted here, prompting visitors enjoying an early evening drink to scatter in panic.Vendors were beginning to set up shop in the tourist hotspot known for its bustling market, just as they do every morning, laying out glossy fashion magazines, organizing souvenir Sagrada Familia key rings, and folding red and blue Barcelona football club jerseys.Federico Colmenarejo, 32, was walking around Las Ramblas in a daze, his hair rumpled, a coffee mug in hand.Read More\"How is it possible that I cross this street every day on my way to work? I can't believe it. In Barcelona this never happens,\" said Colmenarejo, who lives just a stone's throw from Las Ramblas.One of his friends was walking on the street with his young daughter when the van sped by yesterday, plowing into pedestrians. He sent Colmenarejo horrific footage of the scene, showing bodies strewn on the busy street.Mourners have begun leaving flowers, candles and heartfelt messages at the spot on Las Ramblas where the attacker's rampage came to an end.\"I was at home when it happened. My grandmother rang me on Skype -- she normally calls once a month,\" Colmenarejo said. \"It was right at that moment that it happened. I started to hear strange sounds and saw people running away from my balcony.\"He says the call from his grandmother saved his life.READ MORE: Barcelona attack: What we know so farEarly Friday, local residents and tourists congregated near the city's Liceu subway station, at La Boqueria Market, where the driver's rampage ended. A line of people formed to lay flowers and light candles at a makeshift memorial on the large mosaic by Spanish artist Joan Miro. One family left roses at the scene before walking away, tears in their eyes.Miren Stillitani lives near the spot where the van stopped its deadly rampage. She spends a lot of time in Las Ramblas, going for dinner or drinks after work.Miren Stillitani, 30, looked on in stunned silence.\"I feel empty,\" Stillitani, who lives in a side-street just off of Pla\u00e7a Boqueria, told CNN. \"I feel insulted. It's like the feeling of someone spitting on you.\"Stillitani said she was at work when the attack happened, just a minute's walk from her apartment.\"I was in a meeting and everyone started looking at their phones ... The first thing I did was to call my boyfriend because he was home. Luckily he was safe,\" she said.The couple spends most evenings in the lively neighborhood, often going to dinner or grabbing drinks on the popular promenade after work.\"In this neighborhood I felt quite safe,\" Stillitani said. \"I thought it wouldn't be a target because there are also tourist places like Sagrada Familia. You hear about these things but you don't think they're going to happen to you.\"\"But my everyday life is not going to change because of this ... we must go on.\"READ MORE: Manhunt after 14 die in day of terrorAngel Toscano works at a newsstand in the Ramblas market, but wasn't there when the attacker struck Thursday aftenoon.Angel Toscano, 44, works at a news and souvenir stand in the Ramblas market. Standing behind stacks of FC Barcelona scarves, he's there every day from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., and clocked out as usual on Thursday, just hours before the attack.\"I knew this was going to happen for a long time,\" Toscano said as he set up a rack of bracelets and laid out the morning's newspapers, their front pages splashed with news of the attack.\"There are thousands of people here every day. It's a very easy target. If you want to kill people with a car, this is the place to do it.\"That refrain is echoed by others here, who say Las Ramblas was not secure enough to fend off an attack like this. They cite a lack of barriers at the street's entrance, and the sheer number of tourists who flock to the market.Cristiano Grazioli lives a stone's throw from Las Ramblas. He was at home at the time of yesterday's attack and hadn't emerged since.\"I've always said it's a really easy place to attack,\" local resident Cristiano Grazioli, 34, said. \"There are no protections around Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya.\"Grazioli, who lives just around the corner from Las Ramblas, came, skateboard in hand, to see for himself what had happened so close to home.\"This is my quarter. I know a lot of people here. I have a lot of friends that live around here,\" he said. \"I am running through a lot of emotions.\"Grazioli skates up Las Ramblas every morning to get to work in nearby Gracia, where he is a chef in a tapas bar. The neighborhood is host to one of Barcelona's biggest summer street festivals -- it was cancelled last night -- one of a number of events called off in the wake of the attack.Barcelona, Europe's top cruise port, played host to some 9 million overnight guests in 2016, along with millions more who visited the city on daytrips.

They originally planned to stay in the city for six days, but are now considering cutting their trip short. The couple was touring the city's port at the time of yesterday's attack. On Friday morning, after waking up to news of a second attack overnight in Cambrils, some 70 miles from Barcelona, they came to pay their respects on Las Ramblas.\"Yesterday I told my husband I was worried that wearing a hijab, people here would think I agree with what happened. But this doesn't represent me,\" Rania, who declined to give her last name, said. \"The feeling of insecurity is terrible for all people.\"READ MORE: Barcelona attacks: Latest updatesMirta Kisak Koch, 35, moved to Barcelona from Croatia a few years ago. She said she, her children and their dog cross the lively thoroughfare at least six times a day on their way to the park or to go grocery shopping.She said she had long expected the city to be targeted -- but hadn't expected terrorists to strike quite so close to home.\"This is Barcelona, it was bound to happen,\" she said. \"But it's a different thing when it happens on your doorstep.\"\"I don't think this will stop but we have to learn how to live with it.\"",

        "content": "Hamburg, Germany  (CNN)Julia Reusing stood teary eyed under a strip of halogen lights in Hamburg's red light district as the late summer sun's lingering light turned to dusk.Standing in front of the 27-year-old Frankfurt native on Thursday evening, were a group of anti-capitalist protesters -- frustrated after their \"Welcome to Hell\" demonstration was interrupted.  Clashes between riot police and demonstrators started shortly after the \"Welcome to Hell\" rally began on Thursday evening.Police, who had contained the crowd with tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons, said they were responding to violent protesters, known as the Black Bloc, who had shown up with their faces and heads completely covered. Reusing said the police would have intervened regardless, using any small incident as a catalyst to shut the protest down.\"If this is all we can do just for showing our opinion and giving a statement -- and if the state forces are just shutting us up... I mean what kind of state do we live in,\" she said.Read MoreHamburg police told CNN that a full assessment of the overall police response at the anti-G20 demonstrations would come at a later time.Julia Reusing, 27: \"Revolution must not be full of agression. Revolution means love -- not to come together and fight.\"\"Welcome to Hell\" was the first of over 30 planned demonstrations in the days before, during and after the G20 Summit. Hamburg Police said overall 476 officers were injured, at least 186 protesters were arrested and 225 detained over the three days. In total, 20,000 police officers were deployed throughout the summit.When German Chancellor and G20 host Angela Merkel announced her hometown of Hamburg as the summit's location, some feared that the city and its 1.8 million residents would suffer.The security required to welcome world leaders such as US President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan would be disruptive to residents and businesses. But Merkel pressed ahead. At the same time, demonstrators from across Germany and further afield prepared to exercise their right to assemble.Up to 12,000 people attended the  anti-G20 protest, \"Welcome to Hell.\"Authorities implemented a \"Red-Zone\" an area sectioned off to all but the G20 leaders and their convoys and administrators. Twenty-five-year-old student Merle M., who declined to give her last name and was protesting over migration rights, told CNN the \"Red Zone\" demonstrated that leaders were \"trying to delete the right to protest.\"The rally called for solidarity amongst anti-capitalist leftist groups. On Friday morning, a coalition of protest groups organized as \"Block G20 -- Colour the Red Zone\" attempted to break through into the restricted area. Group organizer and political scientist Alexis Passadakis, 40, told CNN that the aim of the protest was \"disturb the summit.\"Passadakis said the G20 is \"illegitimate with no basis in international law. We don't want a partnership of governance where there's a complete lack of transparency.\"\"It's got no effective climate change policy, are blocking migrants saafe routes... and oh, the austerity!\" he said.G20: World leaders at odds with Trump on trade, climateProtestors attempting to cross through the \"Red Zone\" barrier are chased by riot police on Friday.Throughout the day, groups of around 50 people attempted to cross into the \"Red Zone\" -- many staging sit-ins that included singing, chalk-drawing and bubble blowing with other groups drumming and chanting. Local residents handed out coffee to the demonstrators. Some of the groups who staged sit-in protests were pelted with water cannons before being removed forcibly by police. On Friday afternoon, scores of people met at the Millerntorplatz where anti-capitalist and anti-fascist groups from Italy and France gathered among German protesters for what briefly felt like a rave.Singing, chanting and drumming was heard throughout the march.Eventually, it descended into a chaotic game of cat-and-mouse -- violent protesters hurled stones, bricks and bottles at riot police who responded with sound blasts and tear gas.Thousands of anti-capitalist groups from across Europe gathered in Hamburg's Millerntorplatz before the rally turned violent.Caught in the middle of the skirmish was 77-year-old Hamburg resident Karsten Alpers and his bed-bound wife Halgard, who he had brought outside for their daily stroll.Amidst a crowd of protesters running from riot police, Alberts told CNN that although he wasn't informed where the protests would go, he wasn't worried about the demonstrations and wanted to go about his day as normal.Karsten Alpers, wife Halgard and her carer Karina Stanczak were caught up in the skirmishes on Friday.\"For Hamburg, the G20 is a wonderful idea but for the real people living here, it's a hard thing -- there's traffic and it's impossible to get around. These people won't damage anything -- they are peaceful. We are not scared,\" he said.Verena Zech, 47, who was walking her dogs during the \"Colour the Red Zone\" demonstration, said the G20 restrictions in the city had prevented her from getting to work. 15,000 riot police were initially deployed for the summit but on Friday, Hamburg Police called for additional support. \nAlthough her routine was disrupted, Zech said she didn't mind the demonstrations themselves, but called on the German government to give more information about the cost of hosting the summit.The insurance worker added that her neighbors had experienced \"angst\" over violent clashes that were broadcast on television from Thursday night's protests and from Friday morning, where masked protesters had set cars on fire in an upscale neighborhood in western Hamburg.Police used water cannons to disperse a crowd of protestors in central Hamburg on Thursday.As dusk fell Friday, activists returned to the Reeperbahn, where protesters from the LGBTI+ community, anarchists and other members of the left enjoyed three separate music events. Some moved barefoot through the square -- cutting through a wafting pungent smell of cannabis and cigarette smoke as Lou Reed's \"Perfect Day\" blared from a loudspeaker.Further down the street, anarchists and members of splinter left groups bounced heads to a socialist-styled hip-hop performance.Later, a van that had been driven from southern Germany spun electronic music from its roof; a sizeable chunk of the crowd swaying their bodies as blinking lights from water cannon trucks flashed directly in front of them.Electronic music was the soundtrack to a late night dance party at Reeperbahn, where activists created a human peace sign in front of water cannons parked in front of the rally.But a mile away in the Sternschanze district, riots broke out for a second night in a row.From dusk until dawn Saturday, a group of anarchists and radical left-wing protesters set alight scaffolding, building supplies and trash cans across a four-block radius.Anarchists started fires in the Sternschanze district on Friday.Police responded with tear gas and water cannons as demonstrators continued to fuel multiple fires across the area with whatever scraps they could find.As the riots grew, retail shops were looted and a supermarket was burned out. At one point, anarchists poured stolen champagne onto a crackling fire as other demonstrators stood topless, waving their water soaked t-shirts dry over the heat. Multiple shops were looted and destroyed.While fires raged, leaving parts of the Sternschanze looking like a war zone, a few streets away party goers drank beer and cycled through empty streets freed of traffic.As the G20 summit drew to a close on Saturday, an eclectic mix of up to 50,000 activists, according to police, moved through the city's sun-filled streets, shaking off Friday night's hangover with each step.Two separate groups marched parallel to one another during the day, with a markedly different dynamic in comparison to the previous day's rallies. The marches saw LGBTI+ groups, Marxist collectives, migration lawyers, Chinese human rights activists, Kurdish independence movements, feminist organizations and environmental activists walking peacefully alongside one another with riot police leading the way.Kurds advocating for an independent state demonstrated at one of the rallies on Saturday.Couples with sunflower crowns held hands and barefooted activists picnicked on the pavement.Some families traveled into the city center on tandem bikes to listen to anti-G20 speeches at a stage by the harborside Fischmarkt -- where the first skirmishes had kicked off just days before. Carolin Wolter, a 25-year-old office worker, arrived to the harbor with young daughter Levke as Nina Simone's anthem \"Sinnerman\" played between talks on climate change.22,000 protestors, including many environmental activists marched through central Hamburg on Saturday. A separate demonstration also moved through the city at the same time.Wolter said she's worried about the decisions that G20 leaders such as Trump are making about the environment, claiming their profit before people policies will inevitably lead to a bleak future.\"(The environment is) the first main important issue to speak about, especially for my daughter, whose future lies in the decision of these leaders,\" Wolter said. \"And that worries me.\"As the US President and other leaders left the summit on Saturday, police officers took off their helmets and let out a long exhale, telling CNN the atmosphere had finally relaxed.For the protesters, concerned that they'd seen little at the G20 to assuage their concerns, their campaigns continue.",

Clearly, they had been mowed down,\" he said. \"I saw blood and didn't know what their condition was. I should have checked but what could I have done?\"In the shop, \"people were shaking, kids screaming. It was complete panic,\" he said. He said he then heard several gunshots, and one shot appeared to hit the metal shutters. About 10 minutes later, he left the shop through a back door. \"The streets were just weirdly ordinary and it was like people didn't know what had happened yet,\" he said.'You are never going to feel safe in the world'Valerie Istre, an American tourist from Dallas, Texas, was shopping on Las Ramblas avenue when her friend suddenly dropped and broke her sunglasses. Seconds after they walked into a clothing store to buy a new pair, the attackers struck.\"At first, we had no idea what was happening,\" said Istre. \"We didn't speak the language. We knew it was bad and people looked scared. It was very surreal. You didn't know if it was just the van or if people were going to come in with guns.\"Istre was immediately phoned by a cousin who works as a news reporter in Dallas. He was able to explain what was happening.\"Some of us gathered toward the back around a storage room with a lock on the door,\" Istre said. \"The plan was to run inside and lock the door if needed.\"Istre estimates there were 75 people in the store, mostly tourists. \"People were crying, really freaking out. It was really scary.\"Afraid they were going to die, many of the patrons began texting family members to say goodbye.\"I didn't know if I would ever see my three kids again,\" said Istre. \"I sent my 12-year-old daughter a photo I had recently taken of me. I told her I loved her, but didn't say anything was wrong. I wanted her to have a nice, last picture of me in case something happened.\"Istre remained holed up in the store with the other patrons for three hours until police came to escort them out.\"Had my friend not dropped her sunglasses, we could have been hurt. It was very, very, very surreal,\" said Istre.\"It makes you want to go home and hug your kids,\" she said. \"But I also think it's this realization that you are never going to feel safe in the world we live in. It literally could happen any time and any place. You just don't know.\"CNN's Darran Simon and Nadeem Muaddi contributed to this report.",

This is being dubbed a par 14,000. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAdam Rolston, a scratch golfer, and Ron Rutland, serving as his caddy, are bidding for a world record. They started their journey across Mongolia in late June and hope to finish in September. Each has his own individual challenges. Rolston is hitting between 160 and 180 shots a day, and prior to the trip was working to harden the skin on his hands to prevent them from blistering.And Rutland, an adventure junkie who has previously cycled unsupported from his native South Africa to England, is tasked with hauling a 100 kg cart of equipment, including food, water, camping essentials and, most inconvenient of all, extra golf balls.Read More    We have now\u26f3 golfed \u26f3over 1000km!

It's not,' says SpiethHot temperature, early starts, and dehydrationIt all started when the pair met in Kenya and Rolston, inspired after hearing of Rutland's epic bike ride, suggested they embark on a golfing adventure. Their record attempt, which is raising money for sports charity Laureus, isn't your average golf trip. Mongolia's diverse landscape and changeable climate couldn't be further from cozy clubhouses and manicured greens.\"The variety of weather makes it tough,\" says Rutland. \"Obviously it's summer, but at the beginning, at the most Westerly point, it's pretty much rock and glaciers -- very cold, with snow on the ground.

We've spent a bit of money on dehydrated camping food that lean towards the vegan side of things. \"It will be a little bit trickier for me. It's more about making sure I get enough calories, but I think it's the lack of variety that might get to me in the end.\"'Mongolians love golf; they just don't know it yet'As of the end of the July, the pair had completed 766 km of their 1,850 km journey, with the end target of Mt Bogd Golf Club in the country's capital, Ulaanbaatar, getting closer each day.  \"We actually putt out on the 18th hole of Mongolia's only golf club,\" says Rolston. \"We're taking a putter the whole way just to finish off at that one moment -- a bit of useless kit we're going to carry for 82 days.\"Golf is a relatively unknown sport among the Mongolian people, and the sight of two men clubbing a small white ball across their homeland has unsurprisingly generated interest. The pair make their way across the sparse Mongolian plains. \"They don't know about golf, but they absolutely love it,\" says Rolston. \"The first time we came to Mongolia -- we did a sort of recce trip -- and everyone's eyes seem to light up when you drop a white ball. They're super curious. \"You put this white ball into the sky and they just want to have a go.

And while he likely doesn't want to have the same fate as Colin Kaepernick -- who is without an NFL team -- the Seattle Seahawks defensive end is taking social action.\"I can't stand for the national anthem,\" Bennett, who is 31 and in his ninth NFL season, told CNN on Tuesday. \"I can't stand right now. I'm not going to be standing until I see the equality and freedom.\"Following the events that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, Bennett on Sunday took a public stance: He sat on the team's bench with a towel on his head as the national anthem was played before a preseason game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Carson, California. He later said that what happened in Charlottesville \"had a lot to do with\" what he did.Why athletes are getting more political in the age of TrumpBennett, who grew up in Texas, told CNN that seeing what happened in Charlottesville reminded him of the dragging death of James Byrd, and that it left him in disbelief.\"I grew up around that, listening and remembering those things, and thinking about Charlottesville brought back those memories,\" Bennett said. \"It actually brought tears to my eyes to see people fighting and having to hate for somebody because of their color. I couldn't believe it took (President Donald Trump) 48 hours to respond. I thought he would have responded within seconds. And when he came on, I thought he should have handled it just as fast as when he's tweeting about Russia or something.\"Read MoreBennett, whose father served in the Navy, said he isn't protesting the American flag, nor is his protest against the military.\"I'm actually not dishonoring the contributions that they made, if somebody loses their life,\" Bennett said. \"I'm actually trying to honor that.\"Bennett also said that he wants more people to join him \"and fight for what's right.\"Bennett reacts after a sack during the second half against the Detroit Lions in the NFC Wild Card game at CenturyLink Field on January 7 in Seattle.\"At this point, I think if you're being silent, you're being dishonest,\" Bennett told CNN. \"And we can be silenced no more because we're living in this reality where I can't hide behind the logo on my helmet. I can't hide behind the shield. I can't hide behind the glamor and glitz of the NFL.\"\"There's a reality that I'm a black man in America, and there's things that are going on pertaining to minorities, pertaining to women, pertaining to kids, pertaining to religion, and we can't be hiding behind it,\" he continued. \"We're fighting for what America is built on: That's the freedom, the equality, the justice for all and the liberty, and those are the things that I'm actually trying to remember and honor when I sit down for the flag.\"Do you think more athletes should protest? Have your say on CNN Sport's Facebook page.Last year, Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, became a lightning rod when he refused to stand during the national anthem, saying he didn't want to \"show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\"His sitting, which later turned to kneeling, drew fierce criticism but sparked a national movement. Other athletes, from elementary schools to professional leagues, followed his lead.Ravens owner says 'pray for us' over possibility of signing Colin KaepernickKaepernick still doesn't have a job as an NFL quarterback. But that hasn't deterred all NFL players from following his lead this season. In addition to Bennett, Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch -- a former teammate of Bennett's -- sat during the anthem ahead of Oakland's preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday.On Tuesday, Bennett spoke at length about Kaepernick.\"I think Colin Kaepernick was one of the best fighters in sports history for ... equality in my generation,\" Bennett said. \"I think people thought that it would go away because he was out of the NFL, but it's still going on.\"And there's still a fight going on. There's still racism going on. There's still social inequality going on. Just because he's out of it doesn't mean the fight is not gone. Because people figure that we're athletes that we shouldn't be a part of that message, they think we're not that black. We're another category. But I'm in the same category.\"\"If I'm not in Seattle, if I'm driving through Idaho or some other place where people don't know me for being who I am,\" he continued, \"I could be judged on the color of my skin. ... Kaepernick led us to remember that, and I think we can't let that message die.Michael Bennett boycotts trip, says he won't be used by Israel\"We've got to continuously fight the good fight, and that's the fight for everybody to have equality, everybody to have freedom. I think that fight is something we all should be fighting. I wish more players would stand up and say what they really believe, because this is the truth that we all believe, but I think everybody is fearful of what would happen.\"Nobody wants to be Kaepernick. If silence is what we have to do -- I can't do it anymore.\"Bennett entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent with the Seahawks on April 26, 2009, and later was claimed by Tampa Bay off waivers on Oct. 12, 2009. Bennett, who played for the Buccaneers from 2009-2012, signed with the Seahawks as an unrestricted free agent on March 15, 2013. He re-signed a multi-year contract with the team on March 10, 2014.During Seattle's postseason Super Bowl XLVIII championship run, Bennett tied for team lead with 1.5 postseason sacks and had two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.Bennett, who attended high school in Houston, played college football at Texas A&M.

The manifesto calls for the immediate closure of Germany's borders and describes the presence of five million Muslims in Germany as \"a big danger for our state, our society and our values.\"For many German politicians, immigration is seen as a way to counteract the low birth rate in Germany. But in their manifesto, the AfD issues a stark warning about the German \"trend towards self-abolition\" and promises to support \"traditional\" families: \"father, mother and children.\"\"New Germans? We'll make them ourselves,\" reads one official campaign poster.Current polls suggest the AfD could win 7% to 10% of the vote in September, an improvement on its 2013 result. The party is battling with the Greens and the Left Party to be the third-largest party in the Bundestag after Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democrats, led by Merkel's challenger, Martin Schulz. These projections suggest a loss of support for the party since last year, however, when a series of terror attacks in Germany boosted support for the anti-Islam party to 15%.",

        "content": "Story highlightsEnglish Premier League turns 25First season featured no players from South America or AsiaNow the world's most diverse division (CNN)It's been dubbed the \"best league in the world,\" but when the English Premier League kicked off 25 years ago a foreign name on the teamsheet was rare.In its first ever season, back in 1992/93, 71% of registered players were English and just 55 came from outside of Britain. By the 2007/08 campaign, that percentage of domestic players had halved, with over 350 players from 60 nations represented. Now, on the 25th anniversary of its inception, CNN Sport analyzes how the world's richest football league has changed the game forever, becoming the favorite destination for many of the globe's best players.1992/93Leeds United's Eric Cantona (left) scored the first ever Premier League hat trick in a 5-0 win over Tottenham in August 1992. Read MoreBefore the Premier League became awash with cash, some players did come from overseas but most hailed from Scandinavia -- a far cry from the global influx of today -- with Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel helping Manchester United to the title. The division featured 22 teams, and all were led by a British manager. Even more remarkably given the turnaround in managers these days, only one -- Chelsea's Ian Porterfield -- was sacked in that inaugural season.There were no players from South America, Asia, Italy or Portugal.   The only Frenchman to take to the field that year, Eric Cantona, scored the Premier League's first ever hattrick for Leeds United. 1997/98Patrick Vieira embodied the physical power of Arsene Wenger's early Arsenal teams.Five years on, Arsenal had lured French manager Arsene Wenger to the Highbury dugout from Japan -- he was appointed in September 1996 -- and the pace of change really began to accelerate.The majority of the 602 players registered that year were still English, but the number of different nationalities featured across the season had almost doubled.  Arsenal's Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp thrilled supporters with his finesse and technique, scoring 16 league goals on his way to winning the PFA Player of the Year award.Former Italy striker Gianluca Vialli replaced former Netherlands midfielder Ruud Gullit as manager of Chelsea, illustrating a growing appetite for foreign leadership. Wenger, having scoured the continent for talent including Patrick Viera and Emmanuel Petit, became the first manager from outside the British Isles to lift the Premier League trophy.  2002/03Not all expensive foreign imports were successful. In 2001, Juan Sebastian Veron became the most expensive player in the history of British football, only to leave two years later.On Boxing Day 1999, Vialli became the first boss to field an entirely non-British starting XI in the history of English football.By the 2002/03 season, 77 nationalities were represented in the 20 squads, and there were more foreign recruits (58%) than homegrown players. The French national team had been the dominant force in international football in the preceding years, lifting the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championships, and English teams increasingly looked to their close neighbors for new talent. One thing hadn't changed -- Scotsman Sir Alex Ferguson still prowled the Old Trafford touchline -- and Manchester United saw off Arsenal to clinch the title. United's clinical Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy (25 goals) edged Arsenal's PFA Player of the Year Thierry Henry (24) to claim the golden boot. Seven of the top 10 goalscorers weren't English, with two (Leeds United's Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell) hailing from Australia. 2007/08Manchester United beat Chelsea on penalties in the 2008 Champions League final.Europe was feeling the Premier League's power.In 2008, United and Chelsea faced off at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium -- only the second time two clubs from the same country had contested a Champions League final. That game was also the fourth consecutive Champions League final contested by at least one Premier League team.It meant the division was more attractive than ever and, perhaps unsurprisingly, over 65% of players registered that year were foreign.It was also the nadir for the English national team, which failed to qualify for Euro 2008 under Steve McClaren. Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo scored 31 league goals to lead Manchester United to the 2007/08 title, but his time in English football would soon be up. Since his $132 million transfer to Real Madrid in 2009, Spanish clubs have dominated Europe's premier club competition. 2012/13Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho are pictured playing together for Liverpool in 2013.The bubble -- so often predicted to burst -- just kept ballooning as the TV broadcasting deals got bigger and bigger and billionaire owners scrambled to grab a piece of the action.In 2012/13, Premier League squads featured players from 82 nations around the world -- from Antigua and Barbuda all the way to Zambia. Liverpool's Uruguayan Luis Suarez pushed United's Dutchman Robin van Persie all the way for the golden boot, while just 22% of the 27 permanent and caretaker coaches were English.2017/18Manchester City has  overseas owners, a Spanish coach and a host of global stars in its team.Now, 25 years on, the Premier League continues to have by far the highest proportion of foreign players.According to UEFA's most recent Club Licensing Benchmark Report, the Cypriot First Division has the next highest proportion of expatriate players (57.1%), followed by the Belgian Pro League (57.1%) and LIGA NOS in Portugal (55.6%).

        "content": "(CNN)Two non-governmental organizations have said they are suspending migrant search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean because they feel threatened by the Libyan authorities.Germany-based NGO Sea-Eye cited an \"explicit threat\" to humanitarian organizations from the Libyan government as it announced its decision Sunday in a statement on its official Facebook page.\"We decided with a heavy heart to temporarily suspend our planned rescue missions in the Mediterranean,\" the group's founder Michael Buschheuer said. \"The reason for this is the changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean, after the Libyan Government announced an indefinite and unilateral extension of their territorial waters -- in connection with an explicit threat against the private NGOs. Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews.\"Refugee rescue boat called to aid anti-migrant craftThe announcement came a day after a similar decision was made by Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or MSF.Read MoreMSF said Libyan authorities had announced the establishment of a search and rescue zone on Friday, and restricted access to humanitarian vessels into the international waters off the Libyan coast. \"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences -- there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya,\" said Annemarie Loof, operational manager for MSF.Libya is a popular jumping-off point for migrants hoping to reach European shores. Many of them are fleeing war and persecution while others are seeking better economic opportunities. The North African country is a well-established base for a human trafficking operation that sees smugglers operating with more ease because of the country's lack of effective central governance. 'Security risk'MSF said Saturday that it had been warned there was a security risk by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Rome. The humanitarian organization said it had asked Libyan authorities to adhere to the internationally recognized legal obligation to rescue boats in distress, and to allow this to take place in international and Libyan waters.\"MSF further requests that Libyan authorities clarify that all boats, operated by NGOs or anyone else, will be permitted to conduct these rescue activities unhindered and unharmed and that the Libyan nor Italian authorities will interfere with the legally guaranteed right to disembark people in a place of safety,\" it said in a statement. MSF said its medical support team would still assist in rescues aboard the SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e-run boat Aquarius, which is currently patrolling in international waters.Libyan navy fires shotsThe suspension of rescue operations by Sea-Eye and MSF comes less than a week after a Spanish NGO, ProActiva, said two of its ships were chased away by Libyan coast guards.JUST WATCHEDMigrant boat lands on Spanish beachReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMigrant boat lands on Spanish beach 00:57The Libyan navy confirmed that it had fired two warning shots in the air to scare away a Spanish NGO ship near Tripoli on Monday morning. ProActiva said the ship concerned was the Open Arms, which was outside Libyan territorial waters, 13.5 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. The Libyan navy said the vessel was at the border of territorial waters and refused to comply to orders to leave the area.\"Even if they were 13 nautical miles away, they were still within the premise of Libyan search and rescue operations. They don't have permission to work there,\" Brigadier Ayoub Qassem, a spokesman for the Libyan Navy, told CNN on Tuesday. The Italian government announced earlier this month that it would deploy two military ships to Libya in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe. Humanitarian groups warned that the move would expose migrants to more danger on an already treacherous journey.The vast majority of those reaching Europe this year have landed in Italy, according to the International Organization for Migration. As of August 9, at least 2,242 migrants had died this year attempting the Central Mediterranean crossing, according to its estimates.CNN's Laura Goehler, Lorenzo D'Agostino, Sarah El Sirgany and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The campaign to prevent Britain leaving the EU, such as one exists, is not being led by a charismatic politician from Britain, nor even by wistful Eurocrats in Brussels. Instead, the standard-bearer of the anti-Brexit charge -- at least while the UK Parliament is on its long summer break and Prime Minister Theresa May is walking in the Alps -- is a little-known former political apparatchik vacationing on a Mediterranean island at the other end of the European Union.Until a couple of months ago James Chapman was chief of staff to David Davis, the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and the man in charge of Brexit negotiations for Britain. Before that, he worked for pro-EU former finance minister George Osborne, and for a long period he was political editor for the stridently pro-Brexit Daily Mail newspaper. Chapman was chief of staff to David Davis.But now Chapman, from his holiday villa on the Greek island of Spetses, has put rocket boosters under the Brexit debate with a warning delivered on social media that the UK's withdrawal from Europe will be a \"catastrophe\" and that May risks driving the British economy \"off a cliff\" in the process. Chapman has not had a sudden, retsina-inspired conversion about the biggest issue facing the UK -- he is known to have buried his pro-European sympathies in his previous jobs. And his Twitter tirade might have remained just that: a firestorm celebrated in liberal echo chambers and and largely ignored beyond them.But Chapman added an irresistible zinger: a suggestion that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and fellow Brexit supporters might have been jailed if British electoral law outlawed the publication of misleading statements. (Brexit campaigners have abandoned a notorious claim during the 2016 referendum campaign that leaving the EU would mean the UK could afford an extra \u00a3350m a week on its National Health Service.)Read MoreHis strongly worded broadside against Brexit and its supporters galvanized those who are still holding out for Britain to remain in Europe.And, in the dog days of August with little else to write about beyond the drama of North Korea, the British media took the bait. Call for new anti-Brexit partyChapman found himself all over the papers, and, reveling in the notoriety, went on to call for a new anti-Brexit political party, bringing pro-EU elements of British politics together under the name \"The Democrats.\" That catapulted him onto the BBC's flagship morning news program Friday, where, in a feisty interview, he claimed the brand of Theresa May's Conservative party has been so damaged by Brexit it will fail to win an outright majority ever again, and that both the Conservatives and the main opposition Labour party have been taken over by their extremist fringes. UK reveals details of post-Brexit offer to EU citizensChapman's incendiary language has enraged pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, who think he's deliberately making mischief as his old boss prepares to enter the third round of delicate Brexit negotiations with the EU in Brussels later this month. (They may have a point -- Chapman has signed up to write a regular column for the pro-EU Guardian newspaper and all the publicity is doing his profile no harm.)But his intervention has also won support from other Conservative MPs -- including, Chapman claimed on Friday, two Cabinet ministers. With the Labour party led by the left-wing Jeremy Corbyn, and the Conservatives seen as increasingly right-wing under May, there have been serious discussions in Westminster about a new centrist party for at least a year -- even before the EU referendum result. Brexit is about to run headfirst into realityBrexit has given that centrist idea a new pro-European dimension, because both Corbyn and May are in favor of a so-called \"hard\" Brexit, with the UK severing all ties with the EU including the single market. This centrist movement has support in particular from Britain's smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats, who found themselves squeezed at the election called by May in June, when there was no overall winner between Conservatives and Labour. Chapman also claims there would be popular support for such a party because 48% of people voted to remain in the EU.MPs reluctant to break awayBut the problem with the idea of \"The Democrats\" is that no serious politician in either Labour or the Conservatives is yet prepared to jump ship -- to leave the comfort of a well-established party structure, with its members, activists and donors, to the unknown territory of an entirely new movement. Getting into bed with one-time political foes would be a huge leap, no matter how solid the common ground on the big issue of Brexit.Brexit: Theresa May says free movement to end in March 2019What is true is that MPs from different parties have been working more closely together on a range of issues, including Brexit. Last month, a new cross party commission was created -- the All-Party Parliamentary Group on EU Relations, whose members include senior MPs who are opposed to a hard Brexit, including the former Conservative minister Anna Soubry and the one-time Labour leadership contender Chuka Umunna. They are working together as negotiations continue in Brussels and, once the UK Parliament reconvenes in the autumn, will try to soften the Brexit legislation that will repeal EU laws and bring them back under British control. Britain is on course to leave Europe in March 2019 -- and, even though Davis, the Brexit Secretary, has had a difficult time in negotiations with his opposite number Michel Barnier, this is still the most likely scenario. But the anti-Brexit movement sees the parliamentary process, using cross-party cooperation and tabling amendments to the repeal legislation, as the best opportunity to stop a hard Brexit. Such an all-party group allows its members to oppose Brexit without the high risk move of leaving their own parties to join an entirely new one.The problem with this strategy so far is that such a cross-party group, by its nature, has to work slowly and with consensus. What those who are concerned about Brexit -- including voters -- needed was someone to get angry on their behalf. The disparate anti-Brexit movement needed galvanizing into an outraged, forthright and indignant force. Chapman has not become its leader, but its outrider. It is not without irony that it has had to come all the way from a Greek island.",

Many, from sub-Saharan Africa, are fleeing war and persecution; others from impoverished nations in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have opted to risk their lives on the treacherous journey in the search for better economic opportunities.Libya has become the base for a well-oiled human-trafficking operation that's relied on the country's lack of effective central governance to operate with relative ease.Since the start of this year, 2,385 migrants have died on the central Mediterranean route, according to the International Organization for Migration; 114,287 migrants have reached European shores, 85% of them in Italy.CNN's Laura Goehler and Kara Fox contributed to this report.",

If he does, the history books will need rewriting.Hide Caption 9 of 9Read More\"It's amazing,\" a delighted Miller told CNN. \"You know when you see your name on the PGA Tour app or the PGA Tour website and you're reading the storylines ... you realize your dreams are coming true.\"  \"And how many times I've read through those articles or looked at those tee times and seen guys that I knew. \"I've been able to teach and inspire countless people with disabilities that achieving your dream is possible, regardless of what people tell you.\"Golf-obsessedMiller's road to reach the top has been painful, grueling and fraught with obstacles. Since being diagnosed with cerebral palsy, the 26-year-old has undergone 14 separate surgeries related to his condition.The Canadian says he has been golf-obsessed \"ever since I can remember\" and was practicing every day by the time he was eight.Though, due to the cerebral palsy, doubts remained as to whether he would ever be able to take his passion further than practice rounds and driving ranges.\"Let's be honest, I have one good side and it's a very difficult a sport,\" Miller said. \"You see there are mechanics that are involved, hand-eye coordination.\"There are a lot of things that as an athlete I actually posses quite well, it's just I only have one good side to a certain extent.\"READ: How Spieth could beat Tiger at the bankAs the years went by, however, and Miller entered adulthood, his weaker, left side became stronger, healthier and much more active.Over the last year in particular, he says, he's picked up a lot of distance in his game, something he describes as \"slow progression, late blooming.\"Miller's skill and perseverance has seen him become a member of the PGA of Canada and a qualified coach at GOLFTEC Calgary Midnapore, a club he has given hundreds of lessons at since he became an instructor in 2014.Making the cutHis aim at the ATB Financial Classic is to make the cut, though he says a hectic week of media interviews, continual fundraising and practicing hasn't allowed him to think about potential celebrations.\"Right now, I'm just keeping one foot in front of the other,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"It's all one thing at a time.\"Having \"worked his tail off\" playing on the Canadian tour for many years and, more recently, coaching and traveling with a tour professional, Miller is confident there isn't anything that can surprise him. READ: The evolution of the grand slam \"My experiential knowledge of traveling and handling a lot of stuff on the plate is pretty high, as far as a golf tournament goes,\" he says with an air of confidence. \"One thing I do have to remind myself is I don't have to make it more complicated that it is. \"You know, I've prepared for a lot of golf tournaments, I have good support around me and now it's just to really go and enjoy it. It's something that hasn't been done before.\"Charity workWhile making the cut would represent some personal glory, whenever Miller takes the course he is never playing for himself.His fundraising and earnings go to the Cerebral Palsy Association in Alberta, an organization he holds close to his heart.\"I'm doing a lot of effort on my part to raise money,\" he says. \"Any tournament I ever play, I'm gonna be raising money for charity, right? That's part of the program. \"I have to do something, I am a pioneer in this concept now and I'm going to hold that strong. So I have to do it properly and that's what I'll do my entire career.\"Miller believes golf is \"excelling\" with its charity work and disability equality.He says he has always admired the amount of money PGA Tour-sanctioned events have raised and believes other sports should follow suit.Beating the oddsThe chances of a young golfer making it to the professional ranks are slim -- making Miller's achievement even more remarkable.   \"I've slipped the odds in life because at a young age I was dealt bad cards, hard cards to make a success out of,\" he says defiantly. \"I had a lot of people looking at me with sympathy. I had a lot of people looking at me telling not to dream too big just in case it didn't work out. You know what I'm saying? Visit CNN.com/golf for more news and features\"I knew very early on that I was going to have to create these cards into one of the greatest success stories.\"When the scratch golfer steps up and strikes the ball off the first tee, officially becoming part of the PGA Tour, Miller's story will have come full circle.Every year for the past 34 years, the PGA Tour has hosted the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open, the same chain of hospitals at which Miller underwent the 14 surgeries that have today allowed him to compete.\"What are the odds of that?\"",

May 13, 2012 -- That Aguero goalManchester City and Manchester United started the final day of the season level on points. With minutes of their respective games remaining, United were set to become champions once more. But then came the twist: Edin Dzeko scored for City in stoppage time to level at home against QPR, giving Roberto Mancini's men hope -- but they needed to win. With the last kick of the match, along came Sergio Aguero, dancing into the box... Mario Balotelli found the Argentine, who struck low into the bottom-left corner. Ecstasy for the men in blue. City won the title for the first time in 44 years.Read MoreOctober 19, 2002 -- Rooney makes his mark Fifteen years ago Wayne Rooney was an unknown teenager playing for his boyhood club earning \u00a380 a week. Reigning champions Arsenal, seven points ahead at the top of the table, unbeaten in 30 league games, were the visitors at Goodison Park. But in four glorious touches Rooney would ruin Arsenal's unbeaten streak. With his first touch, 40 yards from goal, he picked the ball out of the sky and then spun 360 degrees, evading the backtracking Lauren. His second touch was a kick ahead to himself. And after his third touch, Rooney glanced up, raised his left arm, took aim and the ball gloriously hit the underside of the crossbar before dropping into the net. A star was born.April 3, 1996 -- The greatest game in history?This was a brilliantly entertaining match on a floodlit night at Anfield. Both teams were challenging for the title, neither could really defend. Newcastle desperately needed to win after seeing a 12-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the table swing into a three-point deficit.From 1-0 to the hosts to 1-1; 1-2, 2-2, 2-3, 3-3 and then, in stoppage time, Reds striker Stan Collymore beat Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek. Liverpool manager Roy Evans would later describe the game as \"kamikaze football.\" The teams would play out another 4-3 thriller the following season, but the first time is always the best. May 12, 2013 -- Fergie bows out in styleIn his final season in charge of the one of the world's most famous clubs, Sir Alex Ferguson -- the most successful football manager in British history -- bowed out with a Premier League title. Ferguson ended his reign with 49 trophies: 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two Champions League titles, to name but a few. His last league title -- United's 20th -- was perhaps his easiest, the title secured with a month of the season still to go -- only once (2001) had a Ferguson side won the league any earlier. The Premier League trophy was carried out by two of his former captains, Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson, and it was the manager who received the honor of lifting the Premier League trophy into the Manchester night sky. April 27, 2014 -- Gerrard's slipLiverpool were in swashbuckling form and seemed on course to secure a first league title for 24 years. They had won 11 consecutive matches and were unbeaten in 16 when Jose Mourinho's Chelsea came to Anfield. But a Steven Gerrard error would cost them dearly that season.Inside his own half, the captain slipped, lost possession and Chelsea's Demba Ba capitalized, putting the Londoners on their way to a 2-0 victory. Liverpool's title charge came to a halt after that loss. A disastrous draw at Crystal Palace followed and Manchester City clinched the title. \"There's not a day that doesn't go by that I don't think about what if that didn't happen,\" Gerrard has said. May 2, 2016 -- One of the greatest stories of all timeThis was a season which captured the imagination of the world. Leicester City had started the campaign as 5,000-1 outsiders for the title after almost being relegated the season before and Claudio Ranieri was seen as an uninspired choice to replace Nigel Pearson, who was sacked prior to the start of the campaign.But Ranieri and his team of bargain buys and journeymen started the season brilliantly and, incredibly, sustained their challenge. At the end of March they became odds-on favorites for the first time and, in May, won the first top-flight title in the club's history. The next season, Ranieri was sacked as Leicester struggled, but for one one glorious period the Foxes had made people think anything was possible.October 17, 2009 -- Beach ball madness When is a goal not a goal? A Liverpool-branded beach ball, thrown from the visiting section of the Stadium of Light, glided onto the pitch during the opening few minutes of Sunderland's encounter with Liverpool. So far, so uninspiring. But when Darren Bent's strike beat Liverpool's Jose Reina with the help of a sizable deflection off said beach ball debate raged, especially as it had secured the Black Cats a 1-0 victory. Liverpool's players protested, other referees criticized the decision. For those in any doubt, FIFA's laws of the game state \"the referee should stop, suspend or abandon the match because of outside interference of any kind\", which meant the goal should have been ruled out and the match restarted with a drop ball. April 21, 2001 -- The worst tackle of all time? Roy Keane's challenge on Manchester City's Alf Inge Haaland has been described by the City player himself as the \"worst tackle ever.\" The feud between the pair began in September 1997 at Elland Road. Keane, then United's midfielder, had swung at Haaland, then playing for Leeds, and subsequently injured his own knee ligaments. The Norwegian stood over Keane, apparently telling him to stop feigning injury. In his first autobiography, Keane wrote: \"I'd waited almost 180 minutes for Alfie, three years if you look at it another way. Now he had the ball on the far touchline. I'd waited long enough. I hit him hard. The ball was there (I think).\" The midfielder was given a five-game ban and a record \u00a3150,000 fine from the Football Association. Three operations and two unsuccessful years of rehabilitation later, Haaland's contract with City was terminated. In his most recent autobiography, Keane said he had no regrets over the tackle and denied he deliberately tried to injure Haaland.  January 16, 1999 -- The wrong dugout\"I'm waving, I haven't got a clue where I am,\" is how Ron Atkinson described the moment he realized he was in the opposition team's dugout. Former Manchester United manager Atkinson was in Barbados when he received a phone call asking if he could manage struggling Nottingham Forest. After an overnight flight, the Englishman was faced with leading his new club out against Arsenal. The cameras and photographers were waiting to capture Forest's new manager, little did they know they would capture one of the funniest moments in the league's history. May 14, 1995 -- Blackburn win the title at Anfield The season that will be remembered for when Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton's goals took Blackburn Rovers to a first league title for 81 years. Between them, Shearer and Sutton (nicknamed \"The SAS\") scored 49 of Rovers' 80 league goals. The club's rise through the divisions had been remarkable. Former Liverpool great Kenny Dalglish became the club's manager when they were in the bottom half of the second tier of English football. Aided by the millions of benefactor Jack Walker, and Dalglish's canny signings, they won promotion to the new Premier League at the first attempt. In their first season in the top flight they finished fourth, then were runners-up to Manchester United before being crowned champions in 1995, pipping United on the last day of the season by a point despite defeat by Liverpool.May 15, 2004 -- Arsenal's 'Invincibles'Arsene Wenger's team of the 2003-04 vintage is the first to win the Premier League title having not lost a game. They played 38 league games, won 26 and drew 12, scored 73 goals and conceded just 26, for a total of 90 points. Captained by Frenchman Patrick Vieira, the team consisted of some of the greats of the Premier League era: Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell. Winning the title by 11 points, they were the first team since Preston North End in 1889 to achieve the feat in the top flight, having played 16 matches more. October 24, 2004 -- Battle of the BuffetThe Battle of the Buffet or Pizzagate, however you want to refer to this match at Old Trafford, it was one to remember -- for what happened after the match as well as during. Tempers flared as Manchester United ended Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten run with a 2-0 win, with a controversial penalty earned by Wayne Rooney adding to Arsenal's ire. As the teams made their way back down the tunnel to their dressing rooms, red mist descended and a mass row erupted. Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger were said to be arguing when food from a dressing room buffet was thrown, including sandwiches, and, so the story goes, a slice of pizza slapped Ferguson on the face and Pizzagate was born. April 2, 2005 -- Bust-up between teammatesThree goals down and down to 10 men with eight minutes to go, things got worse for Newcastle United at St James' Park against Aston Villa. Teammates Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer took their frustrations out on each other, the pair locked horns and had to be dragged apart by teammates and Villa's Gareth Barry. Referee Barry Knight sent off both players, leaving the Magpies with just eight players on the pitch. Both players had to later make a public apology in a press conference and were suspended. August 17, 1996 -- Beckham from the halfway lineThe goal that launched a career. On the opening day of the season, Manchester United were playing Wimbledon at Selhurst Park and Beckham, wearing the No.10 shirt previously worn by the departed Mark Hughes, had just turned 21. United were leading 2-0 when, in the final minute, Beckham collected the ball inside his own half, looked up and went for goal from 60 yards out. The ball floated over the head of goalkeeper Neil Sullivan and into the net. \"I was more happy about the fact that Eric Cantona came up to me afterward and said 'good goal.' That was better than scoring the goal for me,'\" Beckham has said. June 2, 2004 -- The 'Special One' arrives Jose Mourinho was the man to herald a new era at Stamford Bridge. Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich had purchased Chelsea in 2003 and spent \u00a3100m on players but ended the first season without a trophy under then-manager Claudio Ranieri. Enter Mourinho, a Portuguese who had won the Champions League with Porto. Mourinho's press conference is the most mesmeric managerial unveiling of the Premier League era. \"We have top players and, sorry if I'm arrogant, we have a top manager,\" said the young Mourinho. \"Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one.\"April 20, 2013 -- Suarez's bite Liverpool striker Luis Suarez made his mark on the Premier League in myriad ways. The striker will be remembered as one of the greatest goalscorers to have played in the league, but also as one of its most controversial. The Uruguayan bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic during a match at Anfield, which led to a 10-match ban for the Liverpool player. Even Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron had an opinion on the matter, calling on the Football Association to make an example of the player, which it did.  September 12, 2009 -- Adebayor rubs it in A few weeks after leaving Arsenal for Manchester City, Emmanuel Adebayor went up against his former club and scored City's third goal in a 4-2 home victory.  But it wasn't for the goal itself that this match will be remembered, but the striker's celebration -- running the length of the field towards the Arsenal fans and sliding across the turf in front of them. The away fans were furious. Adebayor issued a public apology and, in defending their player to the Football Association, Manchester City said Adebayor was provoked. May 15, 2005 -- Robson's West Brom stay up Norwich, Crystal Palace, West Brom and Southampton all went into the final day of the 2004-05 season still battling against relegation, but only one of the four could survive. West Brom, managed by former England and Manchester United captain Bryan Robson, had been bottom of the table at Christmas but fought in the final half of the season to be in with a chance in the last game. And on a dramatic day, Geoff Horsfield and Kieron Richardson scored to secure a 2-0 win over Portsmouth, maintaining their Premier League status by a point. Palace were eight minutes from safety until an equalizer from Charlton sent them down, while Norwich and Southampton joined them. December 26, 2008 -- The pitch becomes the dressing room One of the strangest sights seen in the Premier League was when the then Hull City manager Phil Brown gave a halftime team talk on the pitch, wagging his finger in front of fans. Brown was furious with his team's first-half performance against Manchester City -- they were 4-0 down -- but his ploy had little impact as Hull went on to lose 5-1. \"Our 4,000 traveling fans deserved some kind of explanation for the first-half performance and it was difficult for me to do that from the confines of a changing room,\" said Brown at the time. February 28, 2016 -- Van Gaal takes a fall Ah, Louis van Gaal. The then Manchester United boss, disagreeing with a refereeing decision late in the second half against Arsenal, decided to reenact what he thought was a dive by Alexis Sanchez. He threw himself on the floor, much to the amusement of the thousands inside Old Trafford. The United manager later said he apologized to referee Craig Pawson for his theatrical behavior. \"I was emotional,\" he explained.  February 12, 2011 -- Rooney's bicycle kick Wayne Rooney features twice on this list, but both goals will live forever in the memory. The England striker scored a stunning overhead kick to earn Manchester United a late winner against Manchester City, a victory which put United's title challenge back on track. His celebration too -- arms aloft, back to the away fans -- is also one of English football's most iconic moments. August 3, 1999 -- Arsenal sign Thierry Henry There have been many incredible Premier League signings and Thierry Henry was undoubtedly one of them. The Frenchman had it all -- pace, balance, touch, strength and swagger -- and, for a period, not only was he the best player in the league, but arguably the best in the world too. He spent eight years at Arsenal, scoring incredible goals and winning two Premier League titles, three FA Cups and becoming the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the process.  January 30, 2008 -- Ronaldo redefines the free-kickCristiano Ronaldo was in his Manchester United pomp. The Portugal star's famous 30-yard free-kick found the top-right of the net to leave Portsmouth goalkeeper David James with little hope. \"It was without doubt the best free-kick I've seen in the Premier League,\" Sir Alex Ferguson said after the 2-0 victory. January 25, 1995 -- Cantona's 'king fu' kick A truly extraordinary moment. This is perhaps the most iconic image of the last 25 years. Manchester United's Eric Cantona had just been sent off against Crystal Palace and as he made his way back to the dressing room, the Frenchman launched himself at Palace fan Matthew Simmons.  The \"kung-fu kick\" earned him a nine-month ban. \"People have said this is the most famous common assault case in the history of the English legal system,\" said former United director and solicitor Maurice Watkins. March 2, 2002 -- Magical Bergkamp A moment of genius from Dennis Bergkamp. The Dutchman not only scored a great goal, but an important one -- decisive in Arsenal's double-winning season. With his back to goal, the forward steered the ball around Newcastle defender Nikos Dabizas with his left foot, and swiveled the other side, meeting the ball again before slotting it past Shay Given. Two touches. One wonderful goal. The 90s and 00s -- Fergie time Not one particular moment, but a lasting memory of the era -- Fergie Time. It is a football phrase which has its own Wikiepdia page, explaining the perception that Manchester United received extra added time when they were losing, with the familiar sight of Ferguson pointing at the watch adding to the idea.",

She said she was drugged, placed in a bag, and transported to a cabin in a remote town close to the Italian Alps.But Ayling admitted to Italian police that she went shopping with her suspected kidnapper and had breakfast with him on the morning she was freed, raising questions about whether she was held against her will.Francesco Pesce, who is representing the 20-year-old mother of one, says Ayling went along with her captor's wishes to \"avoid conflict.\"Pesce said Ayling was \"following blindly\" after being warned by her captor that she was being watched by members of a criminal gang, and that she would be killed if she attempted to escape.

Police reconstructed the British model's kidnapping.The suspect allegedly used encrypted accounts to ask the model's agent for $300,000 to stop the online auction from going ahead, according to Italian police.The suspect also allegedly told the agent that he was operating on behalf of \"the Black Death group,\" an organization involved in illegal trafficking on the dark web, a layer of the internet accessible only through anonymizing networks like Tor.This small house in the Italian Alps was where the woman was kept, police said.\nIn Ayling's statement to Italian police, provided to CNN by her lawyer, the model said she shared a bed with her captor at one point, though she insisted she was not sexually abused. Ayling initially told police that Herba wouldn't let her leave the house, but when pressed by authorities, she admitted she had gone with him to buy shoes because she felt he was the key to her freedom.Ayling told police that her kidnapper said she was being released because she had a young child, and that such an abduction contravened the group's rules.Ayling said Herba took her to the British consulate at 7 a.m. on the day she was released, but the building was still closed. So the pair left to have breakfast at a local restaurant before returning at 9:20 a.m. Herba was arrested shortly after.Italian investigators have since established that the suspect had already organized several online auctions for the sale of kidnapped girls, referring to them as \"prey.\"Lukasz Herba, a 30-year-old Polish national, was arrested on kidnapping charges. The websites for the auctions included a description of the victim and a starting price but police said it was still unclear whether the suspect had made them up.Authorities said they are searching for at least one more person in connection with the kidnapping. Ayling told the Telegraph she feared for her life after returning to her London home, and said \"I am incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release.\"Investigations in the case are ongoing in Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.",

In a statement on his Facebook page on Monday, Makwala said: \"According to IAAF medics I am apparently suffering from food poisoning which has affected several other athletes in the athletes' hotel.\"JUST WATCHED Van Niekerk aiming for Bolt's 200m recordReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH Van Niekerk aiming for Bolt's 200m record 02:59READ: The 'very boring' man who could replace Bolt Recovery expected without treatment Ireland's Thomas Barr withdrew from the 400m semifinals, while German and Canadian athletes also staying at The Tower Hotel near Tower Bridge have reportedly been affected too.

The softly spoken 25-year-old refers to himself as \"ordinary, very boring\" and \"average.\"Follow @cnnsport\n\nListening to him speak, it's easy to forget this is the man tipped to fill the void left by Usain Bolt's impending retirement from track and field.Already an Olympic champion -- and now a world champion after victory in Tuesday's 400m final -- the South African is the only man in history to have run a sub-10 second 100m, sub-20 200m and sub-44 400m.And on his way to gold at Rio 2016, Van Niekerk shattered Michael Johnson's 17-year-old 400m world record.Read MoreEight-time Olympic champion Bolt, the fastest man in history, has been glowing in his praise, backing Van Niekerk to \"take over\" athletics in a recent interview with CNN.JUST WATCHEDGatlin beats Usain Bolt in 100-meter sprintReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGatlin beats Usain Bolt in 100-meter sprint 03:24READ: Gatlin confused by boos after beating BoltBut perhaps he has already. Van Niekerk's impressive times in the 200m this season -- his 19.84 second run in Jamaica last month is the second quickest in the world this year -- were enough to convince Bolt not to race over that distance at the IAAF World Championships in London. Now, the understated South African has set his sights on the great Jamaican's 200m world record.\"If you had asked me a few years ago if the 400m world record is possible, I probably would have been shocked,\" Van Niekerk told CNN.\"Now I'm thinking why not, because I never thought I'd be owning the 400m world record today, so why not believe in the 200m?\"Bolt's support giving confidenceJUST WATCHEDSouth African stuns the world at Rio OlympicsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSouth African stuns the world at Rio Olympics 03:05READ: The 74-year-old coach guiding Wayde van NiekerkPrior the the World Championships, which end on August 13, Bolt said he believed Van Niekerk was \"doing a lot for the sport.\" His support hasn't gone unnoticed.\"I should owe him a fee for the amount of recognition he's giving me,\" Van Niekerk quipped. \"It gives me, obviously, a massive boost in my career. \"But, at the same time, it makes me feel good because he respects me as the person I am and I respect him as the person he is. It gives me great confidence to continue achieving great things. \"I'm getting the backing of a legend of the sport and he believes in the great things I can do and become a legend in the sport.\"As Van Niekerk was striding into Olympic history in Rio, Bolt looked on in awe.Making his way onto the track for the 100m final, the Jamaican's reaction to Van Niekerk's 43.03-second lap became one of the enduring images of the Games. Mouth wide open, hands clasped over his face, Bolt summed up the feelings of everyone watching in the Olympic Stadium and around the world.An overnight star However, Van Niekerk's athletics journey actually began with the high jump, before he transitioned into the 100m and 200m.Injuries soon forced him to abandon the shorter sprints and take up the longer, more grueling 400m.

Police reconstructed the British model's kidnapping.Kidnapped for auctionAccording to police, Ayling arrived in Milan on July 10 after agreeing to take part in a photo shoot which had been arranged through her agent for the following day.Police said that she was then attacked on July 11 by two men after arriving at the apartment where the photo shoot was supposed to take place.She was taken to a cabin on the outskirts of Lemie, a remote town in the Italian Alps, where she was kept handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in a bedroom for a week, police said. This small house in the Italian Alps was where the woman was kept, police said.\nThe suspect allegedly used encrypted accounts to ask the model's agent for $300,000 to stop the online auction from going ahead, according to Italian police.The suspect also allegedly told the agent that he was operating on behalf of \"the Black Death group,\" an organization involved in illegal trafficking on the dark web, a layer of the internet accessible only through anonymizing networks like Tor.Lukasz Herba, a 30-year-old Polish national, was arrested on kidnapping charges. Ayling told the Telegraph that her kidnapper said she was being released because she had a young child, and that such an abduction contravened the group's rules.Italian investigators have since established that the suspect had already organized several online auctions for the sale of kidnapped girls, referring to them as \"prey.\"The websites for the auctions included a description of the victim and a starting price but police said it was still unclear whether the suspect had made them up.Authorities said they are searching for at least one more person in connection with the kidnapping. Investigations in the case are ongoing in Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.CNN's Vasco Cotovio and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

Ten athletes \u2014 victims of unimaginable hardship, forced to leave their homes in South Sudan, Congo, Ethiopia and Syria \u2014 united under a single flag.  IOC President Thomas Bach called them \"a symbol of hope\" in a time of crisis. The Human Rights Watch claimed their involvement had \"reframed the debate.\" A year on from Rio 2016, how have the lives of the members of the Olympic Refugee Team changed? Yiech Pur Biel: South Sudan, 800mRead MoreYiech Pur Biel only remembers crying twice in his life: when he was separated from his mother as a child during the devastating Sudanese civil war and, many years later, when he found out he'd be running the 800m at the 2016 Rio Olympics. One year on: He might not have qualified from his heat, finishing in 1:54.67, but Pur Biel's life has changed forever. Just months before the Games began, the 22-year-old was still training barefoot in the vicinity of the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya. But he has now traveled the world, attended the first UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants, and met a number of world leaders, including former American President Barack Obama and Pope Francis. Yet his most cherished moment has been a telephone call from his mother.\"My family never believed I was alive,\" Pur Biel tells CNN, explaining that someone from his hometown of Nasir had heard about his Rio exploits and took his mother to an aid agency to make the call.\"I was happy to talk to them; [now] I want to meet my mother face-to-face, as well as my brother and sister.\"I have a big refugee family, but I also have my real family which needs my care.\"The runner's mother didn't know what the Olympics were, but understood her son had gone \"somewhere far away\" and would come back safely.  Pur Biel is now training for Tokyo 2020, alongside studying for a diploma in public relations \u2014 something he \"never thought possible.\" He has also met his idol, double Olympic champion David Rudisha, telling the Kenyan he hopes to break his 800m world record.Yusra Mardini: Syria, SwimmingThe tale of Yusra Mardini, Syria's teenage swimmer who won her Olympic 100m butterfly heat just a year after swimming for her life, captivated the world. Her house in Aleppo was bombed, the motor on the dinghy transporting her from Turkey to Greece stopped working, but she never lost hope.Together with her sister, Sarah, Mardini pushed the boat for three hours through the Aegan sea toward Greek shores, potentially saving the lives of the 18 other migrants on board. She might not have made the semifinals in Rio, but insisted \"the only thing I wanted was to compete.\" One year on: Mardini is fighting new battles, shedding light on the millions displaced around the world and reclaiming the word 'refugee' as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Named by People magazine as one of '25 women changing the world,' the swimmer is in the process of penning an autobiography, with the story of her life also set to be told in a film by the award-winning director Stephen Daldry. Mardini competed in the FINA World Aquatic Championships this July, returning to Hungary just two years after sleeping rough in a Budapest train station en route from Syria to Germany. She is currently living in Berlin, preparing for Tokyo 2020.Popole Misenga: Democratic Republic of Congo, JudoHaving grown up amid the five-year civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, judoka Popole Misenga sought asylum \u2014 without a passport, money or food \u2014 in Brazil after the 2013 World Championships in Rio. Three years later, he competed at the Olympics in the same city. \"My fight in the Olympics will be for all refugees, to give them faith in their dreams,\" Misenga told CNN last year, before going on to reach the last 16 of the men's 90kg division, losing to world No. 1 Gwak Dong-Han of South Korea in the final minute of his bout.  One year on: Misenga has been granted asylum in Brazil, married a local and become a father. He says Rio is a \"magical place\" to live and, for the first time since childhood, he has been reunited with many of his relatives, screaming \"I'm alive! I'm alive!\" into his phone during a call with his brother. READ: Farewell Usain Bolt, a wonder of our sporting ageRose Nathike Lokonyen: South Sudan, 800mThirteen years after running from soldiers in Chukudum, South Sudan, Rose Nathike Lokonyen became the Refugee Olympic Team's first flagbearer. She then went on to compete against some of the world's finest middle-distance athletes, finishing seventh out of nine in her 800m heat in 2:16.64.  One year on: Taking time out from her heavy training schedule, Lokonyen traveled to Switzerland in September for the 33rd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. Just a month later, the 22-year-old addressed Pope Francis in Sweden, reflecting on the transformative power of sport and calling for world peace. Her favorite memory of Brazil was seeing Copacabana Beach \u2014 \"I was excited because it was my first time seeing the water\" \u2014 but her greatest personal battle remains on the track. Having ran alongside two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya in her heat in Rio, Lokonyen is now determined to beat the South African.She will get the opportunity to test herself again against the 26-year-old at the IAAF World Championships in London, with the 800m heats taking place on August 10.  Paulo Amotun Lokoro: South Sudan, 1500mPaulo Lokoro had never been anywhere except his native South Sudan and Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp before meeting legendary distance runner Tegla Loroupe, who is also the founder of an international humanitarian charity. The 25-year-old had never even trained in shoes. How thing can change. One year on: \"I went to the Vatican and met with the Pope,\" Lokoro tells CNN. \"The first day I arrived they treated me like a big boss and I am not a boss! People liked me a lot.\"A keen football fan, he also traveled to Barcelona and stood in the center of the Nou Camp pitch, with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, to kickstart the Spanish side's #SignAndPass campaign.\"God gave me the chance,\" Lokoro, who hopes to compete as a marathon runner at Tokyo 2020, says. \"I was not aware that my life could be changed so I am grateful to the UN Refugee Agency and the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation.\"Most people hear about refugees but they have not met any person who is a refugee. I created many friendships.\" READ: Bolt in numbers - Why the Jamaican is the greatestYolande Mabika: Democratic Republic of Congo, Judo For Yolande Mabika, judo is a form of catharsis.  More than two decades on from the day rebels attacked her home in Bukavu, Congo, she says the sport has given her discipline and \"a strong heart.\"  One year on: Though the 29-year-old will never stop thinking about what she's left behind, the pain of losing her family has faded. The judoka is currently working as a waitress in a Brazilian restaurant which provides food for the homeless. It is run by a Syrian refugee chef. She hopes to one day work with disadvantaged young girls, to help them overcome the sort of obstacles she faced. \"Brazil is my home now,\" Mabika said. \"I want to stay here and build a new life.\" James Nyang Chiengjiek: South Sudan, 400mJames Chiengjiek was lucky to avoid the fate of South Sudan's child soldiers.Just 13 when he left home, he reached the Kakuma camp in 2002 and quickly capitalized on his athletic talents despite a lack of top-class facilities. in Rio, he secured a personal best in the heats.One year on: It is not winning that drives Chiengjiek. \"The most important thing is not to win golds,\" he says. \"But to spread the peace.\" He says he learnt \"a lot\" at the Olympics and received advice from Justin Gatlin, the American sprinter twice banned for doping who won 100m World Championship gold in London on Saturday. He also conversed with football's $263 million man. \"We met Neymar at the dining hall,\" the 25-year-old recalls. \"He asked to take a photo with us. We sat down and talked.\"I was so happy to meet him. I used to play in Kakuma. My jersey is also number 10 like Neymar.\" Inspired by a piece of advice from the Brazilian star \u2014 \"forget the past and focus on the future\" \u2014 Chiengjiek has his sights set on Tokyo 2020.\"There is big competition in the 800m race here in the training camp,\" he says. \"That is why I am trying very hard, three times a day -- in the morning, midday and in the evening.\" Rami Anis: Syria, SwimmingSeven years ago, Rami Anis was swimming for Syria at the Asian Games in China. After his home city of Aleppo was bombed, nothing was the same again.His journey to safety \u2014 partly made on an inflatable dinghy \u2014 has taken him to Turkey, the Greek island of Samos and, finally, to Belgium, where he gained asylum in December 2015.The 26-year-old achieved a personal best time of 54.25 seconds in his 100m freestyle heat in Rio, with his coach branding his inclusion on the team a form of \"justice.\"One year on: Anis met his idol Michael Phelps -- the most successful Olympian in history --  at the Laureus Awards in Monaco. He hopes the war in his home country will end so he can represent Syria at Tokyo 2020.Anjelina Nadai Lohalith: South Sudan, 1500mOne of Anjelina Lohalith's earliest memories is running to fetch milk from her family's cows in Southern Sudan.  That was before her village was burned down and the fears of a forced marriage compelled her to flee to Kakuma.One year on: Lohalith, who is focusing on the next Olympics, is determined to improve her time in the 1500m. \"If others can break the world record, what will stop me?\" she asks. Reflecting on Rio, she says she could not believe the size of the Brazilian city and how roads had been created \"through the middle of mountains.\" \"I stood at the top of a building and looked down at Rio,\" Lohalith recalls. \"That's when I realized it was real. My time had come.\"  Yonas Kinde: Ethiopia, MarathonYonas Kinde left Ethiopia for Luxembourg in 2012 and immediately pursued his love for athletics, quickly becoming the best marathon runner in the tiny European nation. Out of 155 starters at Rio 2016, the 36-year-old crossed the line in respectable 90th position.One year on:  Kinde is putting his experience to good use, coaching a young Eritrean athlete. He has grown an afro to cope with the comparatively cold Luxembourg winters and hopes to reunite with his wife and daughter, before representing his adopted nation at Tokyo 2020. Ibrahim Al Hussein: Syria, SwimmingIbrahim Al Hussein lost his lower right leg in a bombing while trying to come to the assistance of a friend in danger near his Syrian home. He woke twice during emergency surgery and \"saw everything.\" For two months, he went without painkillers or proper treatment.One year on: The Rio Paralympics has given the swimmer who made headlines around the world for carrying the Olympic torch in Athens cause to dream again. Al Hussein might not have made the final of the 100-meter freestyle, but in September he received the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award for the athlete that \"best exemplifies the spirit of the Games.\" Inspired by the Refugee Olympic Team's story?

Fifteen firefighters in Sicily are under investigation for possible fraud related to fires dating back to 2013. It's not known how many fires the group is suspected of starting or who directed the fires to be lit, police said. None of the firefighters has been identified. According to police, the volunteers would light a fire and wait for someone to call it in. On other occasions, the volunteers would get friends or family members to call the emergency hotline and report a nonexistent fire. An investigation was opened when authorities noticed the relatively high number of emergency calls received when the volunteers were on shift, police said.  Authorities said the volunteers purposely lit fires so they would have to put them out and, in turn, get paid.

Novaya Gazeta has condemned the decision by a Russian court to deport Feruz. \"We think that there is a threat to his health and life in Uzbekistan. He has been tortured and threatened there already. We know, sadly, of a few cases when people who have been extradited to Uzbekistan just went missing. No one knows whether they are alive or what has happened to them,\" Nadezhda Prusenkova, a spokesperson for the newspaper, told CNN.Read MoreIn August, Feruz was picked up by Russian police on his way to work at the paper. He was then taken to Basmanny court in Moscow where a judge ruled he had broken Russian migration legislation and ordered him to be deported to Uzbekistan. Feruz said he was abused after he was taken from court, according to an administrative memo published on the Novaya Gazeta website. In a statement, he said he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back, beaten and shocked with electricity by a prison officer.Journalist Ali Feruz says he was beaten and given electric shocks by a Russian prison officer.The Russian state news agency TASS reported that when Feruz arrived at a temporary detention center, he filled out a form saying he had no injuries to his body.Appealing the order in court on Monday, Feruz said he had twice applied for temporary protection in Russia as well as asylum, according to Human Rights Watch. HRW also said his applications for protection were rejected but the rejections were then overturned for additional review.His case has been the subject of international condemnation.America, don't abandon gay ChechensDenis Krivosheev, deputy director for Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International, said, \"Ali Feruz is openly gay, a human rights activist and a correspondent for the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper.

As long as the review of his application continues, he is legal here in Russia.\"According to Gannushkina, \"There are just 595 refugees in Russia.\"\"People generally get rejected.

Lukasz Herba was arrested July 17 outside the British consulate in Milan while accompanying the woman, said Lorenzo Bucossi, the head of the Milan Police Mobile Command unit.It was not immediately clear why the suspect took the model to the consulate.Authorities said they are searching for at least one more person in connection with the kidnapping.

The great Jamaican will retire after the IAAF World Championships in London, bringing the curtain down on an incomparable career. Follow @cnnsport\n\nBut in the 100m final on Saturday he had to settle for bronze as the controversial American Justin Gatlin secured a surprise victory in a season's best 9.92 seconds. Fellow American Christian Coleman (9.94) took silver, with eight-time Olympic champion Bolt, still the reigning 100m and 200m world record holder, in bronze, clocking 9.95 seconds. Gatlin entered London's Olympic Stadium with the crowd's boos ringing in his ears. The 35-year-old is regarded by many as the sport's villain after twice being banned for doping offenses. He was also jeered in the heats and semifinals.Read MoreBut the 2004 Olympic champion said he \"tuned out\" the supporters' din to claim a victory which wrecked Bolt's farewell. READ: Usain Bolt, farewell to a wonder of our sporting age A glorious career Gatlin genuflected to the Jamaican after his victory. Despite failing to claim a 12th world title, the night still belonged to the fastest man in history. It was Bolt who was the last athlete to leave the track as he treated the 50,000-strong capacity crowd, and a throng of photographers, to his celebratory \"To Da World\" pose. The crowd had come expecting Bolt to secure a 20th Olympic and world gold medal, but with his 31st birthday fast approaching this was a season too far. He had only dipped under 10 seconds once this season prior to these championships and -- though earlier in the week he declared himself ready to defend his world crown -- he did not seem like the Bolt of old.     READ: Bolt in numbers -- why the Jamaican is the greatest There was a little fooling around on the start line, but not with the same gusto as in the past.Throughout his career the sprinter has made winning look effortless, but on a floodlit evening in the English capital he had to work for his medal. After a disappointing start the Jamaican, for the first time in his career at a major championship, was grimacing as he dipped for the line, straining for a glorious end to his individual career.WATCH: Stars and fans bid farewell to BoltAn athlete like no other Bolt is expected to compete in the 4x100m relay on August 12 and should he and his teammates retain their title, his tally of World Championships golds will rise to 12, two more than long-distance runner Mo Farah, who is second on the all-time list. After that there will be no more and his sport will never be the same. No sprinter has ever run as quickly or won as many gold medals, and done so with such easy charm.For nearly a decade he has been the undoubted superstar of track and field, his electric personality and incredible feats illuminating a sport darkened by doping. Bolt told CNN earlier this week that it will take more than one athlete to fill the vibrant void he will leave behind and the sport now faces a period of transition without its main man. Where does Usain Bolt rank in the pantheon of sport's greats? Have your say on our Facebook page. A legend like Ali He has been likened to three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali but, in some ways, the Jamaican's career has surpassed that of the legendary American boxer, even though his last solo race ended with a bronze.  Only twice has Bolt failed to triumph on the grandest stage -- a third place in London and a false start in the 2011 100m World Championships final. The 30-year-old's longevity has been as remarkable as the times he produced in his early twenties. At last summer's Rio Olympics, Bolt became the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, securing his status as one of sport's greats. He achieved an unprecedented Olympic \"triple-triple\" in the sprint events (winning the 100m, 200m and sprint relay) but the 4x100m gold won in Beijing 2008 was taken away from him following teammate Nesta Carter's retrospective positive doping test earlier this year. All four of the fastest 100m times in history belong to Bolt and his sensational 100m world record of 9.58 seconds, achieved in Berlin in 2009, will live long in the memory. The age of Bolt is now over, yet the baton has been passed not to a new generation but an American five years the Jamaican's senior. However, 21-year-old silver medalist Coleman -- still the fastest man in the world this year with a 9.82 run in Eugene in June -- could be Bolt's long-term successor in the blue riband event.",

        "content": "Caccamo, Sicily (CNN)Giorgio Scimeca was only 19 years old when the Sicilian mafia gunned down his cousin.More than 25 years later, Scimeca says he will always remember the smell of blood. \"He was running for mayor of our town. I heard the sound of the ambulance but when I arrived on the scene he was already dead,\" Scimeca told CNN.Back then, even the ambition of running for public office in a small town like Caccamo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Sicilian capital Palermo, was risky business, as the mob would go to extreme lengths to assert its control over the Italian island, killing judges, policemen and even businesspeople who couldn't be bought.Caccamo, like many Sicilian towns, had a longstanding history with the mob.  Now, Scimeca is among thousands of Sicilians fighting back by refusing to pay the \"pizzo\" -- protection money upon which the Cosa Nostra's empire was traditionally built. Read More\"It all started when I opened a bar with my sister and brother,\" Scimeca remembers. \"This guy I knew came in asking to borrow money. Then he would ask to borrow my car  -- perhaps to move drugs around -- and before you know it he's knocking at your door in the middle of the night with stolen goods.\"  \"They pretend they are a friend. Then they try and trap you and make you complicit,\" he adds.Giorgio Scimeca says he won't pay protection money to the Sicilian mafia. Scimeca refused to pay. Instead he called the police -- a risky strategy that nearly cost him his livelihood.At first, locals shunned his bar, fearing the mob's revenge. Then an organization called Addiopizzo stepped in.Taking a standAddiopizzo, which means \"Goodbye to the racket,\" is a grassroots movement founded by a group of friends who were keen to start their own businesses --  but not so keen on sharing their spoils. \"Until recently, talking about the pizzo used to be taboo,\" says Addiopizzo's co-founder, 40-year-old lawyer Salvatore Caradonna. \"But now people are openly questioning such extortion.\"A shop in central Palermo that's set to open soon has posted messages in various languages saying that the owner has no intention to pay mafia protection money.Based in a property seized from a mafia don, Addiopizzo provides legal, moral and social support to those brave enough to report extortionists to the police -- a move that previously could have seen a shop burned down and its owner shunned or even physically harmed.Related: He goes after the mob; now he's the targetWith the help of a million euros (about $1.18 million) from the European Union, the group has been able to invest in rebuilding deprived communities with high unemployment rates, previously a fertile recruitment ground for the mafia.Addiopizzo's network now includes over 1,000 of Palermo's 80,000 businesses as members, each proudly displaying a logo reading: \"I pay those who don't pay\" in their windows. With around 13,000 customers, those shops have found that courage can offer the bonus of attracting a loyal, socially-conscious clientele.Since signing up to the Addiopizzo network, many stores have reported a rise in sales and a drop in mob visits -- a trend confirmed by Palermo's Chief Prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi.Palermo business owners Valeria Di Leo and Fabio Messina were the first shop owners to join the Addiopizzo group. \"When Cosa Nostra members are aware of the possibility that one of their victims can report them to the police, it keeps them away from even asking for the pizzo,\" Lo Voi told CNN.\"It's a help for us because the fight against the mafia can't be done only by judicial or law enforcement agencies -- it must come from the whole population too,\" he said. Such resistance hasn't gone unnoticed among the mob's higher echelons.The head of one of Palermo's most feared clans was heard complaining about Addiopizzo on a wiretap set up while he was in jail, saying that the organization was ruining the prospects for young recruits, while mafia wives and girlfriends have had to take pay cuts, according to authorities. The mafia has diversified into alternative sources of income -- from drug running to money laundering -- but the drop in protection money is making a dent in Italian organized crime's financial empire, which is estimated to generate around 100 billion euros ($118 billion) in profits per year, according to a 2012 report by the Italian business association Confesercenti.And it's not just the mafia's business model that the people of Palermo are turning on its head.'Crooked cap'In his 50 years as an entrepreneur in Palermo, Guido Agnello has never paid the mafia, despite repeated demands and threats. Yet, ironically, he now makes his money from selling one of their iconic symbols -- the coppola, or flat cap. \"I called my business 'La coppola storta' -- or the crooked cap -- to shine a light on their crooked ways,\" he says. \"After all, they have been threatening my family since before I was born.\"Salvatore Giuliano, a notorious Sicilian mobster. Agnello's uncle was kidnapped by Salvatore Giuliano -- one of the fiercest mobsters of his time -- and was only released several months after his family handed over substantial land holdings, jewels and cash. \"One day you would arrive at work and notice the padlock on your shop has been glued shut. That would be a first sign,\" he explains. \"Then the threatening letters come through the door,\" including one that his uncle received -- a poisoned note signed with a skull and cross.\"I even had a mobster come all the way from America when I wouldn't pay locally. He strong-armed me all around town, publicly,\" Agnello says.Although nowadays the mafia gives people like Agnello and Scimeca more room to breathe, some still feel they are never really safe.  \"The mafia never forgets,\" Scimeca said. \"But for Sicilians like me, if more of us continue to speak out and take a stand against their ways, the safer we will be.\"CNN's Milena Veselinovic contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Story highlightsBolt is the world 100m and 200m record holderHe retired after the IAAF World Championships in London  (CNN)A glorious sporting career has come to an end. Usain Bolt, an eight-time Olympic champion, the fastest man in history, retired after the IAAF World Championships in London.He is a sprinter who has broken records and left a legacy. We look into the numbers which made the 30-year-old Jamaican the greatest sprinter to have lived.     All four of the fastest 100m times in history belong to Bolt. Known in his early years as a prodigiously talented 200m runner, he burst onto the 100m scene by breaking the world record in New York (9.72) in 2008. Eleven weeks later, in Beijing, he improved on his time, clocking 9.69 as he claimed his first Olympic title. He has dipped under 10 seconds in the sport's blue riband event 52 times -- putting him fourth on the sub-10 seconds all-time list. But Bolt, who last lost in 2013, is a man who peaks for championships. Three of his quickest times have been achieved on his way to winning either Olympic or world gold.His times have been in decline over the years and the days of him breaking world records are clearly over. The gold-medal winning times aren't what they used to be, either -- from 9.58 in Berlin to 9.81 in Rio last year. Read MoreIn winning 100m bronze in London, his final solo race, he finished in 9.95 seconds. It was only the third time he had gone under 10 seconds this year. READ: Gatlin shocks the worldREAD: Farewell Bolt, a wonder of our sporting ageRead: Take our Usain Bolt quiz     Men of Bolt's size aren't usually speed freaks. His frame is meant to be an obstacle in an event which requires explosive power out of the blocks. \"We never saw prior to Usain Bolt a sprinter who is 6'5 running the 100m,\" former Olympic champion Michael Johnson tells CNN Sport. \"Typically, that type of athlete would not be able to get out of the blocks and get through the drive phase in the first 30m or so when short, powerful, massive pressure and power is what's required.\" With his height and weight, the world record holder would not look out of place on the basketball court. He is notably taller than his rivals, as well as the greats of the past.  Christian Coleman, the world silver medalist stands at 1.75m, while the new world champion Justin Gatlin is 1.85m.      Scientists have been studying the secret of Bolt's supersonic speed for years. He hit a top speed of 44.7.8 km/h between 60m and 80m during his world record 100m sprint in Berlin and is almost as explosive as smaller sprinters in the early stages of a 100m race.Once out of the transition phase, his height comes to his advantage -- the Olympic champion needs only 41 strides to cover 100 meters while other elite runners need 43 or 45. And once he has reached top speed, he is able to maintain his momentum more efficiently than others, which is crucial in a race won not by the person speeding up at the end but slowing down the least.     Bolt --  who since 2008 has contributed to 40% of the country's medals at Olympic Games and World Championships -- is as cherished as the late singer Bob Marley in his homeland.Over 30,000 watched him run his last race on home soil in June. But the world record holder is also universally loved. Not only is he one of the wealthiest sportsmen on the planet -- according to Forbes he is 23rd on the list of the highest-paid athletes in 2017 -- but he is also one of the most popular too, with over 7m Instagram followers and 4.7m on Twitter.",

READ: Can an NBA player become a PGA champ?After three bogeys in his first five holes, the point guard had to dig himself out of a considerable hole.And yet, even though his opening tee shot went horribly awry, there was at least an amusing irony in where it landed: a golf cart cup holder. \"That's probably a first on the tour,\" smiled Curry, renowned for his accuracy from long range.  Photos: Basketball's big bucksAlthough Stephen Curry (R) and LeBron James battled in the last two NBA Finals, their team contracts are on different playing fields. Two-time reigning MVP Curry is criminally shortchanged -- by NBA standards -- at $12.1 million this season, while LeBron lords over the list of top earners in the world's highest paying league. While James' position is expected, there are some eye-popping inclusions on this list. (Source: basketball-reference.com)Hide Caption 1 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 20: Harrison Barnes, $22.12 million \u2013 Barnes became excess luggage at Golden State once Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors. The free agent -- who endured a poor NBA Finals and was essentially the 12th man on the Team USA roster in Rio -- signed a four-year $94.4 million deal with Dallas. The Mavericks are depending on the 6-foot 8-inch 24-year-old to take the scoring load off veteran Dirk Nowitzki. (Note: No's 20 -15 will all earn $22.12 million this season, the maximum under the current salary cap for players with up to six years of experience).Hide Caption 2 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 19: Andre Drummond, $22.12 million \u2013 Drummond led the NBA in both offensive and defensive rebounds last year, averaging a total of 14.8 per game. He also made the All-NBA Third Team, confirming his status as a top-15 player in the league. The 6-foot 11-inch center was rewarded with a five-year max deal from the Pistons, worth over $127 million. Hide Caption 3 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 18: Chandler Parsons, $22.12 million  \u2013 Parsons, a small forward coming off a season at Dallas where he averaged 13.7 points and 4.7 rebounds, signed a staggering four-year $94 million deal with Memphis in July. Parsons has yet to make an All-Star team, or average more than 16.6 points in a season; maybe that's why 38-year-old Grizzlies owner Robert Pera tweeted a GIF of a child throwing money out a window the night of the deal.  Hide Caption 4 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo.17: Hassan Whiteside, $22.12 million  \u2013 Whiteside (#21) is the ultimate American redemption story. The seven-footer was drafted out of lowly Marshall University, and was cut by the Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies and even Al Mouttahed Tripoli of the Lebanese league before catching on with Miami in 2014. In a league run by \"small ball,\" Whiteside excels as a throwback center, averaging 3.68 blocks per game in 2016 -- the highest mark since 2000. He also recorded three triple-doubles -- tying LeBron James and James Harden -- earning him a four-year $98 million deal with the Heat in July.  Hide Caption 5 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 16: Anthony Davis, $22.12 million \u2013 Last season was supposed to be Davis' breakout campaign, but he sat out the last 14 games with knee and shoulder injuries as the Pelicans missed out on the playoffs. Davis has yet to endure a full NBA season and said he has been troubled by left shoulder pain since his rookie campaign. When healthy, however, he is the most dominant big man in the game, which is why New Orleans signed a five-year, $127 million extension to his deal in 2015. Hide Caption 6 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 15: Bradley Beal, $22.12 million  \u2013 Beal averaged 17.4 points per game on 39% three-point shooting with Washington last season, playing second fiddle to John Wall. Although Beal suffered a variety of niggling injuries which kept him on the bench for large chunks of the season, Washington rewarded him with a head-scratching five-year $127 million deal. Hide Caption 7 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 14 Chris Paul, $22.89 million \u2013 Paul is arguably the greatest Clipper of all time. Ever since the diminutive point guard took over LA's forgotten team five seasons ago, the Clippers have become a perennial playoff power -- a stark contrast to the four post-season appearances in the franchises' previous 27 years in the city. Thirty-one-year-old Paul has the option to terminate next season's salary of $24.3 million and test free agency, but has sustained two major injuries in the last three seasons.  Hide Caption 8 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 13 Dwight Howard, $23.18 million \u2013 Once a franchise player, Howard endured three lackluster years in Houston feeding off of James Harden's scraps. Though he will be entering his 13th NBA season, Howard is still only 30 and will look to rejuvenate his career in Atlanta. Plagued by injuries, the 6-foot 11-inch center's scoring sunk to 13.7 points per game last season, though he is still a rebounding force at 11.8 per game.  Hide Caption 9 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 12: Dwayne Wade; $23.2 million  \u2013 Entering his 14th year, the 34-year-old Wade is following a campaign where he notched 74 regular season games for the first time since 2011. But he also recorded a career-low in minutes (30.5 per game) and three-point shooting (a dismal 16%). Seeking star power, the Chicago Bulls signed the three-time champion to a two-year $47 million deal.  Hide Caption 10 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 11: Chris Bosh, $23.74 million  \u2013 Although Bosh's status as an NBA player is in doubt because of reoccurring blot clots in his lungs, he is on a guaranteed three-year deal with the Miami Heat for $75.8 million. Bosh and the Heat have severed ties, though the team will not release him before February 9 (a year after his last game) to claim salary cap relief. If Bosh plays another 25 games in the league -- and he is determined to make a comeback -- the Heat will be on the hook again.  Hide Caption 11 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 10: Damian Lillard, $24.33 million  \u2013 Two-time NBA All-Star Lillard is set to be a perennial fixture in the event -- no small feat coming out of the point-guard heavy Western Conference. Lillard's scoring jumped to 25.1 points per game during the regular season, but he really shined during the Blazers' 11 playoff games, averaging 26.5 points, 6.1 assists, 4.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 91% free throw shooting. If he keeps improving, the 26-year-old will be up for MVP consideration -- which is why Portland committed $120 million of guaranteed money  to keep him around until 2021.Hide Caption 12 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 9: Carmelo Anthony, $24.6 million \u2013 Since joining the Knicks in 2011 -- and signing two deals guaranteeing $138 million -- 'Melo has won just one playoff series. Anthony, however, is coming off a third consecutive Olympic gold medal performance and will work around a re-tooled team featuring Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah and last year's rookie sensation Kristaps Porzingis.  Hide Caption 13 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 8: Dirk Nowitski, $25 million \u2013 Thirty-eight-year-old Dirk Nowitzki is entering his 19th season as a Dallas Maverick and is surely the team's greatest player of all time. The future first-ballot Hall-Of-Famer and former league MVP already racked up $220 million in career earnings before signing a two-year deal last summer for $50 million. Call it a goodbye gift from Mavs owner Mark Cuban. Hide Caption 14 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 7: Al Horford, $26.54 million \u2013 After nine solid seasons in Atlanta, Horford decided he needed a change of scenery and moved north for greener pastures -- both in uniform and compensation. Horford signed a four-year, $113 million deal with Boston, which will take his total career earnings to more than $190 million by the time he hangs up his high-tops -- not bad for a 30-year-old with career highs of 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. (Note: No's 2 -- seven will all earn $26,540,100 this season, the maximum under the current salary cap for players with seven to nine years of experience). Hide Caption 15 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 6 Kevin Durant, $26.54 million \u2013 Only days after the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, the team was injected with a huge dose of goodwill. Durant opted to bolt Oklahoma City -- who happened to be the Warrior's biggest Western Conference threat -- for the Bay Area. The 6-foot 9-inch sharp shooter signed a two-year $54.3 million deal, but can leave Golden State in the off-season if things go awry.   Hide Caption 16 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 5: James Harden, $26.54 million \u2013 Harden -- who signed a four-year $118 million deal with the Houston Rockets in the off-season -- is the best one-on-one scorer in the NBA not named Steph Curry. The bearded gunner, who averaged a career-high 29-points-per-game last season, has been accused of selfish play and lackadaisical defense as his number have risen. But that didn't deter team owner Leslie Alexander. \"I don't think people appreciate how great he is, but we certainly do,\" he said at the signing. Hide Caption 17 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 4: Mike Conley, $26.54 million  \u2013 Memphis Grizzlies point guard Conley signed the most lucrative deal in NBA history during the off-season at five years and $153 million. Conley is a serviceable point guard, but hasn't made an All-Star team in nine NBA seasons. The deal is more a function of timing, as the NBA salary cap is about to lift off in the 2017-2018 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement is set to kick in.  Hide Caption 18 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 3: Russell Westbrook; $26.54 million \u2013 One could argue that Westbrook finally got what he wanted this summer: Full reign over a young, athletic team where every possession will start and end with his decision-making. The Thunder feared the worst when Kevin Durant skipped town, but Westbrook showed character by opting to stay in small market Oklahoma City -- not that the reported three-year, $85.7 million hurt. Westbrook has been a triple-double machine without Durant in the lineup, and -- barring injury -- he'll be in top MVP consideration this season. Hide Caption 19 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo 2: DeMar DeRozan, $26.54 million   \u2013 DeRozan (#10) is a spectacular scorer for Toronto, but featured only a bit role on Team USA's gold medal team this summer. No matter, the Raptors, who have a history of losing draft talent to free agency -- from Chris Bosh to Tracy McGrady to Vince Carter -- locked up the 27-year-old shooting guard to a five-year $137.5 million deal, the second-highest in NBA history.  Hide Caption 20 of 21 Photos: Basketball's big bucksNo. 1: LeBron James, $30.96 million \u2013 A Cleveland economist valued James' return to the city at $500 million -- and that was before he delivered a championship. It's possible that no one player has ever been worth more to his team than LeBron James is to the Cavaliers.

            "Although Stephen Curry (R) and LeBron James battled in the last two NBA Finals, their team contracts are on different playing fields. Two-time reigning MVP Curry is criminally shortchanged -- by NBA standards -- at $12.1 million this season, while LeBron lords over the list of top earners in the world's highest paying league. While James' position is expected, there are some eye-popping inclusions on this list. (Source: basketball-reference.com)",
            "No. 20: Harrison Barnes, $22.12 million \u2014 Barnes became excess luggage at Golden State once Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors. The free agent -- who endured a poor NBA Finals and was essentially the 12th man on the Team USA roster in Rio -- signed a four-year $94.4 million deal with Dallas. The Mavericks are depending on the 6-foot 8-inch 24-year-old to take the scoring load off veteran Dirk Nowitzki.

He also made the All-NBA Third Team, confirming his status as a top-15 player in the league. The 6-foot 11-inch center was rewarded with a five-year max deal from the Pistons, worth over $127 million.",
            "No. 18: Chandler Parsons, $22.12 million \u2014 Parsons, a small forward coming off a season at Dallas where he averaged 13.7 points and 4.7 rebounds, signed a staggering four-year $94 million deal with Memphis in July. Parsons has yet to make an All-Star team, or average more than 16.6 points in a season; maybe that's why 38-year-old Grizzlies owner Robert Pera tweeted a GIF of a child throwing money out a window the night of the deal.",
            "No.17: Hassan Whiteside, $22.12 million \u2014 Whiteside (#21) is the ultimate American redemption story. The seven-footer was drafted out of lowly Marshall University, and was cut by the Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies and even Al Mouttahed Tripoli of the Lebanese league before catching on with Miami in 2014. In a league run by \"small ball,\" Whiteside excels as a throwback center, averaging 3.68 blocks per game in 2016 -- the highest mark since 2000. He also recorded three triple-doubles -- tying LeBron James and James Harden -- earning him a four-year $98 million deal with the Heat in July.",

Davis has yet to endure a full NBA season and said he has been troubled by left shoulder pain since his rookie campaign. When healthy, however, he is the most dominant big man in the game, which is why New Orleans signed a five-year, $127 million extension to his deal in 2015.",

Ever since the diminutive point guard took over LA's forgotten team five seasons ago, the Clippers have become a perennial playoff power -- a stark contrast to the four post-season appearances in the franchises' previous 27 years in the city.

Bosh and the Heat have severed ties, though the team will not release him before February 9 (a year after his last game) to claim salary cap relief.

            "No. 10: Damian Lillard, $24.33 million \u2014 Two-time NBA All-Star Lillard is set to be a perennial fixture in the event -- no small feat coming out of the point-guard heavy Western Conference. Lillard's scoring jumped to 25.1 points per game during the regular season, but he really shined during the Blazers' 11 playoff games, averaging 26.5 points, 6.1 assists, 4.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 91% free throw shooting. If he keeps improving, the 26-year-old will be up for MVP consideration -- which is why Portland committed $120 million of guaranteed money  to keep him around until 2021.",

Call it a goodbye gift from Mavs owner Mark Cuban.",
            "No. 7: Al Horford, $26.54 million \u2014 After nine solid seasons in Atlanta, Horford decided he needed a change of scenery and moved north for greener pastures -- both in uniform and compensation. Horford signed a four-year, $113 million deal with Boston, which will take his total career earnings to more than $190 million by the time he hangs up his high-tops -- not bad for a 30-year-old with career highs of 18.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. (Note: No's 2 -- seven will all earn $26,540,100 this season, the maximum under the current salary cap for players with seven to nine years of experience).",
            "No. 6 Kevin Durant, $26.54 million \u2014 Only days after the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, the team was injected with a huge dose of goodwill. Durant opted to bolt Oklahoma City -- who happened to be the Warrior's biggest Western Conference threat -- for the Bay Area. The 6-foot 9-inch sharp shooter signed a two-year $54.3 million deal, but can leave Golden State in the off-season if things go awry.",
            "No. 5: James Harden, $26.54 million \u2014 Harden -- who signed a four-year $118 million deal with the Houston Rockets in the off-season -- is the best one-on-one scorer in the NBA not named Steph Curry. The bearded gunner, who averaged a career-high 29-points-per-game last season, has been accused of selfish play and lackadaisical defense as his number have risen. But that didn't deter team owner Leslie Alexander. \"I don't think people appreciate how great he is, but we certainly do,\" he said at the signing.",
            "No. 4: Mike Conley, $26.54 million \u2014 Memphis Grizzlies point guard Conley signed the most lucrative deal in NBA history during the off-season at five years and $153 million. Conley is a serviceable point guard, but hasn't made an All-Star team in nine NBA seasons. The deal is more a function of timing, as the NBA salary cap is about to lift off in the 2017-2018 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement is set to kick in.",
            "No. 3: Russell Westbrook; $26.54 million \u2014 One could argue that Westbrook finally got what he wanted this summer: Full reign over a young, athletic team where every possession will start and end with his decision-making. The Thunder feared the worst when Kevin Durant skipped town, but Westbrook showed character by opting to stay in small market Oklahoma City -- not that the reported three-year, $85.7 million hurt. Westbrook has been a triple-double machine without Durant in the lineup, and -- barring injury -- he'll be in top MVP consideration this season.",
            "No 2: DeMar DeRozan, $26.54 million \u2014 DeRozan (#10) is a spectacular scorer for Toronto, but featured only a bit role on Team USA's gold medal team this summer. No matter, the Raptors, who have a history of losing draft talent to free agency -- from Chris Bosh to Tracy McGrady to Vince Carter -- locked up the 27-year-old shooting guard to a five-year $137.5 million deal, the second-highest in NBA history.",
            "No. 1: LeBron James, $30.96 million \u2014 A Cleveland economist valued James' return to the city at $500 million -- and that was before he delivered a championship. It's possible that no one player has ever been worth more to his team than LeBron James is to the Cavaliers. Still, the NBA operates under a salary cap, and within those parameters James commanded the maximum this summer: Three years at $100 million. Look for 'Bron to opt-out of year three and reset his deal in 2018."

A marvel of this sporting age is one championship away from retirement, 30 seconds or so from consigning himself to history. The age of Usain Bolt is nearly over and so the present must be cherished. Bolt, the fastest man in history, one of the greatest sportsmen to have ever lived, will run his last race at the World Athletics Championships in London.Follow @cnnsport\n\nHe will retire having left his mark on history: the first man to win three 100m Olympic titles, the world record holder in both the 100m and 200m, a winner of 23 major gold medals.

No man has run with such speed or enjoyed such longevity. The 30-year-old's extraordinary achievements will be looked back upon with wonder by future generations.They will watch replays of the young Bolt of Beijing, hushing the crowd on the starting blocks before bang... history -- his arms raised, thumping his chest, clocking a barely believable 9.69 seconds to shatter the 100m world record.The 21-year-old's speed was jaw-dropping, the other eight men in a distinguished field left trailing in his wake. They were in a different race and this 6ft 5in newcomer was from another planet. Two more gold medals followed on the Chinese capital's lightning-quick track, his 2008 coronation as sprint king complete. Hearts and imaginations were captured and he has been loved ever since. Bolt wins the 100m Olympic gold in BeijingREAD: What's it like being Bolt's best friendThe irreplaceable joker-in-chiefThere have been so many glorious moments.Berlin in 2009, when the Jamaican reduced his 100m and 200m world records further; London 2012 when all three of his Olympic sprint titles were retained.Back to Beijing in 2015, older, ailing, but managing to fend off the challenge of twice-banned Justin Gatlin to retain his grip on 100m and 200m world titles. Then there was Rio last summer, his Olympic farewell ending in further triumph.Those who will live in a Bolt-less sporting age will wish they had been there, just as we all want to be inside London's Olympic Stadium on Saturday when the history-maker lines up in the 100m final for his last competitive individual race. The 4x100m relay on August 12 is likely to be his grand encore. The final act of this gilded athletic tale.There is little point asking who will take over once he is gone. No-one can clown around on the start line and execute excellence like track and field's joker-in-chief. As the eight-time Olympic champion himself said this week, it will take more than one athlete to fill his vibrant void. Savor him now because Bolt is irreplaceable.Bolt of Jamaica celebrates winning the Men's 4 x 100m relay at the Rio Olympics Read: \"Tokyo 2020 is too far away\"\"It's a simple formula that doesn't actually work,\" says Michael Johnson, whose 200m world record was thought unbreakable until Bolt broke it ... twice.We asked him how his sport will cope without its showman. \"The idea that you have an athlete who's the best there's ever been in the sport, who just happens to have an electric personality as well,\" explains Johnson, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, \"you're not going to replace that.\"That's not going to come around again. It would be ridiculous to look for it and, I think, the sport has made a mistake by relying on that for the last eight years because he was never going to last forever.\"Becoming a legendHoping that the show would go on and on is perhaps forgivable. It is easy to forget that even the seemingly superhuman age, just like the rest of us, no matter how effortless and enjoyable they make winning seem. A showman supreme, a magnetic personality, he has been likened to Muhammad Ali, though he has stayed away from politics. He has continued to compete because he knew only sustained success would see him ranked alongside the three-time heavyweight champion and Pele, regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.He wanted to be \"among the greatest,\" he said before going on to achieve an unprecedented \"triple-triple\" of Olympic sprint golds in Rio, though he has lost the 4x100m relay gold he won in Beijing as a result of team-mate Nesta Carter's positive doping test. \"I am a legend,\" Bolt has said a number of times, after winning three golds in London, and again in Rio. It would be braggadocio from anyone else but, as he himself has explained, he has proved himself to be the best for nearly a decade. \"I feel that if you have done something, it is not bragging,\" he has said.  But even Ali, like most in life, had to comeback from lows. It added to his legend. Bolt, however, has excelled at major championships no matter what his form or fitness. His only failure was a false start in the 2011 World Championships 100m final. Yes, he has slowed over the years and the frequency of injuries have increased.  At times, the country boy who began racing to buy his mother a washing machine has also struggled for motivation after achieving more than he ever dreamed. But even Bolt beyond his peak has always managed to be better than the rest. The iconic image of Bolt while competing in the men's 100m in Rio\"He's just a phenomenally talented athlete,\" says Johnson. \"He's absolutely been tested. I don't think that you could discount anything that he's done over the years. Some of the fastest times in the 100m and 200m have come about during his career.\"Where does Usain Bolt rank among the sporting greats? Have your say on our Facebook page'You have blessed us with Usain Bolt'Bolt salutes the crowd after running his final race in Jamaica The sprint freak from a remote Jamaican village has already said his goodbyes to his own; a five-hour farewell in the national stadium in Kingston, a celebration which started with prayers from an ordained minister. \"We thank you God, for you have truly been good to Jamaica,\" it began. \"You have blessed us with doctor, the honorable Usain St Leo Bolt, the embodiment of sportsmanship, who remind us of the gumption and indomitable spirit of the Jamaican people.\"Thirty-five thousand people watched their most famous son run his 84th and last race on home soil. Bolt, so those on the inside say, would have preferred for that to have been his farewell.He is most comfortable at home, living as ordinary a life as a millionaire superstar can. He trains in a public gym, dances in nightclubs. There is no need for private security. It is when he steps onto foreign soil that people become agog by his presence, which means life on the road is mostly spent in hotels. \"In Jamaica you take it for granted that you can see him every day,\" says Colin Reid, a photographer who has followed Bolt's career with the Jamaican Observer. \"In the international fraternity, they're awestruck. But he's just like one of us. He lives in Kingston. He's approachable, he's amiable, I see him around a lot.\"What you see is what you get, says Reid, something Bolt has also repeated in numerous reports. He enjoys partying, he is still the boy a teacher once described as being full of \"tricks and stories.\"Bolt the thinker, the intellectual Hidden behind the tomfoolery on the track, however, is a thoughtfulness, a keen athletics brain and an intense competitive streak. He is a smiling assassin. His desire to be the best is such that he no longer plays Call of Duty as he cannot cope with not being as good as he used to be. \"He's much different when he's in a much closer setting,\" says Johnson. \"Unfortunately, I don't think the world has been able to see that he is very thoughtful, highly intellectual about athletics, about sprinting. \"Most people think that he goes out there and that it's easy and he doesn't really care if he wins or loses, that he's just having fun.\"Bolt has said he allowed a film crew to follow him in the year leading up to Rio for the movie \"I Am Bolt\" so people could see how hard he worked; vomit-inducing track sessions, suffering in the gym, early-morning wake-up calls. Ed Moses, a two-time Olympic champion who dominated the 400m hurdles in a 122-race unbeaten decade, calls Bolt a mathematician, though when later asked his agent Ricky Simms admits he has never heard his client described as such. \"He's an intellectual guy,\" says Moses. \"He's thought a lot about what it's going to take to get him through the first 40m. He had the tools and resources to put it together and that's why he's great.\"Unlike many of history's great talents, Bolt has been appreciated in his own time. For nearly a decade he has radiated in a sport darkened by doping. Nine of the 30 fastest 100m times, including the top four, are Bolt's. The other 21 marks on that list have been run by athletes who have, at some point, tested positive for doping. QUIZ: How well do you know Usain Bolt?Questions have been raised about Bolt, especially when he first emerged in Beijing. After all, athletes as tall as him are not supposed to run that fast, but the man himself is not bothered by such talk. He is different, a speedster whose long levers allow him to cover the 100m in just 41 strides when others need a few steps more and a little more time.  And so, in under 30 seconds, or 132 steps, Bolt's career will be over. He will be out of sight, as he has been to his competitors for most of his career. There will be no fooling around, no celebratory \"To Da World,\" no electrifying nights under the floodlights. It will never be the same again.",

(CNN)In the summer of 1987, I was a teenage golfer in love with the sport. I had no desire to be a great golfer, but I was besotted with the whole sport; the players, the history, the records and the magic. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe players themselves were a particular fascination, and the great writing that shone a light on how these amazing men and women dared to dream big, and win on the biggest stages.That summer stood out, with the incredible achievements of two English golfers; Laura Davies' win in the US Women's Open and then the colossal achievement of Nick Faldo, in reeling off 18 consecutive pars, in the mists of Scotland's Muirfield, to win the biggest title of all: the Open Championship. It was comic book stuff. I'd attended my first Irish Open a few weeks prior, and was transfixed by the golf of Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and Faldo. These guys were giants. Faldo's story, however, held a particular allure.READ: 'Woods made winning look easy... It's not,' says SpiethRead MoreHe had come back into the limelight that year with a victory in the Spanish Open. All the talk was about how he had completely re-modeled his swing, taking almost two years to perfect a movement that could withstand intense sporting pressure.Faldo had been mocked for his efforts.

So I found myself, in Royal Porthcawl in late July, caddying for one of the world's greatest players in the Pro Am for the Senior Open Championship.I've had the pleasure of working with Faldo over the last 10 years. I've been lucky enough to visit and interview him at his home in Florida and root around his collection of golf clubs.

Read MoreIn April 2016 he caused amusement by taking the wheel to drive US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama to lunch during their state visit to Britain. That came a month before he withdrew from attending commemorations of the Battle of Jutland in Orkney upon the advice of his doctor.Philip's health has long been monitored not just by the palace but by the British media and public. Despite a recent hospitalization for an undisclosed infection, Prince Philip is in good health for a man in his late '90s.During an interview with the BBC on the occasion of his 90th birthday in 2011, Philip said it was time to take a step back from his responsibilities.\"I reckon I've done my bit, I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say,\" he said.However, Philip continued to appear by the Queen's side. In 2012, he was with Elizabeth as she undertook a busy schedule of public engagements across the UK to mark her 60 years on the throne.'Constant strength and guide'In a diamond jubilee address to parliament in March 2012, the Queen said the support of her own family had been \"beyond measure\" throughout her reign. And she paid special tribute to the contribution of her husband, who accompanied her on so many of her official visits. The Queen and Prince Philip arrive at the Diamond Jubilee Pageant in the grounds of Windsor Castle in May 2012.\"Prince Philip is, I believe, well-known for declining compliments of any kind. But throughout he has been a constant strength and guide,\" she said.Phillip jokingly referred to himself as \"the world's most experienced plaque unveiler\" -- but as a child born in Greece into the turmoil of inter-war Europe, a naval officer decorated for heroism during World War II, the Duke of Edinburgh has been anything but. When peace came, Philip remained in the navy, but rekindled an earlier friendship with Elizabeth that quickly blossomed into a public romance.The Queen and Prince Philip wave to guests attending celebrations in London for her 90th birthday in 2016.Philip and Princess Elizabeth were married in Westminster Abbey in November 1947, after Philip became a naturalized British subject, and shortly afterward he returned to naval duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.Newly-appointed as Duke of Edinburgh, Philip had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the queen's father, George VI became ill. The king died on February 6, 1952 while Philip and Elizabeth were on an official trip to Kenya. It was Philip who broke the news to his wife.'Fantastic life partner'The early years of the couple's marriage saw the prince enjoy the height of his popularity. On their first major tour together -- to Canada and the US in 1951 -- huge crowds turned out to see the couple.The duke himself spoke of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family, saying he took on patronages -- including the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, which he created to recognize community service -- out of duty rather than passion.Prince Philip, Duke Of Edinburgh, waving through the open roof of a car on May 1948. \"I didn't want to be president of the World Wildlife Fund,\" he said in an interview in 1992. \"I was asked to do it. I'd much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly.\"Philip has had no constitutional roles other than being a privy counselor, but the queen in 1952 declared that he had \"place, preeminence and precedence\" next to herself \"on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by act of Parliament.\" He has been by the Queen's side as she has traveled for state visits around the world and helped her welcome a host of dignitaries.Their relationship was discussed in a recent ITV documentary about Prince Philip and the jubilee of his much-vaunted Duke of Edinburgh award. Sophie Wessex, wife of the couple's youngest son, Prince Edward, revealed how the pair enjoy each other's company after 69 years of marriage.The Queen, US President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Prince Philip pose together at Windsor in 2016. \"He has been a fantastic life partner for her. I think it's maybe a fairly lonely job being queen,\" she told ITV.\"As a female in the top job I think to have somebody you can lean on, you can discuss things with, she can be honest with behind closed doors ... I don't think she could have chosen better. And they make each other laugh, which is half the battle, isn't it?\"Even now Philip will continue to be a patron or member of hundreds of charitable organizations. And he will remain the Queen's support and best companion in the private sphere.",

        "content": "(CNN)Italy will deploy two military ships to Libya in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe, the Italian government announced Wednesday. The move is Italy's latest effort to counter the country's migration surge. According to the International Organization for Migration, 94,802 migrants have reached Italian shores so far this year, while 2,221 migrants have died attempting the treacherous Mediterranean crossing from Libya to Italy.A rescue that came too lateThe Italian Parliament passed a bill on Wednesday that green-lighted Libya's original request for help, sent in a letter from the Prime Minister of Libya's UN-recognized Government of National Accord on July 27.According to an Italian Navy spokesperson, the two ships -- a patrol vessel and a technical and logistical support unit -- could be deployed to Libyan waters as early as next week.Libya is a popular jumping-off point for migrants hoping to reach European shores. Many of them are fleeing war and persecution while others are seeking better economic opportunities. The North African country is a well-established base for a human trafficking operation that sees smugglers operating with more ease because of the country's lack of effective central governance. Read MoreAccording to the Italian Parliament, the deployment is \"supporting the Libyan security forces in their activities to monitor and contrast illegal migration and the smuggling of human beings.\"Emmanuel Macron says France will set up refugee 'hot spots' in LibyaBut some nongovernmental organizations are concerned the move will expose migrants to far more danger. Amnesty International heavily criticized the initiative, saying that \"deploying warships to police Libyan waters will expose refugees to horrific abuse,\" in a statement released on Wednesday. Gauri Van Gulik, Amnesty International deputy Europe director, said: \"Italy, along with other EU member states, should be focusing on increasing its search and rescue operations. Instead it has chosen to shirk its responsibilities and endanger the very people it says it is trying to help, including by providing military cover and support to the Libyan coast guard, whose reckless and abusive conduct against refugees and migrants during interceptions has been repeatedly documented.\"A 'code of conduct'It's the second move the Italian government has taken on migration in a week.On Monday, Italy's Parliament passed a \"code of conduct\" for NGOs operating search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean. The measure requests that NGO rescue boats take armed police onto their vessels in an effort to crack down on human smugglers. Three of the eight humanitarian groups agreed to its terms. Doctors Without Borders refused to sign the code over concerns it could increase deaths at sea.Since the start of this year, 2,385 migrants have died on the central Mediterranean route, according to the International Organization for Migration; 114,287 migrants have reached European shores, of which 85% are Italian arrivals.",

Such has been the Jamaican's influence on track and field that Sebastian Coe, president of track and field's governing body the IAAF, said this week that Bolt's impact on athletics is comparable to what Muhammad Ali achieved in boxing.

        "content": "Story highlightsPolicy differences have split the UK CabinetDivergent views blur negotiating positionMay weakened after election lossesLondon (CNN)After the most turbulent year of her political life, British Prime Minister Theresa May is currently enjoying the fresh air and tranquility of the Swiss mountains. May interrupted her three-week walking vacation only to participate in the commemorations of the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele earlier this week. While Downing Street insists she remains in charge of the country even from her Swiss chalet, her absence from the political fray has allowed a very public row to escalate within her Cabinet over Brexit.Chancellor Philip Hammond, perhaps taking advantage of the power vacuum, called for a transition period for Britain's immigration rules after the country formally leaves the European Union in March 2019, to allow businesses and workers some time to adjust to an end to EU rules on free movement of citizens. Hammond, who campaigned against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, told business leaders (and the BBC in a subsequent interview) that EU citizens would still be able to come to the UK after Brexit. \"Many things would look similar\" the day after Britain left the EU, he said.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond has advocated a Brexit transition deal.In May's absence, Hammond has built up support for his position from fellow ministers who fear that a \"cliff edge\" drop in skilled labor from the EU will damage the British economy. That has infuriated two leading proponents of Brexit, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. They insisted this week that freedom of movement must end on March 29, 2019, the date when Britain formally leaves the EU. In an attempt to defuse the spat, May's spokesman insisted that free movement will end in March 2019. Read MoreJUST WATCHEDMay: Free movement to Britain will end in 2019ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMay: Free movement to Britain will end in 2019 01:41But the issue may be one of semantics: certainly the door to a transition deal remains firmly open. Former Conservative leader William Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday that Hammond's plan would save the UK from \"disaster\" and that he deserved \"great credit\" for putting it forward.British Cabinet ministers have always taken different positions on Europe -- the issue has been a faultline for the Conservative Party for decades. Since the referendum, those differences were acknowledged but the Prime Minister managed to unite both sides while she was at her most powerful, in the months after taking office amid the wreckage of the Brexit referendum last year.She was able to set the terms for Brexit -- as she did in her Lancaster House speech in January, when she made clear Britain would make a clean break with the EU. Yet the \"snap\" general election this year changed everything: losing her overall Commons majority has left May in a weak position, with no authority to impose Cabinet discipline.UK's Brexit position still unclearThe Cabinet infighting over immigration means that, five months after May triggered Article 50, marking the start of the two-year Brexit process, Britain's position on the most important issue facing the country is unclear. If the Cabinet -- which is supposed to adhere to rules on collective responsibility -- cannot unite around a common position, how is the British government supposed to present one to Brussels and negotiate its way out of the EU?Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has demanded greater clarity on the UK position.It's not as if the negotiations have gone well so far. There have been two rounds of talks since the election in June, with Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's senior negotiator Michel Barnier failing to make a breakthrough on the \"divorce settlement\", the cost to the UK of leaving the EU, which must be agreed before talks can start on any other issue. Barnier has insisted that Britain must clarify its position on the financial settlement by the time the third round of talks starts at the end of August. The next phase of the talks, which will tackle a future free trade deal between Britain and Europe and take in the thorny issue of freedom of movement, is due to begin in just over eight weeks. The public fighting among British ministers will be lapped up by EU negotiators, who will know they can go into that round of talks from a position of strength against a divided team.May's rivals circlingThe Cabinet turmoil is unlikely to relent. None of the ministers involved are showing signs of backing down. Hammond has spent the weeks since the election making public interventions on Brexit and is known to harbor ambitions to succeed May as leader of their party. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, center left, could be angling for May's position.Likewise, Foreign Secretary Johnson would almost certainly make a leadership bid if May resigned or was ousted -- not an unlikely scenario given the Prime Minister's current weak position. Her three most recent predecessors as Conservative prime ministers were all brought down over Europe, and the longer the disarray over the UK's position continues, the more likely it is she will be the fourth.Given the Cabinet infighting and doubts over her own authority, it is perhaps surprising that the Prime Minister has taken such a long vacation -- although no doubt she needed one after her election calamity. While in Switzerland, she could have the opportunity to examine that country's own arrangements with the EU, which allow for enhanced access to the European single market but flexibility on freedom of movement that still gives local people priority over jobs, all while remaining outside the bloc. It is a deal that would no doubt have the backing of many in her Cabinet, if only she had the authority to impose it.",

(CNN)NFL star Michael Bennett was not singled out nor detained because of his race during an incident that occurred in Las Vegas after a major prizefight last month, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Friday.Lombardo said the Seattle Seahawks defensive lineman --  who has alleged a police officer pointed a gun at his head and threatened to shoot him -- was held because of his actions in the aftermath of a reported shooting stood out.As for the allegation that members of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department used a pointed gun while detaining Bennett, the sheriff said: \"There is no evidence that this happened.\"In one of several police body cam videos released Friday, Bennett, who is in the back of a patrol car, complains that his cuffs are too tight, and when officers come to loosen them he says an officer pointed the gun at his head while he was on the ground. An officer heard on the video says no one did so. Bennett says, \"The other officer did, sir.\" It is unclear which officer Bennett is referring to in the video.Read MoreMichael Bennett: Seahawks could be 'wearing the patch with No. 72 on it' In another video he says an officer had the gun to the back of his head and was \"saying he's going to blow my head off.\"\"We have not been able to confirm that statement,\" Lombardo said, adding that the officer could be heard giving Bennett profanity-punctuated orders to move his arms and hands.The detaining officer failed to activate his body camera and could be subject to disciplinary action, the sheriff said. That officer did have his weapon drawn, video shows. Bennett's attorney disputed that the videos released Friday rule out race as a factor.\"It does not disprove in any way what Michael Bennett says happened to him,\" John Burris told CNN. \"He was a large black man running away from what he thought were gunshots, as were many others, and there was no lawful basis for him being detained.\"Bennett is 6-foot-4 and weighs 274 pounds, according to the NFL.\"The video confirms what happened and we don't dispute that. We disagree with the conclusions,\" Burris said.Police responded to open letter from BennettEarlier this month, the 31-year-old Bennett was extremely emotional when he gave his version of the events that followed the August 26 fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr.\"I'm just lucky to be here to be able to speak about it. At any moment, I could've made the wrong decision whether to move, or (if police) felt like I was resisting or doing something wrong, and the Seahawks would be wearing the patch with No. 72 on it,\" he said, referencing a common way NFL teams memorialize players. Bennett spoke to reporters in early September after tweeting an open letter alleging mistreatment by police.Police opened an investigation after that, Lombardo said. Bennett only filed a complaint with police in the past three days, Lombardo said. Two officers who detained Bennett were Hispanic and a third was black, Lombardo said, disputing the accusation that the detention was racially motivated.Bennett's actions stood out from other people, Lombardo said. The sheriff added that two other patrons were detained. They also were minorities. In one video an officer explains to Bennett that he drew suspicion because, as officers shouted for people to stay down and not move, he started running.  Bennett tells an officer he ran because someone said to run.The NFL player was detained for about 10 minutes until police determined there was no shooting, the sheriff added. Lombardo said authorities reviewed 800 videos from that night from multiple sources including surveillance cameras, individuals recording on cell phones and police body cams. About a quarter of those were pertinent to a police investigation, .A video of the incident released earlier this month begins with Bennett facedown on the ground outside a casino, an officer cuffing Bennett's hands behind his back.\"I wasn't doing nothing, man,\" Bennett implores in the video. \"I was here with friends. They told us to get out. Everybody ran. Can you answer my question, sir?\"There was no shooting; Lombardo said some stanchions holding up ropes to set up lines were knocked on tiled floor.The letterIn his letter, Bennett said his daughters, Peyton, Blake and Ollie, were on his mind as he was being stopped for \"being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" \"All I could think was, 'I'm going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin is somehow a threat.' My life flashed before my eyes as I thought of my girls. Would I ever play with them again? Or watch them have kids? Or be able to kiss my wife again and tell her I love her?\" he wrote. Video from the incident shows Bennett telling an officer, \"I wasn't doing nothing, man,\"One officer made it hard for him to breathe by putting a knee in his back, he wrote. His fingers went numb during his detention because of the handcuffs being too tight, Bennett said.He said he asked officers why he was being held, but they never answered him. In the videos, police officers explained to Bennett they thought they had an active shooter and didn't have time to have a conversation with him after they chased him. Bennett, in his open letter, wrote: \"Equality doesn't live in this country and no matter how much money you make, what job title you have, or how much you give, when you are seen as a 'Nigger,' you will be treated that way.\"Bennett, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, is considering a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officers, Burris said earlier this month, calling the incident \"Exhibit A as to how every black man rich, famous or poor, unarmed and innocent, can be falsely detained, arrested or even shot and killed by the police.\"Bennett signs $31.5 million deal with the SeahawksCNN's Eliott C.

Their actions came a day after huge crowds massed in Barcelona, the regional capital, for a final campaign rally by independence supporters, many waving the distinctive Catalan flag.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont gave a rousing call for people to vote despite the obstacles.\"We are people who have experience with difficulties, and every difficultly makes us stronger,\" he said. \"Friends, so that victory is definite, on Sunday, let's dress up in referendum (clothes) and leave home prepared to change history, to end the process and start progress, social progress, economic progress and cultural and national progress.\"JUST WATCHEDCatalonia: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonia: What you need to know 01:10Spain's central government has issued stern warnings against the referendum, which the country's highest court has barred as unconstitutional. It has seized ballot papers and drafted thousands of extra police, or Guardia Civil, in a bid to prevent it.Read MoreOn Saturday, Guardia Civil officers raided the Catalan government's telecommunications and information technology center, Joan Maria Piqu\u00e9, the international communications director for the government of Catalonia, told CNN.The raid was intended to stop the use of vote-counting software linked to Sunday's referendum, Piqu\u00e9 said, adding that the Catalan government has an alternative to the software. A day earlier, a Spanish court ordered Google to remove a voting location app from its Play Store, claiming it was helping Catalan separatists organize in advance of the vote. Parents organize a youth fair to take place inside a Barcelona school over the weekend in hopes of ensuring it remains open until Sunday.Across the region, 2,315 polling stations are expected to open, mostly inside schools, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told reporters Friday. Spain's central government said Friday that the regional Catalan police, the Mossos d'Esquadra, would be responsible for removing people from polling stations in a nonviolent way. The Guardia Civil were stationed on ships in the port of Barcelona in case they were needed.Catalan newspapers reported Saturday that the Mossos were going to schools where polling was set to take place and informing people there that if they were not holding legitimate activities, the facilities would be closed. Jos\u00e9 Maria Salvatierra, a 55-year-old public worker serving as a polling coordinator at one school, told CNN that parents had planned activities such as soccer games and karaoke discos over the weekend so police would have no legitimate reason to close the schools. Parents had also arranged to sleep in shifts on site as an additional precaution, he said. \"What we want, most of all, is to be able to vote,\" Salvatierra said. \"Then, if 'yes' or 'no', it's up to each person.\"Volunteers cook giant dishes of paella to feed those occupying one Barcelona school on Saturday.Increased tensionsPublic support for the referendum within Catalonia, a wealthy region in Spain's northeast, has become increasingly vocal as the vote has neared.More than 5.3 million voters are on the electoral roll, according to the Catalan government. They will be asked to respond yes or no to the question: \"Do you want Catalonia to be an independent state, in the form of a Republic?\"Reflecting the divergent views in Catalonia, a small anti-independence rally was held Saturday in central Barcelona, with participants waving Spanish flags and chanting, \"Catalonia is Spain.\" The crowd of people, some waving Catalonia's flag, but many hoisting Spain's, grew to fill the square in front of city hall. Protestors tried a few times to pull down a pro-referendum banner hanging from city hall and, failing, settled for planting the flag of Spain just below it.

On Friday, Joan Maria Piqu\u00e9, international communications director for the government of Catalonia, told CNN that police entered the offices of a company that works for Google to execute the Catalonia high court order to delete the \"On Votar 1-Oct\" app and that some people were held for a few hours.Google also was ordered to block other future applications put forward by the developer, which had used an email that includes the vote's date.A Google spokesperson told CNN that Google doesn't have an office in Barcelona and no one from the company has been detained. In a statement, Google Spain wrote: \"We only remove content from our platforms to comply with a valid court order or when it violates our policies.\"Still, the independence movement continued to gather steam on Friday night, as thousands of people marched through the streets of Barcelona amid the growing threats from the central Spanish government.Read MoreCatalonia's separatist government is adamant it will go ahead with Sunday's referendum despite the country's highest court barring it as unconstitutional.

Mobile phones have also been seized.The Spanish Data Protection Agency said in a statement that people working in polling stations could be fined up to 300,000 euros ($354,000) for doing so.Despite the government's warnings, Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull told reporters that there would be 2,315 polling stations where people can vote, mostly inside schools. Jos\u00e9 Maria Salvatierra, a 55-year-old public worker is a polling coordinator at one of those schools. He told CNN that parents have planned activities such as soccer games and karaoke discos over the weekend so that police wouldn't have a legal reason to close the schools. Parents have coordinated to sleep at schools in shifts as an additional precaution. \"What we want, most of all, is to be able to vote. Then, if 'Yes' or 'No' it's up to each person,\" Salvatierra said.

As F1 bids farewell to the Sepang International Circuit after 19 seasons, Sebastian Vettel could well kiss goodbye to his 2017 title hopes if he doesn't dent Lewis Hamilton's lead soon. For much of the season it has been the Ferrari driver who has had the upper hand. The German led by 25 points after the Monaco Grand Prix in May and by 14 following victory at July's Hungarian Grand Prix but now it is Hamilton in the ascendancy following a blistering run of form. The Briton has won all three races since returning from the summer break taking the checkered flag in Belgium, Italy, and most recently in Singapore.READ: Ferrari nightmare hands Hamilton dream winRead MoreHamilton took full advantage of Vettel's calamitous start at the Marina Bay Street Circuit to win the race extending his lead in the drivers' championship from three points to 28 with six races remaining.     \"The last two races were not good -- we are not happy,\" Vettel told reporters ahead of Sunday's crucial race. \"In Monza we didn't do our best and equally Mercedes were very strong ... it's mostly in Singapore where we didn't race. Not a great day as you can imagine but the response from the whole team has been very positive.\"There's not much assessment necessary, we weren't happy but we move on ... what's done is done. You have to look at what's coming and the car is strong.\" Vettel and Ferrari will take heart from their respective records in Sepang -- Vettel has won four races at the circuit -- more than any other driver -- and Ferrari boasts seven victories to Mercedes' one. Hamilton won the German constructor's only race to date in 2014 and was desperately unlucky not to win a second last year -- his engine blew up on lap 40 of the 56-lap race while leading, gifting Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo victory. \"The title race has changed hugely\"@alanbaldwinf1 talks to @AmandaDCNN about the drama at Sunday's #SingaporeGP https://t.co/bdUjyhWwDB pic.twitter.com/yb2Uzlf23m\u2014 CNN Sport (@cnnsport) September 18, 2017 But even if another engine mishap befalls Hamilton, the three-time world champion is very much in the box seat after Singapore, says Alan Baldwin, Reuters motorsport correspondent. \"I think Lewis is a massive step closer to that fourth title that he wants,\" Baldwin told CNN. \"You can't take anything for granted in F1 but you have to say Lewis can finish second in the next four races and Vettel would have to win all four just to be on equal terms.\"I can't see Lewis finishing second in the next four races -- I think he'll win a few of them. So if nothing goes wrong with the car then he's in a really strong position.\" Gasly debuts at Sepang swansongAs Vettel looks to get his title bid back on track in Malaysia, another driver, Pierre Gasly, will be finding his F1 feet. The Red Bull reserve driver and reigning GP2 champion will replace Russia's Daniil Kvyat at Toro Rosso for the next two races, the Italian team announced earlier in the week. \"It feels amazing, honestly. Starting my first F1 race this weekend is a dream come true,\" Gasly told reporters in Malaysia ahead of Friday's practice session. \"There is no real target. I'm here to learn as quickly as possible. I need to take one session at a time.

READ: How crashing out helps win races Malaysia has hosted some epic tussles down the years. A demanding track configuration coupled with torrential downpours have combined to produce some memorable races -- notably in 2001 where Michael Schumacher led a Ferrari one-two in a chaotic wet/dry thriller.There has also been controversy. In 2013, Vettel famously ignored team orders and overtook Red Bull teammate and race leader Mark Webber before taking the checkered flag. The Australian was furious.Sepang holds fonder memories for others who have recorded personal milestones at the track.Eddie Irvine won the first-ever Malaysian Grand Prix in 1999 -- the Northern Irishman's fourth and final F1 victory -- while in 2003, Fernando Alonso finished third to claim the first of his 97 podiums. The same day, Kimi Raikkonen celebrated his first F1 win -- although the Finn wasn't getting too misty-eyed about the race's demise when asked on Thursday.  \"To be honest, I don't know if we're going to miss it. It's a nice circuit but the only thing you see is the airport, the hotel next to the airport and the circuit, so you can choose from that what you're going to miss,\" Raikkonen said.Visit CNN.com/motorsport for more news and featuresConversely, Gasly's new teammate Carlos Sainz will be sad to see it go.\"It's probably one of the best track layouts -- fast corners, and it's one of the most physically demanding,\" Sainz said, referring to the intense heat and humidity. \"We will definitely miss it.

Vettel did squeak onto the podium behind the Mercedes duo, but his title lead had slipped away. Drivers' title race after round 13 Hamilton 238 points Vettel 235 points Bottas 197 points",
            "Marina Bay Street Circuit: Ferrari crashes out \u2014 Disaster strikes for Ferrari in Singapore as both Vettel and Raikkonen crash out on the opening lap -- Raikkonen hit his teammate after colliding with Max Verstappen at the start. Lewis Hamilton, who started from fifth, avoids trouble and quickly assumes the lead which he holds to the checkered flag. The win, his third at the Singapore GP extends the Briton's lead over Vettel to 28 points. Drivers' title race after round 14 Hamilton 263 points Vettel 235 points Bottas 212 points",
            "Sepang International Circuit: Verstappen makes more history \u2014 Max Verstappen celebrates after a superb victory at the Malaysian Grand Prix. The Red Bull driver had endured a miserable run of luck in 2017 with seven retirements in the 14 previous grands prix.  But any disappointment was banished in Malaysia as he sped to a second career F1 win. The Dutchman, who turned 20 on September 30, was already the youngest-ever F1 race winner . With victory in Malaysia he is now the second youngest winner too. Lewis Hamilton was a distant second to Verstappen with Daniel Ricciardo finishing third. Sebastian Vettel crossed the line in fourth after starting in last place, which all means that Hamilton extends his championship lead over Vettel to 34 points. Drivers' title race after round 15 Hamilton 281 points Vettel 247 points Bottas 222 points",
            "Suzuka: Hamilton closes in on fourth title \u2014 Lewis Hamilton took a giant step towards a fourth world title at the Japanese Grand Prix. The Briton led from start to finish to scoop his eighth win of the season while Sebastian Vettel suffered a DNF, limping out with engine issues at the start of the race. The Red Bull pairing of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo enjoyed another good weekend, finishing second and third respectively. Hamilton's victory means he now has a 59-point lead with four races remaining and will clinch the 2017 drivers' championship if he outscores Vettel by 16 points at the US Grand Prix in Austin on October 22. Drivers' title race after round 16 Hamilton 306 points Vettel 247 points Bottas 234 points",
            "Circuit of the Americas: Hamilton sprints to victory \u2014 Lewis Hamilton wins his fifth race in six grands prix to extend his lead to 66 points over Sebastian Vettel. The German finished second and still has a mathematical chance of winning the 2017 world championship, but Hamilton could wrap up the title at the Mexico Grand Prix on October 29.

            "Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez: Hamilton makes history \u2014 Lewis Hamilton wins the 2017 world championship to claim his fourth F1 title. The Mercedes driver finished ninth to secure the two points he needed to guarantee Vettel could not catch him in the last two races. After the two collided at the start of the race, Vettel fought back to eventually finish second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Hamilton was ninth. Verstappen's third F1 win was overshadowed by the towering achievements of Hamilton who became the most successful British driver of all time and only the fifth man in F1 history to win four world championships. Drivers' title race after round 18 Hamilton 333 points Vettel 277 points Bottas 262 points",
            "Interlagos: Vettel back to winning ways \u2014 Sebastian Vettel hadn't won a race since the Hungarian Grand Prix in July. In the intervening period between then and the Mexico Grand Prix, he squandered a 14-point lead and lost sight of Lewis Hamilton as the Briton sped away to a fourth world title. In Brazil, Vettel triumphed once again to record his fifth win of the season and the 47th of his career. Hamilton started the race in last place after crashing out of qualifying early on, but stormed through the field to finish fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen and second-placed Valtteri Bottas.

Here's a quick guide, including location, new events, venues, how to watch the Games, the mascot and ticket sales. Competitions will be held at 13 venues for the Winter Games. For the first time, TV viewers in all US time zones will have access to live coverage of the Games, instead of a delayed replay.What city is hosting? The host city this time is Pyeongchang, South Korea. Opening and closing ceremonies will be housed at PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, a temporary structure with capacity for 35,000 spectators.The city is about 80 miles (125 kilometers) east of Seoul and about 60 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone that separated North and South Korea. A train between Seoul and Pyeongchang takes about 90 minutes. This will be the second Olympic Games held in South Korea. (Seoul hosted the Summer Olympics in 1988.) 2018 Winter Olympics For more CNN coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, go to cnn.com/olympics The estimated cost of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics is $10 billion, five times less than the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which were estimated to be the costliest.Read MoreWill North Korea be competing? The International Olympic Committee announced on January 20, 2018, that North Korea will participate in the Winter Olympics.North Korea will send 22 athletes who will compete in three sports, according to IOC President Thomas Bach. Athletes from the North and South will also march together under one flag at the opening ceremony for the Games. North Korean athletes will compete at Winter OlympicsFor the first time in Olympic history, the two nations will enter a joint women's ice hockey team under the name Korea and represented by the unification flag.Of the 22 North Korean athletes, 15 will be women and seven will be men, the IOC said. They will be accompanied by 24 coaches and 21 media representatives.Will Russia be competing? The short answer, yes. But there is a catch. Russia was banned in December from taking part in the Games after the IOC found the country had engaged in \"systemic manipulation\" of anti-doping rules, though Russian athletes who can prove they are clean will be \"invited\" to compete under the name \"Olympic Athlete from Russia.\" CAS to hear last-ditch Winter Olympics plea by 32 Russian athletesHealth concernsOver 1,000 security guards were replaced with military personnel after a norovirus outbreak at Olympic facilities in Pyeongchang.

Health officials have not issued travel restrictions or health warnings.  Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsNathan Chen (figure skating): Chen is among a group of talented skaters looking to dethrone Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, the 2014 gold medalist. Chen might hold the trump card, however, in that he's the only skater ever to land five quadruple jumps in a routine. He did that at the US Championships in January.Hide Caption 1 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsMikaela Shiffrin (Alpine skiing): Shiffrin comes into the Winter Olympics as the most dominant female skier in the world. The 22-year-old is the defending World Cup champion, and she is already out to a big lead this season. In 2014 she became the youngest woman to ever win Olympic gold in the slalom, and she'll be looking to defend that title in PyeongChang -- and also add gold in the giant slalom.Hide Caption 2 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsChloe Kim (snowboarding): Kim had the scores to qualify for the Olympic halfpipe team in 2014, but she wasn't old enough to compete. Now, at 17, she is regarded by many to be the gold-medal favorite. She finished first at the Winter X Games last month.Hide Caption 3 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsShaun White (snowboarding): White has long been the face of the sport, the \"flying tomato\" on the halfpipe known for his flowing red hair. The hair is much shorter these days, and White, at 31, is almost something of an elder statesman as he goes into his fourth Olympic Games. He won Olympic gold in 2006 and 2010, but he finished fourth in 2014. Can he reclaim his crown?Hide Caption 4 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsBrittany Bowe (speedskating): Bowe collided with a teammate while training in 2016, and she was sidelined for months with post-concussion symptoms. It has been a long road to recovery, but Bowe is back and ready to reclaim her spot as one of the best sprinters in the world. The Sochi Games were disappointing for the USA speedskating team in 2014. They finished without a single medal. Bowe represents a chance for redemption. Teammate Heather Bergsma is a favorite in the 1,000 and 1,500 meters; she won both at the World Championships last year.Hide Caption 5 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsMaame Biney (short track): Biney made history in December when she became the first black woman to qualify for the US short-track team.

A month after Biney's milestone, speedskater Erin Jackson became the first black woman to qualify for the US Olympic team on the long track.Hide Caption 6 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsLindsey Vonn (Alpine skiing): Vonn is one of Team USA's most recognizable Olympians. She won downhill gold at the 2010 Games in Vancouver -- the first American woman ever to do so -- but injury kept her out of the 2014 Games in Sochi. She has won more World Cup titles (20) than any skier in history.Hide Caption 7 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsAdam Rippon (figure skating): In January, Rippon became the first openly gay athlete to ever qualify for the US Winter Olympic team.

He finished in second place.Hide Caption 8 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsJamie Anderson (snowboarding): Anderson will be defending the slopestyle gold that she won in 2014, when the sport made its Olympic debut at the Sochi Games.

She was the youngest member of the team in 2010, and in 2014 she was tied for the team lead in points.Hide Caption 11 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsBrian Gionta (ice hockey): The NHL decided not to send players to the Olympics this year, so Team USA is full of unknowns -- many of whom play in pro leagues overseas. Hockey fans should be familiar with Gionta, though. The 39-year-old scored nearly 300 goals during his long NHL career. He will be the captain of Team USA in PyeongChang.Hide Caption 12 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsAlex and Maia Shibutani (ice dancing): These siblings have been skating together since 2004, and they will be among the ice-dancing favorites in PyeongChang.

He is the world-record holder in the 500 meters.Hide Caption 14 of 15 Photos: American athletes to watch in the Winter OlympicsBradie Tennell (figure skating): Tennell skated to \"Cinderella\" at the US Championships last month, and it was the perfect choice for a skater who seemingly came out of nowhere to win the event and clinch a spot on the Olympic Team. The 20-year-old had only made her Grand Prix debut in November. She'll lead a strong US team that also includes medal hopefuls Karen Chen and Mirai Nagasu.Hide Caption 15 of 15When will the first medals be awarded?A record 102 medals will be awarded in 15 disciplines. (See the latest medal count.)

It's helped me definitely look at life in that light.\" READ: Obama, Bush and Clinton appear together at Presidents CupREAD: Jhonattan Vegas hoping to inspire Venezuela at Presidents CupLahiri was the first Indian player to achieve a top-five finish in a major -- at the 2015 PGA Championship -- and has won 18 tournaments worldwide.However, he is yet to experience victory on the US Tour, so has moved to Florida with his wife, Ipsa, to help make that a reality.NervesLahiri is convinced that his meditation techniques help him deal with the specific pressures of golf out on the course. \"Self-observation allows you to separate yourself from what's going on,\" he says.\"There are so many times when I can feel the nerves on the 18th hole and my heart beating fast. But once you start observing what's going on inside you, you're no longer thinking of what happens if I make that putt or miss that putt.\"It allows me to just ground myself and center myself and then say 'okay what's my job at hand? What do I need to do?' and then you do that.\"Whether the result goes your way or not is not something you can control all the time, but you can definitely control how you respond to it.\"Anirban Lahiri reacts to missing a crucial putt on the 18th green and losing his singles matche at the Presidents Cup two years ago in South Korea.Things certainly did not go Lahiri's way during his rookie Presidents Cup appearance in 2015 when he lost all three of his matches -- most notably his crucial singles contest with Chris Kirk.That match went down to the 18th green and Lahiri missed a short putt to gift a point to the Americans who then went on to claim their sixth straight victory in the competition. \"I've thought a lot about it and when I look back I really have no regrets, Lahiri says.\"I went through my routine, picked a line and made a great stroke.

        "content": "(CNN)Catalonia's separatist government is adamant it will go ahead with a referendum on October 1 to decide if the region should split from Spain, despite the country's highest court banning the vote. Spain's Constitutional Court has outlawed the plebiscite, and the national administration in Madrid asserts that any such vote would be unconstitutional.The dispute between the regional government in Barcelona and the Spanish government has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks, with several high-ranking Catalan officials involved in organizing the referendum arrested, and mass protests in the region's capital of Barcelona and other towns. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate, casting doubt on recent polling suggesting a \"Yes\" vote will win and saying that he is for \"a united Spain.\"\"I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to.\"Read MoreThe vote risks plunging the country into one of its worst political crises since the end of Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship four decades ago. Hundreds of thousands have attended rallies to demand their region break from Spain in recent weeks.The basics... Catalonia is a wealthy region in Spain's northeast. One of 17 autonomous provinces, it has its own regional government -- or Generalitat -- which already has considerable powers over healthcare, education and tax collection. But it pays tax to Madrid, and pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair on wealthier areas.\u00a0     Catalonia has long complained that its revenues subsidize other parts of Spain. The region hosts some 16% of the Spanish population and much of the country's manufacturing and finance sectors.Catalan nationalists argue that they are a separate nation with their own history, culture and language and that they should have increased fiscal independence.A banner reading \"I just want to vote\" is seen as demonstrators gather outside the Catalan high court. How did we get here? The long-running dispute goes back to the brutal years under Franco, whose dictatorial regime repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy. It wasn't until four years after his death in 1979 that the region gained full autonomy. In 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for greater powers granting \"nation\" status and financial control to the region. But it was one step forward and two steps back four years later, when that status was rescinded by the Constitutional Court, which ruled that while Catalan is a \"nationality,\" Catalonia is not a nation itself.  Separatist supporters demonstrate in front of the Catalan high court building on Thursday in Barcelona.Catalonia's campaign to break away has been gaining momentum since 2010, when Spain's economy plunged during the financial crisis. It was further galvanized by the Scottish referendum for independence in 2014, which ultimately saw voters opt to remain part of the United Kingdom. Catalonia held a symbolic poll in 2014, in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out.What's behind this latest drive?Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has fought to establish an independent Catalan state since taking office last January, and called the referendum in June. A month later, the Generalitat approved a law allowing it to formalize plans for the October plebiscite. But it would appear support for an autonomous Catalan state has fallen in recent months, according to a June poll conducted on behalf of the regional government. The survey indicated some 41.1% were for independence, down from 44.3% in March. Where does Madrid stand? Firmly against Catalan independence, the central government has vowed to shut down what it says is an \"illegal\" referendum. It has the authority to do this, under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Spain's PM has called on separatists to stop the \"escalation of radicalism and disobedience.\" Madrid asked the Constitutional Court to suspend Catalonia's referendum law, which had paved the way for the ballot. Spain's high court is now investigating whether the regional government has breached the constitution. Catalan President blasts Madrid for 'illegal' referendum raidsSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who leads the conservative Popular Party, has consistently argued that Catalonia cannot leave Spain because the country is indivisible, according to the 1978 constitution. \"What we have seen in Catalonia is an attempt to liquidize national sovereignty,\" he said in a recent address posted to his official Twitter account, adding that all Spaniards should have a say in what their country looks like.Police, acting under a court order, seized almost 10 million papers relating to the upcoming ballot at a warehouse in an industrial estate near Barcelona last week. Voter lists, signs and paperwork for counting votes were also confiscated.Additional state police have been deployed to the region in the days leading up to the ballot to maintain order and prevent the vote taking place, Reuters reported, citing the Spanish Interior Ministry. The Spanish government has moored three ships, one pictured, to the dock of Barcelona's port to house police reinforcements ahead of the proposed but illegal referendum. Despite these actions, Puigdemont says he intends to defy Madrid's orders and has called upon Catalan citizens to \"defend democracy against a repressive and intimidating regime\" by going to the polls to vote as planned.And sports stars are weighing in?The referendum row is a divisive subject across Spain, but some homegrown heroes have made their feelings clear.Barcelona's football club has backed the referendum. \"FC Barcelona in remaining faithful to its historic commitment to the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination, condemns any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights,\" it said in a statement posted to its official Twitter account. Manchester City (and former Barcelona) manager\u00a0Pep Guardiola\u00a0has also joined the pro-independence campaign, showing his support for Catalonia at separatist demonstrations. Football manager Pep Guardiola at a pro-independence demonstration in Barcelona on June 11.But others have been somewhat reluctant to reveal their thoughts.World no.1 men's tennis player Rafael Nadal chose a different approach when asked about the upcoming vote.\"I can't imagine Spain without Catalonia and Catalonia without Spain. I don't want to see it,\" he said at a recent press conference in Prague, according to Bloomberg. Nadal added that he hoped the two sides would come together to work things out: \"We don't want fights, we don't want problems I believe we are much better together and stronger.\"What happens if the vote goes ahead? It's unclear at this point -- but Madrid insists there will be consequences if the referendum goes ahead. And if it does get as far as a vote, those who do enter the voting booth will see a single question: Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state, in the form of a republic? Should the Electoral Commission declare victory for the \"Yes\" campaign, Puigdemont has said the Generalitat will declare independence within 48 hours, Reuters reported, while a \"No\" vote would likely spark an early election.",

The Newmarket-based Gosden won the race with Golden Horn in 2015.Beware the wild boarAhead of Sunday's race, Gosden admitted to a few nerves, not least to his worries over roaming wild boar. Earlier in September, wild boar dug holes in a section of the Chantilly track ahead of the Arc trials.\"If the race was run at Longchamp I'd have a lot more confidence,\" Gosden told BBC Five Live radio.\"The management at Chantilly and the clerks have done a brilliant job with the tracks and the grass and everything because they have had a massive amount of racing loaded on them, for two years now with Longchamp being closed.\"Even without the wild boar getting on there it is a narrow track, there's a lot of racing before [on Saturday and Sunday], we hope we don't get too much rain on Saturday and it turns into slushing through loose ground so that is a concern. \"The other thing is Longchamp has a long back straight, they tend to roll on down the hill into the false straight and when you straighten up at Longchamp you have got a lovely long run to the finish line.\"Chantilly is so different, it's narrow,  you go out an elbow to the left then you start turning back to the right, back downhill past the royal stables to a very tight hairpin bend.\"You can't go too fast around that bend so they all drop anchor and steady up and it can get really concertina-ed around there. \"We've got a very nice filly and a brilliant jockey who knows the track awfully well but I would be a lot more confident if it was held at Longchamp.\"Earlier in September, wild boars had dug holes in a section of the track just days before the Arc trials. This is a picture of a board at the Animal Park of Sainte-Croix in Rhodes, eastern France from May 2016.On having the odds on favorite, two years after winning with Golden Horn, Gosden added: \"If you don't appreciate this you shouldn't be in the game. We work hard for this sort of thing but we don't start counting any chickens at this stage.\"Should the filly win she would secure jockey Frankie Dettori a record fifth win in Europe's richest horse race. Seven jockeys are on four wins, while Dettori has ridden in 28 of the last 29 Arcs, missing one because of a broken ankle.Last year jockey Ryan Moore piloted the Aidan O'Brien-trained Found to victory at Chantilly.The Irish handler also sent out the second and third-placed horses -- Highland Reel and Order Of St. George -- for the first whitewash in the race's history.See you soon #Enable \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfc7\ud83c\udffb #QPAT \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 @fgchantilly pic.twitter.com/y7MtQYI9JR\u2014 France Galop (@francegalop) August 24, 2017\nO'Brien is represented by five -- Order of St. George, St Leger winner Capri, 1,000 Guineas winner Winter this year, Seventh Heaven and Idaho.

Some of the building's architectural details will also echo its natural surroundings. \"We have a lot of references to the nature around,\" Perrault said. \"We designed a handrail with a pattern print like a part of the forest.

The players earn on average around $800 per week, but \"played like lions\" to reach this year's Europa League group stage, overcoming PAOK FC of Greece and European giants Galatasaray of Turkey.They have done so not just through talent and hard work, but a unique approach to team bonding.Kindberg and manager Graham Potter have created a Culture Academy -- nurturing the \u00d6FK squad as people as well as players.  Together they have forged an environment like no other in world football, assimilating players from Nigeria, Gambia, Comoros, Ghana and Iraq with a dedicated culture coach.Nobody -- whether it be star players, staff, office workers or the chairman himself -- gets out of the performances, staged annually at a local theater house. \"We have a range of workshops and then we have a performance day,\" Kindberg explains. \"It is like a match day.\" \"The culture academy sets out to make everybody better. It's a training method for two explicit things: One is courage, the other is decision-making.\"Assistant coach Billy Reid, former manager of Hamilton Academical, recalls the moment he left his job in Scottish football for a club like no other in the world. \"When I first came here, in the first meeting, I was told we were going to do an art exhibition,\" Reid laughs. \"I thought 'hold on just a minute!'\" \"I was completely out of my comfort zone -- I'm not exactly a painter -- but it didn't take long to realize that it wasn't about painting pictures. It was about bringing the squad together and learning new ideas.\" \u00d6stersunds players are taken out of their comfort zone for a performance of Swan Lake.There's method though behind the use of culture.\"The purpose of everything we do -- including the work at the Culture Academy -- is to win football matches,\" Kindberg adds. \"That's rule number one. \"That's why we try to create this unorthodox training environment. And, as far as we can see, it's something that has worked out even better than we thought.\" READ: Player tech analysis catapulting Bayer Leverskusen into the futureEnglishman abroadBefore becoming chairman, Kindberg served in both Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- \"extreme\" experiences that have shaped him to this day.  \"I feel quite calm when everything is falling down around me,\" the Swede says. \"Nobody is shooting at you on the football pitch.\" I feel quite calm when everything is falling down around me; nobody is shooting at you on the football pitch.Daniel Kindberg, \u00d6stersunds FK chairmanKindberg took a chance on Potter in December 2010 -- luring the former journeyman defender to the subarctic city with a promise to do things differently. Potter had enjoyed a modest playing career in the lower reaches of English football, turning out for the likes of Stoke City, York City and Macclesfield Town. But, like former England boss Roy Hodgson who coached Malmo, the 42-year-old wasn't a household name -- a diverse and disparate coaching history taking him from universities in Hull and Leeds to a temporary advisory role with the Ghana ladies team at the 2007 World Cup. In Ostersund, surrounded by dense forest on the shores of \"the Great Lake,\" he has found his calling, becoming the only English manager in European competition this season. \u00d6stersunds FK celebrate the club's first ever piece of major silverware, the 2016/17 Swedish Cup.Players extol the virtues of Potter not only as a manager but as a man, their eyes \"misting up\" as they recall the way the Englishman integrated them in the isolated Scandinavian community.As well as his coaching badges, the \u00d6FK boss studied for a degree in social sciences and a Masters in \"leadership and emotional intelligence\" -- something he admits he wouldn't be able to do his current job without.I'm not exactly a painter, but it didn't take long to realize that it wasn't about painting picturesBilly Reid, Assistant Manager\"Graham's not fulfilled by material things like finance,\" says Kindberg, praising Potter's leadership, warmth and humor. \"He just wants to live his dream and do as well as he can. \"On the football field, he has a tactical awareness above all the levels in Scandinavia.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Modern espionage seems dominated by massive troves of data, hacking and intercepts captured by satellites, even troll farms. But in Moscow a tale of espionage from a very different era has resurfaced. It's been more than 60 years since Kim Philby, an upper-class Englishman with legendary charm, slipped aboard a Russian freighter in Beirut and defected. He'd been a Soviet double agent for years, but the net was closing in.Russia's foreign intelligence service has released previously unseen secret documents about his spying for the KGB (and its predecessor, the NKVD), and his life in Moscow after 1963. They form part of a new exhibition at the Russian Historical Society in an elegant 19th century mansion in Moscow.A decoration awarded by the KGB to Philby for his contribution to the national security of the USSR on display as part of the exhibition.In Britain, Philby was and is regarded as a traitor -- one of five double agents known as the Cambridge Five spy ring because of the university they all attended. Throughout the Second World War and beyond, he gave Russian agents reams of  British intelligence documents, probably revealing in the process the identities of dozens of informants. But many Russians still regard him as a hero for passing on intelligence about the war plans of Nazi Germany and Japan -- which probably saved thousands of Russian lives.Read MoreA key Soviet assetObjects from Philby's Moscow apartment on display at the exhibition, including a chair he worked in, radio, and briefcase which a Russian official said never left his side and that he used to smuggle documents.The exhibition includes some of those documents as well as the briefcase which Philby used to carry them nonchalantly out of the London headquarters of the foreign-intelligence service MI6. Many are marked \"Top Secret -- To Be Kept Under Lock and Key.\"They include a British diplomatic cable about the visit of US Vice President Henry Wallace to Russia and China in 1944. The most interesting, perhaps, is an intercepted telegram from July 31, 1944, containing Benito Mussolini's account to Japan's ambassador in Italy of the attempt by German officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler days earlier.Mussolini told the ambassador: \"The force of the explosion was astonishing and the Fuhrer sustained minor injuries to his left hand and arm ... and some of his hair was burned.\"A Hungarian dagger awarded to Philby in 1976 by the Hungarian intelligence services, as \"a prominent figure in the struggle for socialism.\"Such timely intelligence would have been extraordinarily valuable to Soviet intelligence.After the war, Philby rose to be in charge of the UK intelligence relationship with the CIA and FBI, based in Washington. Two others in the Cambridge circle, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, defected to Moscow in 1951 -- and Philby had to leave MI6 because of what he publicly called his \"imprudent association\" with Burgess. But he was cleared of espionage, and began a new life as a journalist in Beirut.Defection washed down with cognacPhilby's typed notes from 1977.Among the documents on display in Moscow is a typed account of his sudden defection that night in January 1963, as evidence against him gathered. He said nothing to his then-wife Eleanor, but phoned his son asking him to let her know that \"I should probably be very late.\" It was something of an understatement. In fact he was about to board the Dolmatova on a one-way passage to Odessa. The captain greeted Philby -- a phenomenal drinker -- with a bottle of cognac.Once in Moscow, he became comrade Philby, issued with a KGB pass and awarded a string of medals, including the Order of Lenin. His image was even on a Soviet postage stamp. He married (for the fourth time) a Russian woman 20 years his junior. Philby's favorite mug for Russian tea, right, is seen on display.He also trained many KGB agents, but Philby found his students lacking in subtlety. When working abroad, \"they must not bore or repel people by endless repetition of the party line,\" he told them, but try to engage possible targets. At least, he said, he felt at home in Moscow. One of the documents on display contains notes from a talk he gave to KGB agents in 1977. \"My journey started in a London park on a sunny afternoon more than 43 years ago.\" That's when he met Arnold Deutsch, a recruiter for Soviet intelligence, in Regents Park.He also spoke of his time at MI6. \"There I felt myself surrounded by wolves; here I know I am with comrades, colleagues and friends.\"In another note from 1977, Philby wrote: 'May we all live to see the Red Flag flying over Buckingham Palace and the White House.' Philby's widow, Rufina Pukhova, at the opening of the exhibition at the office of the Russian Historical Society.But toward the end of his life, he seemed to have growing doubts about the Soviet system. His widow, Rufina Pukhova, told a Russian newspaper in 2011: \"Kim believed in a just society and devoted his whole life to communism. And here he was struck by disappointment, brought to tears. He said, 'Why do old people live so badly here?'\"Visitors to the Moscow exhibition of Philby's life say they are fascinated by the very human -- even romantic -- era of spying, when ideology and human frailties rather than high-tech surveillance were the currency of intelligence. A puck Philby caught with his hands.Anna Tchernakova, a filmmaker, said she admired Philby for his convictions. \"He became a communist in the 1930s because of what he saw was happening in Germany. You choose loyalties once and you keep them for the rest of your life; he was an idealist,\" she said.It's a sentiment echoed by Sergey Naryshkin, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, who opened the exhibition. Philby, he said, \"was guided by anti-fascist beliefs, chose to work with Soviet intelligence and never regretted it.\"Philby is not forgotten in Moscow; some of his old KGB trainees still gather for a (rather boozy) dinner in his honor every year. And a plaque outside the spy agency's headquarters depicts him as Janus -- the Roman god of time -- with one face looking to the past and the other to the future.CNN's Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsRick Pitino's illustrious Louisville coaching career may be at an endThe Hall of Fame coach had already survived two sex scandals in recent years (CNN)Three major scandals may prove one too many for famed basketball coach Rick Pitino. Pitino, who has led the University of Louisville men's team since 2001, was placed on unpaid administrative leave Wednesday amid a widespread FBI investigation into fraud and corruption schemes in college basketball. Among the allegations: that recruits and their families received payments in exchange for committing to attend specific schools.\"While the investigation is continuing and no charges have been filed against the University of Louisville or any of its employees, the allegations are serious,\" University of Louisville president Gregory Postel said at a press conference. \"Doing nothing would be a tacit endorsement of unethical and criminal behavior.\"In a statement released by his lawyer Steve Pence on Tuesday, Pitino said the latest allegations came as a \"complete shock\" to him.\"If true, I agree with the U.S. Attorney's Office that these third-party schemes, initiated by a few bad actors, operated to commit a fraud on the impacted universities and their basketball programs, including the University of Louisville,\" he said. \"Our fans and supporters deserve better and I am committed to taking whatever steps are needed to ensure those responsible are held accountable.\"Read MoreThe news could signal the end of Pitino's tenure at Louisville, where he won a national championship in 2013. Pence, Pitino's attorney, told the Louisville Courier-Journal that the coach has been \"effectively fired.\"In a Hall of Fame coaching career Pitino also has led Kentucky to a national title and coached the NBA's New York Knicks and Boston Celtics. Still, he leaves behind a mixed legacy, combining an impressive coaching resume with several unseemly sex scandals. Pitino managed to hold onto his job after a tawdry 2010 federal extortion trial and accusations in 2015 that an assistant coach paid for sex and stripper parties for Louisville recruits.Rick Pitino is the only men's basketball coach to lead two different schools to an NCAA championship.Federal extortion caseIn 2010, Pitino testified that he was a victim in a federal extortion case involving a woman who attempted to blackmail him after an affair.Pitino, who is married, testified in court that he had sex with Karen Wise once at a Louisville restaurant in 2003. Weeks later, she called Pitino to say she was pregnant, according to court records. Pitino testified that he gave her $3,000, which she used to get an abortion.The woman later married Tim Sypher, who was the equipment manager for Louisville and a former personal assistant to Pitino.In February 2009, a friend of Karen Sypher's left three voicemails for Pitino threatening that press reports could surface claiming that Pitino raped Sypher. Pitino denied the rape charge.According to an affidavit, Sypher met with Pitino and wrote out a list of demands, including college tuition for her children, two cars and paying off her mortgage in exchange for her silence.A criminal complaint against Sypher accused her of trying to extort Pitino, and she was found guilty in 2010 of several counts of extortion and lying to investigators and sentenced to seven years in prison.Sex and stripper partiesRick Pitino was first named coach of the Louisville men's basketball team in 2001.In 2015, ESPN's Outside the Lines reported that former Louisville assistant coach Andre McGee had paid for sex and stripper parties on campus for recruits -- some of whom were under 18 -- from 2010-2014. ESPN reported that five former Louisville basketball players said McGee paid for strippers to attend parties.The allegations were first made public in a book called \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" written by a self-described escort named Katina Powell and co-author Dick Cady.Powell told ESPN that she was paid $10,000 to supply dancers for those parties. In addition, she said that McGee allegedly gave her cash as part of \"side deals\" to have sex with Louisville players, recruits and guardians on campus visits.An attorney for McGee denied the allegations. Pitino, the head of the Louisville program, claimed that he did not know about the arrangements and said McGee should come forward and tell the truth.Ex-assistant Louisville coach Andre McGee resigns from UMKC\"I don't know if any of this is true or not,\" Pitino told ESPN at the time. \"There's only one person who knows the truth, and he needs to come out and tell the truth to his teammates, to the University of Louisville, to his fans and to his coaches that have taught him to do the right thing for years and allowed him to be part of something special here.\"But Powell suggested Pitino had to know something about it.\"This is my theory,\" Powell said on ESPN. \"Four years. A boatload of recruits. A boatload of dancers. Loud music. Alcohol. Security. Cameras. Basketball players who came in at will. You got players that are so loyal to Pitino. Who wouldn't be like, 'Hey, you know, we got dancers and sex and all that going on'? My thing is how could he not know?\"Amid an investigation, Pitino insisted he would not resign. \"Someday, I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now,\" he said.The scandal led to significant punishments for the basketball program and Pitino. In February 2016, Louisville placed a self-imposed ban on postseason play for breaking an unspecified NCAA rule.In its punishment decision, the NCAA said it could not conclude that Pitino was aware of the activities, but did say that he \"did not exercise sufficient oversight\" of the program. Pitino was suspended for the first five conference games of the 2017-2018 season, and the Louisville men's program was placed on NCAA probation for the next four years.CNN's David Close, Jill Martin and Evan Simko-Bednarski contributed to this report.",

It said migrant workers in other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries -- Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- were also vulnerable as statutory summer work breaks were not linked to actual weather conditions. Generally, government regulations prohibit workers in Qatar from working outdoors between 11:30am and 3pm from June 15 to August 31.JUST WATCHEDQatar's World Cup ambitionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHQatar's World Cup ambitions 07:10But, in a statement, HRW said weather conditions in Qatar outside those times frequently reach levels that can result in \"potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest.\"Read More\"Limiting work hours to safe temperatures -- not set by a clock or calendar -- is well within the capacity of the Qatari government and will help protect hundreds of thousands of workers,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. Sheik Saif Al Thani, director of the Government Communications Office, told CNN in a statement that Qatar was committed to is labor reform program and was constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that \"migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections.\"He said Qatar was the first Gulf country to implement restrictions on summer working hours and that these daily restrictions \"exceeded those of Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\"\"In addition to issuing harsh financial penalties,\" he continued. \"Qatar is also the only country in the Gulf that shuts down companies that are found to be operating in violation of the ban.\"READ: 2022 World Cup a bargaining chip fro Gulf foes'Unexplained causes of death'Migrant labor accounts for 95% of Qatar's total labor workforce, with 40% or 800,000 of these workers employed in construction, according to the HRW report. Qatar was announced as the host city for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 and has since embarked on a huge infrastructure campaign in preparation for football's biggest tournament, spending nearly $500m a week on World Cup projects according to Qatari authorities. JUST WATCHEDQatar 2022: 'Progress made on worker rights'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHQatar 2022: 'Progress made on worker rights' 02:03In 2013, the Qatari government revealed that 520 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal died in 2012 -- 385 of them from unexplained causes. Last year, authorities told HRW that 35 workers had died, mostly from falls. HRW recommended that the government of Qatar release data on migrant worker deaths for the past five years, including cause of death which would \"allow an assessment to the extent to which heat stress is a factor.\"Sheik Thani said the government submitted statistics on all work-related deaths in Qatar for 2016 to the International Labour Organization (ILO), which is publicly available on their website. \"We continue to co-ordinate closely with the ILO and international NGOs to implement reforms that will improve the health, safety and rights of migrant workers,\" he said 'Authorities need to scale up transparency'Qatar's World Cup organizers, the \"Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy,\" says it's attempting to enact higher welfare standards than are generally applied to migrant workers in Qatar, last year introducing work-to-rest ratios which were in proportion with the risk posed by heat and humidity. But HRW said that applied to only about 1.5% of the country's construction workforce and did not take into account the effect of sunlight which, according to the statement, significantly increased the risk of heat stress. \"As Qatar scales up its FIFA World Cup construction projects, authorities need to scale up transparency about worker deaths that could be heat related, and take urgent steps to end risks to workers from heat,\" Whitson said.Of a total of 10 worker deaths on World Cup projects between October 2015 and July 2017, the Supreme Committee classified eight deaths as \"non-work related\" with seven of the deaths resulting from \"cardiac arrest\" and \"acute respiratory failure.\"An artist's impression of the Al Rayyan Stadium, a host venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar.HRW said such terms made it \"impossible to determine\" whether those deaths were related to working conditions, such as heat stress.In a statement issued on its website, the Supreme Committee said it acknowledged the concerns raised by HRW and had discussed those concerns \"at length\" with HRW representatives over the last few weeks. The statement read: \"However, we whole-heartedly refute the suggestion the SC has \"abdicated responsibility\" or that the SC has failed to protect the lives of workers on our projects. \"To date there have been two work-related fatalities and nine non-work related deaths of workers engaged on our projects. The SC profoundly regrets the death of any worker, and we treat every incident with the utmost seriousness. \"However, the SC does not have the authority or mandate to determine cause of death, which is reflected in death certificates issued by the medical authorities in Qatar... The SC investigates all fatalities on SC sites to establish whether they could have been prevented and, if so, to identify improvements for the future. \"The SC has provided HRW with the information requested concerning the circumstances surrounding non-work related deaths on our projects.\"Further criticisms The HRW statement also criticized the Qatari government's failure to implement two key recommendations of a 2014 report by the international law firm DLA Piper, which the government itself had commissioned. DLA Piper had reported that the number of deaths in Qatar attributed to cardiac arrest was \"seemingly high\" and had called for legal reform in the country to allow postmortem examinations in cases of unexpected or sudden deaths, and an independent study into the deaths \"vaguely attributed to cardiac arrest.\"\"Qatar sought the spotlight by bidding for the 2022 World Cup, brought in hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to build roads, stadiums, and hotels, and then shelved key recommendations from their own consultants to investigate migrant worker deaths,\" added Whitson. \"FIFA and national football associations should make clear they expect life-saving changes to law and practice that could set a Gulf-wide example of how to save construction worker lives now -- and in the future.\"FIFA 'Fully committed'FIFA told CNN it was \"fully committed\" to protecting the rights of construction workers involved in building infrastructure for the World Cup in Qatar. A FIFA spokesperson said it was working closely with the Supreme Committee, adding that health and safety and workers' protection measures put in place by the committee met the \"highest international standards.\" \"Contrary to the implications made by Human Rights Watch in its statement, the vast majority of construction work currently undertaken in Qatar is not linked to the 2022 FIFA World Cup,\" the spokesperson continued.\"As part of their National Vision 2030, Qatar started a wide-ranging and ambitious (program) to develop its national infrastructure well before and independent of the awarding of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and features\"Nevertheless, FIFA will continue to engage with the Qatari authorities to build on the initiatives put in place for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and help raise the bar in regards to (labor) standards across the country, and in accordance with relevant International Labour Oorganization (ILO)  Conventions, to the benefit of all workers employed in Qatar.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel began the delicate task of building a coalition government Monday, after a bruising election result significantly weakened her authority.Voters deserted her center-right CDU party and its coalition partners, the social democratic SPD, in favor of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and other smaller parties.Even for an arch pragmatist and a skilled negotiator such as Merkel, the fragmented result leaves her little room for maneuver.Merkel's CDU/CSU grouping gained just 33% of the vote, its lowest share for decades, and needs the support of other parties to govern and pass legislation.READ MORE: What next for Germany and Europe?Read More     The SPD, which suffered its worst postwar result with 20.5% of the vote, has decided to return to opposition. It would be unthinkable for Merkel to entertain an alliance with the far-right AfD, which stunned the German political establishment by gaining 13% of the vote and 94 seats out of 709 in the Bundestag.That leaves a clutch of smaller parties which met the 5% threshold to enter parliament and are vying for influence. They are, from left to right of the political spectrum, the anti-corporation Left party (9.2%), the Green party (8.9%), and the pro-business FDP (10.7%).Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt (L) and Cem \u00d6zdemir of the Green party speak to supporters after exit poll results were announced on Sunday. The most likely scenario is what has been dubbed the Jamaica coalition of the CDU, the FDP and the Greens (the combination of party colors resembles the Jamaican flag). Such an alliance would enjoy a healthy majority in parliament -- but the Greens, with strong anti-corporatist elements, and the pro-business FDP are uneasy bedfellows. They are fundamentally opposed on key issues such as immigration and the troubled German car industry.An alliance between the three parties is not unprecedented: A CDU-FDP-Green coalition operates in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.     The Greens said they were open to talks Monday. Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, co-chair of the Greens, said the talks would be tough but that the party would take take the voters' mandate seriously. \"We now have talks ahead of us and certainly difficult and complicated ones, after the SPD said goodbye and see themselves in an opposition role,\" she said. \"But we will negotiate responsibly and seriously.\"If Merkel were unable to patch together a deal with the Greens and the FDU, she could form a minority administration with the FDU alone. But that would rely on the tacit support of other parties and would be prone to collapse.Merkel acknowledged the poor showing for the CDU. \"Of course, overall, we had hoped for a better result,\" she said. \"We have a clear mandate to govern, there is agreement on that.\" Frauke Petry walks out of the AfD press conference Monday.She appeared not to rule out persuading the SPD to stay in government. \"I have heard the words of the SPD,\" but Germany needed a \"stable\" government, Merkel said at a press conference at her party headquarters in Berlin. She said she would talk soon to the leader of her CSU sister party -- which had briefly considered splitting on Monday morning -- and to representatives of the FDP and the Greens. Merkel insisted her party would govern with the CSU -- \"there is no question about it\" -- after speculation emerged about a split.Her position was helped by the infighting in the AfD, which was thrown into disarray by the walkout of chairwoman Frauke Petry during a press conference called to celebrate its success.But with her own power base severely weakened, she is going to find herself torn from all sides in the weeks to come.",

        "content": "(CNN)French President Emmanuel Macron has laid out a sweeping plan to relaunch the European Union, calling for greater harmonization in key policy areas and raising the prospect that the UK could rejoin a reformed bloc.In a marathon, 90-minute speech at the Sorbonne in Paris, Macron sought to present a new vision for the EU as it reels under the rise of far-right nationalism, mass migration and Brexit.Macron called for a joint military \"rapid response force,\" a common defense budget, a single asylum system and an EU border force. He said the single-currency eurozone should have its own budget and finance minister.\"The Europe we know is too weak, too slow, too inefficient, but only Europe gives us the capacity to act on the world stage in the face of the big, contemporary challenges,\" he said.We can say goodbye to a stable GermanyMacron campaigned for the French presidency on a forcefully pro-European platform. But his vision has been complicated by the German election results and the bloody nose they inflicted on Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose cooperation will be vital to achieving his aims.Read MoreMerkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party and its sister grouping, the Christian Social Union, obtained just 33% of the vote and will need to forge a deal with other parties to govern. The CDU was already resistant to handing more budgetary powers to Brussels. One of her likely coalition partners, the pro-business FDP, is even more hostile to the idea.In his speech, Macron called for a single EU corporate tax band by 2020, saying members who refused to implement it should have their aid from Brussels cut.Macron urged reform of the controversial Common Agricultural Policy farm subsidy system, including tougher measures to fight fraud within it. Traditionally, France has been the biggest beneficiary and staunch defender of the CAP. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on the European Union at the amphitheater of the Sorbonne University on September 26, 2017 in Paris.He also suggested an increase in development aid for Africa, which he said should no longer be treated as a problem \"but as a partner.\"He proposed to finance this by extending the UK's system of taxing property transactions, known as stamp duty. to across the EU and increasing taxes on carbon fuels as a means of transforming the economic model to a more environmentally friendly system.  \"The only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic,\" Macron said. The French President's speech echoed one given 25 years ago by former EU Commission President and architect of the single market Jacques Delors.It was lauded by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who said the EU needed \"courage\" to move forward.\"A very European speech by my friend Emmanuel Macron. Europe needs courage. Thank you for your support for the work of the EU institutions,\" Juncker, the head of the EU's executive arm, said on Twitter.Marcon suggested the UK might want to rejoin the EU after his grand plan had been pushed through: \"In a few years, if they want, the United Kingdom could find its place... In this reformed and simplified EU that I'm proposing, I can't imagine that the United Kingdom could not find its place.\"",

Aston Martin and Red Bull joined forces in 2016, launching an \"innovation partnership\" which helped create Aston Martin's \"Valkyrie hypercar.\" Production on the 1,130 horsepower hybrid car which has been part designed by Red Bull's chief technical officer, Adrian Newey, is expected to go into production next year before being released in 2019 at a rumored cost of around $3 million.

Read MoreThe strengthening of the partnership will see the creation of an \"Advanced Performance Center\" which will employ over 100 Aston Martin's design and engineering staff at Red Bull Racing's base in Milton Keynes, UK. Andy Palmer, president and CEO of Aston Martin said the luxury car brand had been helped by the association with Red Bull so far and that furthering the relationship was the next logical move.

Aston Martin, perhaps most famous for featuring in the James Bond movie franchise, has partnered Red Bull since March 2016 -- its famous wings logo adorning both the 2016 and 2017 championship cars -- the RB12 and the RB13.  A post shared by Red Bull Racing (@redbullracing) on May 30, 2017 at 3:12am PDT Red Bull drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen also drove Aston Martin cars as they towed caravans riotously around the Red Bull Ring in Austria earlier this year. The footage of the pair was shared widely on social media. Red Bull is a four-time back-to-back winner (2010-2013) of the F1 constructors' championship and its drivers have won 53 grands prix since it joined the grid in 2005. The team is currently third in the 2017 constructors' title race with Ricciardo and Verstappen lying fourth and sixth respectively in the drivers' championship.

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)The co-founder of the first far-right party to win seats in Germany's parliament in almost 60 years has declared that it is ready to \"take back our country and our people.\"Alexander Gauland, federal spokesman for the anti-immigration, anti-Muslim, Alternative for Germany (AfD), gave the warning after his party was projected to come in third place in Sunday's national election, according to preliminary results.The result, which puts the AfD at just over 13%, was described by leading party figures as a \"political earthquake.\"Gauland promised his party would provide staunch opposition to the new government, likely led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding:  \"We will hunt them. We will hunt Mrs. Merkel or whomever. And we will take back our country and our people.\"Support for the AfD grew quickly following the arrival of more than a million refugees in Germany in 2015.ProtestsRead MoreOn Sunday, crowds gathered in Berlin and across the country to protest the election result.Crowds gathered outside the AfD headquarters in Berlin on Sunday night.One protester, Julius, who declined to give his surname, said the success of the AfD made it a \"sad day for Germany.\"\"The election results are shocking,\" said the 25-year-old in Berlin.\"I never thought the AfD would score as high as 13%. This is a sad day for Germany especially if we look back at our history.\"We will have to wait and see how many AfD parliamentarians will now be represented in the Bundestag but sadly it looks around 90 -- a shocking result for Germany. \"The AfD polled particularly strongly in east Germany, which includes Berlin, attracting 21.5% of the vote, according to exit polling conducted by Infratest Dimap. In the West, it scored about 11%, the projections said. The results put the AfD on course to become the second largest party in the East, after the CDU.Couple Elgin and Friedhelm from Berlin rushed out to attend the protest after watching the results at home.Elgin and Friedhelm, a couple from Berlin, came to the protest after they watched the exit poll on television.\"We cannot believe that the AfD scored as high as 13% nationwide,\" Friedhelm told CNN. \"This is a catastrophe.\"To imagine that a right wing party is now moving into the German parliament is something we thought we would never see again in Germany after all that has happened in the past.\"'Wrong answers' to the 'right questions'First formed in 2013 at the height of Europe's debt crisis as an anti-European Union and anti-Euro party, the AfD has since turned its focus to immigration and Islam.\"Islam does not belong to Germany,\" reads the party's election manifesto. Germany's Muslims are \"a big danger for our state, our society and our system of values.\"The party has also called for an upper limit on the number of refugees allowed to enter the country, \"for the protection of Germany.\" Last year, AfD co-leader Frauke Petry caused outrage when she suggested that police should be allowed to use firearms against illegal migrants on Germany's border, Reuters reported.Frauke Petry has co-led the party since 2015.\"As with many populist parties, the AfD often asks the right questions -- about immigration and integration, about the EU -- but tends to give the wrong answers,\" says Hartwig Pautz, political scientist at the University of the West of Scotland. \"Their answers are simplistic, unworkable and don't belong in a liberal democracy.\"The AfD profited from a nationalist backlash after more than 1 million refugees entered the country in 2015, sparking debates about integration.A series of terror attacks across Germany in 2016 drove support for the party to a peak of 16% in the polls and a spate of successes in local elections.Even before Sunday's result, the AfD had MPs in 13 of Germany's 16 state parliaments, according to a Reuters count.ControversyLike several other right-wing, populist parties across Europe, the AfD has taken controversial positions on key issues and been dogged by scandal and in-fighting.The AfD was the only one to actively campaign against same-sex marriage before the parliamentary vote in June, calling on Germany to protect and preserve the \"traditional\" family.In July, prominent AfD politician Beatrix von Storch dismissed current debates around gender identity and LGBT rights as \"foolish nonsense.\"Earlier in the year, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, the party's state leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, called for Germany's history to be re-written to focus on German victims of the Second World War and criticized the world-famous Holocaust memorial in Berlin as \"a memorial of shame.\" After a fierce battle within the party, he was expelled, Reuters reported.Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, co-lead candidates for the AfD in Sunday's electionMore recently, top candidate Alexander Gauland  had an investigation launched into his actions, according to Reuters, after he suggested that Germany's integration minister -- who has Turkish roots -- should be \"dumped\" back to Turkey for questioning the existence of a German culture.  The gay men turning to the far right in GermanyAccording to Beate K\u00fcpper, a social psychologist at Hochschule Niederrhein University in North Rhine-Westphalia who studies the far right in Germany, the AfD targets a narrow group of voters: \"the 15% who are against same-sex marriage and who hold strongly right-wing views.\"But, as Pautz, the political scientist, argues, that minority is now represented in the German parliament. \"And many of the new MPs will be inexperienced in politics and they will have a wide range of views.\"The AfD in parliament will be \"very inexperienced, very fractious, very fragmented.\" But it is difficult to know exactly how the party's presence will influence German politics and policy over the next four years. \"We are in unknown waters,\" said Pautz.",

Germany's oldest party, the center-left SPD, which had been in a \"grand coalition\" with Merkel, was consigned to opposition.     Addressing her supporters, a subdued Merkel said the result gave her a \"mandate\" to govern but that the AfD's success would require \"thorough analysis\" to understand the concerns of their voters.Preliminary results showed Merkel's CDU/CSU group would be the largest in the Bundestag, but with its lead cut to 33.5% of the seats, down from 41.5% in 2013. The SPD fell to 21.6% from 25.7%, a result met with shock at the party's headquarters. It was the CDU's worst result since 1949, and the SPD's worst since 1945.Read MoreThe AfD, founded only four years ago, became the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since 1961, with just over 13% of the vote.     Addressing her supporters, Merkel pledged to try and understand the concerns of voters who lent their support to the AfD. \"There's a big new challenge for us, and that is the entry of the AfD in the Bundestag,\" she said.  \"We want to win back AfD voters.\"SPD leader Martin Schulz said the result was a \"bitter disappointment\" and the party would not continue in coalition. During the election campaign, Schulz found it hard to mount an effective opposition to Merkel, as his party had been inextricably linked to her policy decisions. More symbolically, had the SPD remained in coalition, the AfD would have been the largest opposition party.Rise of AfDThe AfD's local party leader in Berlin, Georg Pazderski, declared its success a \"political earthquake.\"Founded in 2013, the AfD rose to prominence on the back of an anti-immigration stance and its opposition to Merkel's decision to open the country's borders to over a million migrants, mainly those fleeing violence and persecution from the Middle East. The party's opponents say it has stoked Islamophobia in Germany.The AfD polled particularly strongly in East Germany, which includes Berlin, attracting 21.5% of the vote, according to exit polling conducted by by Infratest Dimap. In the West, it scored about 11%, the projections said.

Protesters chanted \"Nazis out\" and sang \"say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.\"Far-right party wins seats in German parliament for first time in decadesThe European Jewish Congress called on the major parties to shun the AfD in parliament. \"We trust that centrist parties in the Bundestag will ensure that the AfD has no representation in the coming governing coalition,\" Dr. Moshe Kantor, President of the EJC, said.\"Some of the positions it has espoused during the election campaign display alarming levels of intolerance not seen in Germany for many decades and which are, of course, of great concerns to German and European Jews.\"'Jamaica coalition'With the SPD refusing to rejoin government and no party willing to work with the AfD, the result leaves Merkel with few options for a coalition.     Merkel may be forced to make a deal with the Green Party and FDP, to create a so-called \"Jamaican coalition\" -- with the green and and yellow of the two parties combining with the black of the CDU to resemble the flag of Jamaica.The pro-business FDP are expected to take 10% of seats with the Greens one percentage point behind on nine.JUST WATCHEDWhy some gay men in Germany support the far rightReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy some gay men in Germany support the far right 02:51Coalition talks are unlikely to begin in earnest until final results have been announced on Monday.To form a government, the parties involved must have a combined total of at least 50% of the seats in parliament.

(Source: NFL.com)Hide Caption 1 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Sam Bradford, $18 million \u2013 After six mostly disappointing seasons in St Louis and Philadelphia, the first overall pick of the 2010 draft has finally found a home. Although Minnesota did not qualify for the playoffs with an 8-8 record, Sam Bradford was mostly error-free, throwing 20 touchdowns and just five interceptions on his way to an excellent 99 passer rating in 2016. Hide Caption 2 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 19 (tie): Brock Osweiler, $18 million \u2013 Brock Osweiler has endured a bumpy road on his way back to Denver. Peyton Manning's former understudy experienced a difficult 2016 spell at Texas (15 TDs, 16 INTs) before being traded to Cleveland and subsequently released. The former Arizona State standout was 5-2 as a starter in Denver filling in for Manning, and Broncos fans hope he can restore some of that magic this season. Hide Caption 3 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 18: Ndamukong Suh, $19.1 million \u2013 Ndamukong Suh was signed by the Miami Dolphins for a six-year, $114 million contract in March 2015, making him the highest paid defensive player in history at the time -- hefty numbers for a 30-year-old lineman who has yet to match the 10 sacks achieved during his rookie season with the Detroit Lions. Hide Caption 4 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 17: Von Miller, $19.1 million \u2013 The MVP of Super Bowl 50 for the Denver Broncos single-handedly badgered Panthers quarterback Cam Newton into submission, with 6 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 quarterback hurries in the title game. Von Miller promptly signed a $114.5 million deal ($70 million guaranteed) with the Broncos, making him the richest defensive player in NFL history. Hide Caption 5 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 16: Ryan Tannehill, $19.25 million \u2013 Though Ryan Tannehill (#17) has shown promise in his five seasons in the league, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the pre-season. A former part-time receiver in college at Texas A&M, Tannehill has been one of the speediest quarterbacks in the league -- a quality which will be tested after knee surgery. In a 44-26 win against Houston in 2015, Tannehill became the 64th quarterback in NFL history to record a perfect passer rating, throwing four TDs, with 18 completions in 19 attempts. Hide Caption 6 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 15: Tom Brady, $20.5 million \u2013 With five Super Bowl rings, 12 Pro Bowls, four Super Bowl MVP award and two NFL MVP awards, tom Brady is the one player in the list who can claim to be underpaid. At 40, he's on the back end of a two-year, $41 million contract, but has left money on the table in previous negotiations to sign better players around him -- a plan that has yielded a record seven Super Bowl appearances and counting.  Hide Caption 7 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 14: Matt Ryan, $20.75 million \u2013 \"Matty Ice\" will attempt to re-earn his nickname, after suffering perhaps the most remarkable blown lead in sporting history at Super Bowl 51. Up 28-9 going into the fourth quarter, the Falcons handed 25 straight points to New England, with Matt Ryan giving up a crucial fumble and sack in the process. The former Boston College standout and four-time Pro Bowler was inserted as the Atlanta Falcons' starter since being drafted third overall in 2008. Hide Caption 8 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 13: Cam Newton, $20.76 million \u2013 Cam Newton is arguably the most complete player on this list. At 6 foot 6 inches and 260 pounds, he has the size, speed and athleticism -- along with stellar QB instincts -- to take the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs every year. But after a disastrous 2016 season, in which the Panthers went 6-10, \"Killer Cam\" will again trying to erase his unfortunate Super Bowl 50 performance (0 touchdowns, one interception, sacked six times, two fumble losses). Hide Caption 9 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 12: Philip Rivers, $20.81 million \u2013 In his 13-year pro career, Philip Rivers has yet to appear in a Super Bowl, although he has taken the San Diego Chargers into the playoffs five times. The father of eight children has broken most of the major franchise records, surpassing Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time touchdown leader, wins leader and consecutive starts leader (185 and counting). In 2014, Rivers broke an NFL record by achieving five consecutive games with a passer rating of above 120. Hide Caption 10 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 11: Eli Manning, $21 million \u2013 The two-time Super Bowl MVP led the Giants back into the playoffs last season, only to lose at Green Bay. At times Eli Manning has befuddled New Yorkers with error-prone performances, but his legacy is cemented in New York sporting lore. His active 211-game playing streak is third all-time for QBs. Hide Caption 11 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 10:  Ben Roethlisberger, $21.85 million  \u2013 Though \"Big Ben\" (#7) has flirted with the idea of retirement, the two-time Super Bowl champion shows no sign of slowing down. Shaking off some niggling injuries, Ben Roethlisberger had an excellent 2016 campaign, earning his fifth Pro Bowl selection before taking his Steelers to the AFC Conference Finals. Hide Caption 12 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 9: Russell Wilson, $21.9 million  \u2013 It's ironic that Russell Wilson threw the most famous interception in NFL history -- the last-minute gaff which cost the Seattle Seahawks the 2015 Super Bowl -- because the 28-year-old three-time Pro Bowler plays virtually error-free. Though standing at just 5 foot 11 inches, Wilson was the top-rated NFL quarterback in 2015, and is second all-time, trailing only Aaron Rodgers.  Hide Caption 13 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 8:  Aaron Rodgers, $22 million \u2013 That Aaron Rodgers holds the top career passer rating record while playing in frozen Lambeau Field is a testament to his talent. Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a 2011 championship, and is riding an eight-year playoff streak into 2017. But despite posting stellar regular-season numbers in the six seasons since the Super Bowl (a mind-boggling 219 TDs and just 41 INTs) the Packers have come up short in the playoffs. Hide Caption 14 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 7: Joe Flacco, $22.13 million \u2013 When the Baltimore Ravens offered a three-year, $66.4 million ($44 million guaranteed) deal to Joe Flacco in 2016, it seemed like an aberration. In his 10 seasons, the 32-year-old has yet to make a Pro Bowl. But traditionally the Ravens have thrived on defense, and until Flacco came along in 2008, the team won in spite of its sputtering quarterbacks. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP brings a calm presence to a team which suffered a leadership vacuum after the retirements of Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.   Hide Caption 15 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 6: Kirk Cousins, $23.9 million \u2013 \"You like that?\" Kirk Cousins, who led Washington to the playoffs in 2015 behind that rallying cry, signed his second consecutive one-year deal in the off-season. Unable to come to a long-term deal with the Redskins, the 29-year-old settled for one year and nearly $24 million. Hide Caption 16 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 5: Drew Brees, $24.3 million \u2013 It's hard to overestimate Drew Brees' value to the city of New Orleans. When the former Charger joined the Saints in 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, the team was 3-13. Four years later, New Orleans won its first and only Super Bowl. The 10-time Pro Bowler holds team passing records in every major category.  He has also been a face of the community, raising funds for cancer research and other charitable causes. Hide Caption 17 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 4: Carson Palmer, $24.4 million \u2013 Carson Palmer, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is entering his 14th NFL season. The 37-year-old signed a one-year deal with Arizona in the off season. Hide Caption 18 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 3:  Andrew Luck, $24.6 million \u2013 Andrew Luck -- whose $140 million, six-year deal is still the highest contract total in history -- bounced back from an injury-riddled  2015 to post 31 TDs and just 13 interceptions last season. His off-season shoulder surgery, however, sidelines him for the start of the 2017 campaign. Hide Caption 19 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 2: Derek Carr, $25 million \u2013 The Oakland Raiders made Derek Carr their franchise QB this offseason with a five-year, $125 million deal -- briefly crowning the former Fresno State man as the highest paid player in the league. Carr has been a Pro-Bowler two of his first three seasons in Oakland. Hide Caption 20 of 21 Photos: American football's big earnersNo. 1: Matthew Stafford, $27 million \u2013 Weeks before the start of the 2017 campaign, Detroit made Stafford the highest-paid player in NFL history with a five year, $135 million deal. Though he is yet to win a playoff game, Stafford is the Lions' all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. The nine-year veteran's 99-game starting streak is 11th best of all time. Hide Caption 21 of 21'One team'NFL players began to kneel during the national anthem last year, when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before kickoff, sparking both support and backlash.The Ravens had been linked with signing the quarterback, a move owner Steve Bisciotti said could \"upset some people.\"The debate has intensified after Trump said NFL team owners should fire or suspend players for kneeling during the national anthem.

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)The leadership of the hardline Alternative for Germany party was in disarray Monday, a day after its historic breakthrough in the German elections delivered a stinging blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel's authority.At a press conference in Berlin that was intended to burnish the AfD's success, its chairwoman Frauke Petry walked out. She declared that she would not sit with the party in the Bundestag and said it had to address dissent within its own ranks.Merkel gets fourth term but German voters deliver far-right surgeThe AfD won 13% of the vote and came a stunning third place behind the main center-right and center-left parties.It polled particularly strongly in the former East Germany, which includes Berlin, attracting 21.5% of the vote, according to exit polling conducted by Infratest Dimap. In the West, it scored about 11%, the projections said. The results put the AfD on course to become the second largest party in the east, after the CDU.The AfD becomes the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since 1961. But it has been riven with internal strife: Petry has been regarded as a more moderate force in the party, arguing that it had to break with the far right in order to move from opposition into government. Read MoreIt appeared Petry's actions were an attempt to provoke a wider split. She had already lost an internal battle to oust a regional AFD leader who denounced a holocaust memorial, and her dramatic walkout seemed designed to make voters question which leader represented the \"real\" AfD.\"Today we must be open that there is internal dissent within the AfD,\" Petry said at the press conference. \"We must not be silent about this. The community needs to know that we have controversial debates.\" She told reporters later that she would sit in the Bundestag as an independent and would do her \"utmost\" to work for a shift to the right in the next federal elections in 2021.     Merkel punishedAs the AfD divisions burst into the open, Merkel acknowledged her party had failed to do enough to prevent the drift to the far right. She  vowed \"to focus on those who went to the AfD.\"Voters punished Merkel for her decision in 2015 to allow more than a million refugees into the country at the height of the European migrant crisis. Merkel said that the particular circumstances of the migrant crisis were unlikely to be repeated.Preliminary results showed Merkel's CDU/CSU group would still be the largest bloc in the Bundestag, but with its lead cut to 33.5%, down from 41.5% in 2013 -- the party's worst result since 1949.Her former partners in government, the center-left SPD, decided to return to opposition after exit polls suggested its share of the vote fell to 21.6% from 25.7% in 2013. It was the SPD's lowest share of the vote since 1945.Angela Merkel addresses supporters in Berlin Sunday night.The results delivered a significant realignment of the Bundestag. Two smaller parties -- the Left party and the pro-business FDP -- joined the AfD in surpassing the 5% vote threshold required to enter the national parliament. The proliferation of smaller parties complicates Merkel's coalition-building task.To secure her fourth term in office, Merkel is expected to attempt to make a deal with the Green Party and the FDP -- the so-alled \"Jamaican coalition\" option (the green and yellow of the two smaller parties combine with the black of the CDU to resemble the flag of Jamaica). The new grouping would be significantly weaker than the previous government, a \"grand coalition\" between Germany's two biggest parties.     Merkel said she was confident that a new government would be in place before Christmas, and noted that no other group could build a coalition against her. But she faces a tough battle to build a government that is strong enough to hold back the rise of the AfD.There is no guarantee that Merkel will come to a deal with the FDP and the Greens -- both parties bitterly oppose each other and will be wary of the fate of the SPD, which suffered from its proximity to Merkel in the last government and struggled to mount an effective election campaign under leader Martin Schultz.A poster from the far-right Alternative for Germany on September 21 in Berlin, Germany, that reads \"Burkas?

He said that whatever government transpires, talks could well go on until Christmas and beyond, and that she might prefer to prolong the staus quo for as long as possible. \"She will be ground down by this, if she manages to form a coalition government at all.\"Professor John Ryan of the London School of Economics IDEA unit agreed. \"Eight weeks is usually the norm, but 12 weeks isn't out of the question here. It means there won't be a government in place until 2018.\" CNN's Atika Shubert contributed from Berlin.",

Six males had been hurt, the statement said, but none of their injuries were \"life threatening or life changing.\"A 15-year-old male has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm and is in police custody, the Met said.Read MorePolice, fire and ambulance services were called to the scene of the altercation.\"I recognize the lasting impact on victims of corrosive substance attacks. Our response to such attacks is continually improving through training and joint working with partners and we are working with the Home Office to explore possible restrictions around the sale of corrosive substances in conjunction with retailers and manufacturers,\" Adelekan said.The London Ambulance Service said it was called to the scene just after 8 p.m local time.\"The first of our medics arrived within 10 minutes of the first emergency call and worked closely with our colleagues from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police and London Fire Brigade making sure patients received the medical help they needed as quickly as possible,\" spokesman Paul Gibson said. \"We treated a total of six patients, three of whom were taken to London hospitals.\"The ambulance service's hazardous area response team -- which provides medical care in hostile environments -- was involved in the response, Gibson said.Imran Tahir Rizvi told the UK Press Association he heard someone shouting about an \"acid attack\" before he saw a young man on the floor screaming. \"His fellows were shouting at police for something. Initially people thought like it was a fight. But the guys (with) the victim started shouting 'it is an acid attack, he is burning',\" Rizvi said.A Burger King employee, who would only identify himself as Hossen, said he saw a local homeless man ran into the restaurant's bathroom \"to wash acid off his face,\" the PA reported.\"There were cuts around his eyes and he was trying to chuck water into them,\" Hossen said.Stratford Centre is near London's Olympic Stadium and across the street from Westfield Shopping Centre, one of the largest shopping malls in Europe.",

        "content": "(CNN)Germans are voting to choose a government, and a Chancellor, for the next four years.The election underway in the EU's economic powerhouse could see incumbent Angela Merkel from the Christian Democratic Union win a fourth term in office -- or be ousted by her main rival Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic Party.Merkel cast her vote in the eastern part of Berlin, the German capital, in the afternoon.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel leaves an election booth as she casts her vote in Berlin on Sunday.Polling stations are open until 6 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET), and the country's two state broadcasters are expected to release an exit poll shortly after voting ends.\"The voter turnout is quite high here,\" Markus Putzel, an election volunteer at a polling station in a school in Berlin's Mitte district, told CNN. \"It's a bit like the German Bundesliga,\" he said, referring to the German soccer league. \"You know that Bayern Munich will always be the champion, but it is exciting to see who will come second.\" Read MoreTurnout was robust despite rainy weather and the annual Berlin Marathon, which almost ground this part of the city to a halt in the morning. Merkel or Schulz?As the election reaches its final lap, it seems unlikely that one of the parties will win more than 50% of the 598 seats in parliament, meaning the largest party would start coalition talks on Monday. Whoever wins has a daunting task ahead. Over the next four years, Germany will play a key role in overseeing -- and negotiating -- Britain's departure from the European Union and in dealing with the global threats of terrorism, climate change and an emboldened North Korea.The Chancellor will also have to tackle domestic concerns over immigration, education and investment in digital technologies.How Germany stacks up against its European neighborsMerkel has pledged to reduce Germany's already low unemployment, and is offering modest tax cuts. She has defended her 2015 \"open door\" policy that led to more than a million refugees entering the country, but has insisted the events of that year must not be repeated.\"I honor our chancellor and want her to remain in power,\"  Elenor Mass, 88, told CNN. \"I like her honesty, her persistence and her humanity as well as her hard work. I like her as our head of state.\"The Chancellor has largely stayed away from making big election promises and has been accused of \"sleepwalking\" through the campaign by the German media. Schulz, a former President of the European Parliament, has been far more combative, promising to raise taxes on the rich, tackle poverty among workers and pensioners in Germany, and invest in infrastructure and education. Martin Schulz, top candidate and chairman of the Social Democratic Party, casts his vote in the German election in Wuerselen, Germany, on Sunday.He has also taken a harder line than his rival on the recent actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump, who he accused of bringing \"us to the brink of a crisis\" with his \"fire and fury\" tweet.\"Security, economy and education are the most important issues in this election,\" said Marion, a middle-aged voter who didn't want to give her last name. \"There is no alternative to the Chancellor.  The landscape of the parties is flat, they are all the same, there are simply no differences. Everything is a choice between a bit more or a bit less. I don't like it.\"Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz speaks at a demonstration in Hamburg, Germany on August 31.Who gets a say?There are 61.5 million eligible voters in Germany and 42 parties contesting the election. But only six of those parties are likely to win enough votes to send representatives to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament.Merkel and Schulz spar over North Korea, refugeesThose are Merkel's conservatives (the CDU), the social democrats, the liberals (FDP), the Left party, the Greens and the anti-immigrant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) -- which was founded in 2013 and looks set to enter parliament for the first time.A poster from the far-right Alternative for Germany on September 21 in Berlin, Germany, that reads \"Burkas? We prefer bikinis\". The CDU and SPD -- partners in a coalition government since the last election in 2013 -- are likely to emerge as the two largest parties. But the battle for third place among the smaller parties has been fierce. A woman wearing a veil casts her ballot at a polling station in Berlin during general elections on September 24.Around 650,000 volunteers have been deployed at 73,500 polling stations across the country to make sure the process runs smoothly.Merkel supporters wave placards at a campaign rally in Kappeln, Germany on September 20.What happens next?Once the final results have been announced on Monday, coalition talks will begin. To form a government, the parties involved must have a combined total of at least 50% of the seats in parliament.There are likely to be several coalition options, and plenty of disagreement between the parties before they reach a deal. Parliament will reconvene on October 24 with the new government in place.CNN's Schams Elwazer, Fred Pleitgen, Nadine Schmidt and Christian Streib contributed to this report.",

Their prayer services were held at Fatih Mosque as crying friends and family looked on.Some funeral attendees flew flags with \"Free Syria\" written on them. Syrian activist Naji Jerf slain in TurkeyThe Istanbul killing was uncovered when friends began to worry that 22-year-old Halla was not responding to phone calls and text messages. They notified authorities, who discovered the stabbed bodies in their home located on the Asian side of the Bosphorus River.They had been wrapped in a blanket with detergent poured over it, state news agency Anadolu reported. Authorities suspect the detergent was used to cover up the smell, according to Anadolu. There was no sign of forced entry in the preliminary investigation, the news agency said.Read MoreThe investigation is ongoing. \"The crime happened sometime between Wednesday morning and Thursday afternoon,\" said Moatez Shaklab, secretary general of the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union, which the Barakat family authorized to speak on its behalf.Shaklab told CNN that the elder Barakat had recently received threatening telephone calls for her work with the Syrian opposition. \"Someone told her over the phone that now is the time to silence you,\" he said. \"She didn't take the threats seriously because her activism work had granted her many similar threats in the past.\"The family last lived in Syria for more than a decade before the civil war began.Ouruba Barakat, 60, an activist who also was a journalist, was a critical voice against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. She was a former member of a Syrian opposition group and active in helping Syrian refugees in Turkey.Family friends who knew Ouruba describe her as having a strong character. \"She challenged her society from the day she began her work in the media,\" said Rand Skhita, a 32-year-old human rights activist who had once lived in the same neighborhood as the Barakat family in Idlib City, Syria.Skhita said they used to vacation together when Halla was just a \"sweet little girl who spoke broken Arabic.\"Halla, a natural born American citizen, worked as a journalist for TRT World before joining pro-Syrian opposition Orient Net English.The United States condemned the slayings and promised to follow the investigation closely. Journey to safety was more terrifying than Aleppo, activists say \"The United States is deeply saddened by the deaths of Arouba and Hala Barakat. Hala served as a journalist for Orient News and we remember the courageous work of her mother, Arouba, a Syrian activist who reported on the Syrian regime's atrocities,\" Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the US State Department, said in a statement.Funeral attendees spoke of the pair as having a bond that transcended the traditional mother-daughter relationship. \"They were everything to each other; they were one soul,\" said Sarah Leila, a friend of Halla's from Orient. Halla was a committed journalist who would rarely stop working but for the shortest lunch break, said Leila. Halla would attend every Syrian opposition event she could. But it was her easy laugh that most drew people to her. \"She would always laugh. Even at the really really bad jokes,\" Leila said. Like her mother, Halla also worked with community groups. During Ramadan, she organized fast-breaking dinners for disadvantaged people in a rundown part of Istanbul. She believed that young people could make a change, according to friend Sarah Khalbuss, who was at the funeral. \"Halla was like a light in the room. She had a beautiful laugh and a powerful presence. The two came together so beautifully,\" said Khalbuss, who volunteered at the same community group as Halla. When she heard about the killings, Khalbuss was with a group of Halla's close friends: \"It was a very very dark feeling... we felt like the (Syrian) war was following us.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May sought to kick start Brexit negotiations on Friday, proposing to delay the impact of the UK's withdrawal from the EU with a two-year transition period.In return for continued access to the EU single market, the UK would honor its budget commitments of about 10 billion euros (about $12 billion) year, remain bound by EU laws and accept continued immigration from Europe.But May said the transition should be \"strictly time-limited\" and replaced as soon as practicable by a bespoke, \"creative\" partnership that would respect the result of last year's EU referendum.Can Florence's beauty help Britain seduce the EU?UK and EU leaders share a \"profound sense of responsibility\" to make the process work \"smoothly and sensibly\" for this and future generations, she said at the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence, Italy.\"The eyes of the world are on us, but if we can be imaginative and creative about the way we establish this new relationship, if we can proceed on the basis of trust in each other, I believe we can be optimistic about the future we can build for the United Kingdom and for the European Union,\" she said.Read MoreThe top EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, welcomed the \"constructive spirit\" of the speech but warned that Britain would have to accede to all existing EU rules and oversight to retain access to the single market during any transition period. \"The speech shows a willingness to move forward, as time is of the essence,\" he said.Key points of May's speechTransitional arrangements: May conceded that the Britain would not be ready to implement a Brexit deal when the UK formally leaves the EU in March 2019. A transition period would also be required for the UK to conclude a trade deal with the EU. To ease the process, May proposed a transition of about two years, during which the EU and UK would have access to each other's markets on current terms, retaining the \"existing structure of EU rules and regulations.\"Financial obligations: The Prime Minister made it clear that the UK would not shirk its financial obligations during the transition period. \"I do not want our partners to fear that they will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave,\" she said.For the first time, May said that the UK would make ongoing payments to the EU even after the transition period, to cover joint programs in areas like security, science and culture. The UK would make an \"ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved,\" May sad.Trade deal: May rejected an off-the-shelf post-Brexit deal like the close relationship enjoyed by Norway within the European Economic Area or the detailed trade arrangement recently concluded with Canada. Such a choice was \"stark and unimaginative,\" May said, adding that Britain and the EU could do \"so much better.\"\"European Economic Area membership would mean the UK having to adopt at home -- automatically and in their entirety -- new EU rules. Rules over which, in future, we will have little influence and no vote,\" she said. But a Canadian-style trade deal would \"represent such a restriction on our mutual market access that it would benefit neither of our economies.\"EU citizens' rights: May said she aimed to make sure that EU citizens living in the UK -- including 600,000 Italians -- felt appreciated.  \"We want you to stay, we value you, and we thank you for your contribution to our national life,\" she said. But she did not offer any more details beyond the proposals already outlined by the UK.Security: A passage in May's last landmark Brexit speech in January was interpreted as a threat to withdraw security cooperation from Europe if a favorable Brexit deal was not concluded. On Friday, May sought to reject that notion, stressing Britain's continuing commitment to protecting European security in the face of global threats. \"Our determination to defend the stability, security and prosperity of our European neighbors and friends remains steadfast,\" she said.Cautious responseBarnier, the EU's chief negotiator, gave a cautious welcome to the speech, praising its \"constructive spirit\" and signaling a willingness on the part of the EU to consider a formal transition period. But he warned that any extension of EU rights would require the UK to be bound by existing obligations, such as the freedom of movement of all EU citizens. EU negotiator Michel BarnierBut he said that May's words must be turned into specific negotiating positions when the fourth round of Brexit talks begins on Monday. \"Prime Minister May's statements are a step forward but they must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the UK government,\" he said.Barnier noted that May did not offer any clarity on how to resolve the vexed question of the Irish border -- Northern Ireland will remain part of the UK and the Republic of Ireland will stay in the EU. The restoration of a \"hard\" border between the territories threatens to undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which ended 30 years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. \"Today's speech does not clarify how the UK intends to honour its special responsibility for the consequences of its withdrawal for Ireland,\" he said.Manfred Weber, leader of the pro-European, center-right European People's Party in the European Parliament, gave the speech a lukewarm reception, tweeting: \"In substance PM May is bringing no more clarity to London's positions. I am even more concerned now.\"He added: \"The clock is ticking and time is running faster than the government believes in London.\"EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and UK Brexit Secretary David Davis at the first round of talks.The pace of Brexit negotiations has so far frustrated EU and business leaders. The third round of talks ended last month in a very public dispute over how much Britain should pay in a divorce settlement, an issue the EU says must be resolved before the parties' future trading relationship -- Britain's key concern -- can be discussed.Divisions have also emerged within May's government. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appeared to undermine her position just last weekend with a 4,000-word article in the Telegraph newspaper setting out his own Brexit vision.  May will hope that her speech will satisfy demands from the European Union for clarity on Britain's position, as well as placating the \"hard-Brexit\" wing of her Conservative Party, who are adamantly opposed to any arrangement that looks like ongoing EU membership in all but name.Johnson tweeted a positive response to May's speech on Friday, however, saying: \"PM speech was positive, optimistic & dynamic - and rightly disposes of the Norway option! Forwards!\"PM speech was positive, optimistic & dynamic - and rightly disposes of the Norway option! Forwards!\u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) September 22, 2017\nHe added: \"A strong Britain working hand in hand with a strong Europe - but once again free to take our own decisions.\"CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Matt Wells contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)When Britain went into the first round of talks with the EU two months ago, its chief negotiator was pictured facing his Brussels counterpart with no notes on the table in front of him -- as if to confirm what critics of Brexit believe, that the UK government is woefully unprepared to leave by March 2019. On Monday, at the start of the third round of negotiations, David Davis, the UK Brexit Secretary, will have a stack of documents to hand. After the EU's growing impatience at the lack of preparedness from the UK side in the first two rounds, the British government has published several Brexit \"position papers\" setting out how it sees the UK's relationship with Europe once it leaves in just 19 months' time.It was not just accusations of disorganization that has spurred the government of Prime Minister Theresa May into action. Over the summer, legal experts, businesses and the Prime Minister's own Treasury department warned of the consequences of crashing out of the EU under a \"hard Brexit\" without any transitional arrangements agreed in advance. Brexit splits give Theresa May a holiday headacheIn January, the Prime Minister had boldly declared that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" with the EU, making clear that the UK would be ready to walk out of negotiations -- and Europe -- if it didn't get its own way. But in June, she lost her overall majority in a hastily called election and no longer has the power to play hardball.The straightforward argument -- to take back control from Brussels -- that persuaded the British people to vote for Brexit last year has given way to pragmatism. The \"no deal\" ultimatum has been replaced by more realistic proposals.Read MoreYet whether they will bring Britain and the EU any closer to a deal on Brexit remains to be seen. From the point of view of Brussels, the papers still represent far too much of the UK's desire to \"have its cake and eat it\".So what have we learned from the position papers published this week?Customs arrangements and the single marketAccording to the position paper on customs, Britain would leave the customs union, which allows EU countries to trade freely with each other without tariffs. Yet the UK says it wants a special deal with Brussels involving a transition period of two to three years, during which it would keep the benefits of membership of the customs union whilst ministers seek trade deals with other countries.This proposal of a transitional deal would avoid what many have warned would be the \"cliff edge\" scenario after the exit date of March 2019, which would result in long queues at British ports to move goods into and out of the bloc. Every year, 2.6M trucks pass through the Channel port of Dover without the need for customs checks, posing a huge infrastructure challenge post-Brexit.Leaving the single market is essential to controlling immigration, the UK government saysThis desire for special treatment, in which Britain would step outside formal EU membership yet remain closely aligned to the EU's trading and customs systems, is viewed skeptically by the remaining 27 nations.Legal experts and Brussels officials warned that taking part in trading arrangements with the EU should also mean abiding by the bloc's rules. Last weekend, Sir Paul Jenkins, who was the British government's top legal official for nearly a decade, said May was \"foolish\" to think the UK could carry on reaping the economic benefits of access to the single market without adhering to EU law.The Irish borderAt present, there is no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK government wants this situation to remain -- an invisible border, with minimal checks on goods passing between north and south. Smaller traders would be exempt from any checks, while larger firms would be required to sign up to \"trusted trader arrangements\" using electronic checks. JUST WATCHEDIrish farmers straddling border fear BrexitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIrish farmers straddling border fear Brexit 03:25The future of the Irish border raises serious questions because any suggestion of a \"hard border\", with checkpoints, risks undermining more than two decades of the peace process between Northern Ireland, the republic and the British government. Yet a porous border would also mean there would be no guarantee that goods entering post-Brexit Northern Ireland from the rest of the world -- controversial chlorinated chicken from the US, for example -- would not subsequently travel south and enter the EU in breach of single market rules.The European Court of JusticePapers on civil judicial cooperation and on international arbitration over disputes between the UK and EU make clear that Britain intends to break free of \"direct\" jurisdiction of the ECJ, the court which interprets and enforces EU law on issues including trade and security.An EU flag is waved outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London.But the word \"direct\" is key here: British officials have acknowledged that with a close continuing relationship between the UK and EU, there would need to be mutual respect for each other's legal systems. So future cooperation on judicial matters would involve a \"close and comprehensive framework\" to \"mirror closely\" the existing system so that cross-border disputes were resolved swiftly. On arbitration of disputes between the UK and EU, the British government accepts that the ECJ could still have jurisdiction during the transition period. What we have learnedThis approach of May's government to \"have its cake and eat it\" -- to break free yet somehow remain as close as possible -- risks angering the Brexit purists, including many in the Conservative Party, who campaigned for Britain to cut all ties with Europe and set its own course on trade and law. Wrestling free of the ECJ, in particular, is a totemic demand of the anti-European Tory right wing, and any suggestion of a continuing relationship with it could cause a revolt. Taken together, these papers show how May's government has finally realized it cannot take a sudden and dramatic leap in the dark -- which would be hugely economically damaging and technically difficult. But this process of clarification has also served to highlight how complicated Brexit is turning out to be.",

Search operations were continung on Thursday at five properties, including the address where the teen was arrested overnight.

It appeared only to have partially detonated. \"This continues to be a fast-moving investigation. A significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday.

Three men aged between 25 and 48 were arrested in the southern Welsh city of Newport by the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command in connection with local law-enforcement officials earlier this week. Related: The unlikely backdrop to London's latest terror attackThe remaining two men were arrested the day after the attack: An 18-year-old was detained in the port of Dover as he prepared to board a ferry service to France, and a 21-year-old was arrested in Hounslow, west London.Police have not released the names of either of those suspects but both are believed to have been fostered by an elderly couple, Ronald and Penelope Jones, local officials told CNN on Monday.Alison Griffiths, a Surrey County councillor, described the Joneses as \"the sort of people who would never turn a child away, no matter what the circumstances.\" Britain's terror challenge will last a generationGriffiths said the Joneses had fostered more than 280 children over the past 30 years.They have fostered about eight refugees in the past year, including children from Afghanistan and Iraq, she added.\"This has come as a big shock to them.

        "content": "Story highlightsNFL players becoming business savvyLeague pays for continuing educationHead injury awareness part of career planning (CNN)Last month, the Detroit Lions made their 29-year-old franchise quarterback Matthew Stafford the best-paid player in NFL history, inking a $135 million contract that included a $50 million signing bonus.  Until recently, bets might have been taken as to just how long that money would last him.  Not anymore.Follow @cnnsport\n\nWhile pro athletes have been mismanaging their finances for decades, a combination of the realization of health risks and greater financial savvy have led many of Stafford's NFL contemporaries to reverse that trend.  \"I saved (my first pay check),\" says retired 11-year veteran Osi Umenyiora, who won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants after being drafted in 2003.Read More\"I was really smart about my money, because the knowledge had started to come out (that) a lot of players were going broke.\"During the tail end of his career, Umenyiora, who was born in London and raised in Nigeria, launched a financial planning company for African-born NFL players with the help of his brother. \"I was given a lot of advice from former players,\" Umenyiora tells CNN, noting that his one big purchase as a rookie was the house he lived in, calling it a \"win-win situation\" as an investment. \"The NFL really tried to harp on you not going broke because they don't want to see that statistic.\" JUST WATCHEDTwo-time Super Bowl champion on NFL at WembleyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTwo-time Super Bowl champion on NFL at Wembley 02:40The dreaded 78%\"That statistic\" Umenyiora refers to was spawned from a 2009 Sports Illustrated article that claimed 78% of NFL players were penniless only a few years out of retirement. The 2012 ESPN documentary Broke, which chronicled the financial ruin of several high-profile athletes, only reinforced that idea. More recently, a New York Times article that profiled the 25 first-rounders drafted in 1990, uncovered that seven had encountered severe financial distress, while one, former Los Angeles Raider Anthony Smith, was convicted of murder. Tragically, the most famous member of that class, Hall of Famer Junior Seau, committed suicide and was later diagnosed with CTE, a degenerative disease caused by head injuries. Seau, a linebacker, played 20 NFL seasons and was known for his vicious hits.  With those stories ingrained in this generation of players, you're now as likely to see a gridiron star interning on Wall Street as you would be bumping into a shirtless Rob Gronkowski racking up a reported $100,000 tab at a nightclub. Thirty-five year-old Umenyiora says he had his own financial adviser out of college who assisted him, and cites star teammate Michael Strahan -- who has gone on to stardom as a morning show host -- as someone who offered advise on how to invest his money wisely.  But another of Umenyiora's teammates, Jack Brewer -- who had a far more typical NFL lifespan, appearing in just 40 games in four seasons -- is perhaps a better case study in the advancement of career planning within the league. (The average NFL career lasts just 3.3 years, according to the NFL Players Association.)As an undrafted rookie, Brewer signed with the Minnesota Vikings and took his bonus check -- all $8,700 of it after taxes -- and invested it in an on-campus bar at the University of Minnesota, while purchasing a car to promote events. During his playing career, the NFL introduced its Continuing Education Program, where it would reimburse active players for taking college classes in the offseason. \"No other league has a robust program like the NFL,\" Brewer says. \"The NFL is by far the best, and gives the players the most resources when it comes to education.\" JUST WATCHEDCan the NFL recover from its ratings slump?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCan the NFL recover from its ratings slump? 01:53A new approachNow running an investment firm in New York, Brewer took executive classes at Harvard and Wharton, and eventually finished his MBA from the University of Miami, all paid for by the NFL and the NFL Players Association, he says.   \"A player in the National Football League today has no excuse for leaving the game and not having his education, no excuse for leaving the game not being prepared,\" he says. \"The resources are there. They would have to choose to not use them.\"     Happy birthday to two of my fellow #Lions @iamsrice & @clintonportis #LionOrder #Love #Respect A post shared by Jack Brewer (@jackbrewerbsi) on Sep 1, 2017 at 6:33pm PDT\nBrewer's company The Brewer Group, now works alongside the University of Miami in recruiting athletes to enroll in its business school. So far, he has mentored 80 former professional athletes who have completed their MBAs. \"If you go into NFL as if it's a stepping stone, and you want to use the access you get from the NFL to do great things, your finances are going to be fine,\" Brewer says. Former Seattle Seahawks receiver Sidney Rice, who won a Super Bowl in 2014 and retired at 27 after sustaining multiple concussions, is an example of a player taken under Brewer's wing. Rice completed his executive MBA at the University of Miami and owns a number of fast food and coffee franchises in the Seattle area, as well as a sports apparel company. Before retiring he had already invested in a string of Fresh Healthy Vending machines. Twenty-nine-year-old Sergio Brown, who played in eight games for the Buffalo Bills last season, is another University of Miami MBA. Rather than try out for another team, the seven-year veteran called it quits in the offseason and signed with Google instead, as a digital advertising account manager.  \"No doubt, there a lot more guys like Sergio Brown coming out,\" says Brewer, noting how the greater knowledge about head injuries has impacted players' decisions to change careers while still able to play. \"It's the awareness that's changing the game more than anything,\" he says. \"Guys are going brain dead right now, guys are developing Alzheimer's early. When those are the realities of the game, you will probably approach things a little bit differently.\" Indeed, Rice cited \"all of the awareness that was coming to concussions and being able to see the long-term effects\" as his reason to move on.When asked to respond to Brewer's comment, the NFL said in statement: \"The health and well-being of our players is our priority, and (we) offer numerous programs and benefits for former players.\"It cited a number of league-driven initiatives, including a slew of health benefits for retirees, such a stipend of up to $5,250 per player for knee, hip or shoulder replacement surgery, monthly payments to players who have a mild or moderate neurocognitive impairment, and medical cover of up to $130,000 for those who suffer from dementia, ALS and Parkinson's disease.JUST WATCHEDCoy Wire's Super Bowl reflections ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCoy Wire's Super Bowl reflections  03:46Short careers, long foresightLike Brown, who grew up in a rough part of Chicago, Brewer comes from a modest upbringing in Fort Worth, Texas. He says he understands the pitfalls of immediate wealth which can lead to bad planning. \"A lot of these guys come from poverty, and once they get a little bit of money they feel so indebted to their families and close friends that they want to take care of them,\" says Brewer.\"They don't want to leave them in the conditions they are living in while they advance. It's almost like you have a sense of guilt, and so that is a tough situation to deal with.\"Brewer used to invest money on behalf of NFL players, but found the process \"emotionally and physically draining.\"\"There is so much hand holding (which takes) so much time,\" he says. \"You've got to deal with their parents, their families get involved ... it's a little bit overwhelming.\"Instead, Brewer often gives free advice to athletes on how to handle their money, at least until their NFL pension kicks in. Umenyiora, who lives in London and works as an NFL analyst for the BBC, is quick to point out he won't see a dime of his retirement fund until he turns 55. In order to qualify, a player must have played in at least three games in each of three seasons.\"There are 25, 30 years for most players before they can start collecting on that pension,\" he says. \"So you still have to be really smart and wise about how you spend the money you earn, because, quite frankly, the career isn't that long.\"Today's NFL players, it appears, are certainly getting the message.",

            "No. 19 (tie): Sam Bradford, $18 million \u2014 After six mostly disappointing seasons in St Louis and Philadelphia, the first overall pick of the 2010 draft has finally found a home. Although Minnesota did not qualify for the playoffs with an 8-8 record, Sam Bradford was mostly error-free, throwing 20 touchdowns and just five interceptions on his way to an excellent 99 passer rating in 2016.",
            "No. 19 (tie): Brock Osweiler, $18 million \u2014 Brock Osweiler has endured a bumpy road on his way back to Denver. Peyton Manning's former understudy experienced a difficult 2016 spell at Texas (15 TDs, 16 INTs) before being traded to Cleveland and subsequently released. The former Arizona State standout was 5-2 as a starter in Denver filling in for Manning, and Broncos fans hope he can restore some of that magic this season.",
            "No. 18: Ndamukong Suh, $19.1 million \u2014 Ndamukong Suh was signed by the Miami Dolphins for a six-year, $114 million contract in March 2015, making him the highest paid defensive player in history at the time -- hefty numbers for a 30-year-old lineman who has yet to match the 10 sacks achieved during his rookie season with the Detroit Lions.",
            "No. 17: Von Miller, $19.1 million \u2014 The MVP of Super Bowl 50 for the Denver Broncos single-handedly badgered Panthers quarterback Cam Newton into submission, with 6 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 quarterback hurries in the title game. Von Miller promptly signed a $114.5 million deal ($70 million guaranteed) with the Broncos, making him the richest defensive player in NFL history.",
            "No. 16: Ryan Tannehill, $19.25 million \u2014 Though Ryan Tannehill (#17) has shown promise in his five seasons in the league, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the pre-season. A former part-time receiver in college at Texas A&M, Tannehill has been one of the speediest quarterbacks in the league -- a quality which will be tested after knee surgery. In a 44-26 win against Houston in 2015, Tannehill became the 64th quarterback in NFL history to record a perfect passer rating, throwing four TDs, with 18 completions in 19 attempts.",
            "No. 15: Tom Brady, $20.5 million \u2014 With five Super Bowl rings, 12 Pro Bowls, four Super Bowl MVP award and two NFL MVP awards, tom Brady is the one player in the list who can claim to be underpaid. At 40, he's on the back end of a two-year, $41 million contract, but has left money on the table in previous negotiations to sign better players around him -- a plan that has yielded a record seven Super Bowl appearances and counting.",
            "No. 14: Matt Ryan, $20.75 million \u2014 \"Matty Ice\" will attempt to re-earn his nickname, after suffering perhaps the most remarkable blown lead in sporting history at Super Bowl 51 . Up 28-9 going into the fourth quarter, the Falcons handed 25 straight points to New England, with Matt Ryan giving up a crucial fumble and sack in the process. The former Boston College standout and four-time Pro Bowler was inserted as the Atlanta Falcons' starter since being drafted third overall in 2008.",
            "No. 13: Cam Newton, $20.76 million \u2014 Cam Newton is arguably the most complete player on this list. At 6 foot 6 inches and 260 pounds, he has the size, speed and athleticism -- along with stellar QB instincts -- to take the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs every year. But after a disastrous 2016 season, in which the Panthers went 6-10, \"Killer Cam\" will again trying to erase his unfortunate Super Bowl 50 performance (0 touchdowns, one interception, sacked six times, two fumble losses).",

The father of eight children has broken most of the major franchise records, surpassing Dan Fouts as the Chargers' all-time touchdown leader, wins leader and consecutive starts leader (185 and counting). In 2014, Rivers broke an NFL record by achieving five consecutive games with a passer rating of above 120.",
            "No. 11: Eli Manning, $21 million \u2014 The two-time Super Bowl MVP led the Giants back into the playoffs last season, only to lose at Green Bay.

            "No. 9: Russell Wilson, $21.9 million \u2014 It's ironic that Russell Wilson threw the most famous interception in NFL history -- the last-minute gaff which cost the Seattle Seahawks the 2015 Super Bowl -- because the 28-year-old three-time Pro Bowler plays virtually error-free. Though standing at just 5 foot 11 inches, Wilson was the top-rated NFL quarterback in 2015, and is second all-time, trailing only Aaron Rodgers.",

Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a 2011 championship, and is riding an eight-year playoff streak into 2017. But despite posting stellar regular-season numbers in the six seasons since the Super Bowl (a mind-boggling 219 TDs and just 41 INTs) the Packers have come up short in the playoffs.",

In his 10 seasons, the 32-year-old has yet to make a Pro Bowl. But traditionally the Ravens have thrived on defense, and until Flacco came along in 2008, the team won in spite of its sputtering quarterbacks. The 2013 Super Bowl MVP brings a calm presence to a team which suffered a leadership vacuum after the retirements of Ed Reed and Ray Lewis.",
            "No. 6: Kirk Cousins, $23.9 million \u2014 \"You like that?\" Kirk Cousins, who led Washington to the playoffs in 2015 behind that rallying cry, signed his second consecutive one-year deal in the off-season. Unable to come to a long-term deal with the Redskins, the 29-year-old settled for one year and nearly $24 million.",
            "No. 5: Drew Brees, $24.3 million \u2014 It's hard to overestimate Drew Brees' value to the city of New Orleans. When the former Charger joined the Saints in 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, the team was 3-13. Four years later, New Orleans won its first and only Super Bowl. The 10-time Pro Bowler holds team passing records in every major category.  He has also been a face of the community, raising funds for cancer research and other charitable causes.",

His off-season shoulder surgery, however, sidelines him for the start of the 2017 campaign.",
            "No. 2: Derek Carr, $25 million \u2014 The Oakland Raiders made Derek Carr their franchise QB this offseason with a five-year, $125 million deal -- briefly crowning the former Fresno State man as the highest paid player in the league. Carr has been a Pro-Bowler two of his first three seasons in Oakland.",
            "No. 1: Matthew Stafford, $27 million \u2014 Weeks before the start of the 2017 campaign, Detroit made Stafford the highest-paid player in NFL history with a five year, $135 million deal. Though he is yet to win a playoff game, Stafford is the Lions' all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. The nine-year veteran's 99-game starting streak is 11th best of all time."

Follow @cnnsport\n\nAlthough huge strides have been made since the 2012 London Olympics, when every Olympic sport had female representation for the first time, women athletes remain largely underpaid and overlooked. According to London-based charity Women in Sport, women's sports make up just 7% of all media coverage in the UK and generate a mere 0.4% of all sports sponsorship money.But there is one professional sport that stands out as a beacon of gender equality: equestrianism. \"That's the amazing thing about this sport, it's the only Olympic sport where men and women have an equal playing field,\" rider Ariana Rockefeller told CNN by phone.

Rockefeller who competed on the Longines Global Champions Tour in Europe for the first time this summer. Equal prize money, billingAlthough equestrian sports returned to the Olympic family in 1912, only male cavalry officers were allowed to take part. At the 1952 games, women were allowed to participate in dressage, followed by showjumping in 1956 and eventing in 1964.More than six decades later, men and women compete against each other at all levels of competition, with both sexes receiving equal prize money and billing. In fact, in a sport where the main focus is on the bond between animal and human and less on physical strength and endurance, women often beat men -- both in the arena and at the bank. And unlike most other professional sports, female coaches are common in riding.READ: Ariana Rockefeller on fashion, family and horsesWomen rider tops money rankingsThis week Rome hosts the penultimate round of action in the 2017 Longines Global Champions Tour (LGCT).Australian rider Edwina Tops-Alexander tops the all-time prize money list on LGCT for the world's top show jumpers with close to \u20ac3.5 million ($4.2 million) in earnings.Tops-Alexander, a two-time winner of the overall LGCT crown who competed in her first show earlier this month after giving birth to a baby girl at the end of July, was also the first rider to earn more than one million euros ($1.2 million) in prize money.Australian Edwina Tops-Alexander in action in Chantilly, France in 2010.

However, it is important that we continue with these searches and I'd like to thank all those affected for their support, patience and cooperation.\"Related: The unlikely backdrop to London's latest terror attackOfficers continue to search a property in Newport, South Wales where a 25-year-old was taken into custody on Tuesday night in connection with last week's subway bombing at Parsons Green Underground station in London. People who saw Tuesday's police activity in Newport said officers pounced on the suspect. Sully Ali, 19, a part-time model, told Britain's Press Association: \"A big van pulled up and six officers got out and jumped this guy.\"\"There were two armed officers there, they didn't have their guns pointed at him but they had them on show. The guy was smiling. I didn't hear him saying anything or the police saying anything to him.\"Ali said the man worked as a painter and decorator for some local residents.

You don't expect it in your own house.\"The couple were given medals by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for the continued work fostering children and young people. Police investigating the Parsons Green train attack arrested two more men on Wednesday.ISIS has claimed involvement in the subway bombing via its Amaq News Agency.

The country's Constitutional Court suspended the vote on September 6, after the central government argued that Spain's 1978 constitution declares that the country is indivisible, Reuters reported. National authorities have stepped up their efforts to halt the vote in recent days. Officers from Spain's national police force, the Guardia Civil, arrested Catalonia's junior economic minister, Josep Maria Jove, along with eight other officials.Police raided three Catalan government buildings -- the Presidency, the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- Catalan authorities confirmed to CNN. People hold a banner reading \"Independence now!\" in Catalan at a demonstration on September 11.The raids were believed to be linked to the referendum's website, a spokesman for the regional government said. Police also seized almost 10 million papers relating to the upcoming ballot at a warehouse in an industrial estate near Barcelona, the Ministry of Interior said. Papers such as voter lists, signs and paperwork for counting votes were also confiscated.The Ministry of Interior said the seized papers were \"essential electoral material for holding the illegal referendum suspended by the Constitutional Court.\"Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy hit back at the Catalan President in a video address Wednesday.  \"What we have seen in Catalonia is an attempt to liquidize national sovereignty,\" he said in the address, posted to his official Twitter account.He added that all Spaniards should have a say in what their country looks like. As the operation got underway, protesters assembled outside the offices of Catalonia's economy ministry in the heart of Barcelona's tourist district, waving posters that read \"Freedom for Catalonia\" and shouting: \"We will vote.\"Puigedemont called upon Catalan citizens to \"defend democracy against a repressive and intimidating regime\" by going to the polls as planned on October 1.Barcelona's football club said it backed the referendum. It said in a statement posted to its official Twitter account: \"In the wake of the events that have transpired in recent days and, especially, today, with regard to the current political situation in Catalonia, FC Barcelona in remaining faithful to its historic commitment to the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination, condemns any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights.\" CNN's Milena Veselinovic and Stephanie Halasz in London contributed to this report.",

The three were charged under Germany's \"good Samaritan\" laws. The District Court of Essen-Borbeck said the three didn't help the man \"although they were obliged to do so.\"The incident took place last October in the foyer of a Deutsche Bank branch. Surveillance video presented in court showed the collapsed man and the three people paying no attention to him. The defendants argued they thought the 83-year-old was a homeless man sleeping. Read More\"Because the man was visible in immediate vicinity of the banking machines, there could be no reasonable doubt for the defendants this was a disaster that required assistance,\" the court said in a statement. The court, in its statement, didn't name the victim or the defendants. The three have to pay fines ranging from $2,900 to $4,300.\"Duty to assist\" statutes also exist in countries such as Denmark and France. The absence of such laws in many US states is due in part to the fact that courts have consistently ruled that a person is not bound by law to help someone else (even if one would think it falls under the law of common decency). Many states do, however, have laws that protect people who render aid from being charged if their actions unintentionally cause harm to the person they are trying to help.One recent case that made headlines was in Florida, when a group of teens taunted a drowning man while filming his death from afar. They were not initially criminally charged, but police later recommended to the prosecutor that they be charged with failing to report a death.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe Desert Road Runners is the oldest running club in Dubai Despite its inferno-like summer temperatures, running in the emirate has exploded in recent yearsDubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN)It's 35 degrees Celsius on the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, and a group of women wearing tiny shorts and Lycra vests are about to jog with men around a public park in Dubai.My feelings of apprehension are twofold. One: exercising in this heat seems masochistic. Two: women in Dubai are generally expected to dress conservatively in public.But in the sort of cultural contradiction that has come to typify Dubai, concern is not needed. Female runners, it transpires, are unofficially absolved from observing the emirate's religious rules of sartorial decency.And as for the temperature? Well, the mercury hit 45 degrees Celsius last week.  Read MoreWelcome to Dubai's oldest running club -- possibly one of the most hardcore sports groups in the world.Dubai's oldest running clubWhen the Desert Road Runners (DRR) first braved the heat in 1989, Dubai had a lot more desert than it did road.The Burj Khalifa had not yet been conceived of. Emirates airline was four years old. And the population was about 500,000. It's nearly three million today, 2.3 million of whom are non-Emiratis.In short, it was a different world -- one with not a sail-shaped skyscraper in sight.\"It really started as a social club for British expats,\" Graham Rafferty, who has been club coordinator since 1998, and a member since 1996, tells CNN. \"Initially, we used to run in the streets. Then the streets got too busy.\"Some of the Dubai Road Runners, pictured in August 2017.In 1991, this merry band of 20 runners founded Dubai's first 10km race, The Dubai Desert Road Run, which is still held every September.\"In the early days, the Ukrainian National Athletics Squad used to come out to Dubai to train in winter, enter the 10k and take all the prizes,\" laughs Rafferty.The only local competition the DRR had back then were the Abu Dhabi Striders, who had been racing around their patch of desert since 1984.But in 1995, the regional running scene was transformed with the birth of the Dubai Creek Striders, who earmarked as their turf Dubai's pretty old town, home to the Gold Souk and Al Fahidi Fort.What began as a club of four soon proliferated, and in 2002 the Striders founded the Dubai Creek Striders Half Marathon. Rivalry was ignited in a running inferno.Extreme runnersTia Jones arrived in Dubai in 2004 from Australia, after her husband took a job with an oil and gas company in the emirate.\"At first, I was despondent because I thought I wouldn't be able to run here,\" she says. \"People forget that when the temperature is 42 degrees Celsius the 'real feel temperature' can be up to 56 with the humidity. That's what the body feels when it runs.\"The rugged landscape of Hatta, seen in 2015 during the cycling Dubai Tour.Jones joined the DRR and discovered extreme ways to beat the heat.\"We get up at 2am in the morning and drive out to Hatta,\" she says of the UAE town at the foot of the Al Hajar mountains. \"You start as early as you can and then come back.\"Mountain runs are vital training, she explains, \"to get the elevation because Dubai is flat\" and many international races are not.Jones, like many other DRR members, is now an ultra-marathon runner, currently focused on time-based track racing.\"I do a 12-hour run on a 400m track to see how many miles I can do in that time. I've just done a 24-hour (race) and managed 211km (131 miles). I was quite happy with that.\"The Striders are also producing more ultra-marathon runners.Having a strong South African contingency, this year the club sent 14 runners to the famous Comrades ultra-marathon of 89 km (56 miles) between the cities of Durban and Pietermaritzburg.\"Three years ago, we were only entering two or three runners (in Comrades),\" Neil Goulsbra, vice chair of the Striders, tells CNN.Running out of control?What started out as a niche hobby, something that \"crazy\" expats did to fill the time, has become a phenomenon in Dubai.The DRR now has 200 members, the Striders are pushing 850 and there are countless other running clubs across the emirate.In 2007, the Dubai Marathon launched, and has been followed by countless events from skyscraper dashes such as the 30 Vertical Run Almas Tower, which see runners scale a 64-story building, to the corporate-sponsored 3 Bloomberg Square Mile Relay.\"Running as a sport in Dubai has dramatically changed. When I arrived in 1996, there were two to three races,\" says Rafferty. \"Now there are about two races per week. \"The commercial events are pushing out the club events, soaking up the sponsorship and getting high numbers but only 10% are really runners. The rest are turning up for the T-shirt.\" Runners at the starting line of the Dubai Marathon, January 23, 2015. First run in the year 2000, the marathon is now extremely popular, with the winner receiving $200,000 -- one of the highest race prizes in the world.Some of the wider region's most interesting races, however, have flourished.The Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon just north of Dubai, for example, is known globally for its lightning quick times, while the Wadi Bih Run has turned a popular hike in the Wadi Khabb Shamsi into a wildly successful race along the Arabian Gulf coast of Oman. Founded in 1993, it is the oldest race in Middle East and, for some, the ultimate regional long-distance, consisting of  two relays (50km, 72km), and three solo races (30km, 50km, 72km).Positive outcomeWhile the DRR and Striders are perhaps victims of their own success, there is another notable way in which these clubs are a unique force for good.On the sweltering morning CNN joins the DRR, its runners hail from Cameroon, India, South Africa, Germany, England, Italy and Canada -- a mix of nationalities you'd be pushed to find at a Dubai Friday brunch -- and hold jobs up and down the economic spectrum. And although none were present, I'm assured the group has Emirati members. Today, the group is congratulating Michael Lobo, a logistics manager from Goa, India, who aged 65 has just qualified for his second Boston Marathon.He recalls how in 2014, he qualified for the same race by just 15 seconds. \"I got a call in the middle of the night to say I'd qualified,\" he grins. \"It felt like winning the lottery.\"",

Harvey described the teenager as unhappy. A local official said the second suspect had also been fostered by the Joneses.

She didn't want to lose to me again.\"Though that day belonged to Sharapova, their head-to-head since makes for grim reading for the Russian.

It would be two years before they would see each other again.Yuri had planned for someone to pick them up from the airport, but that person never arrived.Barely able to speak a word of English between them, they were stranded in a new country in the middle of the night with nowhere to go.Sharapova is all too aware that had it not been for fate, good fortune or the kindness of strangers, her story could have been completely different.Sharapova was knocked out in round 16 of the US Open -- her first grand slam since her return from a drugs ban\"It's 2:00 am and nobody is there and where do you go?\" she says. \"What do you do? Who do you call? And then, there happens to be a couple that you meet on the plane that takes you to their hotel room,\" she recalls. \"You end up staying on the floor and just those experiences, like, who were the saviors? Who? When we're young, we always say 'stay away from strangers,' but those were the strangers that really helped us get to where we are today.\"Throughout her career Sharapova has painted herself as the underdog, as if it were her against the world.She believes this backs-against-the-wall approach stems from her time bouncing around tennis academy dormitories, always being an outsider, never quite fitting in.\"I was with kids that were much older than I was, that had very different interests, that stayed up late, that didn't take their sport as seriously as I had,\" she recalls. \"So I think we're maybe on different goal career paths and I realized that from a young age. And I think part of that isolated me. \"It became a habit and it became so repetitive that I didn't even notice it, but it was absolutely lonely in those times.\"Drug banSharapova held a press conference to announce she had failed a drugs testREAD: Sharapova ban reduced on appeal READ: Sharapova return generating buzzOn March 7, 2016, Sharapova called an impromptu press conference to announce she had failed a drugs test.The prohibited substance meldonium -- an over-the-counter heart medication commonly used in the countries formerly comprising the Soviet Union -- had been found in a regulation test she had taken following her Australian Open quarterfinal defeat to Serena Williams.Though at the time Sharapova accepted \"full responsibility\" for taking the drug, to this day she vehemently denies knowingly taking a banned substance that would aid athletic performance.Initially prescribed meldonium in 2006 \"both as a cardio-protective agent and as a preventative agent for diabetes,\" Sharapova claimed she wasn't aware the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had added the drug to the prohibited substance list on January 1, 2016 -- 18 days before the start of the Australian Open.\"It was shocking,\" she said, describing her emotion upon hearing of the failed test. \"It was surprising. It was a lot of emotions. So much uncertainty, I think. That was the toughest emotion that I had to deal with.\"JUST WATCHEDWhy would athletes use meldonium?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy would athletes use meldonium? 01:15But questions about the legitimacy of Sharapova's defense still remain. How had nobody in her team of agents, doctors, dieticians, lawyers and advisers not notice the addition of meldonium to the prohibited substances list?As the final sentence of the independent tribunal investigating the case said: \"She is the sole author of her own misfortune.\"Many leading figures on the tour, most notably Eugenie Bouchard and Caroline Wozniaki, have been vocal in their disapproval of Sharapova's return to the circuit and the wildcards she has received.Sharapova, however, remains unfazed by the criticism.\"I think if the reaction was coming from fact, I think I would take them into account,\" she explains. \"But when the reactions come from just the personal opinion, or things that are not based on facts, there's no time for me to think about that.\"Can Sharapova win another grand slam?

RetirementSharapova is adamant she never believed the drug ban would end her career, although she admits not knowing how long the ban would be was \"scary.\"Despite the ban shaving 15 months off her career, the five-time grand slam champion believes it gave her a new lease of life.Prior to her positive test, she admits to seriously entertaining the idea that 2016 would be her last year on the professional circuit.After suffering multiple shoulder injuries in her early twenties and undergoing surgery, Sharapova was unsure whether her body could continue to cope with the rigors of the tour, much less whether she had the desire to continue playing.\"To keep doing that grind, six days a week, for hours on end,\" she says. \"Competing at 18, 19 tournaments a year and doing it over and over. \"You know, it's a combination of things that get you to a high, whether it's a ranking or a high position and all those things have to come together. \"I always knew that I had a passion for the sport, but I just felt like I would just one day want to sit on the couch. And I don't know, sitting on the couch gets pretty boring.\"Sharapova says she would like to end her career on her \"own terms\" but, as of yet, doesn't know herself what this means.Visit CNN.com/tennis for more news and features\"I don't know if it's a grand slam, I don't know if it's another victory, I don't know if it's a personal victory. I don't know,\" she says. \"I think we know so many things. We know scheduling, we know events, but all I know is things that I've achieved. I know all those things. I know what I'm capable of. I know how much desire I have. \"And I still feel like I have a lot to bring.\"This story's headline has been updated with an additional quote from Maria Sharapova and makes clear that the coach she talks about at Wimbledon in 2004 was Mauricio Hadad.",

It looked like three going into one, but I don't know who was to blame.\"   Hamilton on cruise control Never before in the 10-year history of the Singapore Grand Prix had rain affected the night race, but a deluge before sundown served notice of what a difficult night might be in store. The rain cleared only to return 15 minutes before lights out, forcing drivers to switch to intermediate tires and full wets while waiting on the start grid.   The added grip was little help to Verstappen and Raikkonen as they slipped up, and into each other as they fought over the same piece of track. It was an unexpected blessing for Hamilton who, with both Ferrari drivers out and only one Red Bull to deal with, controlled the race as the rain relented and the track dried out.UPDATED DRIVER STANDINGS@LewisHamilton now leads the championship by 28 pointsThe biggest lead so far in 2017#SingaporeGP \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec #F1 pic.twitter.com/1nwoMV3m2F\u2014 Formula 1 (@F1) September 17, 2017 \nThe Briton easily kept Ricciardo at arm's length even when the Safety Car inevitably came out as members of the chasing pack slid into the barriers -- in all, eight drivers retired.Hamilton took the checkered flag after two hours with 58 laps of the scheduled 61 complete -- motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, stipulate that a race can last a maximum of 120 minutes. Further down the field, Carlos Sainz finished fourth -- his best-ever F1 result -- with Sergio Perez and Jolyon Palmer following on behind.Palmer's first points of the season may stand him in good stead as he looks to find another seat next year after recently being axed by Renault in favor of Sainz.

Singapore marked his 129th race without any silverware, one more than compatriot Adrian Sutil who left F1 in 2014.

In Friday's incident, at Parsons Green station, an improvised device exploded as a train arrived during the morning rush hour, injuring 30 passengers.  \"(The second man) was arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act and taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody,\" police said in a statement Sunday.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said that lowering the threat level to \"severe\" means that an attack is now considered \"highly likely.\"\"Members of the public will be wondering what that means in terms of their travel into work tomorrow.

Sudden 'boom'The blast occurred during the morning rush hour at about 8:20 a.m. local time (3:20 a.m. ET) Friday at Parsons Green Tube station, a leafy stop on a busy commuter line from southwest London into the center of the British capital.     Rowley said the blast was caused by a single improvised explosive device. A British security source who was briefed on the investigation told CNN that a timer was found on the device. It's clear the device was intended to cause much greater damage, the source said, but cautioned that the investigation is still in its preliminary stages.Another source briefed by investigators told CNN that an initial assessment of the device indicates it is \"highly likely\" to have contained the explosive TATP but that this has not been confirmed. It also appeared to have been crude and poorly designed, the source said.In the aftermath of the explosion, Parsons Green station was closed, a wide security cordon was put in place and large numbers of emergency responders, including armed police officers, flooded the scene.\"Suddenly, there was this boom,\" eyewitness Gustavo Vieira told CNN. \"Everyone shouting and screaming... We were just leaving the carriage [when the explosion happened]... everyone starting running... and I didn't look back.\"He said people were taken to a nearby restaurant, where some were treated by first responders. A woman is tended by first responders near Parsons Green station.Another witness, software developer Sylvain Pennec, told CNN: \"It was maybe 10 meters from me, the explosion. I didn't fully realize because I had my headphones on. I heard a big... 'Bam,' an explosion noise. \"When I looked I saw people starting to get scared. We were lucky because we were at the Parsons Green station and the doors were starting to open. Everyone managed to get out of the train.\"Pennec said the device looked \"like a big mayonnaise bucket\" but he was unsure what was inside.\"I saw some people with burns, and things like that. But, from what I saw, most people were injured from the movement of the crowd,\" he added.Ambulances and police stand nearby after an incident on a tube train at Parsons Green subway station.Police evacuated an area within a radius of about 55 yards around the station while they investigate.\"The evacuation has been necessary whilst specialist officers secure the remnants of the improvised device and ensure it is stable,\" a Met Police statement said, adding that a \"small number of residents\" would be affected.Mayor: 'Safe global city'Khan told CNN there would be \"an enhanced police presence\" across London's public transport system and urged people to be \"vigilant and alert\" -- but not alarmed.\"What we've seen in the last period across Europe is attempts by evil and cowardly individuals to kill, to injure and to disrupt our way of life and what we're not going to do is allow them to change how we live our lives, to be pluralistic, to be respectful,\" he said.\"We will do all we can to keep our city, to keep Londoners, to keep visitors, to keep businesses safe.\" He added: \"We are a safe global city.\"An armed police officer stands nearby after an incident on a tube train at Parsons Green station.US President Donald Trump told reporters in the White House Rose Garden that \"we have to be tougher and we have to be smarter\" in dealing with the terrorist threat.\"It is a terrible thing. It just keeps going and going and we have to be very smart, we have to be very, very tough, perhaps we are not nearly tough enough,\" Trump said. Trump called the British Prime Minister \"to offer his condolences over this morning's cowardly attack in London,\" a Downing Street spokesperson said.Later in the day, speaking to members of the United States Air Force at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, Trump said \"radical Islamic terrorism\" would be eradicated.He added, \"America and our allies will never be intimidated.

Terror had struck -- and for London's fourth terror attack this year, in the unlikeliest of locations.Around 30 minutes outside central London, this verdant, largely residential area in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is hardly an obvious target for extremists. Members of the emergency services work near Parsons Green underground tube station in west London on Friday, following an incident on an underground tube carriage at the station.It is an affluent, upmarket neighborhood popular with families and young professionals.

He recalled scenes of frantic chaos and confusion as commuters scrambled to get off the packed train and onto the   platform. There were children and elderly people among them, he added.\"I looked to my left and just saw a herd of people starting to run down,\" Shokunbi said, shaking his head in disbelief.  \"Out of all the places you know?

But another legend of the game, 10 months Federer's senior, recently sealed two grand slam titles in the space of 24 hours. Martina Hingis, 36, won the women's doubles and the mixed doubles at the recent US Open, taking her overall grand slam total to 25.

And she remains the youngest singles grand slam winner in the Open era -- having reached all four major finals in 1997, only missing out at Roland Garros.\"I was the youngest in most of the things I did,\" says Hingis. \"Now, I look back at it and see [today's] juniors and young upcoming players ...You say 'Oh Jelena Ostapenko, when she won the French Open she was only 20 years old!' \"And I'm like hang on ...

Had she done too much too young?\"In my case I definitely wouldn't want to change what I went through with anyone,\" says Hingis. \"It's a lot cooler than having to go to school.\"\"I did education until I was 14 when I turned pro and then some later on as well, but I think this is the best education you can get. \"My mom always made sure that when we traveled to different cities and countries that we also took something from there to learn about.\" A fleeting returnHingis came out of retirement and returned to the ATP Tour in 2006, duly lifting the Australian Open mixed doubles trophy with India's Mahesh Bhupathi.

Erdogan says exiled former ally Fethullah Gulen was behind the attempt, a charge the US-based cleric has denied.Related: Nearly 500 in court in Turkey's biggest trial over coup attemptErdogan's purgeSince the failed coup, Turkey has been under a state of emergency and Erdogan has orchestrated a series of controversial constitutional reforms while overseeing a massive purge, which critics argue is simply a pretense to silence opposition voices.

Cavusoglu responded, saying that \"We should distinguish between 'real journalists' and 'pseudo-journalists' who help terrorist activities.\" He said that those who were involved the coup last year should \"face the sentences that are necessary.\"'I'm not at war with press,' says Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganMore than 169,000 people have faced \"judicial action\" ranging from travel restrictions and detentions to arrest warrants since the coup attempt, according to state media outlet Anadolu, citing the Justice Ministry.That figure includes the ongoing high-profile Cumhuriyet newspaper trial, in which six journalists and managers from one of the country's last remaining opposition publications remain imprisoned on charges of supporting various terror organizations operating in Turkey. Seven others from the paper who had been indicted were released under judicial supervision in July.But the trial -- which many observers are calling a crucial test of press freedom -- continues for their colleagues who were denied release by an Istanbul court on Monday. After evaluating the demands, the court board ruled Akin Atalay, Ahmet Sik, Kadri Gursel, Mehmet Murat Sabuncu, Ahmet Kemal Aydogdu and Yusuf Emre Iper should remain under arrest until more evidence is presented.

In a bid to help their drivers crash out in bed rather than in a race teams turn to sleep scientists like Steven Lockley who ensure their stars are at their mental peak of their powers when the lights go out.   F1 drivers are looking for every edge, every advantage, and sleep is one of the tools they can useSteven Lockley, Harvard Medical School\"If you are healthy you can't really get too much sleep and the more you get the better you perform -- it's been pretty well proven,\" Lockley, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told CNN's The Circuit. Read More\"F1 drivers are looking for every edge, every advantage and sleep is one of the tools they can use to make sure they are at optimal performance.\"READ: Top tips to improve your slumberCircadian clockIn Singapore, keeping jet lag at bay isn't too problematic -- the evening race allows drivers to stick to European time. \"They end up going to bed at 3-4 a.m. Singapore time and get up about noon there,\" Lockley says.  But for the races that follow in Malaysia and Japan, longer, more complex plans are required.\"We start shifting them to the new time zone before they leave, so they get a head start and then managing their light/dark cycles which is a key synchronizer of circadian clock,\" Lockley added.\"So when to see light but also when to avoid light -- wearing sunglasses becomes an important component.\"Sunglasses: \"Sometimes it's the plan, sometimes it's for style,\" says sleep expert Steven Lockley.\"We also use melatonin which is good at helping you shift your clock and we manage caffeine use so it's being used optimally to help alertness, but minimizing the negative impacts on sleep.\"READ: Bottas signs 2018 Mercedes dealLockley provides his expertise to F1 through Hintsa Performance, a consultancy that work with several drivers on the grid, tending to all aspects of their health, from mental and physical well being to nutrition and recovery. Their team of coaches apply the philosophy of its late founder, and former McLaren team doctor, Aki Hintsa, who was a highly respected and much-loved figure in the F1 paddock.   I just had that little bit extra capacity and brain power and energy left for the crucial momentsNico Rosberg, 2016 F1 world championLewis Hamilton, who worked with Hintsa at McLaren, has spoken glowingly about the Finn's positive influence. Reigning world champion Nico Rosberg also credits Lockley's guidance with helping him clinch the 2016 title. \"I always struggled so much in all the years with sleeping when I got to different time zones ... it took so much energy from me,\" Rosberg explained earlier this year. But by following Lockley's advice of making small adjustments ahead of races, the German's fortunes were transformed. \"I just had that little bit extra capacity and brain power, you know, and energy left for the crucial moments. Anything extra you can bring to the table is going to help you in that moment and that's part of why I won the world championship.\"Speedsters and spacemenLockley has spent almost 25 years studying sleep and along with F1's elite counts astronauts among his clients. \"Through our work, NASA are putting new multi LED lights on the International Space Station so they can change the intensity and the color of the light to help with alertness when we want them to be performing well or to calm the brain before sleep.\"Steven Lockley is helping astronauts work and rest better on the International Space Station.Other more down-to-earth professions are also beginning to benefit from his expertise -- notably police, firefighters, doctors and nurses whose body clocks are routinely under siege from night shifts and long working hours.There is no one walking around that does well after five or six hours of sleepSteven Lockley, Harvard Medical SchoolScientists already know a lot about these \"all-nighters,\" as Lockley calls them, but the effects of chronic sleep loss are only just starting to be better understood. \"We didn't realize until recently that this chronic sleep loss builds up pretty quickly and that's a problem for most of us -- that, and the impacts on long-term health, increasing the risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer, is key,\" Lockley said.\"You can build up quite quickly what's termed as a chronic sleep debt. Even within a couple of weeks if you're only sleeping six hours a night you can be as bad as someone who has been awake for 24 hours straight.READ/WATCH: Vettel - 'Hunger to win greater than ever'\"We know that even eight hours a night isn't enough to maintain performance day-to-day ... there is no one walking around that does well after five or six hours of sleep, even though they might claim to. When you measure them objectively you find that they are still performing poorly.\"Fast asleepWith Lockley's sleep plans to hand, few drivers will have any problem getting their eight hours in this weekend. Some spend even longer in bed -- Force India's rising star Esteban Ocon says he sleeps for 12 hours!  \"What I have noticed, even before I was involved, is that sleep is being prioritized -- the drivers sleep a long time,\" Lockley said. \"They know that they need to sleep well ... the drivers are wanting to sleep eight, nine, 10 hours a night because they know it makes such a big difference. They are, if you like, good advocates for sleep. They realize its importance and prioritize it in their planning.\" Planning is the key word here, whether you're an F1 driver, an astronaut or even a holidaymaker heading off on a long-haul flight.  \"The direction of travel -- and how well you adapt -- depends on your internal clock. Three quarters of us have a clock longer than 24 hours which means we find it easier traveling west, whereas a quarter of people actually find it easier to travel east,\" says Lockley, whose jet lag advice will shortly be available on an app called Timeshifter.  Visit CNN.com/motorsport for more news and features\"Knowing whether you are a morning type of an evening type is a good start. Think about your direction of travel and plan your trip accordingly. Start to shift before you go. If you're going west, go to bed a bit later for a couple of days before. If you're going east go to bed earlier.\" Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen gets some shut-eye at Spa-Francorchamps.But what about Lockley? Does he ever suffer from jet lag?\"The jet-lag guy can't have jet lag so I plan and follow the program when I travel. My wife and I traveled to Australia for the first time about 10 years ago and that was the first time she really believed I knew what I was talking about!\" he says.\"That was the proof of the pudding.\" The 2017 Singapore Grand Prix takes place on Sunday September 17",

For a girl whose family home has no running water -- who first played golf with makeshift wooden clubs cut from trees lining her home course -- the chance to play at an elite level could be life-changing. A fund-raising website, teampratima.com, has been set up where members of the public can make donations to support her career. There's hope this money can help her secure a college place in the US with access to high-level coaching, regular training, and advanced equipment. But Sherpa won't be forgetting her home country -- a nation with just 700 registered golfers among a population of 29 million.  \"I want to develop golf in Nepal,\" she says. \"I will give back to the golf community in Nepal and will help underprivileged children enjoy the sport as I have.\"The Royal Nepal is just a stone's throw from the airport in the country's capital Kathmandu.

Monkeys, mistaking them for eggs, are known to steal shots from the greens.A young girl shelters on the greens of the Royal Nepal Golf Club following the earthquake that devastated Kathmandu in 2015.The goats, chickens, and dogs kept by Sherpa's family, meanwhile, are hardly safe. One of their five dogs was eaten by a leopard. Then there's the weather. During the summer months, monsoons are common in Nepal; Sherpa is no stranger to crunching drives and measuring putts through torrential rain. In April 2015, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Kathmandu. With buildings reduced to rubble, locals were forced from their homes and 2,000 sought shelter living in tents on the Royal Nepal. For several months, Sherpa's home became a refugee camp.READ: $10 million bonus keeps golfers focusedSame sport, different gameWhile this life may appear an anomaly within the sport of golf as most know it, Sherpa shares the same dreams and heroes as any aspiring professional.

        "content": "Bremen, Germany (CNN)Karsten P. empties a test tube filled with metal pieces into the palm of his hand. They're the tiny screws and bolts that held his face together after he and his partner Sven were violently assaulted in a life-changing attack outside their local store.Two surgeries later and fearful of being attacked again, the openly gay 52-year-old taxi driver -- who doesn't want to be identified because of concerns of another attack -- avoids public spaces and always takes pepper spray with him. He and his partner have also been forced to move neighborhoods in the northwest German city of Bremen following mounting costs as a result of being injured. \"I went outside and saw someone kicking my partner's head. I was trying to stop him and right at that moment, I got hit from the side,\" Karsten recalls about the attack. \"I kind of lost consciousness and when I got up again, I thought my partner was dead. He was all covered in blood and he didn't move at all.\"Karsten holds the metal implements that held his face together following the attack.Police identified the attackers as two locally known Muslim extremists. They were never arrested and later fled to Syria. After demanding answers from local prosecutors and the mayor's office and not getting a response, Karsten turned to Germany's far right party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD).\"I don't like everything they say,\" Karsten says, \"but this is too dangerous for gay people to live openly here, if we get attacked like that. We need a party that's talking openly about this.\"Read MoreThe anti-immigration, anti-same-sex marriage partyWeidel, an openly gay woman, was brought into the AfD as a moderating voice.Campaigning on a vociferously anti-immigration platform, the four-year-old AfD party now has seats in 13 of the country's 16 state parliaments. It has proposed a ban on mosque minarets and cutbacks on migration, from within the European Union and beyond, while its party manifesto says that \"Islam does not belong in Germany.\"Critics accuse the party of being a flimsy disguise for neo-Nazi sentiment, and cite one candidate who allegedly sent a photo of Hitler to some AfD supporters with the text: \"Adolf please get in touch! Germany needs you! The German people!\"Germans vote in national elections this month, and the AfD is contesting them for the first time. The party is polling around 9% in recent days, which could put it in contention for third or fourth place, well behind Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats, who have ruled out entering into a coalition with the AfD.Why the German elections matter to the rest of the worldIn some ways, the AfD is an unlikely place for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) voters. The party has threatened to sue the government for allowing the recent vote to legalize same-sex marriage, and the AfD manifesto advocates the \"traditional family as a guiding principle.\" Yet one of the AfD's top candidates, Alice Weidel, is an openly gay woman raising children with her partner. Weidel, an economist, was brought in as the softer, moderating face of the party, but her campaign speeches show she can deliver an angry rant on immigration as well as her AfD peers. \"Merkel's refugee policy will destroy our welfare state of the Federal Republic of Germany!\" she said in a recent campaign post. \"We, as AfD, will make sure that this comes to an end. Because open borders do not work with a sustainable social state.\" 'Homonationalism'People like Karsten and Sven aren't alone in supporting the party. There is even a German term for gay support of the far right: \"homonationalism.\" A 2016 survey from \"MEN,\" a monthly magazine for gay men, showed that 17% of respondents openly supported the AfD, higher than the national average. \"A party like the AfD gives people from minorities an offer of social identity,\" says Beate Kupper, a social psychologist at Hochschule Niederrhein University in North Rhine-Westphalia who studies the far right in Germany. \"If you identify strongly with a group and you have an 'out-group' that you can position yourself against, that is a good feeling for your personal belonging.\" Kupper singles out Weidel's campaign speeches as a particular example of this. \"If you look at Alice Weidel, she's an economist, so her expertise is on the economy. [But] she is not speaking that much about the economy. Her topic is very much devaluation and hatred towards Muslims. Muslims are now the identified out-group.\"Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugees Mirko Welsch was also once an AfD supporter, initially drawn to the party by its resistance to the euro currency. He was even an elected AfD official in his district council of Saarbrucken, a rare feat for a gay member of the party. \"I was convinced that the AfD would grow as a party into a well-respected opposition to the Christian Democrats,\" he says. \"I believed in what it originally stood for.\"But he became increasingly uncomfortable as party leaders ratcheted up the anti-immigration rhetoric. He resigned in March, after one AfD leader called for a \"180-degree turn\" in the way Germany deals with the Second World War, particularly \"national guilt\" over its Nazi history.\"The AFD has developed in a way that we are seeing incitement against different groups of minorities,\" Welsch says. \"The party has just moved too many inches to the right.\"Welsch believes that LGBT support for the AfD is actually dropping, despite Alice Wiedel's prominence within the party. \"You will see that many more AfD voters in the LGBT community won't vote for the party in the future. There is just too much turmoil going on,\" Welsch says, adding that his former party \"has become a farce.\"An untapped source of votes?Alexander Tassis says LGBT and other groups have concerns that the AfD understands, and that other parties don't. Welsch points out that he was once one of the 130 or so openly gay AfD members. That number now stands at 20, says Alex Tassis, the man who is now responsible for the AfD's gay outreach.Tassis heads up Alternative Homosexuals, the AfD group that reaches out to the LGBT community. A gay immigrant from Greece, Tassis says he strongly believes that \"Islamization\" is a threat to Germany and Europe and that the AfD will soon become the most popular party among gay men. There's no contradiction in the party's stance against gay marriage, he says. And it's clear he views the LGBT community as an overlooked source of votes this election. \"Gays, lesbians and also older migrant groups in Germany -- like myself who came to Germany a long time ago -- are just as important to Germany as any other human being who lives here,\" he says. \"The LGBT and older migrant groups have concerns that other parties simply don't understand and don't get. I represent those groups and want to give those groups a voice. That's what I am here for. \"\"I'm not against every Muslim,\" Karsten says, \"but I'm against the criminals.\"Tassis was the one who answered Karsten's email for help after he and his partner were attacked. Within three hours of reading it, Tassis met the couple in a downtown Bremen cafe and connected them with a lawyer, encouraging them to sue the local prosecutor, something the pair are looking into. \"Cases like Karsten's or similar cases have unfortunately happened in Bremen amongst citizens before,\" Tassis says. \"This case was particularly dramatic. Every citizen has a right to be heard, every citizen needs an ear and this is what I did In Karsten's case.\"That swift response turned Karsten from someone who used to vote for the left-wing Green Party into an AfD supporter. \"It has nothing to do with being a Nazi or being totally right. I'm not against every foreigner. And I'm not against every Muslim. But I'm against the criminals,\" Karsten explains. \"This was the only way we could get some help. Because the other parties didn't care.\"",

This will be a very sad and tragic moment in our history. We will always regret this -- and I think that you will regret it as well soon, if I might say,\" Juncker told members of the European Parliament, including Brexit architect Nigel Farage. \"Nonetheless, we have to respect the will of the British people. But we are going to make progress. We will keep moving. We will move on. Because Brexit isn't everything. It's not the future of Europe. It's not the be all and end all.\"UK lawmakers approve EU withdrawal bill Juncker's speech, in Strasbourg, France, comes as British and EU leaders ready for a fourth round of Brexit talks this month, and a day after the UK published a paper offering to contribute military assets to the EU. Defense is the UK's most valuable card in Brexit negotiations and London hopes its contribution in the area will yield favorable trade terms from the EU in return. Read MoreJuncker called on EU leaders to set out a clear vision for the EU's future ahead of May 2019 European Parliament elections, held just over a month after the UK is scheduled to officially leave the union. \"The 30th of March 2019, on that date it will be a union of 27. And I suggest we prepare very well for that date,\" he said, calling for a summit in Romania that day. A reformed EUJuncker gave an insight into his vision for the EU's future and how he hopes to keep the other 27 member states together after a tumultuous period. Britain voted to leave the union in June 2016. Around the same time, several members of the EU expressed growing discontent over how to handle the migrant crisis, while euroskeptic right-wing parties in several member states gained support.\"When I stood before you this time last year, I had a somewhat easier speech to give. It was plain for all to see that our union was not in a good state. Europe was battered and bruised by something that shocked our very foundation,\" Juncker said in his opening remarks. Angela Merkel's legacy hinges on mending Europe\"We only had two choices -- either come together around a positive European agenda or each retreat in our own corners. Faced with this choice, I argued for unity.\"Juncker wants to boost trade deals and finalize pending ones by the end of 2019, saying that countries around the world were \"knocking at our door\" for new agreements. He also called for trade pacts with Australia and New Zealand. After fierce criticism from Britain over inefficiency in the EU, Juncker proposed that his role as president of the European Commission be merged with that of the European Council.He repeated a call to create a post for a eurozone finance minister, but added that the post could be filled by an existing commissioner.And in apparent response to criticism that the bloc focuses on the most menial of issues, Juncker presented a commission with a whittled-down agenda, saying it proposed just 25 initiatives this year, down from 100 two years ago.CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.",

Cuban farming hitIrma was a Category Five hurricane when it crashed through the Caribbean, killing at least 26 people. Small islands like St. Martin/St. Maarten, and the twin-island state of Barbuda and Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands have all suffered extensive damage. The storm also grazed Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti before pummeling parts of Cuba. Looting broke out on St. Martin, but France's interior minister said Sunday that police on the ground had restored order. Collomb added that France has worked for the past 48 hours on water delivery to affected neighborhoods and food supplies are being provided. There are currently 1,500 French helpers in the islands. Meanwhile, the cleanup began on Cuba, the largest island in the Caribbean, whose northern territories took a substantial hit, with reports of major flooding in the capital Havana. A sailing boat is beached in the cemetery of Marigot on St. Martin  on Saturday.Most people in Cuba's coastal area live in one-story homes, putting them at great risk as floodwaters rose to roof level in some places. Many residents had left town before the storm hit and all foreigners were urged to evacuate. Those who remained told CNN they were prepared, though they knew this was a storm like few had ever experienced.Elsewhere in the country, Irma struck the archipelago north of Cuba's Camaguey and Ciego de Avila provinces with gusts so strong they destroyed an instrument used to measure wind, Cuba's meteorological agency reported.Damage will be felt most in Cuba's considerable agricultural sector, the state newspaper Granma reported Monday. It said all of Cuba's provinces had reported serious damage to farming infrastructure except for Guantanamo, Santiago and Granma in the southeast of the island where the damage was \"only moderate.\"Correction: This story has been corrected to reflect that Barbuda is part of Antigua and Barbuda, which is an independent state.",

The greats of the game -- Pele, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane, and Lionel Messi to name but four -- have worn the iconic number and have literally carried their nations on their backs in the process. The fresh-faced, 18-year-old Christian Pulisic, who will still be a teenager by the time of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, is starting to get used to the weight of that responsibility.Hey #USMNT, @AlexiLalas has a message for you.via @FOXSoccer pic.twitter.com/azSIxtHo6v\u2014 FOX Sports (@FOXSports) September 11, 2017\nHe has not only become an integral part of his club side Borussia Dortmund's midfield -- where he wears the number 22, as German World Cup-winning goalscorer Mario Gotze has a lock on the 10 shirt  -- but has also been essentially entrusted with the keys to driving the US men's team (USMNT) to Russia.It's been a bumpy ride to say the least, but the side still has their fate in their own hands with two qualifying games to go in the CONCACAF group.Those bumps prompted the former US international Alexi Lalas to label the current crop of USMNT players \"underperforming, tattooed millionaires.\"Read MoreTim Howard, Geoff Cameron, Clint Dempsey, Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore were singled out for particular criticism by Lalas, before the former US international turned his attention to Pulisic.\"And, oh, by the way, to all the guys that I didn't mention, it's because you don't even warrant a mention,\" Lalas told Fox Sports on Sunday. \"That includes you too, Wonder Boy.\"Christian Pulisic fires in a shot in the World Cup qualifier against Costa Rica.'Truly special'However, USMNT coach Bruce Arena is in no doubt as to what he has at his disposal, which is understandable, considering Pulisic has scored seven goals for the national team in the past year alone.\"I was very fortunate in 2002 to have two young stars on our World Cup team in Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, and Christian's ahead of them at this point,\" Arena told CNN in New York, ahead of the home defeat to Costa Rica. \"He'll be 19 if we qualify for a World Cup, and he's an outstanding player playing in one of the great club teams in Germany, and in the world. His future's incredible and I think Christian's a player that will be around in 2026 as well.\"As well as being the youngest player to represent the US and score for his country in a World Cup qualifier, Pulisic is also the youngest foreigner to find the back of the net in the Bundesliga.For good measure, he's Dortmund's youngest-ever goal scorer in the Champions League, and he'll need to be at his best in a group against the holders Real Madrid, as well as Tottenham, who the Bundesliga club face on Wednesday.Dortmund has a good track record in developing young talent, which will likely continue under the tutelage of new coach Peter Bosz, who most recently worked wonders with Ajax Amsterdam.READ: Player tech analysis catapults club into futureREAD: Has 14-second delay scuppered $29M dealREAD: Europe feels forces of PSG and Qatar's 'soft power'Unsurprisingly, the player himself has relished playing in Europe's most prestigious club tournament, telling CNN World Sport's Patrick Snell earlier this year that his deftly-taken debut goal in the Champions League against Benfica, \"was truly special ... it's such a big moment to do it in that style,\" going on to say: \"it's up there with the debut, the first goal, it could be on top.\"While Pulisic himself has been entirely humble about his remarkable rise -- \"It's been amazing. Everything has happened so fast. Of course I'm still so young, but I wouldn't change a thing. It really is a dream come true to me\" -- his USMNT colleagues are far more effusive in their praise.Didn't take long for @cpulisic_10 to announce his return from summer break.Full #MNTRewind: https://t.co/LQVpcDZzeV pic.twitter.com/NOeLfewV5v\u2014 U.S. Soccer (@ussoccer) August 7, 2017\n\"Christian's attributes are countless, I think he has all the physical tools to be a superstar,\" affirms goalkeeper Howard.\"He can go wherever he wants to go,\" adds Pulisic's midfield teammate Dempsey, who knows a thing or two about lofty expectations.\"I think he's just so smooth on the ball. He has such a change of pace, causes mismatches because he's able to glide past the first defender; someone has to step to him and other players are open. Dempsey added: \"Great vision, he can thread the pass so he showed that he's getting clinical in front of goal and has a very, very bright future, I can't wait to see all the stuff he's able to accomplish.\"No wonder that former USMNT goalkeeper Kasey Keller believes Pulisic could become the first US player to command a transfer fee of $100 million, \"by a Barcelona, a Real Madrid, a Manchester United, a Chelsea, a Bayern Munich.\" Arena concurs, telling CNN that \"he may end up at one of the elite clubs in the world.\" And when it is put to Dempsey that perhaps Barcelona opted for the wrong Dortmund player in Ousmane Dembele, rather than Pulisic, to replace Neymar, he responds that, \"I think he can play for any club. He has to follow what's best for him. Everyone has their own path. \"He's playing Champions League now and doing great there so we'll have to wait and see what the future holds.\"Borussia Dortmund top the Bundesliga table after three games. Pulisic has scored one goal in the league this season.Pulisic's bright future is arguably a product of his past. Both his parents played at university, and father Mark played professional indoor football and coached too. Pulisic's Dad didn't just hone his son's promising skills in his birthplace of Hershey, Pennsylvania. At the age of seven, Pulisic spent the year in England, and in 2005 played for the youth team of Brackley Town in Northamptonshire, 70 miles north of London.While his stint overseas was brief, Pulisic has said England is where his love for the game started to come alive.Howard is of the opinion that Pulisic's upbringing and the journey that's taken him to Germany have played their parts in the boy wonder quickly turning into a man.\"From everything I know, he comes from a very good family,\" Howard explains to CNN. \"He has learned his football at a traditionally powerful club, a world-renowned club, and the mental side and the longevity side is up to him. The sky's the limit for him; the rest of it is in his hands.\"Pulisic celebrates with the German Cup trophy after Dortmund's win against Eintracht Frankfurt in the 2017 final.Paradoxically, Pulisic has been witnessing firsthand that age-old sign of respect from his international rivals, who have at times kicked out at him in frustration, while referees have arguably not given the young playmaker the protection he needs. The same scenario was experienced by a certain Pele at the World Cup in 1966, while Maradona and Messi have had to deal with their shins being targeted by defenders. It's part and parcel of the blessing and curse that comes with wearing that number 10 shirt.In fact, in his country's crucial 1-1 draw away to Honduras in early September, Pulisic had spent 85 minutes trying to unlock the opposition's defense with a key contribution but to no avail.The same scenario had played out in the previous match at home to Costa Rica, which ended in a damaging defeat.But four days on in Honduras, Pulisic didn't allow his head to drop, and a late burst resulted in a free-kick being awarded in a dangerous position.From the resulting set-piece, the USMNT scored to claim a precious point. Even when not directly involved, Pulisic's contribution had yet again proven pivotal.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Emmanuel Macron came to power on a promise of reform and after winning convincingly last May, claimed to have the mandate he needed to carry out the type of change that every French president since Francois Mitterrand has tried and failed to see through.But even before his first attempt at reform -- an overhaul of France's famously rigid labor laws -- Macron has seen his support in the polls drop. That, say some union leaders, will make it impossible for him to transform France as he promised he would.As Fabrice Angei of the CGT union told CNN: \"In this country the workforce knows it has the power simply to stop working\" and to grind the entire economy to a halt. And, he added, this time the whole world is watching to see which way, in the land of \"freedom and of the declaration of human rights,\" the class struggle will go on. Union opposition helped defeat former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's attempt to change labor law last year.So far, it has looked as though Macron was winning. Two of France's biggest unions -- Force Ouvriere and the CFDT -- have announced that they will not be taking part in a strike planned for Tuesday, preferring instead to continue negotiating with the government.Read MoreThat's partly down to one of the big sweeteners offered as part of the reforms -- a 25% increase in severance packages -- but also, some warn, a desire on the part of the unions to keep their powder dry ahead of future reforms to such areas as employment insurance and professional training, changes that could threaten the funding and therefore the very future of the unions.For now the government looks as though it may not encounter the sort of opposition that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande faced in the spring of 2016 when it tried to overhaul the labor laws, this despite the fact that Macron is seeking to go even further than Hollande had -- both in the way the reforms are to be carried out and in their substance. Macron's plans were laid out on August 31 in a series of five executive orders all aimed at \"making up for the lost years, the years of missed rendezvous,\" according to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.The goal is to give companies more flexibility in hiring and firing workers, more power to negotiate working conditions directly with employees and less financial risk in cases of wrongful dismissals. The measures would also make it easier for foreign companies to close sites in France and give new flexibility to companies with fewer than 50 employees, which make up 95% of French business.It is no surprise that French business leaders and economists have welcomed the reform plans. More surprising perhaps is that for now the planned strike will not see the sort of unified union opposition that has been seen in the past.But the CGT, which is leading the charge against the proposals, says that although some unions have chosen not to take part in the strike, there is more opposition to the reforms than the government realizes.The CGT's Angei believes the numbers on the streets on Tuesday will be high enough to show that Macron will not get his reforms through easily. From a legislative point of view, the French president may have taken the precaution of reforming by decree, but Angei warns that the workforce itself will block the process even if Parliament can't. After all, he says, \"polls show show the anger that has led to Macron's drop in popularity and that anger can also lead to revolt.\"",

How idyllic does that sound?It conjures up images of the wind in your hair, aquamarine seas, dolphins at the bow, and watching the sunset in a different piece of paradise every night.I am guilty of posting photographic proof of these very scenes. But don't be fooled as we were. These images are captured in a split second. The rest of the time, the picture isn't always so pretty.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThree months into our sailing adventure, we've learned that smooth sailing is an oxymoron. So is \"pleasure cruiser\" which is what our yacht is termed in the boating world.The reality of sailing hit us just a few hours into our maiden voyage when a huge abandoned rope wrapped itself around our propeller, bringing us to a dead halt in the middle of the English Channel.Read MoreThere was no wind so we couldn't sail back to the UK. We were essentially a floating bath tub. Cue the coastguard.Our boat \"Boomerang\" had immediately lived up to her name.

Way of lifeIn hindsight, that might have been fortuitous given the number of times we've had to abandon a trip to a picturesque cove and return to shore to fix something. We've run over at least three ropes (that we know of) in the vast ocean, had the boat hauled out twice to fix the sail drive, motored most of the distance we've traveled due to a lack of wind and almost every time we use something for the first time it doesn't work.At first we thought we were just unlucky, but it turns out this is what owning a boat is all about. Sailing is not a holiday, it's a way of life where you are constantly fixing your boat in exotic locations.Unlike ourselves, most boat owners we've met so far on our journey have years of sailing and some form of engineering experience under their belt.We had our Competent Crew and Day Skipper qualifications and may have checked the oil in our car engine once or twice.We literally jumped in at the deep end, and for this hubris, are now paying our dues to Neptune in spades.It feels like we're undergoing a good old-fashioned rite of passage and the first lesson is to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

        "content": "(CNN)When German voters head to the polls on September 24, they'll have to choose from a record 42 parties, but there are just two realistic candidates for Chancellor -- incumbent Angela Merkel, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), and her Social Democratic Party (SPD) rival, Martin Schulz.Immigration is still a top concern for many German voters after more than a million asylum seekers entered the country over the past two years, but other issues such as income inequality, climate change and an aging population are equally divisive.Here's how Germany stacks up against its European neighbors on these issues, and what Merkel and Schulz plan to do about them.ECONOMYAt 4%, Germany has a very low rate of unemployment. And it's been falling fairly consistently -- from a high of 11.5% -- since 2005.      Read MoreBut although the number of full-time jobs has risen, there's been a bigger increase in the number of part-time and low-paid jobs.  According to the Federal Employment Office, 4.7 million Germans rely solely on  so-called \"mini-jobs,\" which tend to be lower paying and insecure. Schulz has promised to crack down on precarious forms of employment, pledging to offer workers a way into more secure jobs. Merkel has herself hired several employees from her own government office to work as \"mini-jobbers\" on her election campaign -- for which she has been widely criticized -- but wants to see workers in these jobs benefit from the same wage increases as regular employees.When asked about the hirings at a news conference, she said she saw no problem with employing people on these contracts.     Although Germans earn more on average than British, French, Spanish and Italian workers, incomes have stagnated over the past decade and are now slightly lower than in 2008.Between 2008 and 2015, the number of people at risk of poverty rose nearly 10%, leaving one in six Germans at risk.Tackling in-work poverty is a key part of Schulz's campaign.\"Whoever believes that good work deserves fair pay must vote SPD,\" he said at a recent rally.The CDU manifesto says that \"everyone should be able to afford to live from what they earn,\" but Merkel herself has said little on the issue, choosing to focus primarily on the country's low unemployment rate.     Figures show that incomes are a little more equal in Germany than in many of its European neighbors. But income inequality has hardly budged over the last decade.It's a key concern for German voters and a central topic in the election campaign, particularly among Germany's left-wing parties. \"Zeit f\u00fcr mehr Gerechtigkeit\" (\"time for more fairness/justice\") is Schulz's primary campaign slogan and a staple in his speeches.Asked about social inequality in a live YouTube interview in August, Merkel spoke about employment figures and her government's success in raising the minimum wage. RELATED: Germany's economic strength masks rising inequalityREFUGEESAlthough Germany tops the list for asylum applications this year, the number is a lot lower than in 2015-2016, when the country received more than 1.2 million applications.                              The presence of so many asylum seekers has pushed the number of foreigners in Germany to a record 18.6 million. Around half of Germans say they are worried about the integration of refugees and about immigration more broadly. Merkel has defended her 2015 \"open door\" policy while insisting that the events of that year must not be repeated. \"We want the number of refugees arriving in Germany to be permanently low,\" her party's manifesto reads.Schulz is calling for all European countries to take their fair share of refugees. \"We stand for a humanitarian refugee policy,\" the manifesto says.RELATED: Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugeesSECURITYGermany climbed eight places on the Global Terrorism Index to 41 after six people were killed by terror attacks in 2015 -- the country's first terror-related deaths since 2007. Further attacks in 2016 killed 22 people and injured many more.     The attacks led to calls for stricter immigration controls and increased support for the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany.The same year saw more than 3,500 attacks on refugees and refugee hostels, leaving 560 people injured including 43 children, according to a government document.  Both Merkel and Schulz have pledged to put 15,000 more police officers on Germany's streets and to continue investing in anti-terrorism measures. The SPD has also promised to tackle the growing problem of right-wing extremism.ENVIRONMENTGermany emits more CO2 per capita than many of its neighbors, including Austria, Denmark, Italy and Spain.      It's an issue that concerns the majority of voters. A recent survey showed that more Germans are worried about climate change than about war or terror attacks. Germany also looks likely to miss its 2020 target for reducing emission levels, which have barely changed since 2009.      A bigger proportion of Germany's energy comes from renewable sources than in the Netherlands or Poland -- but countries such as Norway and Iceland are far ahead.Most voters want Germany to do better. In a recent survey, 95% of those asked said that the growth of renewable energy was important or very important.Both the conservatives and the Social Democrats are promising to expand the production of renewables in Germany -- but they're not setting any targets.RELATED: Why Germany has a dirty climate secretAGING POPULATIONThere are now more retirees than ever before, while the proportion of working-age Germans to support them has been falling for the past three decades.      Pensioner poverty has emerged as an important election issue. More than 17% of Germans aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty, compared to 15.5% in 2008.Schulz wants to stabilize pension levels using public money, and has pledged not to raise the retirement age higher than 67 before 2030.Merkel's party manifesto offers no new plans to tackle the challenge, describing the policies of the past 12 years as \"successful\" and promising more of the same.MILITARYGermany spends a smaller proportion of its GDP than the UK and Italy on its military -- and less than even Norway and Finland, countries that very rarely mobilize their troops.     Earlier this year, Merkel came under fire from US President Donald Trump for spending less than 2% on defense -- the requirement for NATO countries. She has promised to meet that target by 2024. Germany also plans to increase its troop levels by 20,000 over the next seven years to nearly 200,000, as reported by German media. Schulz calls for the removal of US nuclear weapons from German soil and rejects any \"spiral of rearmament.\"",

Almost 1,000 mostly first-time independent or opposition candidates are now in the running to fill 1,502 municipal posts.They get support on fundraising, legal issues and leaflet design as well as regular training sessions, including how to canvass voters door-to-door, a relative novelty in Russia.Shkliarov is passionate when he talks about what he calls Russia's much-needed political facelift.\"Russians understand more and more that the way out of this misery is not just blaming the government, not just replacing [President Vladimir] Putin.

We're trying to adapt,\" he says. 'Sexy and cool' politicsHis own path to politics started with Barack Obama's 2008 trip to Germany, where Shkliarov was pursuing a PhD in political science.He was blown away by how \"sexy and cool'' the presidential hopeful from Chicago made politics seem.Why young people are flocking to Russian protestsShkliarov, who had by then cut his teeth on various election campaigns in Germany, including volunteering for Chancellor Angela Merkel, moved to the United States with his American fiancee in 2010 dreaming of working on Obama's re-election run.The dream came true after he took his wife's advice and offered to work for free.He progressed from making cold calls to running a team of 40 people within a couple of weeks, he says, in part because his broken English was an ice-breaker.''My weakness became my biggest strength,\" he says.It confirmed his belief that \"in America you get a fair shot, no matter where you're from.\"Stacking up successes as he moved locations -- and got on the payroll - he found himself a short while later pushed into giving a pep talk to hundreds of fatigued volunteers in Milwaukee.Lost for words at first, he started telling them his story.\"I told the truth. I said I was so inspired by your president because in the country I'm from we didn't have democracy.

Nadal further solidified his standing as the world's No. 1 male player and trails only Roger Federer, who has 19 major titles, on the all-time men's grand slam singles list.Nadal's 23 career appearances in slam finals also are second to Federer, who has 29.\"It's just unbelievable what happened this year, no?\" Nadal said on the court after the win.Read MoreHoisting a Grand Slam trophy for the 16th time...\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6@RafaelNadal #USOpen pic.twitter.com/UAvcsP7MAG\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 10, 2017\nThis win also signals the end of an era, as it's Nadal's final major with his uncle, Toni, as his coach. Toni Nadal is stepping aside to focus on his work at Nadal's tennis academy in Mallorca, Spain. Carlos Moya, a former world No. 1, joined Nadal's coaching team in December.\"I can't thank him enough for all the things that he did for me,\" Nadal said. \"Probably, without him, I will never be playing tennis. It's great that I had somebody like him just pushing me all the time. I think because he was strong and he had that great motivation to practice with me since I was a kid, I was able to get through all these problems that I had during my career in terms of injuries.\"\"That makes me stronger,\" he continued. \"I just say thank you very much to him because he's for sure one of the most important persons in my life.\"Nadal also said a few words about the recent earthquake that hit Mexico and those impacted by Hurricane Irma.\"I'm just sorry for all the victims, and just keep going for everybody,\" he said. \"It's very sad moments for our world, but at the moment to be strong and to fight to be back. That's impossible to control this natural disasters, so just all the best for all the victims and to all the people that are suffering.\"At age 31, Anderson was the oldest first-time grand slam tournament finalist since Nikola Pilic (33) at the 1973 French Open and the lowest-ranked US Open finalist since the inception of the ATP rankings in 1973.His reward after his long wait: Facing one of the best players of all time in the 31-year-old Nadal, whom he's never beaten. He falls to 0-5 against the Spaniard.Nadal dominated the match overall. He never faced a break point and finished with 11 unforced errors to Anderson's 40.

It's tough playing you. You proved it again tonight. You're one of the great ambassadors of our sport.\"Nadal now has won at least two grand slam tournament titles in a season for the fourth time in his career. This year, he lost the Australian Open to Federer before defeating Stan Wawrinka on clay for a 10th French Open title, making him the only man or woman in the Open Era to win a single grand slam event 10 times. Nadal won three majors in 2010 and two apiece in 2008 and 2013. He last made it to three major finals in one year in 2011.With Federer, who also won Wimbledon, and Nadal each winning two majors this year, both further distance themselves from the rest of the men on the all-time grand slam titles list: Pete Sampras is third with 14, while Novak Djokovic is the next active player on the list with 12, tied with Roy Emerson.After a few injury-plagued years Nadal returned to No. 1 in the ATP rankings on August 21, his fourth career stint at the top.This year's US Open, the last major on the tennis calendar, was missing several big names because of injuries: Djokovic (elbow), Andy Murray (hip), Wawrinka (knee), Milos Raonic (wrist) and Kei Nishikori (wrist). A rash of upsets further opened up the draw.In the top half, where Nadal was situated, he dodged playing No. 3 Federer, who lost to No. 24 seed Juan Martin del Potro in the quarterfinals. Nadal didn't face an opponent in the top 20 in his run to the title.At age 31, Kevin Anderson was the oldest first-time grand slam tournament finalist since Nikola Pilic (33) at the 1973 French Open.The bottom half of the draw created an opportunity early for the likes of Anderson, ranked No. 32, to reach a grand slam final for the first time. No. 8 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Alexander Zverev, seeded fourth, got bounced in the second round. No. 5 seed Marin Cilic was gone after the third. Anderson defeated No. 17 seed Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals and No. 12 seed Pablo Carreno Busta in the semifinals.Earlier this year, Anderson missed the Australian Open because of a hip injury and was forced to retire during his fourth-round match at Roland Garros because of a left thigh injury.\"It's been an amazing two weeks for me, \"Anderson said. \"Last year was difficult for me. It's tough when you're injured as a tennis player. The competition is so strong. To come back and make my first finals of a grand slam has been a special two weeks.\"Anderson is the first South African man to reach the US Open final in the Open Era; Cliff Drysdale was runner-up at the US Championships in 1965. He is the first South African in a grand slam singles final since Kevin Curren at the 1984 Australian Open.The last South African to win a major remains Johan Kriek, who won the 1981 Australian Open. Kriek represented the US when he won the 1982 Australian Open.This was the seventh time in the Open Era that a grand slam final featured a pair of players aged 30 and over. It's the fifth straight grand slam in which the winner is over 30 years old, as Wawrinka won the US Open in 2016.By Jill Martin, CNN",

This will be his third major final this year. He lost the Australian Open to Federer and defeated Stan Wawrinka for a 10th French Open title, making him the only man or woman in the Open Era to win a single grand slam event 10 times. Nadal last made it to three major finals in one year in 2011.Read MoreFollowing Friday's win, ESPN asked Nadal on court whether he thought a year ago -- when he lost in the round of 16 in New York -- that he would reach three major finals in 2017 with the chance to win two titles.\"I would say, 'Thanks, but it's almost impossible,' Nadal replied. \"But here we are.\"Nadal entered Friday with an 8-5 head-to-head record against del Potro, but the 28-year-old Argentine had the edge on the hard court, including the last two meetings: 2013 in Shanghai and in the semifinal in the 2016 Rio Olympics. At the 2009 US Open, del Potro defeated Nadal in straight sets in the semifinal and went on to beat Federer in five sets in the final for his only grand slam title.That moment eight years ago has been the biggest grand slam highlight for del Potro, who has undergone four wrist surgeries in his career.Friday's win levels Nadal with del Potro at 5-5 on that surface, and he was in fine form at Ashe.Juan Martin del Potro's lone major title was in the US Open in 2009.Del Potro broke in game five and held on to win the first set. But in the second set, Nadal went on the offensive, utilizing the inside-out forehand to put a bagel on the Argentine to level the match and to win the next nine consecutive games. Del Potro, who was sick in this tournament, couldn't slow Nadal down after that. Tiger Woods, himself a 14-time major golf champion, cheered the Spaniard on from Nadal's box in the stands.\"I was not playing bad the first set, but I was playing too much against his backhand,\" Nadal said. \"I feel he was waiting for me there and then he had the opportunity to cover his backhand with his forehand because I was hitting too many balls against his backhand.\"Then at the beginning of the second (set), I knew that something had to change. The only way to change is to try to move him more to leave the ball a little bit more unpredictable. Because being the way that I was playing the first set without playing bad, I was losing, so something had to change.\"He may not be ranked near the top or have as many titles, but there is no doubt that del Potro is a top-level player. He came into Friday night with eight career wins over a world No. 1, the most among players who have never ranked as world No. 1 since July 1984, when records first were kept. This was his first major semifinal since 2013 at Wimbledon.Nadal has two US Open titles, winning in 2010 and 2013.Anderson celebrates like a championIt's been a long wait for the 31-year-old Anderson to reach a grand slam final -- and for his home country.Anderson is the first South African to reach a US Open final since Cliff Drysdale in 1965 and any grand slam final since Kevin Curren at the 1984 Australian Open.Kevin Anderson celebrates after defeating Pablo Carreno Busta to reach his first major final.The last South African to win a major is Johan Kriek, who won the 1981 Australian Open. Kriek represented the US when he won the 1982 Australian Open.Carreno Busta, 26, started the afternoon attempting to become the first US Open champion since Neale Fraser in 1960 to win the title without dropping a set. In his road to the semifinals, he had gone 15-0 in addition to winning the first set against Anderson. All of his opponents were ranked outside of the top 30.But he couldn't get by Anderson, who stands at 6 feet, 8 inches. The South African won 83 percent of his first serve points and had 22 aces Friday.Both Anderson and Carreno Busta were first-time major semifinalists. Anderson is the lowest-ranked US Open finalist since the inception of the ATP rankings in 1973.\"This is why we work so hard,\" Anderson said. \"It was an unbelievably tough match for me. I was pretty nervous starting out. I'm sure Pablo the same. It was the first time for both of us on one of the most famous stages in tennis, on the biggest court. Just what a fantastic crowd. I really had to dig deep there. I think just my emotion at the end sort of summed it up. I'm over the moon right now. I know I've given myself one more shot, but I'm really going to allow myself tonight just to really celebrate tonight's win.\"Anderson celebrated the win by climbing into the first row of seats to his support group, which includes his wife, Kelsey.Anderson is 0-4 in his career against Nadal and 0-6 against del Potro. But none of that seemed to matter on Friday. Anderson celebrated his win as if he had won the championship, climbing into the first row of seats to his support group.\"I really don't know what to say right now,\" a beaming Anderson said. \"I don't know if the team hug is appropriate for (reaching) the finals, but it felt like the right thing to do.\"While his wife Kelsey and brother Gregory were in attendance, his parents weren't watching live. They get too nervous, Anderson explained, and wait to watch a replay.\"I think they'll be pretty excited,\" he said.",

This also was the first all-American US Open final since 2002, when Serena Williams defeated Venus Williams.

The others were unranked Kim Clijsters in 2009 and No. 26 Flavia Pennetta in 2015.When it was over, the two Americans shared a long embrace on the court. After Stephens celebrated with her support group, including her mother, Sybil Smith, she returned to the court and sat next to Keys,  whom Stephens calls her best friend on the WTA tour.Read More\"Honestly I wouldn't have wanted to play anyone else,\" Stephens said. \"For us both to be here is such a special moment. I told her I wish there could be a draw, because I wish we could have both won. I think that if it was the other way around she would do the same for me. I'm going to support her no matter what, and I know she's going to support me no matter what. To stand with her today is incredible. That's what real friendship is.\"Stephens with Madison Keys after the match.None of this looked possible earlier this summer.Stephens, who had been sidelined for 11 months after a foot injury and underwent surgery in January, made her comeback at Wimbledon and entered this summer's US Open Series ranked 957th. But she's been on a tear in the North American events, reaching the semifinals in Toronto and Cincinnati.\"I had surgery January 23,\" Stephens said. \"If someone told me then that I'd win the US Open, 'It's impossible,' I would say. 'It's absolutely impossible.' My journey to get here, coming back, just being able to keep it all together and have such a great team behind me -- this journey's been incredible. And I honestly wouldn't change it for the world.\"With the win, Stephens is projected to rise to No. 17. She also nets a hefty payday: $3.7 million. Her career earnings heading into this tournament were $4,519,709, with $310,546 coming this year.\"That's a lot of money,\" a visibly surprised Stephens said, as Keys jokingly tried to take the check.Keys, 22, is projected to move up to No. 12 by reaching the final.\"Sloane is truly one of my favorite people, and to get to play her was really special,\" Keys said. \"Obviously, I didn't play my best tennis today and was disappointed, but Sloane, being the great friend that she was, was very supportive. If there's someone I have to lose to today, I'm glad it's her.\"An improbable runStephens, who started playing tennis at age 9, comes from an athletic family. Her mother,  Smith, is a former collegiate swimmer at Boston University. Her late father, John Stephens, was an NFL running back in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Stephens made her breakthrough in 2013 when she defeated Serena Williams to reach the Australian Open semifinal. She would go on to lose to eventual champion Victoria Azarenka.Her first singles title was in 2015 in Washington. She added three more titles in 2016.The potential has been there for her to win a grand slam, but what she's done this summer, considering the circumstances with her previous injury, is shocking.Heading into Saturday's final, Stephens had won 14 of her last 16 matches, including defeating No. 9 Venus Williams in the semifinal. She's one of three players who have never held the No. 1 ranking who have beaten both Williams sisters in grand slam events.\ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude0aCongratulations to @Madison_Keys and @SloaneStephens on a truly fabulous two weeks of tennis in Flushing Meadows.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/JUvfoJJrDa\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 9, 2017\nStephens now has more wins at the year's US Open matches (seven) than she had in her last six grand slam appearances combined (six).Stephens didn't play in the US Open last year because of the foot injury.\"I should just retire now,\" Stephens cracked. \"I told Maddie I'm never going to be able to top this. I mean, talk about a comeback.\"Unranked players aside, Stephens is the second-lowest ranked player to reach and win the title match at a grand slam, after No. 111 Chris O'Neil, who won the 1978 Australian Open. She's the lowest ranked player to reach and win the title match at the US Open.Stephens is the fourth unseeded player to reach the final in the US Open and 14th in grand slam finals in the Open Era.Excluding when unranked Clijsters won in 2009, the matchup between No. 16 Keys and No. 83 Stephens, with a combined ranking of 99, is the lowest title match at the US Open since computerized rankings began in November 1975. In addition to Stephens, Keys also was making a comeback from injury.For Keys, this year's US Open was just her 10th tournament of 2017. During the off-season, Keys underwent surgery on her left wrist and missed the first two months of the year. She also, according to the WTA's website, had a second surgery on the wrist ahead of Wimbledon, and she also withdrew from Rogers Cup in Toronto because of a left forearm injury.\"If you told me two months ago that I'd be holding a (runner-up) trophy for the US Open, I'd be really happy and proud of myself,\" Keys said.The No. 15 seed has never won the US Open. The last time a 15 seed won a major was Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon in 2013.Youth movementWith this result, four different players won this year's majors -- the first time that's happened since 2014. Serena Williams won the Australian Open, Jelena Ostapenko was the French Open champion, and Garbine Muguruza hoisted the Wimbledon trophy. It's the 12th time that has happened in the Open Era.There are also signs of a changing of the guard in women's tennis. Ostapenko, 20, became the first unseeded player and lowest ranked player to win Roland Garros in the Open Era. Muguruza, 23, became the only player to defeat both Williams sisters in a grand slam final when she defeated Venus Williams to win Wimbledon. When the rankings are released Monday, Muguruza will be in the top spot for the first time.Stephens joins Muguruza, Ostapenko and Petra Kvitova as players born in the 1990s to win a grand slam title.This year's US Open was the third final in the past five grand slam events not involving a player age 30 or older.",

Several minutes often differentiate the leading riders in cycling's three Grand Tours, which also include the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia. But the '84 Vuelta wasn't so straightforward.Follow @cnnsport\n\nAfter 19 stages, comprising of three time trials and 13 gut-busting mountain climbs, France's Eric Caritoux and home favorite Alberto Fernandez were practically inseparable. On the final day of racing, the stage was set for the closest ever finish in a major cycling race. An unlikely leader, Caritoux held a 36-second lead over the Spaniard ahead of the final time trial. The Frenchman rode first and waited on as Fernandez ate away at his advantage.In an era before sophisticated timing systems, a nail-biting delay ensued. Read MoreIt proved to be too little too late for Fernandez. Caritoux, phenomenal over the climbs throughout the race, held on to claim an historic victory -- the only Grand Tour win of his career. Eric Caritoux (front and center) won the only Grand Tour of his career at the 1984 Vuelta a Espana.\"I lost 30 seconds in the time trial but it took me a while to know that I had won,\" Caritoux said in an interview with the Vuelta website earlier this year. \"It was raining at the end of the stage and, had I known I had such little margin, I would have taken more risks and I could have fallen. \"Luck was on my side.\"READ: Why a race through Spain started in FranceAn unlikely victorIf the race was extraordinary, the circumstances around Caritoux's victory are equally remarkable. Just two years into his professional cycling career, Caritoux had no intentions of entering La Vuelta that year. After late pressure from organizers, however, his Skil team entered. Caritoux abandoned a break with his family in the south of France and had a matter of days to get race-ready.\"Four days before the start, while I was working in the vineyard, my grandmother told me that the sports manager, Christian Rumeau, was on the phone,\" the Frenchman recalls.READ: Miguel Indurain, the 'cyclist from another planet'\"I had to catch a train to join the team in Geneva, and then a plane to get to Malaga.\"Riding without support from team members in the mountains, Caritoux defied all expectations -- including his own. \"I participated in 12 Tours de France (my 12th was in 1989), but La Vuelta is the best memory of my career as I didn't win it with a surprise escape, but in the mountains. \"For me, finishing second in La Vuelta a Espana when I had just become a professional [would have been] a huge victory.\"An untimely tragedyFernandez's life took a tragic turn later that year. The Spaniard and and his wife were killed in a car accident that December. A month short of his 30th birthday, the 1984 La Vuelta proved to be the last major race of Fernandez's career and the closest he came to winning a Grand Tour. \"That deeply affected me,\" says Caritoux.

Life out the saddleFor Caritoux, the 1984 Vuelta was the only Grand Tour victory of his career, although he did win the French road race championships in 1988 and 1989.

It also will be Keys' first major final.\"It still doesn't feel real,\" the 22-year-old Keys said. \"I'm still shaking.\"Read MoreThis year marked the first time four American women reached the semifinals at the US Open since 1981, when Tracy Austin, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova and Barbara Potter did it. The last time it happened in a major was at Wimbledon in 1985 (Evert, Zina Garrison, Navratilova and Kathy Rinaldi).It's the first all-American US Open final since 2002, when Serena Williams defeated Venus Williams. Stephens and Keys have played each other just once, with Stephens winning that match.Stephens' long road backStephens, who was sidelined for 11 months following a foot injury and surgery, made her comeback at Wimbledon and entered this summer's US Open Series ranked 957th. But she's been on a tear in the North American events, reaching the semifinals in Toronto and Cincinnati. Heading into Thursday's semifinal, Stephens had won 13 of her last 15 matches. Stephens, 24, entered the US Open at No. 83 in the rankings. By reaching the final, she is projected to rise to No. 22. She's the fourth unseeded player to advance to a US Open final in the Open Era. Her previous best result in a major was reaching the Australian Open semifinal in 2013.After the handshake with Williams, Stephens applauded the seven-time major champion as she left the court.\"When I started my comeback, if someone told me I was going to make two semis and a grand slam final, I just would have probably just passed out because that's what I'm ready to do now,\" Stephens said. \"It's incredible. I don't know what to say. I don't know how I got here. Just hard work. That's it.\"Williams, a seven-time major champion, was seeking her first grand slam title since 2008, and she has been achingly close this year. She lost in the Australian Open final to her sister, Serena Williams, and the Wimbledon final to Garbine Muguruza.At 37, she was trying to become the oldest grand slam singles champion in the Open Era, taking the record from her sister.When Williams exited the court, Stephens stood up and applauded the champion, who won the US Open in 2000 and 2001.Juan Martin del Potro upends Roger Federer at US Open\"I'm honestly just honored to be able to play at the same time as her, one of the greatest to play our game,\" Stephens said, who is now 2-0 against Williams. While Stephens remained steady early, the unforced errors piled on for Williams, finishing the first set with 17. The set took just 24 minutes.\"I just wasn't playing well,\" Williams said. \"Those are moments where you have to dig deep and figure out how to get the ball on the court and have a big game. I can't be tentative and try to figure out how to put that ball in.\"I figured out a lot, but she played great defense. I haven't played her in a long time. Clearly she's seen me play many, many times. I haven't seen her play as much.\"But the script was flipped in the second. After saving three break points in the opening game, Williams' level of play went up dramatically, with 11 winners and Stephens regressing.It was a tighter third set, but the unforced errors kept rising for Williams as the two players traded breaks. At 5-5, Sloane hit the gas pedal, scrambling all over the court displaying terrific defense and breaking Williams at love.Williams finished with 51 unforced errors, to Stephens' 27.\"It required a lot of fight, a lot of grit,\" Stephens said of the final set. \"I knew if I just stayed with it and hung tough, played my game as best as I could and didn't get too down on myself, I would have a few opportunities. That's just what I did. ... I just worked my tail off and ran every ball down and tried to get a racquet on every ball.\"Keys dominatesFor Keys, this year's US Open was just her 10th tournament of 2017. During the off-season, Keys underwent surgery on her left wrist and missed the first two months of the year. She also, according to the WTA's website, had a second surgery on the wrist ahead of Wimbledon.Keys improves to 3-0 against the 25-year-old Vandeweghe, all of which happened this summer. Those first two wins -- at Cincinnati and in Stanford, California -- were close matches. This one was far from that, as Keys had 25 winners to Vandeweghe's 22 unforced errors. Madison Keys celebrates after defeating CoCo Vandeweghe in straight sets.\"I knew I had to rise to the occasion, and I'm just happy to be in the final,\" said Keys, whose previous best major result was reaching the semifinal at the 2015 Australian Open.While Keys dominated on Thursday, there could be a question about her health. At 4-1 in the second set, she took a medical timeout and left the court. She emerged with heavy wrapping on her right thigh.Keys said she wanted treatment because she had \"started to feel it\" and \"was afraid something more serious would happen\" if she didn't. However, when she was asked how sound she was heading into Saturday's final, she answered with a huge smile.\"I feel great right now,\" she replied. \"I don't think I could feel better than I do right now.\"",

Although Black had surgery in October 2015, her hip blew out again in July 2016. The pain has become so bad it hampers her sleep at night. To help pay for a much-needed yet costly operation, Black decided to start a crowdfunding campaign.\"I just have Medicaid, that's just state insurance,\" Black said by phone from Florida. \"They cover the basics which I'm lucky to have, but they don't cover for this operation, for what I need. So that's really tough on me.\" Read More\"I'm supporting my family right now, my younger sister and my mom, so I can't be spending all that money on insurance every month,\" she said.READ: Madison Keys, Sloane Stephens reach first US Open finalREAD: Juan Martin Del Potro Upends Roger Federer at the US OpenGoFundMeBlack's story was first reported by the New York Times on September 5. Although Black initially rejected the idea of raising funds online, she decided to start a GoFundMe page after an overwhelming response to the article. I have decided to create a Go-Fund-Me. Thank you for all the kind messages! https://t.co/MeX4QbGQ4u\u2014 Tornado Alicia Black (@Tornadoblack98) September 5, 2017\n\"I'm not the type of person that likes to ask people for money,\" Black said. \"But I was getting so much support from friends and from people I didnt even know, and everyone kept telling me, 'set up the GoFundMe'. I've been given so much support over the last couple of days. It has really been amazing.\" Black's GoFundMe page showed she has raised more than $13,000 in the first two days of the campaign. Her goal is to reach $40,000, which would cover the $16,000 operation by an expert in Philadelphia and also pay for rehabilitation without having to give tennis lessons. Follow @cnnsport\n\nPushed too hardRest and recovery is something Black has been lacking in her junior career, during which she said she sometimes spent up to 10 hours a day on the court and was pushed too hard while her body wasn't yet strong enough. \"It's a tough situation,\" she said. \"If I can go back in time and change it, I would take better care of my body and not play as much.\"Hailed as a future star of American tennis after she narrowly lost to Croatia's Ana Konjuh in the US Open junior finals four years ago, Black remains hopeful of a return to the top level. \"I would have to get my fitness back because I haven't really been able to do anything in the last few years,\" she said. \"I'm not afraid of my game, coming back, because I've been playing my whole life. I feel like if you're at a certain level, you don't really lose the tennis aspect of it.\"Serena, Venus provide hopeVenus Williams at this year's US Open. Black is also taking inspiration from Serena and Venus Williams, who were still contending for the biggest titles well into their mid-30s.This season, the now 37-year-old Venus Williams reached the finals of Wimbledon and the Australian Open and the US Open semifinals.Visit CNN.com/sport/tennis for more news and features \"I see Serena, I see Venus, I see so many of these players doing better and better well into their late 20s, early 30s,\" Black said. \"It gives me a lot of hope.\"",

(CNN)Seattle Seahawks star Michael Bennett couldn't contain his emotion as he recounted his treatment last month at the hands of Las Vegas police, abruptly ending a news conference after raising the specter of what a wrong move could have meant that night. \"I'm just lucky to be here to be able to speak about it. At any moment, I could've made the wrong decision whether to move, or (if police) felt like I was resisting or doing something wrong, and the Seahawks would be wearing the patch with No. 72 on it,\" he said, referencing a common way NFL teams memorialize players they've lost. \"I try to tell my daughters every single day that they matter,\" he continued late Wednesday, hanging his head for a few seconds before sighing and walking out of the news conference.The 31-year-old Super Bowl champion addressed the media hours after he tweeted an open letter in which he alleged that police unfairly detained him, roughed him up and threatened to shoot him after he ran from what he thought were gunshots following the August 26 fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Turns out, there was no shooting: Police said the sound was velvet rope stands falling over, CNN affiliate KCPQ reported. Read MoreStill, authorities responding to Bennett's open letter stood by their treatment of the defensive end and tackle. Based on what they knew at the time, officers believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and pursued him, Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said, adding that he saw \"no evidence that race played a role in this incident.\"What happened before Bennett was handcuffed remains unclear. The only video of the arrest released so far begins with Bennett facedown on the ground outside a casino, an officer cuffing his hands behind his back.\"I wasn't doing nothing, man,\" Bennett implores in the video. \"I was here with friends. They told us to get out. Everybody ran. Can you answer my question, sir?\"Brotherly loveMichael, left, and Martellus Bennett, seen in 2015, are among the most outspoken players in the NFL. In his letter, Bennett said his daughters, Peyton, Blake and Ollie, were on his mind as an officer allegedly put a gun near his head and threatened to shoot him if he moved. \"All I could think was, 'I'm going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin is somehow a threat.' My life flashed before my eyes as I thought of my girls. Would I ever play with them again? Or watch them have kids? Or be able to kiss my wife again and tell her I love her?\" he wrote. He wasn't the only one shaken at the notion of his demise. His younger brother, Martellus Bennett, a Green Bay Packers starter who played with Michael at Texas A&M, also got choked up discussing with reporters how things could've gone wrong. White House visit: Martellus Bennett to skip it Martellus Bennett said he had to walk out of a team meeting \"because I broke down crying just thinking about what could have happened,\" according to ESPN.Towering over the reporters gathered at his locker, the 6-foot-6, 275-pound tight end further said, \"I don't really have the answers. You just think, 'What if?' you know? Two seconds this way, two seconds that way, the whole thing is different.\" \"So, for me, I'll just be happy to see my brother,\" he continued, his voice quavering, \"because there's a chance that I couldn't see him.\"Police: Bennett ran, jumped wallVideo from the incident shows Bennett telling an officer, \"I wasn't doing nothing, man,\"Michael Bennett said he's trying to focus on the Seahawks season opener Sunday against his brother's Packers. He hates that he's instead talking about the encounter with police, he said, adding that he doesn't cast blanket blame on law enforcement authorities. \"It sucks that (in) the country that we live in now, sometimes you get profiled for the color of your skin, and it's a tough situation for me,\" Bennett said. \"Do I think every police officer is bad? No, I don't believe that. Do I believe there are some people out there that judge people by the color of their skin? I do believe that.\"The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed it detained Bennett for about 10 minutes that night before releasing him, said McMahill, the undersheriff.Police responded to a call of battery and assault with a gun that turned into an active-shooter situation, he said. Officers believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and gave chase, McMahill said.They first saw Bennett crouched behind a gaming machine, then watched him run out the doors of a casino, jump over a wall and run into traffic, McMahill alleged. \"Many folks today have called this an incident of racial-bias policing, that police officers focused solely on the race of the individual that they were going to stop. I can tell you as I stand here today, I see no evidence of that,\" he said. Detective Steve Grammas, president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, called on the NFL to investigate Bennett over his \"obvious false allegations against our officers,\" saying the player has yet to file an internal affairs complaint against the officers, who are both minorities. Read Grammas' letter\"I believe a fair and impartial investigation will show officers detained somebody that ran away from the scene and that was hiding and when they had reason to believe he wasn't involved he was let go. It's being blown up more than it should be, I believe,\" he wrote.

Bennett said he was leaving a party when he heard what he thought were gunshots and ran for cover. Police ordered him to the ground at gunpoint and as he lay there, complying with commands not to move, an officer placed a gun near Bennett's head and warned him that if he moved, he would \"blow my f*ing head off.\" A second officer \"forcefully jammed his knee into my back making it difficult for me to breathe,\" he wrote. \"They then cinched the handcuffs on my wrists so tight that my fingers went numb,\" the letter states.\"The officers' excessive use of force was unbearable,\" Bennett wrote. \"I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground handcuffed facing the real-life threat of being killed.\"Bennett is considering a federal civil rights lawsuit against the officers, attorney John Burris said, calling the incident \"Exhibit A as to how every black man rich, famous or poor, unarmed and innocent, can be falsely detained, arrested or even shot and killed by the police.\"Bennett signs $31.5 million deal with the SeahawksWrote Bennett in his open letter: \"Equality doesn't live in this country and no matter how much money you make, what job title you have, or how much you give, when you are seen as a 'Nigger,' you will be treated that way.\"Bennett gets supportJUST WATCHEDNFLer: I'll protest anthem until we're equalReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNFLer: I'll protest anthem until we're equal 01:52Despite fielding criticism since he joined ranks with free agent and former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in refusing to stand for the national anthem before NFL games, Bennett has witnessed an outpouring of support over his run-in with Las Vegas police.

I stand with Michael and I stand with the people.\" In an interview last month with CNN, Bennett said he won't stand for the national anthem until he sees \"equality and freedom.\"\"At this point, I think if you're being silent, you're being dishonest,\" Bennett told CNN. \"I can't hide behind the logo on my helmet. I can't hide behind the shield. I can't hide behind the glamor and glitz of the NFL.\"During his Wednesday news conference, Bennett invoked the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in explaining how his encounter with Las Vegas police is an apt example of why he won't stand during the anthem.\"We hope that you'll be judged on the content of your character, not the color of your skin, but sometimes you get judged on that, and that's the reality that I live in,\" the two-time Pro Bowler said. \"When people ask why I sit down, this is why.\"Grammas, the police union president, took issue with Bennett's stance on the anthem in his letter calling for an NFL investigation. \"While the NFL may condone Bennett's disrespect for our American Flag and everything it symbolizes, we hope the League will not ignore Bennett's false accusations against our police officers,\" he wrote.

        "content": "London (CNN)The summer is over and Britain's lawmakers are back in Westminster, with Brexit taking center stage.Over the next few months, Britain's departure from the European Union will start to gather pace as MPs vote on a host of bills and amendments.The debate on what's known as the European Union (Withdrawal) bill -- designed to transfer EU law into UK legislation upon the country's departure from the bloc in March 2019 -- began Thursday, ahead of a vote next week in the House of Commons.The next round of Brexit talks, party conferences and the upcoming German election could all have some effect on the process.All of this comes after a tumultuous few months for Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May, whose position remains the source of constant rumor and speculation.Read MoreMay defiantMay has been under increasing pressure since June's election, at which her Conservative Party lost its governing majority and was forced to make a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to remain in power.Last week May dismissed reports claiming she would quit in 2019 and insisted she was looking forward to the 2022 election.Pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May has been growing since the June election that cost her a majority in the House of Commons.But British newspapers have been full of stories claiming that some of her own members of Parliament want her to step down, while various names have been touted as replacements.Her latest challenge is steering the European Union (Withdrawal) bill through Parliament, with Labour set to oppose it and plenty of MPs aiming to make amendments when it's debated in the Commons for the first time. Second reading of the EU (Withdrawal) billIn addition to codifying existing EU laws, the bill also means that the UK will no longer have to adhere to new laws made in Brussels beyond March 2019.But the government intends to use controversial laws from the time of King Henry VIII to enact corrections to the statute book, prompting opponents to complain of a \"power grab.\"MPs from both sides of the house have questioned the use of the powers, which will allow the government to change large amounts of former EU law without the Commons' permission.The government says those powers will not be used for any significant changes but rather for technical amendments and for a limited time.JUST WATCHEDMay: Free movement to Britain will end in 2019ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMay: Free movement to Britain will end in 2019 01:41Labour says using those statutes will give the government \"sweeping powers to change laws by the back door.\"According to the government, the provision is necessary to make sure that it can transfer around 1,000 pieces of EU law over to British law before the departure date.Read: How Henry VIII will help Theresa May navigate EU divorceLabour has said it will vote against the bill, but whether any Tory rebels will join it remain to be seen.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has said that his party will not vote for the Bill because it will allow ministers to make sweeping changes to legislation without parliamentary scrutiny.Labour's Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has been outspoken in his criticism of the government.\"We are reaching the stage of negotiations where fantasy meets brutal reality,\" Starmer told the House of Commons Tuesday.  \"Too many promises have been made about Brexit which can't be kept.\"The party wants to introduce a number of amendments and has also changed its stance to support remaining in the single market and customs union during a four-year transition period.Read: Brexit presents unprecedented opportunities for Britain and the USLabour would also accept free movement of people during the transition phase as well as paying into the EU budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the four years.But while Labour, Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party are likely to band together to vote against the bill, May should have the numbers to pass it.The legislation will then pass onto the committee stage in the House of Commons in October where amendments are likely to be added under pressure from backbench Conservatives and opposition MPs.Brexit talks Victory in the Commons would be a welcome boost for May with Britain enduring a difficult start to negotiations with Brussels, highlighted by the frosty encounter last week between Brexit Secretary David Davis and his European counterpart Michel Barnier during their latest round of negotiations.JUST WATCHEDBrexit: UK and EU concerned over slow progressReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit: UK and EU concerned over slow progress 02:37On that occasion, Barnier complained of \"no decisive progress\" in the negotiations and accused Britain of attempting to secure the \"impossible\" in its approach to leaving the single market while retaining its benefits.Davis, meanwhile, has accused the EU of inflexibility, while International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said Britain would not be \"blackmailed\" to paying its way out of the bloc. The two sides have yet to come to an agreement over the Northern Irish border, the rights of EU citizens or Britain's financial obligations.\"Nobody has ever pretended this would be simple or easy,\" Davis told MPs Wednesday.\"We've always said this negotiation would be tough, complex and at times confrontational. So it has proved.\"JUST WATCHEDUK suggests temporary customs union with EUReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK suggests temporary customs union with EU 02:07A lack of consensus over key areas, such as an exit payment, means any attempts to move onto negotiating future trade are likely to be postponed.The British government was forced to deny reports it had agreed to pay a \u00a350 billion ($65 billion) \"Brexit bill\" to secure its departure, though Davis concedes that he expects the wrangle to go on for the \"full duration\" of the negotiations.The two sides are set to meet again in the week beginning September 18 and October 9, but both have indicated they're willing to step up the pace of the negotiations ahead of the EU summit in Brussels on October 19.For May, who will attend her party's annual conference in the first week of October, progress is crucial.She will address party members in a bid not just to ensure she remains as leader but to convince them she is one to lead the party forward.The next few months could be vitally important not just to Britain's post-EU future but to see if May is still in Downing Street to see Brexit carried out.",

        "content": "(CNN)A German hackers' collective has warned that software used to record and transmit voting tallies in many German states has \"serious flaws\" and is vulnerable to external attack just weeks before voters cast their ballots in federal elections.Hackers from the Chaos Computer Club published an analysis of the PC-Wahl software package Thursday in which they reported finding a \"host of problems and security holes\" that even a moderately skilled hacker -- let alone a state-sponsored team -- could exploit.\"The analysis showed a number of security problems and multiple practicable attack scenarios. Some of these scenarios allow for the changing of vote totals across electoral district and state boundaries,\" a CCC statement said.The software in question has been used in Germany's national, state and municipal elections for decades, it added.Why the German elections matter to the rest of the worldLinus Neumann, a CCC spokesman who was involved in the analysis, told CNN that \"elementary principles\" of IT security were ignored. \"The amount of vulnerabilities and their severity exceeded our worst expectations,\" he said.Read More\"A whole chain of serious flaws, from the update server, via the software itself through to the election results to be exported allows for us to demonstrate three practical attack scenarios in one.\"Germans head to the polls on September 24 to vote in a federal election. Chancellor Angela Merkel is running for her fourth term in office and polls show her Christian Democratic Union Party, or CDU, as the clear front-runner. Her chief rival is Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democratic Party, or SPD.The election is being closely watched after a series of upset results in votes last year.Vote-IT, which provides the PC-Wahl software, hasn't yet responded to CNN's request for comment, but the government cybersecurity agency said the company is implementing some recommendations on improving the package.Software 'possibly the worst'Germany, a European powerhouse and one of America's staunchest allies, does not use voting machines, meaning all votes are cast on paper. Can Martin Schulz succeed where Sanders and Corbyn failed?But PC-Wahl is one of a half-dozen software packages used countrywide to tally, aggregate and transmit the votes higher up the chain, another CCC spokesman, Frank Rieger, told CNN.\"From what we've seen, none of them is really great but the one that we analyzed is possibly the worst,\" he said of PC-Wahl. Hackers from CCC were able to take over a machine using the PC-Wahl software while vote tallying was taking place, he said.Adding to the problem, Rieger said, is that Germany's localized electoral system means that it's almost impossible to know what software is used across each polling station, municipality, precinct and state.Allegations of Russian interference in the US presidential election last year have stoked concerns in Germany over election security and voting technology, Rieger added.The CCC undertook its analysis -- carried out by a group of three hackers because they had limited time -- after it was contacted by a newspaper looking to verify claims by a security researcher about problems with PC-Wahl, Rieger said.Over the course of eight weeks, the CCC group found a series of flaws, reported them to the authorities and the manufacturer, and then were able to hack the software again after attempted patches by its maker failed, he said.The CCC has called on the government to \"promote and use software in the election process that has publicly readable source code,\" so that security flaws can be found and resolved more quickly, and to support the development of new, state-of-the-art election software.Government working on securityGermany's cybersecurity agency, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), said Thursday that the maker of PC-Wahl was working with the authorities to improve security.Merkel and Schulz spar over North Korea, refugees\"In close cooperation with the responsible federal and regional election managers and the PC-Wahl software producer, the BSI has issued recommendations for improving the security level in the transmission of preliminary election results with the software mentioned,\" it said in a statement. The manufacturer is putting the BSI's recommendations in place, the agency said. The BSI has been carrying out its own tests to uncover potential weaknesses in election processes and has been advising the German Parliament and parties on cybersecurity, it added.A spokesman for the BSI told CNN that the affected software evaluates only a preliminary election result.The official election results can always be double-checked since the election offices have them on paper, he said.The BSI will do whatever is necessary to prevent any manipulation of preliminary results and the discussion and insecurity this could cause, he added.The agency has been in contact with the software producer since the beginning of the year to work on securing the preliminary election result process, he said, including by talking to the heads of election offices.CNN's Manisha Ganguly, Diana Macumba and Laura Goehler contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsGreat Wall Marathon first run in 1999 Attracts runners from all over the worldThe 26.2-mile route includes 5,164 steps  (CNN)For some, running just one marathon is the ultimate sporting achievement.For others, it's just the beginning. Amongst running communities, there are rare breeds who aren't so much concerned with the distance -- it's more about where they run 26.2 miles, who they meet and the memories they make on the way round. That's Henrik Brandt's philosophy, and that's why he's run the Great Wall Marathon in China every year for the past 18 years.When the race was founded in 1999 with only 350 entrants, Brandt was there. A combination of stunning scenery, testing conditions, and a great atmosphere means the Dane hasn't missed a race since. Read MoreI've run marathons all over the world ... but there's no doubt my love is the Great Wall MarathonHenrik Brandt, marathon enthusiast\"It's my favorite, my number one,\" Brandt told CNN. \"I've run marathons all over the world on every continent, I've had a lot of adventures over the years, but there's no doubt my love is the Great Wall Marathon.\"Runners feel the burn on a climbAs endurance races go, the Great Wall Marathon is unique. Covering 5,164 steps, you can find yourself ascending hundreds of meters in a matter of minutes, toiling in temperatures of up to 40\u02daC.But there's something about the endless incline, the intense heat, and the camaraderie on the way round that runners find alluring, and Brandt is no exception.An impulse decisionIt was the Great Wall Marathon that made Brandt, who only started running two months before he first competed in the race, fall in love with the sport. \"In 1999 I was married to my first wife,\" he explains. \"She had run two marathons at that time and I thought she was just crazy. All the training she had to do before -- I thought it was a waste of time. \"We read in a Danish newspaper about the Great Wall Marathon, and I thought it was a great idea because it would be fun to visit China and the Great Wall and all the things I've heard about it.\"A phone call later, and Brandt, to the disbelief of his wife, had signed himself up on a whim.\"She looked at me and thought I was mad. But later that day she went for a run and I went with her, and continued that for some weeks. I was not a runner at all. \"It was quite a challenge to start with the Great Wall Marathon. Then I finished in a better time than her, so I thought I'd have to try a real marathon to see what the difference is in the time. \"I signed up for the Berlin marathon four months later and, to give you a sense of how hard the Great Wall is, I did it two hours faster.\"Raquel Holgado is all smiles during the 2017 Great Wall MarathonThis year's winner won in a time of  three hours, 14 minutes, 32 seconds, over an hour slower than the time it took Kenya's Daniel Wanjiru to win this year's London marathon.Something differentThe Great Wall Marathon has seen close to 23,000 finishers over its 18 years, a success that has lead Albatros -- a Denmark-based travel company that specializes in adventure holidays -- to broaden its marathon portfolio. Albatros organize five different marathons in total and aim to offer something different to most organized marathons, swapping cities for safaris, concrete streets for stunning scenery, and well-trodden routes for remote resorts. They appeal to athletes with a sense of adventure that the regular marathon circuit can't satisfy. \"Going to the Berlin marathon, which I've been to twice, I drive to Berlin by myself, book the hotel by myself, and get to the start area,\" says Brandt. \"I run in the morning then go back home [in Denmark] again -- I'm not really getting contact with all the runners at the Berlin marathon.\"Follow @cnnsport\n\nRaquel Holgado, a Sydney-based personal trainer who made a video of her Great Wall Marathon this year, agrees. \"I prefer new marathons, rather than repeating the same one,\" she told CNN. \"But with the Great Wall Marathon I'd 100% do it again.\"\"It's great and completely unpredictable. You completely forget that you're doing something difficult or challenging. \"This was great because I did the video and had lots of people sending me emails and messages. It's just a great way to meet people.\"The world's hardest marathons?On top of the Great Wall Marathon, Albatros also organizes one in the Arctic Circle; one in the ancient deserts of Petra, Jordan; The Big Five Marathon, held in a South African game reserve, and the Bagan Temple marathon that winds through the iconic spires of the Buddhist temples in Myanmar. Runners tackle the inhospitable landscapes of the Petra Desert marathonWhichever they sign up for, runners will be pushed to their limits -- be it by icy winds, energy-sapping sand, or sweltering desert heat. \"With the Big Five Marathon on the sand, you feel like you take three steps forward and one step back,\" Steen Albrechtsen, head of production at Albatros, told CNN.\"In the Polar Circle Marathon, we start on the ice cape and we run on the ice cape a certain distance and finish on normal roads. It's extremely cold.We're not trying to break anyone, we're trying to give them a good raceSteen Albrechtsen, Albatros Travel\"But I think the Great Wall might be the hardest. We always say that you can't win on the wall, but you can lose on the wall. You can't really push yourself. If you start pushing yourself, the unrelenting incline will get to you later on.\"It's a mix of temperature, terrain, and incline that makes them all so hard.\"That said, it is meant to be a holiday, and Albatros wants the experience to be rewarding, if not necessarily enjoyable.Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videos\"We try to make a race that's a 30% increase of someone's normal marathon time,\" Albrechtsen adds. \"We're not trying to break anyone. We're trying to give them a good race, we're trying to give them a good experience. We actually have something like a 97% completion rate.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Bennett's brother, who also plays in the NFL, and quarterback Colin Kaepernick shared support for BennettThis article contains language that some may find objectionable. (CNN)Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett, who is among prominent NFL players who protest the national anthem before games, said police in Las Vegas unfairly singled him out, threatened him with a gun and detained him briefly after he attended last month's prizefight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor.Bennett shared his account in a letter he posted Wednesday on Twitter. As he was leaving a party at the casino and heading home, he said he heard what sounded like gunshots. While he and others ran for cover, Las Vegas police officers pointed guns at him \"for doing nothing more than simply being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he wrote. One pointed a gun at his head while another pinned him to the ground before they handcuffed him and placed him in a squad car, he said. They released him upon learning who he was, but left him feeling as though \"the system had failed me,\" he wrote on Twitter.The Las Vegas Police Department confirmed that officers detained Bennett for 10 minutes and released him. They were responding to a call of battery and assault with a gun that had turned into an active shooter situation, Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Wednesday. Read MoreBased on the information they had at the time, they believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and pursued him, McMahill said. Given the circumstances, McMahill said he saw \"no evidence that race played a role in this incident.\"'Emotionally traumatic event,' lawyer saysBennett has hired civil rights attorney John Burris, who on Wednesday called the officers' actions \"outrageous, and exhibit A as to how every black man rich, famous or poor, unarmed and innocent can be falsely detained, arrested or even shot and killed by the police,\" according to a statement.Bennett, a father of three, feared for his life when he was detained, Burris told CNN.\"He was jumped, if you will, by these officers and told to get on the ground and, certainly, at gunpoint, it was uncalled for, it was an emotionally traumatic event,\" the attorney said. \"You are placed in a position where your life can be in danger. If you make any sudden moves that could be misinterpreted by the police officers, you can lose your life.\"Michael Bennett: 'I can't stand for the national anthem'In his account, Bennett said that as he lay on the ground, complying with his commands not to move, the officer placed his gun near his head and warned him that if he moved he would \"blow my (expletive) head off.\" While he was \"terrified and confused by what was taking place,\" a second officer came over and \"forcefully jammed his knee into my back making it difficult for me to breathe,\" he wrote. \"They then cinched the handcuffs on my wrists so tight that my fingers went numb,\" he continued.\"The officers' excessive use of force was unbearable,\" Bennett continued. \"I felt helpless as I lay there on the ground handcuffed facing the real-life threat of being killed. All I could think of was 'I'm going to die for no other reason than I am black and my skin color is somehow a threat.'\"McMahill said the officers were responding to the situation based on what they knew at the time. An individual later identified as Bennett was seen crouched down behind a gaming machine as the officers approached, he said. Once Bennett was in the officers' view, he quickly ran out of the south doors and jumped over a wall into traffic. \"Due to Bennett's actions and and the information officers had at the time, they believed Bennett may have been involved in the shooting and they gave chase,\" he said. \"Many folks today have called this an incident of racial bias policing, that police officers focused solely on the race of the individual that they were going to stop. I can tell you as I stand here today, I see no evidence of that. I see no evidence that race played a role in this incident.\"Bennett is considering filing a federal civil rights lawsuit for \"unlawful detention,\" for the use of a firearm against him, and for being aggressively kneed in the back and handcuffed roughly, Burris said. \"Money cannot be the sole object for him because he makes a lot. I think he wants acknowledgment of what was wrong with what took place, and it's important from his point of view that when something like this happens, you stand up for yourself, you don't take the easy way out,\" Burris said.Bennett expressed a similar perspective in his open letter: \"Equality doesn't live in this country and no matter how much money you make, what job title you have, or how much you give, when you are seen as a 'Nigger,' you will be treated that way.\"'The call that night was a scary one'Bennett's brother, Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett, signaled support for his sibling Wednesday in an Instagram post.\"The call that night was a scary one,\" Martellus Bennett wrote. \"The emotion and the thought of almost losing you because of the way you look left me in one of the saddest places ever. I could hear the fear in your voice, the tears in your eyes as well your sprinting heart beat. I can't imagine how the people who lost their loved ones felt when they got the call.\"Martellus Bennett added later: \"To me, you're much more than a nigger,\" a direct reference to the line in his brother's open letter.The unexpected connection between slavery, NFL protests and the national anthemAlso responding to Bennett's letter Wednesday was Colin Kaepernick, the ex-San Francisco 49ers quarterback who became a lightning rod last year when he refused to stand during the national anthem to protest what he believes are racial injustices and ongoing police brutality in the US. \"This violation that happened against my Brother Michael Bennett is disgusting and unjust. I stand with Michael and I stand with the people,\" Kaepernick tweeted. In an interview last month with CNN, Bennett said he won't stand for the national anthem at NFL games until he sees \"equality and freedom.\"\"At this point, I think if you're being silent, you're being dishonest,\" Bennett told CNN. \"And we can be silenced no more because we're living in this reality where I can't hide behind the logo on my helmet. I can't hide behind the shield. I can't hide behind the glamor and glitz of the NFL.\"Kaepernick, who last year said he didn't want to \"show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" drew fierce criticism for refusing to stand during the national anthem but also inspired athletes -- from elementary schools to professional leagues -- to join his movement. Kaepernick remains a free agent, as no NFL team has signed him.CNN's Carma Hassan and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.",

The formerly Communist nations in eastern Europe claimed they would struggle to absorb mainly Muslim refugees from Syria.Read MoreIn their case before the ECJ, Hungary and Slovakia argued that there had been procedural flaws and that the decision was neither a suitable response to the migrant crisis nor necessary to deal with it.While Poland backed their case before the court, Belgium, Germany, Greece, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and the European Commission argued in support of the council, the ECJ press release said.In its ruling Wednesday, the court rejected all the arguments brought by Hungary and Slovakia.Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugees The measures were legally taken by the EU Council and did not require ratification by individual governments, its news release said. \"Its adoption was not subject to the requirements relating to the participation of national Parliaments and to the public nature of the deliberations and vote in the Council.\"It also noted that retrospective assessments of how effective the decision had been could not be used to question its legality.  The court \"observes in particular that the small number of relocations so far carried out under the contested decision can be explained by a series of factors that the Council could not have foreseen at the time when the decision was adopted, including, in particular, the lack of cooperation on the part of certain Member States,\" it said.The European Commission warned EU member states earlier this year that there were \"no more excuses\" for not delivering on promises to take on refugees.According to the International Organization for Migration, as of August 30 this year, only 27,412 people had been relocated to 24 countries, compared with the 120,000 provided for by the scheme. Of those, 19,200 were transferred from Greece and 8,212 from Italy. Germany, France and the Netherlands have taken in the highest number. Under the emergency scheme, 120,000 relocations were due to take place over two years, ending in September 2017.",

        "content": "(CNN)He's a former alcoholic, an ex-soccer player and he doesn't have a university degree. Martin Schulz is not your average candidate for Chancellor.But on September 24, the votes of millions of Germans will decide whether he will replace Angela Merkel, Germany's leader since 2005.Related: Why the German elections matter to the rest of the worldLike America's Bernie Sanders and the UK's Jeremy Corbyn, he's a male social democrat taking on a more conservative female politician. And according to the polls, Schulz's chances don't look good.Read MoreCould he do what Sanders and Corbyn failed to? Here's what you need to know about Merkel's challenger.  Schulz the manSanders and Corbyn were both viewed as outsiders trying to break into and shake up mainstream politics. And Schulz's early life certainly doesn't look like that of a typical career politician either.A serious knee injury shattered his childhood dreams of becoming a pro soccer player. He struggled with alcoholism and never went to university, working in a bookstore instead and later becoming mayor of his local town.It's a past he's happy to discuss. \"When I left school early I really hit rock bottom,\" he said during a live YouTube interview with German voters on Tuesday. \"That was the beginning of a crisis in my life.\"Schulz has been holding campaign rallies across Germany -- often attracting thousands -- in the run-up to the election.But for the past six years he's been president of the European Parliament -- and was a member of it for 16 years before that.\"He's not a Corbyn or a Sanders,\" says Charles Lees, professor of politics at the University of Bath in England. \"It's difficult for politicians who are basically insiders to suddenly adopt the mantle of the outsider without looking inauthentic.\" His campaignBut Schulz did play the outsider card at the start of his campaign -- and successfully.Support for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) surged after he became its leader in January, and the party gained 20,000 members in the months that followed.\"There was a huge amount of energy and hope among SPD supporters,\" recalls Andreas Jungherr, expert in political communication at the University of Konstanz in southern Germany. \"Schulz was trying to use similar rhetoric to Sanders and Corbyn -- the rhetoric of hope and optimism.\"Countless memes were spawned, including a riff on the Obama \"hope\" poster and calls to \"Make Europe Great Again.\"Schulz's election as leader of the SPD spawned the \"MEGA\" meme (\"Make Europe Great Again\"), riffing on President Donald Trump's campaign slogan.Key to the successes of Sanders and Corbyn was a strong grassroots campaign -- and that's vital to the SPD's efforts too.Tobias Nehren, who heads up the SPD's digital campaign, spent several weeks in the US before last year's election, getting top tips from activists who worked for Sanders and his rival Hillary Clinton.In recent months, he's been working to get the SPD's new online supporters out on the streets, knocking on millions of doors.And like Sanders and Corbyn, Schulz has raised most of his campaign finance from a huge number of small donations.But lack of money is a problem and Schulz has lost his early momentum, falling back in the polls and turning away from visionary rhetoric towards more concrete policy proposals.In Tuesday's YouTube appearance, it was the old Schulz who turned up -- idealistic and impassioned, relaxed and candid: \"a man of the people,\" as one Twitter user wrote.\"Authentic, likeable, modern, competent, persuasive, with clear ideas and structure. @MartinSchulz you are my chancellor!\" wrote another Twitter user Mc Fly. Authentisch,sympathisch,modern,kompetent,\u00fcberzeugend,mit klaren Ideen und Struktur. @MartinSchulz Sie sind mein Kanzler! #deinewahl @spdde\u2014 Mc Fly (@angelfredd) September 5, 2017\n\nHis opponentA big part of Schulz's problem is his opponent, argues Lees. \"He's up against a much more accomplished political operator than Corbyn was at the last election and arguably also Bernie Sanders,\" he said. \"Merkel has got fantastically attuned political antennae.\"She rarely mentions Schulz's name on the campaign trail and is often accused of avoiding controversial issues and failing to present concrete policies. Those tactics also make it hard for Schulz to launch a successful attack.The two candidates took part in a live television debate three weeks before the election.\"There is plenty of substantive ground to criticize Merkel,\" argues Dan Hough, professor of politics at the University of Sussex in England. \"But unless she does something to show her incompetence, Schulz will struggle,\" he says. \"And the historical record shows she doesn't do that very often.\"A televised \"duel\" between the two candidates Sunday was widely seen as Schulz's chance to rattle his rival and position himself as a realistic alternative.But the few blows he managed to land -- on Merkel's refugee policy, the diesel scandal and crime -- did little to unsettle her.The votersSanders and Corbyn were both appealing to an electorate unhappy with the status quo, fed up with years of austerity and sharp-suited, silver-tongued career politicians.Although Schulz is preaching a similar message -- against inequality and worker exploitation, for state investment and social justice -- it doesn't seem to be cutting through.Through Germany's open door: What life is really like for refugees \"Unlike in [other] Anglo-Saxon economies, ordinary voters are pretty content,\" argues Lees. \"It's not an unhappy electorate.\"There are problems, but they're not very apparent, he explains.Moreover, German voters \"tend to have a strong aversion to political risk because of the country's history.\"Germany's post-war history seems to bear that out. The country has had only eight different leaders since 1949 -- and three of them have been in office for at least 12 years.The systemWhile both Sanders and Corbyn were essentially in a straight-up fight for power with their more conservative rivals, Schulz is working within a more complicated multiparty system.That hampers him -- and his cause -- in two ways.German governments are nearly always formed by coalition -- and Schulz's Social Democrats have been ruling alongside Merkel's Conservatives for the past four years.\"If he starts criticizing Merkel's government, he's criticizing his own party,\" Hough points out. \"His room for maneuver is pretty slim.\"An SPD supporter holds up a \"Now Is Schulz\" poster at a campaign rally.The multiparty system also means that genuine political renegades are more likely to find homes in smaller, niche parties away from the center ground.That's where discontented voters will be drawn too. \"The existence of a left-wing party is something Corbyn and Sanders never had to deal with,\" explains Hough.\"I cannot think of anybody in the SPD who would have a realistic chance of doing a better job than Martin Schulz,\" he says. But winning the election is a tough ask.\"He needs to find an angle on Merkel that works. He hasn't done that so far.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Photographs of Britain's Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing topless on vacation in 2012 were an invasion of privacy, a French court ruled on Tuesday. The court in Nanterre, in the western suburbs of Paris, awarded 100,000 euros in damages to the duchess and her husband, Prince William. It also slapped both the editor of Closer magazine and the chief executive of the publishing group that owns it with the maximum fine possible under French law (45,000 euros or about $53,500). The couple had asked for 1.5 million euros (nearly $1.8 million) in damages after the magazine and regional newspaper La Provence published grainy photos that showed the duchess sunbathing topless while on holiday in the south of France.The photos were taken with long lenses as the duke and duchess stayed at a private chateau owned by Viscount Linley, a nephew of Queen Elizabeth. William and his wife were on a nine-day tour of Southeast Asia, seen here arriving in Tuvalu in 2012, when the paparazzi pictures where published. Paul-Albert Inweis, the main lawyer for Closer, called the fines \"somewhat exaggerated\" after the ruling. Read More\"The Windsor spouses sought 1.5 million euros in damages from the court but they got 50,000 each, which is in line with the jurisprudence. This is welcome,\" he said. \"On the other hand, the fine -- which corresponds to the maximum fine -- seems somewhat exaggerated for a private dispute.\"\"This case raises real issues regarding freedom and we will consult with our clients.\"Six people associated with the publication of the paparazzi images -- including three photographers -- went on trial in May, five years after they were first printed. At the time, Prince William slammed the decision to print the images of his wife as \"particularly shocking\" in light of his late mother's battles with the paparazzi.Princess Diana died 20 years ago in a car accident as she fled photographers in Paris, when her sons were aged 15 and 12.A royal baby will make the world's greatest brand even stronger \"The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so,\" a palace spokesman said in 2012.In 2012, Closer was fined by a French court for printing the images and banned from distributing the print magazine and online. The court also ordered the publication to turn over the original images to the royal family within 24 hours of the ruling and pay them 2,000 euros (around $2,600).  The ruling comes a day after the duke and duchess announced they are expecting their third child together. The baby will be fifth in line to the throne.",

The Toronto-based American actress, who stars in the hit US TV show 'Suits,' revealed the pair were introduced in July 2016 by mutual friends in London.\"We're two people who are really happy and in love,\" Markle told Vanity Fair. \"We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception. She added: \"Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship.\"Markle spoke for the first time about her high-profile relationship in this month's Vanity Fair cover story.In November, Prince Harry ended weeks of speculation and confirmed that they were in fact an item in a statement released by Kensington Palace. Read MoreHe condemned the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" his girlfriend had faced from media outlets before adding that he was worried for her safety. The move was a departure from the usual sharply choreographed media announcements from the British royal family.The palace rarely puts out such statements, only doing so in recent years to keep the paparazzi from getting too close to Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the children of Harry's brother, Prince William. The brothers have been much more open about their personal lives than their royal predecessors. Recently they spoke publicly about their mother, Princess Diana, on the 20th anniversary of her death. 'The rest is noise'Markle, 36, shed light on the media frenzy that has engulfed her life since she embarked on the year-long relationship, admitting it can be difficult at times. \"It has its challenges, and it comes in waves -- some days it can feel more challenging than others,\" she told the magazine. \"And right out of the gate it was surprising the way things changed. But I still have this support system all around me, and, of course, my boyfriend's support.\"Markle appears carefree and relaxed in the spread in Vanity Fair.In the interview, Markle also claimed not to read any articles about herself, a strategy she may have picked up from the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William's wife, who is said to have adopted this tactic when handling the media's glare. \n\n\n\n\n\"I don't read any press. I haven't even read press for\u00a0'Suits.' The people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am. The rest is noise,\" she said.The interview will likely do little to quell swirling rumors around the couple regardless of the fact that they largely stay away from the cameras. \"We're a couple,\" Markle said. \"We're in love. I'm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It's part of what makes it so special, that it's just ours. But we're happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\"",

We will see how the situation develops.\"Putin's remarks Tuesday are the latest in a series of tense diplomatic exchanges between the two nations following US allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.Last week the Trump administration announced it was shuttering the Russian Consulate in San Francisco as well as annexes in Washington and New York in response to mandated staff cuts at the US mission in Russia.The American plan to close the three diplomatic facilities followed Moscow's order for almost half of US personnel to leave their positions in Russia and the seizure of two US diplomatic properties in response to expanded sanctions passed by Congress.Read More\"The fact that Americans have reduced the number of diplomatic representations in the US, well it is their right, but it was done not in a polite manner and that does not give credit to our American partners,\" Putin said Tuesday.Putin apparently came up with the 155 figure because he said that 155 of Russia's staff in the United States were \"not really diplomats\" but part of its UN mission in New York.In July, Putin sought to reduce the number of US diplomats in Russia to 455, a figure equal to the number of Russian diplomats now in the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.The Russian leader also said Tuesday he could sue US authorities over violating Russian property rights.\"This was unprecedented, and I was a graduate of St. Petersburg University school of law, I can tell you that (the) American side has taken away the right to use our property. And this is (a) violation of our rights,\" Putin said. \"I think to start with, we should go to court and we should go see how effectively (the) American court system works.\"US 'prepared to take further action'Russia summons American diplomat as its US outposts are ordered to closeIn a statement last week announcing the US plan to close the Russian facilities, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, \"The United States has fully implemented the decision by the Government of the Russian Federation to reduce the size of our mission in Russia. We believe this action was unwarranted and detrimental to the overall relationship between our countries.\"In the spirit of parity invoked by the Russians,\" she continued, \"we are requiring the Russian government to close its Consulate General in San Francisco, a chancery annex in Washington, D.C., and a consular annex in New York City.\"Nauert also noted the United States was allowing Russia to maintain additional annexes \"in an effort to arrest the downward spiral in our relationship\" but was \"prepared to take further action as necessary and as warranted.\"Obama expulsionsIn late 2016, President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and the seizure of two Russian government compounds in response to alleged Russian meddling in the presidential election.

During her second pregnancy, the Duchess was treated at Kensington Palace.  The newest tiny royal will be a sibling to four-year-old Prince George and two-year-old Princess Charlotte -- the royal couple's first two children. The family toured Canada last year. Regardless of whether the child is a boy or a girl, the baby will become the fifth in line to the throne behind big sister Charlotte, bumping Prince Harry down the line of succession.A change in law after William and Kate wed gave women the same rights of accession to the throne as men.The child will be Queen Elizabeth's sixth great-grandchild.

He remained humble and private, despite transcending his sport and changing the perception of cycling in Spain.Oscar Pereiro, a fellow Spanish cyclist and himself a Tour de France winner in 2006 -- the Spaniard inherited the 2006 title after original winner Floyd Landis was disqualified for doping -- has got to know Indurain well in the years since the pair retired.Indurain put an end to his professional cycling career four years before Pereiro began his, leaving an indelible mark on the up-and-coming rider's generation.Read More\"For me, truly, Miguel Indurain is one of the greatest Spanish athletes in history,\" Pereiro tells CNN. \"Not only as a person and as an athlete, but what he did for sport in Spain, the moment in which he did it, the way his which he did it and the way he expresses himself.\"I've had the great fortune of spending a lot of time with him and every day I still see him as a person from another planet. He's someone who transmits more than the values he had as a cyclist.\"Miguel Indurain, pictured in the yellow jersey, is shown competing in the 1995 Tour de France.Commentators have often described Indurain as a quiet man which, most of the time, played into his favor and enhanced his image as a daunting and complex opponent for his rivals.On other occasions, however, it's sometimes suggested Indurain's own team would struggle to understand his daily needs, such was his lack of communication.Pereiro admits that previous guesses at Indurain's character may have been on the mark, but also reveals a side to the man which was kept hidden from the public eye.\"It's possible that they speak correctly about him,\" Pereiro says. \"But he's quite chatty about cycling, he can have his own shyness but he also makes jokes, he knows how to have a laugh, he also knows how to be very close. \"I don't know what some interviews attribute to him but eating with him, riding bikes with him is very pleasant. \"Now we've both retired, we go riding together and I confirm everything they say. He's a great person all round and very warm. I still have such admiration for Miguel Indurain that I think back to the impact he had on me.\"Indurain, again pictured in yellow, secured five consecutive Tour de France victories.Since Indurain retired, no man has been able to match his record of five consecutive Tour de France victories, nor his record of winning the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France back-to-back for two years running.For a man who did so much for Spain and cycling, it seems almost cruely ironic that the only Grand Tour he never won was the one in his homeland: La Vuelta, the grand tour of Spain.La Vuelta in 1996 also proved a watershed moment for Indurain in helping make his mind up to call time on his career.Indurain's nicknaame was 'Miguelon' (\"Big Mig\").He was persuaded to race that year in his national tour -- the first time he'd competed in La Vuelta since 1991 -- having come second in the Tour de France, only to be painfully dropped on the steep Fito pass.\"In the end, it was all a matter of faith, of wanting to believe that what had happened in the Tour was no more than a temporary loss of form,\" wrote Carlos Arribas in El Pais.\"That the improbable challenge of riding and winning the Vuelta in September would be feasible for him by a mere act of will, despite the fact that he'd always restricted his best form to three months of the year.\"And four months later -- on January 1 1997 -- Indurain annouced his retirement.",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)A couple of years ago, Moschka Mohammadi was unable to read or write. Now, at 11, the young Afghan refugee is fluent in German, seamlessly translating between German and Dari with her parents at their dinner table as she arranges a visit to the orthodontist and the delivery of a new bed for her two siblings.Back in Afghanistan, Mohammadi had attended just one day of school -- in a room hidden from the Taliban -- when fighting broke out in their village.Her family first fled to Kabul before embarking on the long trek to Germany, with a hand-painted Quran her only physical reminder of home.Mohammadi's family is one of just under a million refugees that have taken refuge in Germany since 2015 under German Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door migration policy. During the Mohammadi's journey, they lost almost all their belongings in the sea. The only thing they could save was a small bag that held their family Quran. \"It's the most important belonging we have,\" Moschka said.As unprecedented numbers of migrants began to pour into Europe, Merkel asked each German state to accept a quota of asylum seekers. Read MoreSince that call, many cities and towns have taken in more refugees than required, with varying degrees of success.Two years on, CNN visited Altena and Bautzen -- two German towns that took in more than the required quota of refugees to see how Merkel's policy has fared.     'A win-win situation'Altena, an industrial west German town, was facing an economic downturn after its ironworks closed. Jobs were lost, businesses shut down, and families abandoned their homes. The population dropped by more than 10%.The mayor was looking for a way to give the town a boost when Merkel made her appeal in 2015. \"First, we wanted to help. There was a human reason to take them,\" Altena's mayor Andreas Hollstein explained. \"But the second reason was a win-win situation. We thought, 'Okay, we need new people in Altena. We need new neighbors. And this will help us invest in the future.'\"Since September 2015, Altena has welcomed 400 refugees: 50% from Syria, 30% from Iraq and 15% from Afghanistan. The town took in in 400 refugees, and set up a program to match them with volunteer mentors that would help navigate German culture and its notoriously bureaucratic paperwork.   Hollstein recalls the initial response of local residents. \"The far-right was hysterical. They called it a 'crisis,'\" he laughed. \"On the far left, they threw their arms out and said: let everyone in and be happy.\" \"But neither is helpful. It's just hard work.\"That work was especially challenging at the beginning, when Hollstein had hoped to fast track refugees to jobs at the steel mills. While some were quick to adapt and learn German, others couldn't read and had to start from scratch.Ellnas Momand, 10, says she misses her home in Afghanistan but  has \"really good friends here in Germany and I like school.\"Some local residents resented the new arrivals. While the town was deciding whether or not to accept an additional 100 people, a young man hurled a firebomb into a Syrian family's home, sending them to the hospital for smoke inhalation and damaging the dwelling.The man was arrested and sentenced to four years in jail.Hollstein said the isolated incident only strengthened the town's resolve to make integration work.\"It became easy to convince people to accept new refugees. We wanted to show we would welcome them,\" he said.Bernadette Koopmann is one of the welcoming. She mentors Moschka Mohammadi's family along with another family from Afghanistan.Mentor Bernadette Koopmann, 45, at her home in Altena. \"I have such a perfect life. I have healthy children, we live in a country that has not experienced war in a long time. Others are not so lucky,\" she said.\"They experience war, devastation, and poverty. I believe it's not too much to ask for our help.\"Koopmann's role as a mentor to the family has evolved into a bond of friendship.She visits them at least once a week teaching German to the parents, was with them when their youngest daughter was born and more recently, cried with them upon learning that their refugee status was rejected. She's now assisting them with their appeal. \"... if that gets rejected ... it would be too difficult to bear. But I'm hopeful. They have a good case,\" she said.Yalda Mohammadi, 8, and brother Omit, 8, both attend elementary school in Altena, where they study German.Daughter Moschka, fearful of what the future might bring, spoke with a wisdom beyond her eleven years.\"I know that some people are annoyed with us, with refugees,\" she said.\"But I think if (they) could just see, if they could experience what it like to be a refugee at some point in their lives, then they would know how difficult it is.\"Across town, Mayor Hollstein stood at a construction site that embodies the town's commitment to its newest residents.Two refugees, a welder from Afghanistan and a literature student from Syria, spoke to one another in German as they worked to renovate a 18th century building into a new tourist and community center.Ultimately, the mayor hopes that refugees fluent in German will also be able to staff it.  \"I want this to become like an extended living room for refuges in Altena\" explained project manager Lisa Gudra. \"In Germany, we meet at home. But in other countries, they have a coffee culture where the community meets outside more. This is what I want to see where all residents can mingle.\"Merkel has hailed Altena as an integration success story.And for the town's new residents -- like the Mohammadi family -- its success is everything.Yalda and Omit play with their 9-month-old sister Elena, the first of the family to be born in Germany.'I thought I had left my problems behind'Around 500 kilometers (310 miles) away in the prosperous east German town of Bautzen, Yahya, a 21-year old Syrian refugee is desperate to leave.\"I thought I had left my problems behind in Syria. I came here to live in peace. But there are some people who don't want us to enjoy our freedom. So, I don't go out at night because I know this is asking for trouble,\" Yahya, who asked that his last name not be published, said. Bautzen used to be a part of communist East Germany but after reunification, tourists flocked to its cobbled streets and pastel-colored buildings in the medieval center. Its population of 40,000 is growing, and when the city was asked to take in 900 refugees, it offered to take in 1700 -- nearly double what was required.  Yahya, a Syrian refugee, is fearful of being targetted in Bautzen.But protests and blockades greeted the first arrivals and a refugee shelter was burned down.\"The city was not resistant. It was afraid,\" Mayor Alexander Ahrens explained. \"It's a very human reaction to fear most things that you don't know. People in the area had no experience living together with foreigners.\"Ahrens pointed to recent history to explain further.Yahya's backyard in Bautzen. He doesn't feel welcome in the town, he says.\"Until 1989, you were not able to discuss the issue of racism and right-wing extremism in Germany.  More over they had no reason to discuss this, because there were only Germans here. So, there was no chance for that racism to become obvious. That's something that has changed with the refugee movement.\"\"It took 20 - 25 years in west Germany to change attitudes -- why should we think we can drive back everyday racism just like that overnight?\" he added.Last year, tensions peaked when a fight between local and refugee teenagers escalated into a full-blown melee in the city's main square.'I no longer feel secure' in Germany, Syrian refugee saysBautzen became front-page news and, for some, a textbook case of the refugee policy failure, but Bautzen's mayor insists the incident was an organized provocation from Neo-Nazi extremists hoping to stoke more violence. Neo-Nazi grafitti that reads \"Nazi Kiez (Nazi neighborhood) is seen in Bautzen's town center.Since then, more police are on regular patrol, and a particularly volatile asylum-seeker was temporarily banned from the town. Tensions have simmered down this year but there are still occasional Neo-Nazi demonstrations on the streets.That is the source of Yahya's fear. One night, a group of young men taunted him before setting a group of dogs on him, he said. He managed to escape, but was shaken.Still, Yahya does not believe that Bautzen's residents are bad people, only frightened of foreigners they can't understand, adding that perhaps other parts of Germany would be more welcoming and that attitudes in the country could be changing.Alexander Ahrens, Bautzen's mayor since 2015. Yet, in many ways, Yahya is an example of a well-integrated refugee: His German is proficient and becoming rapidly fluent. He has two jobs and earns enough to rent an apartment.  He's one of many \"success stories\" in the town that Mayor Ahrens was keen to highlight, including a Syrian doctor who will soon work in a position that the city has been looking to fill for three years.  The more time spent living side-by-side with refugees, the more society will accept the benefits, the Mayor says. But some local residents have a less optimistic view of refugee integration. There is a fear that more refugees will mean more crime, particularly after the sexual assaults in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2016, where police said scores of migrant men assaulted women during firework displays in the city's main square.Bautzen's town center. The east German town is just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the Polish border. Loreen Henke, 19, said she now avoids some parts of town because of refugees. \"They hassle me and pester me when I'm walking by. It's not a good thing for women and it makes me afraid. Before the refugees came, we could go wherever we wanted at night. But now we are scared. It's something we have to talk about more openly.\"  But there are also signs that Bautzen may be warming to its new arrivals. Frau Wolf, Yahya's 92-year-old neighbor, has given him a German name, \"Johanes,\" often popping over to ask about his health and encouraging him to get out more.\"He's a good boy! He's always helping me,\" she said. Old enough to remember the aftermath of Germany's own war, she added. \"People should be nicer. After all, we were refugees once too.\"",

Turkey's deputy Prime Minister, Mehmet Sismek, also reacted on Twitter. \"EU never had a credible commitment to let Turkey in,\" he wrote Monday. \"Merkel isn't only shooting herself in the foot but also jeopardising the future of Europe.\"EU never had a credible commitment to let Turkey in.

In July, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned Germans against traveling to Turkey and suggested that the German government would review corporate investments in Turkey.\"Someone who detains law-abiding visitors to their country on the basis of outlandish, indeed absurd, accusations and throws them into prison has left European values behind,\" Gabriel said, calling for Steudtner's release. \"We cannot continue as before.\"JUST WATCHEDNobel laureate on Erdogan's TurkeyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNobel laureate on Erdogan's Turkey 06:45A few weeks earlier, Turkey's Foreign Ministry criticized an art installation in Berlin depicting Erdogan as a dictator that coincided with the G20 summit in Hamburg, calling it \"a new example of rising racism and xenophobia in the country.\"Soon after, the Turkish government blocked German lawmakers from visiting German troops stationed in Turkey participating in NATO operations in Syria.Earlier this year, German officials prevented top politicians, including Erdogan, from addressing Turkish rallies in Germany in the lead-up to an April referendum that handed Erdogan sweeping new powers.In response, Erdogan likened the German government to that of Adolf Hitler. \"I thought that Nazism was over in Germany, but it turns out that it is still going on,\" he said. \"It is still going on, it is clear.\"Merkel warns Erdogan over electionJUST WATCHEDGermany heads to the polls in SeptemberReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGermany heads to the polls in September 02:22Relations with Turkey are a key issue in the days leading to federal elections in Germany, where there are some 3 million people with Turkish roots.Earlier this month, Erdogan called on voters of Turkish origin to boycott the two biggest parties -- Merkel's Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats -- along with the Green Party in the election, describing them as \"enemies of Turkey,\" according to CNN affiliate NTV.The call drew a fierce rebuke at the time from Merkel, who warned Erdogan against interfering in the election.Germans go the polls September 24, with Merkel widely expected to secure a fourth term.CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Merieme Arif contributed to this article",

        "content": "(CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel traded blows with her election rival, Martin Schulz, in a live TV debate Sunday night, three weeks before the country's federal election.The pair sparred over the right course of action in North Korea after Sunday's nuclear bomb test.President Donald Trump \"is not the right person to solve this conflict,\" said Schulz, leader of the Social Democratic Party, or SPD.\"Last time, by tweeting, he brought us to the brink of a crisis.\"Why the German elections matter to the rest of the worldGermany will need to work with other partners, including Canada, to solve this crisis, Schulz continued. \"The problem we have with Trump is that he is unpredictable ... we never know when he will tweet next time.\"Read MoreHe later likened Trump to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, arguing both leaders question democratic values.Merkel responded to the question of North Korea with more caution. \"I don't think we can solve this without the US President, but we will only consider a peaceful, diplomatic solution,\" she said.\"We need the US as a power for peace,\" she said, \"and we need to do everything possible to get them on the right and sensible path.\"The stakes are highSunday night's encounter, the only head-to-head debate of the campaign, had been billed as a moment of potential peril for the Chancellor and a moment of opportunity for Schulz.More than 16 million Germans tuned in to watch, according to the Forsa Institute.Merkel is running for her fourth term in office and polls show her Christian Democratic Union Party, or CDU, as the clear front-runner in the September 24 vote. But Merkel is not naturally combative and has been criticized for barely mentioning her opponent's name during the campaign.She was also accused of threatening to boycott the so-called \"duel\" if the question-and-answer format was changed to allow the candidates to debate each other directly.Merkel did not deny that claim when questioned about it at her annual press conference last week.Last night's debate was viewed by more than 16 million Germans.While debating is not Merkel's forte, her opponent has shown plenty of rhetorical firepower on the campaign trail.Schulz also has less to lose, with polls showing his party 10 to 15 points behind Merkel's conservatives.Little known to most German voters before he was elected party leader in January this year, he was looking to make a strong impression in the debate.The pair were questioned in a studio in Berlin over 90 minutes by two sets of moderators. Despite the question-and-answer format, which limited the amount of direct combat between the candidates, there was plenty of heated debate.As well as addressing domestic issues such as social inequality, pensions and education, they clashed on a series of topics with broader implications.TurkeySchulz took a harder line than his rival on Erdogan. Relations between Germany and Turkey have deteriorated significantly in recent months.Negotiations for Turkey's accession to the European Union must be stopped, he said.Germany accuses Turkey of arresting 2 more Germans for 'political reasons'\"All our basic values are called into question,\" by Erdogan's regime, he continued.He also called for accession payments to Turkey to be stopped, describing Erdogan as an \"autocratic ruler.\"\"Germany needs to let Turkey know that all red lines have been overstepped,\" he said.Merkel agreed that accession negotiations should be paused but insisted that \"we need to continue talking\" with Turkey. \"I do not want to stop diplomatic relations with Turkey,\" she said.RefugeesThe debate opened with a series of questions on Merkel's refugee policy, for which she has been widely criticized after 1 million refugees entered the country in 2015. Integrating these refugees is \"a very big task,\" Merkel admitted -- but defended her decision to allow an indefinite number of refugees into Germany in September of that year.Schulz criticized that decision, arguing that Merkel should not have acted without support from other European countries. \"People who flee from ISIS, from mass rape and mass violence, come here and we are ready to protect them,\" he said. \"We are proud of that in Germany.\"Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz has been holding rallies around the country.We cannot and we should not close Europe's outer borders, he said. But \"in terms of migration, we face great challenges.\"\"Integration is the task of a generation.\"Schulz also promised to speed up deportations of those asylum seekers who do not have the right to stay in Germany, but argued against mass deportations, insisting that cases should always be assessed on an individual basis.Security\"We must not get used to terror and we need to confront it,\" said Merkel when asked about the rise in the number of terror attacks across Europe.\"We need to do everything possible to learn from our mistakes,\" she said, referring to the truck attack in Berlin in December in which 12 people were killed. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of \"sleepwalking\" through the campaign.The perpetrator, Anis Amri, was supposed to be in pre-deportation custody at the time of the attack.Schulz agreed there were many mistakes and said Germany needs to take all preventive measures to stop people from becoming a risk.IslamMerkel defended the majority of Muslims in Germany, saying that many contribute to the country's success and are part of German society.\"The Islamic community needs to make clear that (Islamist terrorism) has nothing to do with Islam,\" she said.But she said the training of imams within Germany needed to be improved and that mosques should be closed \"if things happen that we don't accept.\" Schulz acknowledged that some newcomers from Muslim countries may have a different set of values and stressed the importance of education, both in schools and in vocational training programs. DieselThe country's auto industry has taken a hit since Volkswagen admitted two years ago that 11 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with software that allowed it to cheat pollution tests.The crisis unfolded under Merkel's watch and Schulz criticized the Chancellor for being too slow to address it.He heaped blame on the car industry, too. \"The damage they have caused is immense,\" he said.Merkel admitted that \"trust has been breached.\"\"We need to make sure that the carmakers right their wrongs,\" she said. Cars and auto parts account for roughly one-fifth of all German exports, worth \u20ac260 billion  ($309 billion). The sector employs over 800,000 people.",

The bomb was found during work Tuesday close to the Goethe University Frankfurt compound on Wismarer Street, police said in a statement. #Weltkriegsbombe #FrankfurtDas sind die Helden von Frankfurt und das besiegte Biest. Tausend Dank an Ren\u00e9 Bennert & Dieter Schwetzler! pic.twitter.com/cuHbjfzZe6\u2014 Polizei Frankfurt (@Polizei_Ffm) September 3, 2017\nThe device was a British bomb, specifically a 1.4-ton HC 4000 air mine, the statement said, and was put under police guard ahead of Sunday's operation to make it safe.Police said the size of the bomb made extensive evacuation measures a necessary precaution. Residents were told to leave their homes by 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) before the operation to defuse the bomb began.Read MoreThe process -- which took about four hours to complete -- began around 2:30 pm local time after police removed additional Frankfurt residents who had yet to leave the evacuation zone.Police said the evacuation was precautionary.Authorities began evacuating hospitals and care homes Saturday, as well as the German federal reserve and a major local broadcaster. Soon after 8 a.m., Frankfurt fire brigade spokesman Markus R\u00f6ck said the evacuation procedure appeared to have gone smoothly.\"The situation is relaxed which is a good sign and everything so far is going according to plan. We will now assess if everybody has left voluntarily and go from house to house and remove people if necessary. People who need assistance are being transported over the next few hours,\" R\u00f6ck said.Patients of the Buergerhospital clinic were moved to another hospital.The fire brigade tweeted: \"Transport for those who can't leave on their own is on its way into the evacuation zone.\" It said 1,100 relief workers and fire fighters had been deployed for the operation.The brigade's director, Reinhard Ries, told reporters: \"The scale of this bomb is overwhelming. I have never seen anything like it.\"     Police had the authority to forcibly remove residents from their homes. The fire brigade said in a statement that streets would be patrolled with the assistance of helicopters to ensure that no-one had been left behind and that homes were secure.About 11.30 a.m. local time police tweeted that the evacuation zone had been divided into 15 sectors, 12 of which had been emptied.Preparation for the disposal of the bomb.Shelters were set up for residents who were unable to go to friends or family during the bomb operation, with food provided.The two main shelters -- at a convention center and a concert hall -- could house up to 10,000 people, R\u00f6ck told CNN.The city also offered many activities to evacuees, with all public museums open and free of charge.Evacuees at Messe Frankfurt Sunday.\"Not everyone has the opportunity to spend the day with friends or relatives. By offering free entry to all city museums we want to help those affected to spend a few hours without worrying\", Frankfurt's Mayor Peter Feldmann said in a statement. Frankfurt airport tweeted that airport tours would be free to all Frankfurters forced to leave their homes, while residents organized other distractions such as yoga in the park. Those who evacuated on foot or by bicycle were allowed to head back to their homes, authorities said. But residents who drove couldn't return until patients who were evacuated from two area hospitals had made it back.The Frankfurt fire brigade said residents are expected to be able to return to their homes from 6 p.m. local time.One group organized yoga for residents evacuated from their homes.Legacy of the warWorld War II may have ended over 70 years ago, but its legacy still lingers in cities across Germany.Some streets close to the evacuation zone looked deserted Sunday.In May, more than 50,000 people were asked to leave Hanover after a bomb was discovered during pre-construction work on a site in the Vahrenwald district.On Christmas Day 2016, another 50,000 were evacuated from Augsburg in south Germany after a 1.8-ton bomb was found beneath an underground parking garage.Laura Goehler reported from Frankfurt and Susannah Cullinane wrote from Auckland.",

        "content": "(CNN)The German election is very much Chancellor Angela Merkel's to lose. But Sunday evening's encounter with her principal opponent -- the sole head-to-head debate of the campaign -- is a moment of potential peril.Few leaders in the democratic world can match Merkel's experience -- she has led Europe's biggest economy for more than 11 years and polls show her Christian Democratic Union Party (CDU) as the clear frontrunners for the September 24 vote.Why the German elections matter to the rest of the worldThere are very few threats to Merkel \"sleepwalking\" through this election -- as German media puts it -- but this debate could be one of them. Debating is not Merkel's forte, and her opponent, Martin Schulz of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), is likely to be forceful and well-prepared. He has less to lose -- several polls show him lagging  between 10 and 15 points behind Merkel. Stung by criticism that he is too much like Merkel, Schulz will be trying to set a distinct agenda.Read MoreWith just one debate scheduled for the entire campaign period, it could prove critical. Around half of Germany's 30 million eligible voters plan to watch it, according to a poll by the Forsa Institute, commissioned by STERN Magazine. Of those, about 22% said they would likely make up their minds on who to vote for, based on their performance in the debate.According to Forsa's Peter Matuschek, Merkel's lead over her past opponents has dropped after her debates. \"She is not a good debater, everybody knows this. And that might be an advantage for her opponent if he is in good shape that night,\" Matuschek told CNN. Here are three key election issues expected to dominate the debate:Merkel's refugee policyAn asylum-seeker takes a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel during the leader's visit to a refugee registration in Berlin, in September 2015.Merkel's most controversial policy in her current term has been her immigration policy, particularly in the case of refugee admissions.As European nations failed to strike an agreement to share the substantial number of refugees pouring into the region from Syria and Africa, Germany unilaterally decided to allow an indefinite number into the country. At the height of the migration in 2015, Germany took in more than one million refugees.The policy has been divisive, praised by human rights activists and a certain German demographic, and admonished as careless and too generous by others. It also gave fuel to the fringe far-right Alternative for Germany Party (AfD), which has lobbied the German people on an anti-immigration platform. Issues such as family reunification, deportations and integration, as well as border controls and a possible cap on refugees continue to make headlines. Merkel and Schulz both oppose the idea of a cap on refugees. DieselgateVolkswagen in 2015 admitted to installing emissions-cheating software in millions of its vehicles.The country's auto industry has taken a hit since Volkswagen admitted two years ago that 11 million of its cars worldwide were fitted with software that allowed it to cheat pollution tests. Its vehicles in the US were found to be emitting up to 40 times the legal limit on nitrogen oxide.It wasn't long until other German carmakers were accused of the same thing, including Daimler and BMW, as well as Volkswagen's subsidiaries Audi and Porsche.The crisis unfolded under Merkel's watch and Schulz has accused the Chancellor of being too slow to address it.Germany's finance ministry last month said that while the impact of the scandal was difficult to quantify, it was a notable risk to the economy. Cars and auto parts account for roughly one fifth of all German exports, worth 260 billion euros ($309 billion). The sector employs over 800,000 people.Merkel and her government are still finding ways to avoid driving bans ordered by courts and to ensure car sales don't tumble.In July, European antitrust officials confirmed they were looking into claims that Germany's major carmakers may have been operating a cartel since the 1990s, colluding on everything from vehicle development to diesel emissions systems.Security and terrorismPolicemen guard a truck that crashed into a Christmas market in Berlin, on December 19, 2016.Germany suffered a series of terror attacks in recent years, including a truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people last year. Security remains a major concern, and Schulz will be watched closely to see if he has anything new to offer. So far he appears to be on the same page as Merkel. Both party leaders  have promised to strengthen Germany's security forces and hire more police in response to the problem.This issue also relates to Merkel's refugee policy. Her critics say that it is near impossible to effectively screen all the refugees entering the country to determine whether they are a security risk. ISIS, for example, has claimed to have infiltrated the refugee route to Europe to carry out attacks on in the region. Following several attacks, Merkel has famously responded in her usual pragmatic way that \"we can manage it,\" a phrase that her critics slammed as naive and her supporters praised as measured.

What could there possibly be left to achieve? In the case of Teddy Riner, a whole lot more. The pursuit of sporting history seemingly never stops for the French judoka, who dominated the heavyweight division once again at this year's Suzuki World Judo Championships in Budapest. \"It is a big day for me, my family and my federation\" Riner told CNN Sport. \"This gold medal is French. This gold medal is mine!\" Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 28-year-old hadn't stepped onto a tatami in a competitive match since winning the Olympic final in Rio de Janerio 386 days ago. Read MoreMuch has changed since \u2014 not least the very rules themselves \u2014 but his standing within the sport remains unquestioned. The six-foot-eight, 141 kilogram judoka was imperious under the lights of the Papp Lazslo Arena, pawing away his opponents' advances like a cat toying with a piece of string. Bigger, heavier opponents stood in Riner's way \u2014 including Egypt's Maisara Elnagar (151.8kg) and Brazil's Rafael Silva (167.8kg) \u2014 but no man could stop him.READ: Sumiya Dorjsuren sends Mongolia into meltdown Legends of Judo: Ryoko TaniTeddy Riner pins Ecuador's Freddy Figueroa for 20 seconds to score ippon in their third-round match.Winning all four of his preliminary matches by ippon \u2014 judo's equivalent of a knockout \u2014 Riner faced explosive Georgian Guram Tushishvili at the semifinal stage in one of the most hotly-anticipated clashes of the Championships.It was the first ever meeting between two of the best pound-for-pound judokas on the planet. Tushishvili, the lightest in the division (111kg) and still just 22, had capitalized on Riner's absence by winning European Judo Championships in Warsaw earlier this year. But, despite forcing the match to golden score and enjoying the backing of a noisy Georgian contingent, he was unable to prevent the man known as \"the Teddy Bear\" scoring the decisive waza-ari.  Legends of Judo: Masashi Ebinuma Guram Tushishvili came as close to beating Teddy Riner than any competitor in the past seven years. It meant Riner faced David Moura of Brazil for a record-extending ninth World Championship title in the gold-medal showdown. Champion in both Cancun and Ekaterinburg this year, Moura traveled to Hungary occupying top spot in the rankings. Riner, meanwhile, had dropped to 14th place during his absence from judo and begun the tournament unseeded. Not that it mattered. Riner won the match in golden time with a sasae-tsurikomi-ashi throw, taking his unbeaten run to 134.\"These days it is very difficult,\" Riner told CNN Sport. \"This is my first competition since the Olympic Games and now there are a lot of new opponents. \"The younger guys have very beautiful judo, very quick judo, so I am very happy!\" World Judo Championships: A guide to 'the gentle way' Still just 28 years old, Riner is now aiming for a tenth consecutive World Championship gold. \"The Olympic Games are very far away,\" he said. \"After maybe five or 10 days' rest, I will come back, train and go for it again.\" Where does Teddy Riner rank among the best sports stars on the planet? Have your say using the hashtag #CNNJudo or commenting on the CNN Sport facebook page In Saturday's other weight divisions, Japan's Aaron Wolf emerged victorious in the -100kg final against Georgia's Varlam Liparteliani, with Azerbaijan's Elmar Gasimov and Azerbaijan's Kirill Denisov walking away with bronze.South Korea's Minjeong Kim and Iryna Kindzerska took bronze in the women's +78kg category.

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Nooruddin Mujaddady tries not to think about the events that led him to flee Afghanistan. The death threats against his family back home, the grueling months-long journey to Europe, and the anxiety of his new life in Germany are constant weights on his mind. When he can, Mujaddady prefers to focus on cricket. Standing on Berlin's Maifeld sports ground during a recent finals day of the German Cricket Federation's nationwide Super Series, the 25-year-old told CNN that when he plays cricket he doesn't think of \"anything else -- just cricket and sport\".\u00a0Nooruddin Mujaddady plays for the Eastern Bears.Once banned by the Nazis, who wanted Germany to concentrate on athletics, cricket is enjoying a renaissance because of the country's high levels of immigration.\u00a0Some of the best cricketing talent was on display at the Maifeld, once the scene of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini's 1937 rally.Read MoreLike Mujaddady, many of those competing have come from Afghanistan and Pakistan, fleeing war, violence and political persecution.Mujaddady arrived in Germany two years ago after traveling from Afghanistan, through Pakistan and on to Europe via car, bus and foot.At first, Germany was a faceless stranger. But slowly Mujaddady says he's adapting to his new surroundings in Rheinsberg, a picturesque city in the northeast of the country.The national Super Series was held at Berlin's famous Maifeld.Playing cricket has given him a new community, a group of friends and the opportunity to feel part of something again, he says.\"Here in Germany I'm like a child,\" Mujaddady told CNN.\"I am taking it slowly, step by step. Cricket has helped me to feel better about everything and allowed me to relax.\"\u00a0Escaping the pastAn experienced cricket player in Afghanistan, Mujaddady was introduced to a local club by a social worker six months after his arrival in Germany.\u00a0His tale is shared by other migrants. Between 2015 and the end of July, 171,491 Afghan nationals have claimed asylum in Germany, according to government figures. A total of 26,644 people have successfully applied for asylum after fleeing Pakistan. Mujaddady (L) was all smiles at the Super Series finals day.In the past two years, the number of people playing cricket in Germany on a regular basis has increased from 2,800 to 5,500. There are now more than 300 clubs across the country -- up from 130 in 2015 -- and it's not just in cities like Berlin.\u00a0'We are playing cricket everywhere'Brian Mantle told CNN: \"Six years ago, we had about 70 teams, now we have over 300.\"For Brian Mantle, chief executive of the German Cricket Federation, the landscape has completely changed since he arrived in Germany from England in 1996.\"It is really growing by the week. Just this week we had two or three inquiries from clubs up and down the country,\" he told CNN.\u00a0\"...we are not just playing cricket in the big cities, we are playing cricket everywhere. Small towns are getting cricket teams. It used to be just in Berlin, Hamburg, Bonn, Cologne and places like that. Now it's really\u00a0everywhere where cricket is being played.\"While Mantle oversees the national team, he also takes a hands-on role when it comes to grassroots cricket.\u00a0He views the sport as the perfect tool to help those coming to terms with their new life to find others who are experiencing something similar.\u00a0At clubs across the country, he says friendships are being forged, stories are shared, problems are halved.\u00a0\"The first level is to make these people feel comfortable here and to be happy,\" Mantle said.\u00a0\"They are playing cricket against people from all over the world: There are Germans here, Indians, Pakistanis, English people, and it gives them the opportunity to just be a normal person.\u00a0\"Out on the street they are maybe treated in a different way, but here they are just normal cricket players like everybody else. It helps them to be happy. This is the first step into integration.\"\u00a0The passion and enthusiasm are contagious. The German national side, which has benefited from the influx of new players, has made impressive strides.Most recently, it won the European Region Division One title and will take part in the World Cricket League Division Five in Johannesburg, South Africa, starting next week.The competition will pit Germany against teams from across the world such as Qatar, Ghana and Vanuatu, all developing cricketing nations.But it is the sport's impact on new arrivals that has been attracting more attention.\u00a0\u00a0'A better life'Isrhad Ahmad lives in Bautzen, volunteers as a translator and is captain of his local cricket club.Irshad Ahmad, a 30-year-old from Pakistan, is the captain of a local cricket club.

Yet it falls short of future strike partner Neymar's fee of $260 million, part of a reported total package of nearly half a billion dollars signed by the Brazilian last month.Although both figures dwarf Manchester United's $105 million record signing of Paul Pogba set just last year, there is more than just inflation in play, say analysts. \"For Qatar, capturing Neymar realizes the dream when it bought (PSG) in 2011,\" says James Montague, author of \"The Billionaires Club: The Unstoppable Rise of Football's Super-rich Owners.\"Read More\"Namely, to be at the very top table of European soccer, signing top players in their prime and appearing to be just as an attractive option as Barcelona and Real Madrid. \"This adds to the power of PSG's brand, which ultimately helps to promote Qatar internationally,\" he adds.

But its rise in club football came to prominence once the rulers of Abu Dhabi purchased Manchester City in 2008, in part as a game of \"one upmanship in the intense competition\" with Dubai, its prospering neighboring emirate, Montague highlights in his book. \"When you have states buying football clubs,\" he says -- noting the blurred line between state funds and private wealth in the region -- \"their interest is to burnish their reputations. This is a soft power issue.

Those rights appear under threat given the viewing habits of younger audiences less inclined to pay for expensive cable and satellite TV packages. The world's richest sports league, the NFL, posted a nine percent drop in viewership for most of last season, according to research analysts MoffettNathanson. SKY TV, the Premier League's main carrier in the UK, suffered a 14% fall in its live football coverage last season, according to the FT. So, while the likes of Manchester City and PSG appear immune to a fall in viewership numbers -- though perhaps not a fall in energy prices -- their competition in Europe may not be as sheltered.

The country's recent stalemate with neighboring UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia -- who have levied terror-funding accusations against the country, among other charges (all which have been vehemently denied by Qatar) -- is a prickly thorn in its quest to host the tournament without blemish. \"Ultimately, (the World Cup bid) hasn't been the positive experience I think they were hoping for,\" says Montague. \"They've been putting out fires almost since they day they won it.\"Indeed, Qatar has battled charges of manipulating the World Cup voting process -- which it has been cleared of by FIFA -- and of poor treatment of migrants building the tournament's stadiums. The country's human rights record that includes a ban on homosexuality has also been put into question.\"It's brought a magnifying glass on Qatari society that I don't think it was prepared for, and I don't think it's particularly happy about it,\" adds Montague.

The revelations are aimed at dispelling claims that a recent leap forward in Pyongyang's intercontinental missile technology may have been achieved by using designs stolen or originating from Ukraine.       \nVideo from North Korean state media purports to show the launching of an intercontinental ballistic missile.The claims are made in a report released by analysts at the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) on August 14 which says technology, possibly from Ukraine's Yuzhnoye Design Office in Dnipro, was used in recent North Korean missile tests.In July, North Korea successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) -- the KN-14 or Hwasong-14. At the time, Pyongyang claimed they were capable of carrying a \"large-sized heavy nuclear warhead\" as far as the US mainland.Read MoreUkraine has denied any link to North Korea's long-range missiles, and said Russia may instead have provided Pyongyang with the improved missile designs. Russia has denied supporting North Korea's arms program.      An officer with Ukraine's security service, who worked on the 2011 case of the two North Koreans and who we granted anonymity because of his operational role, insisted it was \"impossible\" North Korea had obtained any missile technology, as he was sure their espionage attempts had all been intercepted. He said that in 2011 two other North Koreans -- who traveled to Ukraine from the country's Moscow Embassy -- were deported after they were caught trying to obtain \"missile munitions, homing missile devices in particular for air-to-air class missiles.\" A third North Korean, tasked with transporting the actual devices out of Ukraine, was also deported. And as recently as 2015, five North Koreans were deported for \"assisting North Korea's intelligence work in Ukraine,\" the officer said, without providing further details.He said, apart from the two in jail, there were no North Koreans left in Ukraine, as those not deported by Ukraine had been voluntarily withdrawn -- many working in alternative medicine centers. The hallway to the cell where X5 is serving out his 8-year sentence in Ukraine.North Koreans guilty of espionageThe two North Korean spies seen on the grainy surveillance footage are currently serving eight-year prison sentences for espionage in the Ukrainian town of Zhytomyr, 140 kilometers (87 miles) west of Kiev. Ukrainian officials allowed CNN inside the prison facilities to see if they would grant interviews under guard supervision.     The elder inmate is a man in his fifties from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang who is known in court documents as X5. He is gaunt, compared to the fuller frame he had in the surveillance videos, and speaks lightly-accented Russian.His younger accomplice is a technical expert known as X32.They are the only such spies in Ukrainian custody, although officials say they have on several occasions intercepted North Korean attempts to access their missile secrets, and as a result in 2016 effectively barred all North Koreans from the country.The door to a cell where X5 is serving his prison term. The sting  The grainy surveillance video provided to CNN was filmed on July 27, 2011, on a hidden camera set up within a garage to capture the end of a sting operation that was months in the planning.

The design and production of the missile system was most recently held by Ukraine but, according to GlobalSecurity.org, the country ended production of the missile in 1995.The Ukraine security footage gives a rare window into the elaborate and shadowy world of North Korea's bid to improve its ability to hit the United States and other adversaries with long-range missiles.The court documents also reveal startlingly human moments during the operation.The two nervous men continually whisper to each other the material they seek is \"secret,\" and worry the flash batteries may run out on their PowerShot and Coolpix cameras as they photograph the dummy designs.Speaking briefly to CNN in the jail where he now makes cement railings and iron rods to pass prison time, X5 confirmed he had \"partially\" admitted his guilt.'X5' is seen working at a prison near Zhytomyr, Ukraine.The court papers say he insisted his job, as a trade representative in the North Korean embassy in neighboring Belarus, was merely to arrange training in missile technology for North Korean experts -- information he didn't think was classified. He even tried to get one expert, the papers allege, to travel to North Korea and teach there.Dressed in dark blue overalls and a cloth cap, mixing cement, X5 said he \"of course\" wanted to return to North Korea, and had not spoken to his family or anyone there since his arrest.\"I am serving my term of punishment. They feed us well here, we work...

This year represents Ferrari's best chance yet to end the drought, although it's hard to look past Mercedes.\"I think Lewis could win this,\" Hamilton said. \"He's on top form, the car's working well, but he's being pushed. All things being equal he should win it. But last weekend was so close -- so there's nothing in it.\"READ: Vettel: 'Best moment I can picture is winning in red' The Autodromo Nazionale Monza, north of Milan is once of F1's most famous race tracks  Vettel finished two seconds behind Hamilton in Belgium and speaking on Thursday, the German struck a quietly confident tone about Ferrari's chances at Monza before conceding that Mercedes probably have the edge. \"The form we showed in Spa was real and the speed was there in the race,\" Vettel told reporters. \"I think we've made improvements on all fronts and I'm very happy.\"The track layout suits Mercedes, so we will do our best.

It was pretty hard and it gets to a point where you're not capable of doing things properly anymore.\"I recall taking one measurement four times to remember what number I was reading. You get pretty stupid when you're tired.\"You make big decisions on the water and you need to have slept to have done that.\"JUST WATCHEDVolvo Ocean Race: The Everest of the SeasReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVolvo Ocean Race: The Everest of the Seas 22:31READ: Bullied as a kid, he conquered the worldTheurillat runs One Day -- a coaching method centered on one individual, with one coach addressing subject in one day -- and works with everyone from Olympians to paragliders and businesses.\"Normally, you have the boss and the employees,\" he explains. \"The boss normally has to think about doing the right thing, and the employees then do it. Simon has to do both.\"Being a solo sailor is a big challenge: to prepare to be alone or to relax during the night. It's not enough just to prepare the boat and the body, you have to prepare the brain.\"When we're drunk or tired, the brain doesn't have a back-up if you make mistakes. If you make mistakes, you have no way of knowing. So you need to understand at what point those mistakes come in.\"Koster estimates he will average four or five hours sleep across any 24-hour period throughout the race.For 2017, he has worked more closely with Theurillat on the water, playing out sessions while sleep deprived so the decision-making process becomes automatic when he's at the point of exhaustion during the race.The rules of the Mini Transat state that sailors are not allowed to contact the outside world.

For, do you need to steer or will autopilot do a better job, particularly if you're tired.Theurillat points out these are Koster's words and thoughts and not his own, ensuring the sailor is making as many correct decisions as possible.\"We see peak performance like a cake, there are so many layers: the boat, tactics, the body,\" says Theurillat. \"One part of that is taking time to know what you're going to do. If you start doing something without a plan, it's easier to go in the wrong direction.\"It's easy to make the right decision when sitting on the shore over a coffee. \"But not on day 10 on the water when short of food and tired. So since the first leg, we've spoken about the decisions he's made, what he'd do again and what he'd do differently.

Gisela Mettele, professor of gender history at Friedrich Schiller University Jena, and a member of the jury that helped make the decision, said: \"As different as the chosen personalities are, they have one thing in common: they were curious about the world.\"Deportation to the campsAnne Frank spent two years in hiding with her parents, sister and another Jewish family in a secret alcove at the back of her father's office in Amsterdam, nicknamed \"the Secret Annex.\" Read MoreDuring her time in hiding, she documented the rise of the Nazi party and the persecution of Jews in the diary she called \"Kitty,\" published posthumously as \"Diary of a Young Girl.\"The German secret police arrested the occupants of the Annex in August 1944; they were sent by train to a transit camp in Westerbork, then on to Auschwitz. Anne and her sister were later sent to Bergen-Belsen, where they died in February 1945. May 1944:  Jews exit a German boxcar at Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Deportees like the Franks were frequently made to purchase one-way tickets from Deutsche Reichsbahn, the state-owned German rail company, a precursor of Deutsche Bahn, which was in charge of managing the transportation of millions of Jews between the camps.

He is \"suspected of having planned and made concrete preparations for an Islamist-motivated attack,\" spokeswoman Frauke Kohler said in a news conference.His aim was to \"kill and wound as many people as possible,\" she said.The Syrian teen had researched bomb-making techniques online and had begun acquiring the necessary chemicals and materials to build an explosive device, including sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, Kohler said.Read MoreMobile phones and batteries found during a search of the suspect's home suggest that the bomb would have been triggered remotely, Kohler said.

        "content": "(CNN)Jordan Spieth's childhood friends might have dubbed him a college dropout, but his decision to initially go to university to has proved hugely influential for wannabe golfers.According to Golf Channel commentator Charlie Rymer, the US college game is \"on fire\" at the moment and that has a lot to do with Spieth.Follow @cnnsport\n\nSpieth was midway through his sophomore -- second -- year at the University of Texas when he decided to turn pro in December 2012 at the age of 19. A two-time US Junior Amateur Champion and ranked No. 1 amateur in the world at the time, Spieth has never looked back. Spieth competing at the 2011 Walker Cup one year before turning professional.Fast forward to 2017 and already Spieth has 11 PGA victories to his name, has won three of the four majors -- something only he and Jack Nicklaus achieved before their 24th birthday -- and accumulated more than $35 million in prize money, not to mention endorsements. No doubt, there are future champions in this picture. #EastLakeCup pic.twitter.com/yhqd4FJmw8\u2014 East Lake Cup (@eastlakecup) October 31, 2017\n\nRead MoreSpieth wannabesThis week's three-day tournament in Atlanta sees 40 golfers -- some of the best young men and women in the college game -- do battle at the prestigious East Lake Golf Club, which is the home of the PGA season-ending TOUR Championship.All three days are broadcast live on the Golf Channel and commentator Rymer believes that, thanks to Spieth, it is \"very, very likely\" that some of these Spieth wannabes will be competing and winning at the highest level of the game, sooner rather than later.\"There really has been a paradigm shift in the way young professionals coming out of college look at the game,\" Rymer, who himself played on the PGA Tour and regularly represented Georgia Tech at East Lake during his college days, told CNN Sport ahead of the East Lake Cup in Atlanta.\"Jordan Spieth really changed all that. He came right out of the University of Texas and started winning immediately and now all the kids coming behind him are like: 'I can do that.'\"Spieth secured his first major win at the 2015 Masters at the age of 21.There is no shortage of youngsters wanting to emulate Spieth and the world of college golf is as competitive as it ever has been. Not only do scholarships open up the possibility of making it as a professional golfer; they also provide a way of funding expensive bachelors degrees as well as allowing graduates to pursue careers in all walks of life.However, it's easier said than done to win a scholarship.Children aiming to secure scholarships at American universities have to shoot consistently low scores, drive the ball over 250 yards, get their putting stats down and enter the right tournaments just to get noticed.If that wasn't enough, they need to get the academic grades as well. Fans cheer as Jordan Spieth of the United States high-fives them during the Presidents Cup at Liberty National Golf Club.AccomplishmentsIt's not just the college golfers who have been inspired by Spieth. Even his friend of nine years Justin Thomas, who turned pro a year later, credited him with opening the door and spurring him on to achieve what he did during an incredible 2017 season. \"It's been a lot of me chasing him and his accomplishments so far,\" Thomas told CNN just before last month's TOUR Championship.Longstanding friends Thomas and Spieth have competed against each other since they were 13.READ: Jordan Spieth an 'aggressive' pranksterREAD: Tiger Woods to return after nine-month absence\"I feel like if I'm beating him in a tournament, I will then have a good chance to win. It keeps me working, it keeps me pushing to try beat him.\"Just a few days after that interview, Thomas went on to take the $10 million FedEx Cup bonus at the end of a season that yielded five victories including his first major title at the US PGA Championship. He was named PGA Tour Player of the Year barely four years after leaving Alabama State and Rymer told CNN's Don Riddell that type of success is hugely motivating for college golfers.Justin Thomas celebrates FedEx Cup win at East Lake in September.\"They gave Thomas a check for $10 million, the kids were watching that, I'm sure of that,\" said Rymer, 49, who won the US Junior Amateur Championship in 1985.\"It's certainly something that's having an impact in bringing kids to the game and also getting them ready to go out and play professional golf.\"It's a production line that bodes well for US golf, which is already in very good shape. Dustin Johnson is world No. 1 with Spieth and Thomas close behind in second and third spot respectively.The US won their seventh straight Presidents Cup in October.Brooks Koepka, the US Open Champion, and Rickie Fowler are also in the top 10 and this strength is evident in the international team competitions. The US comfortably won their first Ryder Cup in six years at Hazeltine in 2016 and Steve Stricker's Presidents Cup team destroyed the internationals at Liberty National in New Jersey, by 19 points to 11.JUST WATCHEDThe Evian Championship and Lexi ThompsonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Evian Championship and Lexi Thompson 22:31BeliefAccording to Rymer what makes Spieth stand out is his mental strength.\"Jordan thinks as well as any athlete I've ever seen in any sport. We've seen him win major championships when he clearly didn't have his A-game,\" says Rymer, referring to the 2017 Open where, after blowing a three-shot overnight lead, Spieth became the only player in history to play the last five holes of a major five-under par to secure the Claret Jug.Spieth's victory at Royal Birkdale took him to within one of the career major grand slam\"He just believes in himself as much as I've ever seen anyone believe in themselves and when a challenge comes along, it doesn't bother him. He looks at a challenge as 'let me show you how good I am,' and he goes out and gets it done.So who will be the next college golfer to emulate Spieth and Thomas and go on to win major titles at the senior level?Congratulations to Will Gordon of Vanderbilt University for winning the #EastLakeCup Men's Individual Title. pic.twitter.com/bZaBeOV3IZ\u2014 East Lake Cup (@eastlakecup) October 30, 2017\n\nCongratulations to @robynnbearr, our #EastLakeCup Women's Individual Champion. pic.twitter.com/MaybuN3rg0\u2014 East Lake Cup (@eastlakecup) October 30, 2017\n\nIf day one of the East Lake Cup is anything to go by, you should keep an eye on Vanderbilt's Will Gordon and the University of Southern California's Robynn Ree, who took the men's and women's individual stroke play titles respectively ahead of the team match play tournaments. Oregon sophomore Norman Xiong, 18, is also being talked up as a future star of the game after winning the Western Amateur title in August -- the third oldest amateur championship in golf, which boasts past winners such as Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and Phil Mickelson. Xiong, who was born in Guam and raised in Southern California, was the first Oregon player to win the Western since it was founded in 1899 and was part of the victorious 2017 US Walker Cup team. He is currently the sixth ranked amateur in the world. Brad Dalke committed to play for Oklahoma at just 12 years old. He's 20 now and perhaps most famous for beating Rory McIlroy in an arm-wrestle but his runner-up finish at the US Amateur earned him a place at both the 2017 Masters and US Open, though he didn't make the cut in either.Illinois' Nick Hardy, 21, caught the eye with a 52nd place finish at the 2015 US Open, while his college teammate Dylan Meyer, despite being hospitalized in May this year with ulcerative colitis, held his own amongst the seniors at the John Deere Classic, missing the cut by just two shots.Norman Xiong was part of the 2017 U.S. Walker Cup team that beat Great Britain and Ireland 19-7Nick Hardy finished tied 52nd at the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay.The women's line up in Atlanta is no less impressive. Ree finished two shots clear of a talented field which includes three of the world's top 10 amateurs in Stanford duo Albane Valenzuela (No. 3) and Andrea Lee (No. 5) and Arizona State's Swedish player Linnea Strom (No. 9).This could be Ree's final event at college level. She's finished in the top-10 at every tournament she's played in this year and is entered in the final stage of the LPGA Q-School, where a top-20 placing would secure her card on the professional circuit for next season. Albane Valenzuela competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics for Switzerland.Valenzuela, 19, is already Switzerland's top ranked golfer -- she represented her country at the 2016 Rio Olympics and made the cut at the US Open of the same year. Los Angeles born Andrea Lee, 18, is currently the best ranked player under 20 in the US and was the first Stanford player to be named the NCAA's women's golf Freshman of the Year.Stanford's Andrea Lee competed for the US in the 2016 Walker Cup.'Scared to death'The East Lake Cup -- now in its third year -- shifts to the team match play event on days two and three. Vanderbilt's strong showing in the men's stroke play has earned them top seeding and a semifinal showdown with Oregon; with defending champions Oklahoma up against Illinois in the other. It's Stanford against Arizona in the women's event and Northwestern against Southern California.All the action will be broadcast live on television and commentator Rymer believes that is also a factor as to why these players are not fazed by the cameras when they finally make it on to the senior tour.Charlie Rymer (right) is a former PGA professional and joined Golf Channel in 2009.\"We didn't have this opportunity when I played college golf, to come out and play on TV,\" said Rymer in an interview on the Golf Channel.\"It makes you uncomfortable, the first time you go out and you play in a big event on live TV. For me it happened to be the British Open and I was scared to death. The next time it was a little bit easier and the time after that, a little bit easier again.Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"I think it might be one of the reasons why today, when the girls get to the LPGA Tour and the guys get to the PGA Tour, they are going out and doing amazing things. \"They're not having to worry about getting comfortable in front of the cameras.\"",

        "content": "This story is based on French police documents on the investigation into the Paris attacks obtained by CNN and interviews with investigators over the last four months, as well as the public statements of Belgian and French prosecutors.  (CNN)The night that shook Paris started with three rental cars: three cars with three teams of terrorists maneuvering through the Friday evening traffic, armed with the weapons of war.A little before 9 p.m., a Renault Clio driven by Salah Abdeslam, the Paris plotter captured on March 18 in Brussels, pulled up outside the national stadium. An international soccer friendly match between France and Germany was just kicking off and 80,000 fans, including French President Francois Hollande, were already inside. Three men got out of the car and headed toward the stands. One of them -- Bilal Hadfi, a young French citizen living in Belgium -- can be seen on surveillance video speaking into a cell phone. The other two were Iraqis who had slipped into Europe weeks before by posing as refugees. One of the trio was dressed in a Bayern Munich football team jogging suit. Concealed underneath their clothes were shrapnel-filled suicide vests held together with tape.  A few miles away, a black Seat Leon weaved toward the busy cafe district of Paris. The man behind the wheel, an already notorious Belgian ISIS operative named Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was on the phone speaking to Hadfi at the stadium to make sure everything went according to plan. In the passenger seats, two of his childhood friends, Chakib Akrouh and Salah Abdeslam's older brother, Brahim, clutched their Kalashnikovs, readying themselves.   Not far away, a black Volkswagen Polo with another trio of heavily armed terrorists headed toward the Bataclan concert hall, where hundreds had gathered to hear the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal. The French ISIS fighters in the car -- Ismael Omar Mostefai, Samy Amimour and Foued Mohamed-Aggad -- had all recently been on the front lines in Syria, and were moments away from carrying out the worst massacre in the modern history of France.

A security guard at Gate R told French police that starting at 9.05 p.m., he blocked a man resembling one of the Iraqi stadium attackers four times from trying to trick his way in, according to French police documents. One eyewitness interviewed by police remembered seeing three attackers, including Salah Abdeslam, talking to one another after being refused entry into the stadium. Interrogated after his capture four months later, Abdeslam claimed he had been assigned to blow himself up at the stadium but backed out, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, who said the claim should be treated with caution. The French police reports make clear that eyewitness accounts are not always reliable and, in the case of the many interviewed after the Paris attacks, were sometimes contradictory. What is clear is that at a certain point after dropping off the stadium attackers, Salah Abdeslam drove away with his suicide vest. MORE: Six questions about Paris suspect's arrest     Explosion at the Stade de FranceAt 9:20 p.m., the first of what would be several large bangs thundered across the stadium. The Iraqi suicide bomber -- who according to the security guard had been trying to sneak in -- blew himself up outside Gate D, killing one other person. A doctored Syrian passport in the fake name of Ahmad al Mohammad would later be found near what remained of his right foot. At the moment of the first blast, Bilal Hadfi, the young Belgian member of the stadium attack team, was still on the phone with Abaaoud, the plot ringleader, who was impatiently maneuvering his Seat rental car through the traffic on Rue Bichat to get to the cafe district. Inside the car were his childhood friends Brahim Abdeslam and Chakib Akrouh. The elder Abdeslam brother had traveled from Belgium to Syria in January 2015, where like Akrouh he had joined ISIS.Face to face with a suicide bomberKalashnikov fire in the cafe districtTheir attack began at 9:25 p.m. when a car in front of Abaaoud blocked his path. Five shots were fired from the Seat Leon, killing the driver of the car.  According to some eyewitnesses, Abaaoud stopped the car in the middle of the road, turning on the blinking hazard lights. Shouting \"Allahu akbar,\" Arabic for \"God is great,\" all three terrorists then got out of the vehicle and sprayed the terrace and windows of the Cambodge and Carillon cafes with their Kalashnikovs, killing 13 people. At 9:30 p.m., a second bang was heard in the stadium. A second suicide bomber, dressed in the colors of Bayern Munich, detonated his vest outside Gate H. Fortunately, no one was killed. Hollande, the French president, would soon be evacuated from the stadium. The third suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest 20 minutes later, next to a McDonald's restaurant near the stadium, injuring over 50, including seven seriously. By the time of the second explosion at the Stade de France, the Seat Leon was at a new location. At 9:32 p.m., Abaaoud's team got out of the vehicle, again shouted \"Allahu akbar\" and opened fire at revelers at the Casa Nostra and Bonne Biere cafes near the Place de la Republique, killing five. One of the surviving eyewitnesses noticed one of the shooters was wearing orange sneakers, Abaaoud's footwear selection that night.

At 9:36 p.m., the cafe killers opened fire on La Belle Equipe cafe, killing 19. As at the other cafes, most of those who lost their lives were sitting on the outdoor terraces. Eyewitnesses later recalled the gunmen did not speak to each other as they calmly sprayed the cafes and cars traveling down the road with bullets. The car again sped off to a new location. At 9:40 p.m., Abaaoud dropped off Brahim Abdeslam at the Comptoir Voltaire cafe. According to eyewitnesses interviewed by police, he was wearing a hooded jacket over several layers of clothing when he brusquely entered the covered interior terrace of the establishment. He smiled at the other patrons, apologized for interrupting their dinner, then blew himself up. Their killing done for the night, Abaaoud and Akrouh drove up toward the Montreuil suburb of Paris, where they would abandon the car.The Bataclan attack: 'We're starting'At around 9:40 p.m., Bataclan attackers Ismael Omar Mostefai, Samy Amimour and Foued Mohamed-Aggad parked their Volkswagen Polo in front of the concert hall. At 9:42 p.m., one of them took out a Samsung smartphone and sent a last text to a cell phone located in Brussels: \"We're getting going; we're starting.\" They then tossed the Samsung phone into a garbage can near the entrance of the Bataclan. The phone was later recovered and has provided key information to investigators. They believe one of the men who received the text message in Belgium outranked Abaaoud in the Paris attack conspiracy. He has been identified as Mohammed Belkaid, an Algerian confectioner turned ISIS operative who was killed on March 15 in Brussels. Investigators believe he was the overall commander of the ISIS cell behind the Paris attacks as well as the attacks that shook Belgium five months later.Investigators believe Belkaid was being assisted in Brussels on the night of the Paris attacks by Najim Laachraoui, the cell's suspected bomb-maker, who went to Syria in February 2013 and returned to Belgium using a fake identity. On March 22, 2016, Laachraoui was one of two suicide bombers who detonated suitcase bombs at the Brussels airport.  MORE: New Paris attacks suspect namedIn total, 21 phone calls and two text messages were exchanged between the Samsung phone and the cell phone geolocated in Belgium after the latter phone went active, 24 hours before the Paris attack.Investigators believe Belkaid and Laachraoui provided direction to the Paris attackers from Brussels before, during and after the night of the attacks, using multiple cell phones. According to French police reports obtained and viewed by CNN, the second of those cell phones, geolocated in precisely the same area in Belgium as the first, was communicating with Hadfi at the stadium and with Abaaoud's cafe team as the attacks unfolded, suggesting the attack was being coordinated in real time from Brussels.The encryption appSeveral hours earlier, at 2:14 p.m., the Bataclan attackers had downloaded the encryption messaging app Telegram onto their Samsung smart phone, according to police reports. No recovered content from the messaging app is mentioned in the French police documents, suggesting there were likely communications by the Bataclan attackers that will never be recovered.

At 4:39 p.m. on November 13, one of the attackers downloaded detailed floor plans of the Bataclan venue onto the Samsung phone and conducted online searches for the American rock band playing there that night, the Eagles of Death Metal.Almost all of the 89 people killed inside the Bataclan lost their lives during the first 20 minutes of the attack. The gunmen first killed three people on the sidewalk outside the concert hall, then entered and moved to the floor area of the venue, peppering the concertgoers with automatic fire, while shouting \"Allahu akbar.\" Inside the BataclanAs one fired his weapon, the other reloaded so they could kill as efficiently as possible. Researching the floor plans appears to have paid off for the perpetrators. As some of those inside tried to escape through an emergency exit, they found a third terrorist waiting for them on the other side, according to the French police documents. According to the eyewitnesses cited in the French police documents, the attackers spoke perfect French, taunting those lying wounded on the floor of the concert hall by saying, \"Anybody who moves, I'm going to kill.\" 'Where are those Yanks?'After the initial wave of killing, the gunmen stopped and asked each other \"Where is the singer? Where are those Yanks? It's an American group, you're bombing us with the Americans, so we're going to hit the Americans and you,\" according to an eyewitness cited in the police documents.   The terrorists then addressed those fighting for their lives on the floor, telling them they had been dispatched from Syria by ISIS to carry out the attack to avenge French airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

According to police documents cited by Le Monde, when the other two terrorists opened fire on the police officers from above, they were forced to retreat.The two surviving terrorists, Mostefai and Aggad, then took some of the surviving hostages, and according to documents cited by Le Monde, herded them to an L-shaped corridor deeper inside the building. According to police documents obtained by CNN, by then the terrorists had seized several cell phones from concertgoers to try to access the Internet but could not find a signal. Hostage rescueBy 10:45 p.m., France's rapid response commandos, a unit known as RAID, were on the scene. According to the French police documents obtained by CNN, they started communicating with the hostage-takers from outside the corridor via cell phone. The terrorists threatened to start executing their prisoners unless they received a signed paper promising that France would leave Muslim lands.At around that time,  Abaaoud, the Paris team leader, was spotted by a witness outside the Bataclan concert hall, apparently barking orders into a hands-free cell phone to the two surviving terrorists inside. Investigators later traced the cell phone he was using that night to the area outside the Bataclan. After abandoning the Seat Leon in Montreuil, he had ridden the metro back into the center of town to coordinate the final phase of the attack. Just after midnight, the RAID commandos stormed the corridor, rescuing all the hostages alive. According to eyewit",

Follow @cnnsport\n\nIn all the sport's 68-year history only Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost, Michael Schumacher, Sebastian Vettel and now Hamilton have achieved such high status. For Hamilton, the moment had added historical significance, as he overtook racing legend Jackie Stewart to become the most successful British driver of all time.\"This year I think Lewis has come of age,\" Stewart, who won the world title in 1969, 1971 and 1973, told CNN. In the second part of the season he has shown a considerable maturityJackie Stewart, three-time F1 world championRead More\"In the second part of the season he has shown a considerable maturity which was not particularly obvious on some occasions before and he's driven extremely well -- he should be very proud of himself,\" Stewart told CNN. Lewis Hamilton celebrates at the Mexican Grand Prix after winning a fourth F1 drivers' title.'At ease within his own skin'Stewart and many others around the F1 paddock had quietly questioned whether Hamilton ever would cultivate a more measured demeanor after raising eyebrows with some of his antics off track.Last year's Japanese Grand Prix highlighted those reservations when Hamilton, who was involved in a bitter title battle with then teammate Nico Rosberg, played around on his phone during the pre-race press conference and then refused to speak to the media two days later.

That's what he was prone to do. What we've seen this year is that he is so at ease within his own skin, finally. That's the impression you get.\"If we'd had this conversation a year ago I would have said you can't compare him, he's not there yet. He's won three championships which is great -- hats off, respect -- but he's not quite the full deal, But now he is.\"He's definitely worthy of being up in the top five,\" Hamilton said. \"I'm not going to choose who's better but you are talking about the Stewart, Jim Clark, Prost, Senna and Schumacher.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)Spain's state prosecutor is seeking charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds against Catalan leaders involved in the region's disputed independence bid that has thrown the country into political turmoil.The prosecutor, Jose Manuel Maza, said a range of senior Catalan figures, including deposed President Carles Puigdemont and all members of his former cabinet, would face court after the Catalan parliament voted to issue a unilateral declaration of independence last week.The leaders could face lengthy jail terms if charged and convicted. Rebellion, sedition and misuse of funds carry maximum terms of 30, 15 and six years, respectively. Spanish media reported that Puigdemont and several members of his sacked government had left the country and were now in the Belgian capital, Brussels. His spokesperson told CNN he did not know of his whereabouts.Belgium's migration minister Theo Francken told reporters this week that his country would be legally required to consider Puigdemont's request for political asylum if he made one. Carles Puigdemont making a statement in Barcelona last week. Read MorePuigdemont did not attend a meeting of his Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) in Barcelona on Monday morning, nor was he seen at the Catalan government's headquarters. Maza said the Catalan leaders had \"created an institutional crisis that culminated with the declaration of unilateral independence, with total disregard for our Constitution.\" He said his office had filed documents with the High Court and Supreme Court, which will consider the charges.A document laying out the charges says that several of the leaders had misused public funds by holding an independence referendum on October 1, which it described as illegal. Catalan leaders have argued that there is no legal way to give their people a choice on secession.Madrid's control testedThe announcement came as civil servants in Catalonia returned to work under the Spanish government's control, following the week of political upheaval.Madrid suspended the region's autonomy and imposed direct rule after the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence on Friday in Barcelona.     Civil servants, including some who supported the independence bid, appeared to obey Madrid's orders by carrying on as usual in their jobs. Ministers who had been removed from their positions stayed away from work, leaving the Catalan Government's headquarters quiet Monday. The parliament's speaker, Carme Forcadell, said on Twitter that she would show up for work, as expected by Madrid, to oversee the transition of power until the December vote. \"We continue working,\" she wrote. Forcadell is among the leaders targeted by the state prosecutor. Local armed police guarded the entrance to the government's headquarters in Barcelona, in a sign that local security forces were working as normal. The two chiefs of the Catalan police were among those dismissed by Madrid.Catalan police were seen guarding the entrance of the Catalan government's headquarters in Barcelona on October 30, 2017.The Catalan Police Prefecture circulated a letter over the weekend asking the local police force, the  the Mossos d'Esquadra, to remain neutral.Puigdemont's next moveIt was unclear what Puigdemont's next moves would be. Taking control of Catalonia on Friday, Madrid dismissed the regional government, dissolved parliament and called new elections for December 21.Puigdemont's party, as well as the pro-independence Republican Left, have both said they will take part in the election. Before charges were filed against, him the Spanish government said Puigdemont would be eligible to stand.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here, what comes nextSpeaking at the weekend from his hometown of Girona, Puigdemont said that he still intended to build an independent country. He called on Catalans to opposed Madrid's rule in a democratic, peaceful fashion.Before the prosecutor's announcement, Puigdemont posted a photograph on social media Monday that had been taken from inside the Catalan government's building with the caption, \"Good morning\" in Catalan and a smiley face. The photo had been clearly taken on a previous day and there was no sign that had entered the building on Monday, causing confusion over his whereabouts.     Bon dia \ud83d\ude0a A post shared by Carles Puigdemont (@carlespuigdemont) on Oct 29, 2017 at 11:39pm PDT\nDeep divisionsSpain was plunged into it worst political crisis since the restoration of democracy in the 1970s  after Catalonia held the independence referendum on October 1, which Madrid and the country's top court called illegal. Puigdemont said that the vote gave him a mandate to declare independence. Some 90% voted in favor of independence in the disputed referendum earlier this month, but turnout was only 43%.A new poll suggests that political parties backing independence would not win a majority if elections were held today. Pro-independence parties would get 61 to 65 seats in the region's parliament, short of a majority in the 135-seat assembly, the Sigma Dos poll suggests. The poll was published Sunday in El Mundo, which has run editorials opposing independence. Pro-independence parties had 72 seats in the parliament before it was dissolved. The poll of 1,000 people in Catalonia was conducted by telephone on October 23 to 26, before the Catalan parliament voted to declare independence.

His symptoms were mild at first but got progressively worse. \"I just thought it was me getting old,\" Elliot, 29, tells CNN's Judo World at the GB Judo Centre of Excellence in Walsall, near Birmingham in the United Kingdom.JUST WATCHEDLegends of judo: Yasuhiro YamashitaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegends of judo: Yasuhiro Yamashita 01:10READ: Israeli stars wins gold in UAE; officials don't play anthemRead MoreThe diagnosis came not long after Stewart had moved his family back to the UK from Hong Kong, where he had spent six years in semi-retirement establishing himself as a judo coach and forming his own judo club. He returned to Britain still with the dream of having one last shot at emulating his father and competing at an Olympics.After Stewart's sight rapidly deteriorated at the start of 2017 he needed an emergency operation to prevent him losing his vision altogether.His family, including his dad and his younger brother, Max Stewart, who is also a GB judoka, helped him pay for the procedure.

The opticians classified him as a B3 competitor, which is the most able-bodied you can be as a VI judoka, with B1 being totally blind.It meant he could get back into full-time training at the Centre of Excellence alongside the able-bodied athletes and under the guidance of his father who coaches there. \"Judo means everything to me.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of anti-independence protesters rallied in the Catalan capital of Barcelona on Sunday after Madrid took unprecedented measures to quash the region's bid to split from Spain.The protest comes as tensions spiked following the Catalan Parliament's vote Friday to declare unilateral independence.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here, what comes nextIn a sea of red-and-yellow Spanish and Catalan flags, protesters marched down Barcelona's Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia shopping strip, some chanting for the imprisonment of deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who led the divisive independence drive. Barcelona police say around 300,000 people attended. Puigdemont has urged his supporters to pursue \"democratic opposition\" to the moves by Madrid, which have included dissolving the region's government and calling snap elections for December 21.It was unclear on Sunday what that opposition would mean in practice. The sacked head of the Catalan police force urged officers to follow the orders of the new commanders, but there were signs that some civil servants would refuse to obey Madrid.Anti-independence protesters in Barcelona on Sunday holding Spanish flags, as well as others that say \"together.\"Read More'Democratic opposition'Puigdemont made a public statement on Saturday from his home town of Girona, apparently designed to give the impression that he was still in power.\"Let's move forward with the only winning attitude -- without violence, insults, in a very inclusive way, respecting opinions and symbols and protests by other people who are against what the parliamentary majority decided,\" he said.\"I ask you to have patience, perseverance and perspective.\"He added that the best way to defend the progress made so far was to oppose Article 155, the constitutional provision that Madrid employed to impose direct rule.The Spanish government on Saturday also confirmed that Puigdemont would be eligible to run again for President. But at the same time, Madrid has threatened to have the suspended leader charged for \"rebellion,\" which carries a maximum 30-year jail term.     Deeply dividedSpanish government spokesperson Inigo Mendez de Vigo said Saturday that Puigdemont's bid for independence had \"ended.\" In a recorded interview distributed by Reuters, Mendez de Vigo said: \"It looks as if they proclaimed the republic of Catalonia, but 24 hours after, who has recognized it? No one, that's it.\" Mendez de Vigo said that because Puigdemont was removed from office, he had no powers or financial means. \"If he wants to continue in politics, which is his right, he should prepare for the next elections and exercise his democratic opposition.\" The spokesperson added that by fresh elections would give Catalans an opportunity to be heard \"in a legal and free way.\" \"This is a way to tell to Catalans, if you want to vote, do it under the conditions of the law and freely.\"Paco, left, and Emilio in Barcelona on Sunday say Catalonia has been taken over by irresponsible anti-democratic forces.But if Puigdemont runs again and wins the next election, he will no doubt take his victory as a mandate to pursue independence. The secessionist movement has deeply divided Catalonia, one of Spain's wealthiest regions. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the independence vote in the Catalan Parliament. And in the past month, tens of thousands of people have protested in rallies, both in favor and against independence. Moises Santos, 37, said he feared the independence bid would cause problems for the Catalan people for years to come. At Sunday's rally, 37-year-old Moises Santos, who lives near Barcelona, said he saw the Catalan Parliament's vote Friday as invalid and blamed the independence agenda for dividing people in the region. \"It's not a real independence declaration because half the Parliament was out of the Parliament. So they are breaking society,\" he said. \"I think it's 50-50. Society is breaking in two parts.\"More than 2.25 million people turned out to vote in the October 1 referendum, ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court. Catalan authorities said 90% of voters favored a split. But the turnout was low -- around 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the referendum.Police and forceBefore its autonomy was suspended, Catalonia had been granted sweeping powers of its region. Key among them was the right for Catalonia to its own police force, known as the Mossos.  But on Saturday, Madrid sacked the region's two police chiefs, and the Mossos has called on it officers to stay neutral in the political upheaval. JUST WATCHEDCatalonians celebrate independence declarationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonians celebrate independence declaration 01:21The police response to Sunday's protest is being seen as a litmus test of that neutrality.In an internal document, whose authenticity was also confirmed to CNN by the Mossos, the dismissed director general of the Catalan police, Pere Soler, said his officers were being treated in an \"extraordinarily unjust manner.\" There were being \"falsely accused\" of a lack of preparation ahead of the controversial referendum, adding that the actions of the Mossos' officers \"were more efficient without injuring anyone in any case.\"Police sent into the region by Madrid were widely criticized for an excessive use of force during the vote. In an attempt to shut it down, police fired rubber bullets and protesters and were seen pulling voters from polling stations by their hair and restraining elderly voters.In another letter circulated within Mossos, Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero spoke of his \"sadness\" over his dismissal as Mossos chief, but called on the force to go on doing its job.\"You have to keep on building the future. The commanders who take over will help you do that, and I ask you to do what you always did, to be loyal and understanding with their decisions,\" he said.Trapero already faced charges of sedition over his force's actions in the run-up to Catalonia's banned referendum.Trapero's deputy, Ferr\u00e1n Lopez, has been appointed to head the Catalan force in his place, under the authority of the Spanish Interior Ministry.CNN's Claudia Rebaza, Phil Black and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

Rajoy spoke hours after the Catalan Parliament voted by 70 to 10 to \"form the Catalan Republic as an independent and sovereign state.\" Read MoreThe day's dramatic and fast-moving events pushed Spain into uncharted territory, testing the limits of the constitution drawn up after the restoration of democracy in the 1970s.Dramatic scenes in BarcelonaThe stage was set when separatists in the Catalan Parliament tabled a motion to declare independence from Spain, arguing that a disputed referendum on October 1 gave them a mandate to split from Madrid.Supporters of independence gather outside the Catalan Parliament in Barcelona.After a heated debate, opposition parties walked out of the 135-seat chamber before the vote, some leaving Catalan and Spanish flags on their empty seats.Pro-independence crowds massed outside the Parliament cheered, jumped up and down, and waved flags, including the Catalan separatist \"Estelada\" flag, as the independence result was announced.    Visca Catalunya Lliure! #mambo #welcometothecatalanrepublic A post shared by Adri\u00e0 Mateus (@ams.adri) on Oct 27, 2017 at 6:38am PDT\nLess than an hour later, the Spanish Senate granted the Madrid government powers under Article 155 of the Constitution to sack the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his ministers. Rajoy, who has pledged to quash the separatists, called a Cabinet meeting to agree on the measures he would take.\"Spain is a serious country, a great nation and we will not allow some people to blow up our Constitution,\" Rajoy told journalists in Madrid.Urging Spanish citizens to remain calm, he announced that Puigdemont and his ministers would be dismissed, and new elections in Catalonia would be held on December 21.Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has vowed to crush the Catalan independence bid.The office of Spain's prosecutor general meanwhile confirmed it would file a lawsuit for rebellion against Puigdemont, the Catalan government and the members of the parliament board who voted in favor of independence.It was unclear on Friday how the Spanish government would enforce the measures announced by Rajoy. A tough crackdown could risk a repeat of the violent scenes that played out in Catalonia on October 1, the day of the referendum.But it seemed unlikely that members of the Catalan government who have fought so hard for independence for years would simply acquiesce to Spanish government forces. Another question was how the local Catalan police force would react if national forces were deployed to the streets of Barcelona.Puigdemont: 'Stay strong'Speaking in the Catalan Parliament building after the landmark vote, Puigdemont said legitimately elected lawmakers had cast their ballots according to a mandate earned in the October 1 referendum.But he acknowledged that the path ahead would not be easy. \"We are facing a period in which we will need to stay strong and in peace, dignified and civil as we have always been, and I'm sure we will keep being so,\" he said.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont casts his vote for independence from Spain on Friday.\n \"The institutions and the people together built nations, societies, and a nation cannot be built without one of these elements.\"Supporters followed his words with applause and repeated chants of \"freedom, freedom.\" International reactionThe European Union has backed Madrid in its handling of the crisis, which Rajoy has insisted is an internal matter.For EU nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor. I hope the Spanish government favours force of argument, not argument of force.\u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) October 27, 2017\n\nFollowing the Catalan Parliament's vote, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted: \"For EU nothing changes. Spain remains our only interlocutor. I hope the Spanish government favours force of argument, not argument of force.\"Puigdemont responded via Twitter: \"Catalans always favour the force of arguments.\"The UK and Germany, through government spokesmen, said they would not recognize Catalonia's independence declaration. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said his nation does not recognize the declaration of independence.\"France wishes Spain to be strong and united. It only maintains one partner, which is the Madrid government. The constitution of Spain must be respected,\" Le Drian said in a statement. The United States also voiced its support for the Madrid government.\"Catalonia is an integral part of Spain, and the United States supports the Spanish government's constitutional measures to keep Spain strong and united,\" US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.How did we get here?Several times during its history, Catalonia has found itself caught between the rivalries of France and Spain.The region industrialized before the rest of Spain and had strong anarchist, socialist and communist movements that all fought against Gen. Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s.The current dispute goes back to that conflict. Franco repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy, and in the early years of the dictatorship at least, expressions of Catalan language and culture. Four years after Franco's 1975 death, the region regained some of that autonomy.In 2006, Madrid backed Catalonia's calls for even greater powers, granting it \"nation\" status and financial control. But four years later, the Constitutional Court rescinded that status, ruling that while Catalan is a \"nationality,\" Catalonia itself is not a nation.One of Spain's 17 autonomous provinces, Catalonia has had its own regional government with considerable powers over health care, education and tax collection. But it pays taxes to Madrid, and pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair to wealthier areas, something that has helped stoke resentment.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)The Spanish government has taken its first steps to impose direct rule on Catalonia, firing its police chief and nominating the deputy prime minister to take control of the region in an unprecedented effort to quash its attempts at secession.A day after the Catalan parliament defied Madrid and voted for a unilateral declaration of independence, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy issued a decree that confirmed the sacking of Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, head of the regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra. Trapero already faced charges of sedition over his force's actions in the run-up to Catalonia's banned October 1 independence referendum. The director general of the Catalan police, Pere Soler, was also dismissed.On Friday Rajoy dismissed Catalonia's president and cabinet, dissolved its parliament and called new elections for December 21 as part of a drastic package of measures to seize control of the renegade administration in Barcelona. JUST WATCHEDCatalonians celebrate independence declarationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonians celebrate independence declaration 01:21Rajoy appointed his Deputy Prime Minister, Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, to take charge of Catalonia's government.Read MoreIt remains unclear how the Spanish government will enforce the measures announced by Rajoy. A tough crackdown could risk a repeat of the violent scenes that played out in Catalonia on October 1, the day of the disputed referendum, when national police were brought in.Much also depends on whether Catalonia's deposed leaders give up their power willingly, and whether the thousands of civil servants in the region carry out orders issued by Madrid.In a televised address Saturday, dismissed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont appealed for Catalan citizens to remain peaceful and use \"democratic opposition\" to advance their cause.\"Let's move forward with the only winning attitude -- without violence, insults, in a very inclusive way, respecting opinions and symbols and protests by other people who are against what the parliamentary majority decided,\" he said.\"I ask you to have patience, perseverance and perspective. The best way to defend the point we have reached now is the democratic opposition to Article 155,\" he added, referring to the constitutional provision which allowed Madrid to impose direct rule.Catalan police: Remain neutralThe Catalan Police Prefecture circulated a letter internally asking the Mossos to remain neutral as events unfold.\"We must remember that in each and every one of our interventions, we are acting as representatives of the institution we serve and not as individuals. Consequently, the principle of neutrality must always be upheld,\" said the letter, whose authenticity was confirmed to CNN by the Mossos. If demonstrations bring those with opposing views into conflict, the force's responsibility \"is to guarantee everyone's safety and to prevent any incidents from happening,\" the letter said, adding that mediation was the best tool.Protesters with Catalan separatist flags celebrate in Barcelona on Friday.In a separate internal document, whose authenticity was also confirmed to CNN by the Mossos, Soler said the Catalan police force was being treated in an \"extraordinarily unjust manner.\" Soler said the Catalan police were being \"falsely accused\" of a lack of preparation ahead of the controversial referendum, adding that the actions of the Mossos' officers \"were more efficient without injuring anyone in any case.\"In another letter circulated within Mossos, which confirmed its authenticity, Trapero spoke of his \"sadness\" over his dismissal but called on the force to go on doing its job.\"You have to keep on building the future. The commanders who take over will help you do that, and I ask you to do what you always did, to be loyal and understanding with their decisions,\" he said. Trapero's deputy, Ferr\u00e1n Lopez, has been appointed to head the Catalan force in his place, under the authority of the Spanish Interior Ministry.Dismissed Catalan police chief Josep Luis Trapero, pictured on October 16, is accused of sedition.The Spanish government's moves came hours after the Catalan Parliament voted to \"form the Catalan Republic as an independent and sovereign state.\" Opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote.There were wild celebrations in the streets of Barcelona, the regional capital, by those who back secession on Friday night. Rival demonstrations into the night were held by those who favor unity with Spain.The secessionist movement has deeply divided Catalonia, one of Spain's wealthiest regions. Some 90% voted in favor of independence in the disputed referendum, but turnout was only 43%.Anti-independence demonstrators gathered in Madrid on Saturday to call for unity. Many held Spanish flags aloft, while others carried placards saying \"No to the coup!\" or calling for Puigdemont to go to prison.People hold signs reading \"No to the coup\" while waving Spanish flags during a demonstration urging unity in Madrid on Saturday.Appeal for calmBoth the Spanish government and Catalan leaders have appealed for calm amid heightened tensions on both sides. The front pages of national and regional Catalan newspapers on Saturday illustrated the depth of the divisions.The headline on Catalan daily El Punt Avui declared \"Hello Republic,\" with images of celebrating crowds outside the Catalan Parliament and the motion for independence approved by its lawmakers. Another Catalan daily, Ara, had the headline \"The Republic, proclaimed, the government, sacked.\"Hola, Rep\u00fablica!!!

Article 155 has never before been used.Earlier, Puigdemont said legitimately elected lawmakers had cast their ballots according to a mandate earned in the October 1 referendum.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont casts his vote for independence from Spain on Friday.\n How did we get here?The dispute is Spain's worst political crisis since democracy was restored in the 1970s. It was triggered by the decision of Catalonia's political leaders to push ahead with the October 1 independence referendum, even after it was banned by Spain's highest court.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here, what comes nextThe plebiscite was the culmination of a yearslong effort by secessionists in Catalonia, which has its own distinct culture and language.Despite calls for dialogue, the opposing sides have been at loggerheads since the vote, with neither apparently willing to give way.After Puigdemont declined to clarify to Madrid whether he had declared independence following the referendum, the Spanish government pushed ahead with plans to impose direct rule under Article 155. Two leading figures in the secessionist movement, Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart, were also detained on sedition charges.The standoff culminated in Friday's dramatic events. But Spain and Catalonia now enter uncharted territory.The European Union has made it clear that it does not support the move, fearing breakaway movements in other member states. In any case, under EU rules, Catalonia would not be a member of the EU on its own, and would have to apply for membership from outside the bloc.Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States issued statements saying they would not recognize the independence of Catalonia.CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Barcelona and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

First there was the calamitous start to September's Singapore Grand Prix where Raikkonen and Vettel crashed into one another. Two races later, there were red faces when a spark plug failure ended Vettel's race after four laps in Japan.The embarrassment has been magnified by Hamilton's near faultless form which has yielded 143 points from a possible 150 in the second half of the season.

Implying that it wasn't the much-fabled \"Liverpool Way.\"However, Souness says the way Liverpool won during their most successful spell in the 70s and 80s, was based on a solid defence and a midfield that was hard to break through. Success was built from the back.The 1978-79 Liverpool team that Souness played in is the best example of this, keeping a remarkable 28 clean sheets out of a possible 42 league games and conceding only 16 goals during the campaign, four at Anfield.  \"I don't think the [Liverpool Way] was any special way of playing football,\" Souness explains.\"You have to be able to adapt, no game is the same.\"What we could do -- you have to remember the state of the pitches going back to the 80s -- we could go somewhere on a Saturday where it was a ploughed field because of the bad weather and we'd have to fight to win the three points.\"Then midweek we might be going to Bayern Munich on a very nice surface,\" he says.\"We could wear two hats.

Tiger Woods had pain, anxiety, sleep drugs in system during arrest Completion of the program does not expunge the defendant's record.

        "content": "Barcelona, Spain (CNN)The Catalan leader's high-wire bid for independence from Spain faltered on Thursday when he backed away from a plan to call new elections amid disagreement within his own party.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said he had considered the option of dissolving the regional Parliament and calling new elections, in what appeared to be a last-ditch effort to stop Madrid from taking control of the region.But in a public statement in Barcelona, the regional capital, Puigdemont rejected the idea, apparently because he could not obtain guarantees from the central government that it would not press ahead with a plan to impose direct rule on the region. \"My obligation and responsibility is to explore all the possibilities, absolutely all of them, to find a solution through dialogue, an agreed solution, to a political conflict that is of a democratic nature,\" he said.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont making his statement on Thursday in Barcelona.At a heated meeting of the Catalan Parliament on Thursday evening, MPs struggled to find a way forward. Read MoreInes Arrimadas, leader of the liberal Ciutadans Party, blasted Puidgemont, saying that it was not too late to call for elections while blaming him for dividing the Catalonian public. \"We are losing international legitimacy and you can't do that to Catalans,\" Arrimadas said. Llu\u00eds Rabell, leader of the Catalan arm of the left-wing Podemos party, said it was time to give up on the unilateral declaration of independence. \"Catalonia does not need more martyrs,\" he said.Madrid has scheduled a vote in the Spanish Senate for Friday, in which members will decide whether to suspend Catalonia's autonomy and put it under Madrid's control. Puigdemont's announcement came after a day of confusion in Barcelona. Puigdemont delayed the statement after two MPs in his Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) said they were unhappy with the plans for new elections.\"I respect the decision, but I do not share it,\" MP Albert Batalla said on Twitter, after a Catalan newspaper said Puigdemont was on the verge of calling elections. \"Today I renounce as an MP and I give up my membership at the @Pdemocratacat,\" he wrote.Another MP, Jordi Cuminal, did the same. \"I do not share the decision of calling for elections. I resign from my seat as MP and I give up my membership at the @Pdemocratacat,\" he tweeted.It was unclear whether the two MPs would reverse their decision in the light of Puigdemont's later announcement.In his speech, Puigdemont said he was willing to call for an early election as long as he had \"certain guarantees\" surrounding the vote. He did not specify from whom he sought the guarantees, but he appeared to be alluding to Madrid. \"But there were no such guarantees that would justify me today calling for an election,\" he said.Catalonia's independence standoff: How we got here and what comes nextSpain was plunged into its worst political crisis in decades on October 1, when Catalonia held an independence referendum, and Catalan and Spanish leaders in Madrid have been in political deadlock ever since. Madrid slammed the referendum as illegal, but Catalan leaders took its results as a mandate to declare a split from the country.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has threatened for weeks to impose direct rule on Catalonia as a way to quash Puigdemont's plan to declare independence. He said Madrid had prepared all the documents to employ the never-before-used Article 155 of the country's Constitution. More than 2.25 million people turned out to vote in the October 1 referendum, ruled illegal by Spain's consitutional court. Catalan authorities said 90% of voters favored a split. But the turnout was low -- around 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the referendum.CNN's Claudia Rebaza and journalist Elena Gyldenkerne reported from Barcelona.

He was also required to pay a fine. The public prosecutor's office appealed the case, hoping to get a heavier sentence and force the man to serve some actual jail time.But the judges on the court of appeals in Porto refused to impose a stiffer sentence on the man.

        "content": "Istanbul (CNN)Eleven activists have gone on trial for terror offenses in Turkey -- including two local Amnesty International chiefs and two foreigners -- as the country continues with a purge that has gutted institutions in all areas of public life.Turkey has detained tens of thousands of people, including journalists, activists and opposition political figures, following an attempted military coup last year. The activists are accused of aiding three groups that Turkey describes as \"armed terrorist organizations\" and could face up to 15 years in prison. Amnesty International slammed the allegations as \"entirely baseless.\"\"From the moment of their detentions, it has been clear that these are politically motivated prosecutions aimed at silencing critical voices within Turkey,\" Amnesty International's Europe director, John Dalhuisen, said in a statement.  Read MoreDozens of protesters gathered outside the courthouse to support the activists and called for their release.Protesters called for the release of the 11 activists outside the Istanbul courthouse on Wednesday.Ten of the activists -- including Amnesty's Turkey director, \u0130dil Eser -- were arrested in a police raid on July 5 in Istanbul while attending a workshop on wellbeing and digital security, Amnesty said. The 11th is Amnesty's Turkey chair, Taner K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, who was arrested a month earlier and is being tried in an additional case. Among the 11 are German citizen Peter Frank Steudtner, a non-violence and wellbeing trainer, and Swedish citizen Ali Gharavi, an IT strategy consultant, who join dozens of other foreign nationals detained in Turkey's purge.The indictment alleges that the workshop was an unauthorized meeting at which the activists were orchestrating an uprising. It also alleged that the cybersecurity techniques they discussed -- such as securing information in mobile phones if the devices are seized by police and how to encrypt information -- conformed \"to secrecy rules of terrorist organizations.\"Amnesty called on the judge to throw out the case. \"Without substance or foundation the Turkish authorities have tried and failed to build a case against \u0130dil, Taner and the other nine human-rights activists. It took the prosecutor more than three months to come up with nothing. It should not take the judge more than half an hour to dismiss the case against them,\" Amnesty said.The rights group said that the 11 activists were carrying out standard human-rights protection activities, such as \"appealing to stop the sale of tear gas, making a grant application and campaigning for the release of hunger-striking teachers.\"ByLock app controversyThe activists are accused of aiding the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) -- which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US and the EU -- and FETO, a term used by the Turkish government to describe supporters of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen lives in exile in the US and Turkey blames him for orchestrating the attempted coup, which he has denied.K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 is also accused in a separate case of being a member of FETO. If he is convicted, he could face 17\u00bd years in prison.In that case, prosecutors' evidence against K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 centers around his alleged downloading of ByLock, a widely available phone app used for encrypted messaging that the indictment says is also used by Gulen supporters.Amnesty said it had commissioned two independent forensic analyses of Taner's phone that found no trace of Bylock on the device.Wednesday's trial, and several other cases, have caused concern in the West over the erosion of civil liberties in the country under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule. Erdogan spearheaded a vote this year on constitutional change that granted him sweeping new powers that could cement his leadership until 2029.He has overseen the extension of the country's state of emergency several times, which has allowed Ankara and the courts to continue with a crackdown that has transformed media organizations, rights groups and the country's educational institutions.",

Crews can also contain seven women and one or two men, or five men and five women, or 11 women.It's a change that initially didn't go down well with one of the race competitors.Rival skipper David Witt, of Hong Kong-based entry SHK Scallywag, vowed to buck the trend of the other six teams and take just seven men and no women, saying: \"It's hard enough to win the race, the last thing we need is to be part of a social experiment.\"However, the veteran Australian skipper has since relented and drafted in Dutchwoman Annemieke Bes to bolster his crew.JUST WATCHEDBlair Tuke's pursuit of historyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBlair Tuke's pursuit of history 03:04READ: Giving it all up to sail around the world'Initial hump'The argument for more sailors is down to rest and recovery times and increased muscle for physically demanding maneuvers such as sail changes.For Caffari, a mixed crew makes complete sense.\"Most boardrooms are not male-only or female-only, they're very mixed to produce high-performance teams. My argument was, what's the difference?\" she says.\"What it will achieve, finally, because it's still an unbelievably male-dominated sport, is it will get us over that initial hump where professional male sailors realize it's not that bad. Going forward it will be more acceptable and won't be such a 'thing.' \"You're a sailor on the boat because of your ability rather than what gender you are.\"Practicing on board Turn the Tide on Plastic. READ: People think we're crazy, says around-the-world sailorThe 44-year-old Caffari was the first woman to have sailed single-handed around the world in both directions -- including the 2009 Vendee Globe -- and the only woman to have raced non-stop around the world three times.She sailed on the all-female Team SCA in the last edition of the Volvo Ocean Race in 2014/2015, her fifth circumnavigation, but has also sailed extensively with mixed crews.\"The conversation is a little cleaner, maybe a bit more polite -- but only at times. Girls can often be worse than the guys. It brings out the better side of people,\" she says.\"That interaction of having the mix is a healthier environment.\"Battered hands after eight days of the Volvo Ocean Race in 2015.In Caffari's experience, gender is unrelated to how individuals cope when the pressure is on during an ocean race. \"Someone who is tired, and nice and warm in their bunk and you want them to go out where it's wet and cold, they're all pretty miserable,\" she says.\"Either you're a person that can be woken up four times a day or you're not. I think whether you're male or female is irrelevant.\"Ian Walker sighs as he is about to put on wet weather gear for another watch on deck during the 2015 race.'Massive responsibility'The bulk of Caffari's crew, including British America's Cup sailor Bleddyn Mon, has never been to the treacherous Southern Ocean -- with its howling winds, huge seas and icebergs -- which features in three of the 11 legs from Alicante to The Hague. \"My biggest burden of responsibility going into this race is the level of inexperience on my crew. That's a massive responsibility for me,\" says Caffari. \"Six out of 10 have never been in the Southern Ocean before and don't know what they don't know, so don't even know what to ask. I'm trying to think of everything they need to understand before we go.\"Surfing down mountainous waves with the boat humming at high speed, strong winds screaming through the rigging and sheets of spray lashing across the deck like a fire hose is what draws Caffari back to the world's watery wastes.She hopes her excitement for the extreme conditions of the Southern Ocean can rub off on her young crew, especially if they are anxious.\"That's the best sailing, I love it,\" she says. \"That's the bit we signed up for, that's the cool bit where it gets fun and the sailing is awesome. \"You lead by example. If you're relaxed and enjoying it and laughing that it is cold and wet then they pick up on that vibe. If you're stressed and scared and think something terrible is going to happen, that's the impression they get.\"   Charlie Enright on the helm as the clouds part for a momentary glimpse of sunlight with rain and squalls on the horizon in the 2015 race.'Emotionally battered'Caffari has learned from experience not to panic, but she still shudders at the memory of being stuck halfway up the mast while making repairs during a solo passage in the Southern Ocean, when the wind had relented from a constant 40 knots for two weeks to a \"lighter\" 25-30 knots.\"My first reaction was I'll just cry but clearly that's not going to help you go up or down,\" she says. \"I was trying to psyche myself up to have the confidence to unclip and free climb down. It took me an hour and a half to sort myself out. I didn't handle it well. I was emotionally battered and bruised and valued myself a bit more after that.\"Even worse was her first brush with an ice field during her groundbreaking \"wrong way round\" voyage against the prevailing winds in 2005-2006.

That, at least, is the sentiment of South Korea's greatest footballer Park Ji-sung.Follow @cnnsport\n\n The former Manchester United midfielder -- who will be an Olympic torchbearer in the countdown to his country hosting the 2018 Winter Games -- believes that North Korea's participation in the tournament sends a positive message. 2018 Winter Olympics For more CNN coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, go to cnn.com/olympics \"When we had a good relationship between North Korea and South Korea, we always connected with sports,\" Park tells CNN Sport. \"We have a tricky relationship between both countries, so if they participate that means a lot to our country as well.\"Read MoreDialogue building Last month figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik became the first North Korean athletes to qualify for PyeongChang 2018 and the pair will have the full support of South Koreans, according to Park. \"We can cheer for them and support them,\" he said of the North Korean Olympic team. Figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-sik perform to the music of The Beatles and have been training in CanadaAccording to Reuters, North Korean athletes still have a chance of qualifying for speed skating and Nordic skiing. Nevertheless, North Korea's Olympic committee has yet to announce whether it will allow its athletes to participate in the Winter Games. It boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul. \"They are always open to come to South Korea and play, because we never reject North Korean athletes,\" added Park, an honorary ambassador of the 2018 Winter Games. \"We (can) really help them to set up during the Olympics, which can maybe (build) a good relationship between North Korea and South Korea.\"Park has played for Kyoto Purple Sanga, United, PSV Eindhoven and Queens Park Rangers.Widely regarded as Asia's most accomplished footballer, Park played 100 times for South Korea and scored in three World Cups.The former midfielder, famed for his boundless energy, won four league titles at United and was the first Asian player to captain the club. He was also the first Asian player to play in, and win, a Champions League final after United beat Chelsea in 2008.Park even suggests that the two countries -- whose relationship has endured varying stages of tension since Korea's division after World War II -- could co-host a future FIFA World Cup,  akin to the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. \"It's pretty exciting,\" he said. \"It would be great idea to have the World Cup together. It shows how our relationship is good ... so actually, I hope it happens.\" In June, South Korea's president Moon Jae-in proposed that the two neighbors join a regional coalition to bid for the 2030 World Cup, saying it would \"help to create peace\" between them. More recently, however, Moon called North Korea's actions \"extremely deplorable\" at the United Nations, following weeks of tension that prompted strong language from US president Donald Trump.

So there is nothing really different.\"The rivals met four times in the 2008 World Cup qualifiers, drawing the first three matches before South Korea finally won 1-0 in Seoul.North Korea's home matches were played in Shanghai because of its refusal to allow the South Korean flag and national anthem to be represented, according to The Daily Telegraph.

France has said it will pull out of the competition if North Korea's atomic weapons testing escalates. The Winter Olympics will start on February 9 in the mountainous resort area PyeongChang, which sits just 50 miles from the North Korean border. Though its proximity is an obvious concern to visitors, living with North Korea's sabre-rattling is a way of life for South Koreans, according to Park: \"It's not a big thing. It's kind of something that is there, but not happening.\"\"If they don't know the relationship between South Korea and North Korea, they are probably worried about the situation, but (for) the South Korean people this is normal,\" he said, adding that he \"totally understands\" the predicament of tourists and athletes who may think twice about attending the games, \"These days any country has to have security issues because of terror,\" he added. \"This Olympics is as normal as the other Olympics security-wise.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news and videosBuilding prestigeWhat is undeniable, however, is that showcasing the world's premier winter sporting event adds another level of prestige to South Korea's image, following the 1988 Summer Olympics and the 2002 World Cup.So does rolling out a recently retired Premier League star.

        "content": "Story highlightsDalkurd founded by Kurdish immigrants in 2004Has become unofficial Kurdish 'national team' Seeking promotion to Sweden's top league (CNN)Something unusual is happening in rural Sweden.In a plot that even Swedish writer Henning Mankell might have thought too far fetched, a small football club based in the county of Dalarna -- a three-hour drive northwest of Stockholm -- has become a \"national team\" for millions of Kurdish people around the world. It's a club that's given the Kurdish diaspora plenty to cheer about.Dalkurd are close to winning promotion to Sweden's top league, the Allsvenskan.Set up by Kurdish immigrants in 2004, Dalkurd FF has been so successful that it's on the verge of reaching Sweden's premier division after five successive promotions. Such is the global interest in the club's fortunes that one Facebook page devoted to the team has grown to more than 1.5 million followers.\"What the team has managed to create is both a team that has its ties very much to the locality but also allows supporters from the entire Kurdish diaspora to support it,\" Iraqi-Kurdish author Agri Ismail, who is based in Sweden, told CNN Sport.Read MoreDalkurd won five promotions in their first five seasons after being formed in 2004.\"Rather than support a Stockholm team, I can support Dalkurd because they are 'my' team, even if I've never been to Dalarna.\"It allows for a communal space, away from the traditional spheres where minority identities are upheld such as politics or religion, a new way to celebrate Kurdishness.\"This is different from the usual reasons behind supporting a team, which is either based on locality or the team's success. Most Kurds in the Kurdish region are either Barcelona or Real Madrid fans, and El Clasico games are massive in Kurdistan.\"Dalkurd play at a tiny 6,500-capacity stadium in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden.Quest for a Kurdish homelandNow co-owned by two Kurdish millionaires, Dalkurd play in the colors of the Kurdish flag and three of the current squad are Kurdish, including the captain, Peshraw Azizi, whose father was a Peshmerga fighter. The Peshmerga are the Iraqi-Kurdish militia that have fought ISIS for the last three years. But their history goes back to resisting the rule of Saddam Hussein in the quest for a Kurdish homeland.There are  Kurdish minorities in northern Iraq, eastern Turkey, western Iran and northern Syria.In both Iraq and Syria, the Kurdish populations have achieved significant autonomy, but they are vulnerable to more powerful forces both within and beyond those countries. A Peshmerga fighter stands watch on a roof  during a rally to urge people to vote in September's controversial independence referendum.There are between 25 and 30 million Kurds spread across four countries. But they've never had a state of their own.In September, Iraqi Kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence in a controversial referendum, as tensions between Iraq's largest ethnic minority and the central government in Baghdad intensified.Iraqi Kurds fly Kurdish flags during an event to urge people to vote in the independence referendum in Arbil.Because Kurdistan is not a country, it is not recognized by soccer's world governing body, FIFA, and therefore has no official national team for its people to support. However teams made up of Kurds have participated in tournaments for non-FIFA affiliated teams such as the VIVA World Cup and the Confederation of Independent Football World Cup.Displaced Iraqi children pose for a picture with FC Barcelona shirts  at the Harsham refugee camp, near Arbil.'Proudly Kurdish'Founded in 2004 by nine Kurdish migrants in the county of Dalarna, which is best known for its fishing and camping, Dalkurd was initially designed as a social project to keep troubled local youngsters off the street.That sense of social responsibility is still alive and kicking and is very much at the heart of the club's ethos. Dalkurd's website talks of the importance it places on being a club \"born with a social responsibility\" and their efforts to aid Kurdish integration within Swedish society.   Kurdish people have been arriving in Sweden as political refugees since the 1970s and the community has traditionally had difficulties \"fitting in\" -- something that continues to this day.

Club captain Azizi has made several trips to the region, including visits to refugee camps and the frontline in the war against ISIS. In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Azizi, who regularly tweets about the Kurds' plight, told a story of how he was recognized on one of his trips by a Peshmerga fighter who told him to \"go home and make us happy through football.\" \"My father fought for a long time in the war and now I'm continuing his fight, this time through football and not in war,\" Azizi told the Guardian. \"For me this is an equally important fight for the Kurdish issue.\"It happens again, \"no friends but the mountains\" Kes nell\u00ea kurd mirduwe,kurd z\u00eenduwe,Z\u00eenduwe qet nanew\u00ea allakeman.\u270c\ud83c\udffc\u2764\u2600\ud83d\udc9a #Peace #Kurdistan pic.twitter.com/4iKqSzYerC\u2014 Peshraw Azizi (@Pashazizi) October 16, 2017\nGreat responsibilityDalkurd's co-founder and chairman, Ramazan Kizil, says his ultimate goal is for his team, which plays at a tiny 6,500-capacity stadium, to face one of the major Turkish sides like Fenerbahce or Galatasaray. They can take inspiration from one of their former players, Brwa Nouri, a player of Kurdish descent, who now plays for Swedish team Ostersunds.Led by English manager Graham Potter, Ostersunds, like Dalkurd, experienced a similar surge through the Swedish leagues, finished eighth in the top division, won the Swedish Cup and then produced a shock two-leg victory over Galatasaray to reach the Europa League.

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Germany's 709 members of parliament are gathering Tuesday for the first time since federal elections exactly one month ago.All eyes will be on the 92 lawmakers representing Alternative for Germany (AfD), the first far-right party to enter the country's parliament in almost 60 years. The anti-immigration, anti-Islam AfD became the third largest party in the Bundestag after winning 12.6% of the vote, a result described by leading party figures as a \"political earthquake.\"CNN spoke to four of the new arrivals to find out who they are and what they want their party to achieve -- and to experts who have been watching their rise.ImmigrationRead MoreThe party's leaders put immigration front and center in their election campaign, naming it as one of the AfD's top priorities in parliament.\"First and foremost we must end the migration chaos,\" says Karsten Hilse, 53, one of the AfD's three directly-elected members of parliament. The former police officer won 33% of the votes in his constituency near Dresden in eastern Germany, pushing Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU into second place.He is extremely critical of Merkel's open-door policy towards refugees and -- like many AfD politicians -- insists that she broke the law when she briefly opened the borders in September 2015. He wants to see Merkel investigated.Karsten Hilse was elected to the German parliament in September's elections.But his discontent goes much further than one policy. In a campaign speech in September, he made his anti-immigration views clear, arguing that German values were threatened by the arrival of people \"who reject our way of life.\"\"We are being heterogenized and diluted,\" Hilse said, and \"the German people ... are meant to silently accept this change and ultimately the loss of our homeland.\"Joana Cotar, 44, born in Romania and now living in Hesse in central Germany, is one of ten women representing the AfD; she takes a less hardline stance on immigration. \"I am concerned to help people who need help, those who have a right to asylum,\" she says.Joana Cotar worked in social media before being elected to the German parliament.But she too wants to see a shift in the country's migration policy. \"Germany has a mammoth task to overcome ... I think our country and the population here is simply overwhelmed.\"Analysis: The party won't be in government, and isn't even the largest opposition party. But Henning Meyer, social scientist at the London School of Economics, is convinced its 94 politicians will have a big impact on refugee policy.\"The AfD is not in a position in parliament to block anything,\" Meyer says. But he believes they will \"change the discourse, change the narrative and pull other parties to the right.\"It's already happened, he says: Just a week after the election, in which Merkel's party lost almost a million votes to the AfD, the Chancellor agreed to implement a type of refugee cap, a policy she had explicitly rejected early in the campaign.READ MORE: Merkel changes tune on German refugee capThe European UnionUnlike other far-right parties in Europe, the AfD is not calling for Germany to leave the European Union. But it is fundamentally opposed to the idea of \"ever closer union,\" as championed by Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.\"The last thing we need is more EU,\" says Cotar. \"We need less EU; we don't need paternalism of the nation states.\"\"We should all regulate our own issues at a national level. However, where we need to work together with the EU we should ... on the issue of border control, for example. This is a topic for the EU but it has failed so far.\"Newly elected member of parliament Siegbert Drose, 48, is an even stronger opponent of a federalized Europe.Siegbert Drose grew up in East Germany and joined the AfD soon after it was formed in 2013.He wants to see \"more sovereignty for nation states\" within the EU, which he believes is \"on the path to becoming a new Soviet Union.\"On this subject he's inspired by the same nationalist outlook that drives his anti-immigration stance. \"I want us, as a European nation, to keep our identity and our diversity, our differences. So for peaceful coexistence, there is no future for multiculturalism.\"Analysis: Meyer believes that the AfD could play a significant role in influencing discourse, if there is another eurozone crisis.\"They would then become as anti-euro as when the party started,\" Meyer says. \"Could they make political hay with this? That depends on the circumstances.\"The far right labelPetr Bystron, 44, leader of the AfD in Bavaria in southern Germany, is widely viewed as holding extreme right-wing views. But he rejects that label, both as an individual and on behalf of his party.\"We view ourselves as a party in the center, a citizens' party,\" he says, \"a liberal party with conservative values.\"The Austrian elections should terrify Europeans Hilse takes a similar view when people describe his views as far-right. \"From my perspective, the CDU has betrayed their conservative values -- they simply moved too far to the left.\" \"That's why I don't mind when people say this to me. Because I know that I am still the man with conservative values in the middle.\"It's not a view shared by most of the other politicians who will be sharing the Bundestag benches with Hilse and his 91 colleagues (the AfD won 94 seats but two have since left the party).      In a television interview a few days before the election, Sigmar Gabriel -- foreign minister in the outgoing government -- accused the AfD's leaders of spreading Nazi propaganda and spoke of his distress at the thought that \"Nazis\" would soon have a voice in the Bundestag for the first time since the end of the Second World War. All the other major parties ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD before the vote.Analysis: Ross Campbell, senior lecturer in political science at the University of the West of Scotland, says the other parties see them \"as rabble-rousers, extremists\" and will not cooperate with them in parliament. \"They will try as best they can to shut them out and hope that they will implode,\" he says.But Campbell says this approach could have the opposite effect. \"It may justify one of the main narratives that they have -- that the parties are basically the same and that the media are corrupt in their portrayal of the AfD as a far-right party.\" Thousands of people gathered near the German parliament Sunday to protest against the AfD. \"Against racism in the parliament,\" reads the poster. Party disunityAlmost since its inception, the AfD has been plagued by internal disunity. Cotar insists it's all in the past. \"We are all in agreement and I don't think we will see any AfD parliamentarians wanting to leave now,\" she says. \"We cannot afford disunity.\"Opposition is at the top of her agenda. \"(Our voters) expect from us exactly what we expect from ourselves,\" she says. \"To be outspoken, to bring up painful subjects, to go where it hurts and to present a clear opposition to government.\"But just a day after the elections, then-AfD chairwoman Frauke Petry walked out of a press conference, declaring that she would not sit with the party in the Bundestag and that the AfD must address \"internal dissent.\"Frauke Petry leaves a press conference in Berlin on the day after the German election.Earlier this year, Petry had lost an internal battle to oust a regional AfD leader who denounced Berlin's Holocaust memorial, and her walkout seemed designed to make voters question which leader represented the \"real\" AfD.She has since formed a rival right-wing group called \"Blaue Wende\" (blue change -- the color indicating conservatism).Analysis: \"The AfD could end up splitting down the middle,\" says the LSE's Meyer. Some members may join Petry -- who is now considered more moderate than the party's leaders Alice Weidel and Alexander Gauland -- while others are much more right-wing and are \"pulling in a different direction.\"\"Petry will be a threat to them,\" says Campbell. \"She does have the potential to pull people away if things begin to unravel.\"But Campbell is also convinced that disunity within the party -- many of whose representatives are politically inexperienced -- could thwart the AfD from the start.\"We will hear a lot of opposition from the AfD but it may be disintegrated,\" Campbell says. \"It may be quite difficult to get them to speak with a coherent voice.\" CNN's Nadine Schmidt and Melina Borcak reported from Berlin, and Judith Vonberg wrote from London.",

The Swiss, who turned 36 in August, continued his fine form at Wimbledon, where he clinched a record eighth title.Read MoreFollow @cnnsport\n\nWhile Federer sat out Roland Garros, Nadal won his 10th French Open title in blistering form on the Parisian clay. The 31-year-old Spaniard is the only player -- male or female -- to win any major 10 times. One of only three men to have won majors in their teens, 20s and 30s, Nadal ended his grand slam season with a third US Open title. Verdict: With two majors each, it's a tie. But Federer still has the upper hand when it comes to grand slam titles won with 19, three more than Nadal.Who do you think had the best year? Have your say on our Facebook page.READ: Nadal on his \"special\" historic French Open winREAD: Federer: there were moments I wanted to walk away from it all     Win percentageThanks to smart scheduling with long periods of time off to aid rest and recovery, Federer has barely lost this season. His 44-4 run gives him a win percentage of 91.7%, a mark he has exceeded only twice in his long career. Federer and Nadal first played each other in 2004.Nadal, on the other hand, has played a full schedule, going 65-10, which gives him a win percentage of 86.7%.In 1984, John McEnroe put down the best season win-loss record in the Open era, winning 96.5% of his matches with 82 wins and just three losses, which included a record 42-match run that ended in the French Open finals. Federer recorded the second-best season in 2005, when he won 95.3% of his matches.Verdict: Once again, it's a tie. Although Federer has the better win percentage, that stat would undoubtedly have looked different had he played during the clay court season. Look at win percentage over their entire careers, and Nadal has a slight edge with 82.6% to Federer's 81.9%.

        "content": "Story highlightsYasuhiro Yamashita is considered the best judoka of his generationThe heavyweight star went 203 matches undefeatedThe Japanese icon opens up on life in judo (CNN)With a tear of his right calf muscle, Yasuhiro Yamashita's lifelong dream was surely over. The Japanese heavyweight judoka had envisaged himself atop the Olympic podium ever since he was \"deeply moved\" watching the Tokyo 1964 Games on television as a boy.Follow @cnnsport\n\nSuddenly, two decades later in Los Angeles, the 4,000 people that had crowded into a gymnasium to watch the sport's greatest star drew breath. Yamashita, then 27 years old, had won 194 consecutive matches ahead of the 1984 Olympic Games, sweeping aside everyone that stood in his way. The gold medal seemed his to lose.Legends of Judo: Yasuhiro Yamashita1977 All Japan Championships: Gold1978 All Japan Championships: Gold1979 All Japan Championships: Gold1979 Paris World Championships: Gold (+95kg)1980 All Japan Championships: Gold1981 All Japan Championships: Gold1981 Maastricht World Championships: Gold (+95kg)1982 All Japan Championships: Gold1983 All Japan Championships: Gold1983 Moscow World Championships: Gold (+95kg)1984 All Japan Championships: Gold1984 Los Angeles Olympics: Gold (Open)1985 All Japan Championships: GoldBut with one injury, just two rounds into the open weight division, the reigning world champion looked vulnerable. Read More\"I did not feel the pain during the fight because I was concentrated on the opponent in front of me,\" Yamashita tells CNN. \"I did not lose my determination regardless of the situation.\" He had sustained the injury while attempting an Uchi Mata inner thigh throw against Arthur Schnabel of Germany, but somehow managed to get through the match, defeating his opponent by choke hold submission.Barely able to walk,  he still found time to bow. Legends of Judo: Ryoko Tani, the greatest female judoka ever?\"Even during the hardest fought battles, a judo match starts with a bow, and ends with a bow to show respect towards the opponent,\" says Yamashita. \"Once the fight was over I focused on not making the injury worse, by walking carefully and resting as much as possible.\" But Yamashita's limp was far more pronounced by 18:45 that evening when he faced Frenchman Laurent Del Colombo in the semifinal. And sure enough, just two minutes in, the crowd witnessed a rare moment in judo: the imperious Yamashita was thrown off balance, with Del Colombo becoming the first-ever non Japanese judoka to score against him. \"In my semifinal, it was the first time I thought I might lose,\" Yamashita afterward admitted. Prevented from competing at the Moscow 1980 Olympics because of the Japanese boycott, he hadn't come this far to be denied. The 128kg Yamashita used all of his strength to pin Del Colombo for ippon after 2 minutes and 12 seconds, advancing to the final against Mohamed Ali Rashwan of Egypt -- a man he had never faced before. \"Judo is a bridge that connects the world's people, cultures and countries.\"Yasuhiro YamashitaHe only needed 65 seconds to secure gold, once again getting the better of his opponent with his unrivaled Ne-Waza technique, holding him for 30 seconds for ippon. \"The referee's call seemed to come from far away,\" Yamashita remembers. \"I stood in the middle of the loud cheers and I felt I was the happiest man in the world.\"READ: Legends of Judo -- Driulis Gonz\u00e1lez MoralesRashwan, for his part, famously avoided the injured leg of the opponent and won an international fair play award for his conduct. Yamashita, who had been determined not to betray the slightest emotion all day, clenched his teeth and looked to the heavens. Yamashita stands proudly atop the podium alongside Egypt's Mohamed Ali Rashwan, Romania's Mihail Cioc and Arthur Schnabel of Germany. \"He would have taken part in this final match even if he had a broken leg!\" the commentator exclaimed. \"Oh there's no doubt about it,\" replied co-commentator and US coach Paul Maruyama. \"The entire burden of Japan was on him and he had to win.\"  As the anthem begun, Yamashita had to be helped onto the podium, but his dream had come true. 'A bridge to connect the world'The gold medalist had reached the pinnacle of his sport and, unbeaten in 203 consecutive bouts, he retired a year later aged just 28. Since, Yamashita has occupied a number of roles, from coaching Japan's next generation to heading up the Japanese Olympic Committee ahead of Tokyo 2020.

        "content": "Rome (CNN)While the rest of the world has its eyes on the outcome of Catalonia's tussle for independence from Spain, two of Italy's most prosperous regions voted overwhelmingly in favor of greater autonomy from Rome in non-binding referendums on Sunday. More than 95% of voters who cast ballots in Veneto and Lombardy -- two northern regions which account for around 30% of Italy's GDP between them -- opted to vote \"yes\" to more autonomy, according to officials in both regions. Turnout was more than 57% in Veneto, the region's spokesperson told CNN. In Lombardy, turnout was about 39%, that region's spokesperson said. The referendums were called by the two regions' governors, both of whom are part of the right-wing Northern League -- a party that once favored secession -- and were aimed at securing further powers over spending, immigration, education and healthcare.     Five regions in Italy already boast autonomous powers, including Sardinia and Sicily, as well as Veneto's neighbor, Friuli-Venezia.Read MoreLombardy includes the city of Milan, and Veneto has Venice as its capital. A woman in Milan looks at a poster explaining how to vote in Sunday's referendum.What lead to the votes?The votes were called by the two regional leaders, Roberto Maroni of Lombardy and Luca Zaia of Veneto. The referendum is non-binding but local leaders believe it will give them a mandate to negotiate with Rome for further powers.\"We aim to have enough power to break the resistance of the government,\" Maroni told CNN before Sunday's ballots. \"We want to manage the territory, manage the areas that handle migratory flows.\"\"For us, the most important thing is obtaining resources,\" he added.Unlike the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was declared illegal by the Spanish government, the Italian constitution allows for these types of votes to be held.In a first for Italy, voting in Lombardy was carried out on tablet computers via an e-voting app, while Veneto retained more traditional methods.Why are the votes important?Politicians backing the referendums believe the successful economies of their region should not be used to fund poorer areas in the south of Italy.Roberto Maroni, president of Lombardy, wants more resources for the region.Maroni wants to slash his Lombardy's tax bill by at least 50%, claiming it sends more than \u20ac54 billion to Rome than it does in return. In Veneto, Zaia believes the deficit is around \u20ac20 billion and wants his region reimbursed.The move comes ahead of the Northern League's attempt to increase its share of the vote in next year's general election.\"Saying I am enthusiastic is an understatement, I can't wait for the vote,\" Northern League leader Matteo Salvini previously told Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera.\"Finally after 30 years there is an official date, institutional, recognized and legal to include citizens in this project of autonomy. Venetians and Lombardi, 15 million people, will be able to express themselves by asking for more autonomy and more money. It is the triumph of liberty.\" Is this a pattern?The vote comes at a time when separatist movements have been gaining traction.A taxi with a sticker announcing the Lombardy referendum passes along a street in Milan.Britain's decision to leave the European Union and the ongoing tension between Catalonia and Spain are two of the highest-profile cases currently playing out.There is also the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum, though such a move has lost momentum over the past year.Away from Europe, Iraqi Kurds voted in favor of declaring independence from Iraq, while there has also been secessionist violence in Cameroon.But in Italy, it's different. The president of Veneto, Luca Zaia, says more autonomy will have a positive impact.In the 1990s, the Northern League campaigned to create the independent state of Padania, which would would stretch across the north of the country, following the Po river around Lombardy in the west and Venice in the east.Now, the party's dream of an independent state has been put on hold in pursuit of national success in next year's election.\"From the juridical standpoint, there is no analogy with the Brexit referendum,\" Zaia said in his party's manifesto.\"The objectives are radically different. The referendum of Veneto does not question a break in either the supranational right nor with respect to international law, nor with respect to the Italian constitution.\"He added: \"Unlike Brexit, this will create a positive impact. The referendum of Veneto is destined to have a strong impact.\" This story has been updated to reflect the results.Journalist Valentina Di Donato reported from Rome.

The star-studded event was hosted by British actor Idris Elba, and the audience was littered with famous footballing names.For Ronaldo, it was yet another trophy to place in an already bulging cabinet. The striker helped Real Madrid its first league and European Cup double since 1958 last season -- the first side to win back-to-back Champions League titles in the process.

Nervous, the footballer needed reassurance, but the memory of his mum who had recently died emboldened him. She was his motivation. The first pinch of the needle hurt, but the longer the bee-like buzz of the tattoo machine continued the more the Philadelphia Union defender became numb to the pain. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAs he looked into the mirror and saw two doves and the words \"we only part to meet again'\" embossed on his left shoulder, the little discomfort Yaro had felt was worth it. These days footballers with tattoos are two-a-penny, but what makes Yaro's unusual is that it was done by the Chief Tattoo Officer of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union. It is a position that the club describes as a first in professional sport.Yaro said he never thought he would have a tattoo. Union's ink initiative has also had an unusual spinoff, according to Ghanaian-born defender Yaro: it has helped the squad form closer bonds. Read More\"Most guys have a tattoo for a reason and there's an inspiration behind it so finding out their stories are always cool,\" the 22-year-old tells CNN Sport.\"It allows us to sit and talk about something other than soccer. Some of the guys who were new to the club this year didn't know my mum had passed away and they found out through my tattoo. It has given the team something else to talk about, other than what we do every day.\"Admitting his pain tolerance \"isn't great,\" Yaro has followed in the footsteps of David Beckham, Le Bron James and thousands of other professional athletes in acquiring a permanent piece of body art. \"I came in for training the next day and everyone wanted to see it,\" he says, smiling, before conceding that he is unsure why tattoos are so popular among his fellow professionals. \"Everyone was really excited. I had a lot of text messages from friends who saw it on Instagram, but the reaction was all positive.\" Photos: The most eye-catching tattoos in sportPerhaps the man who started the trend.

The idea of having an in-house tattoo artist was the brainchild of Doug Vosik, Union's vice president of marketing, after he bonded with new Dutch signing Giliano Wijnaldum -- brother of Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum --  over their love of ink during a pre-season photo shoot.The Union's logo with a coiled snake is one of the most popular tattoos among fans.\"While introducing myself to Giliano, I immediately pointed out a few of his tattoos that I liked,\" Vosik tells CNN Sport. \"Catching him a bit off guard as a fan of tattoos, he was surprised when I rolled up my sleeve to show him all of my tattoos.  \"During this conversation, coach Jim Curtin walked by and shared that he absolutely loves tattoos and one day hoped to have a couple. Realizing how quickly strangers could bond over tattoos led the idea of having an artist provide professional services to the team.\"After months of whittling their way through 150 candidates, the club created a five-person shortlist before consulting with players and staff on who should become the team's official tattooist. Richie Marquez gets inked at Bonedaddys during a special event organized by the Union.The winner of this unique one-year deal was Jay Cunliffe, owner of Bonedaddys Tattoo, based in the northeast of the city, while fellow finalist Dan Czar has earned a special place on the team sheet to give fans and players a variety of styles to choose from. Cunliffe and Czar, who is based in Atlantic City, will collaborate to create Union-themed tattoos and host fan events -- on October 21 the club allowed season ticket holders to trade in their reward points for free or discounted tattoos -- while there are also plans afoot to design a mural. 'I can get more tattoos now' Midfielder Marcus Epps' long-held ambition is to have a sleeve -- a series of tattoos covering the length of the arm -- and he is already making plans for his next visit to Bonedaddys.     \ud83c\udf9b A post shared by Marcus Epps (@ballon_dor379) on Oct 12, 2017 at 10:18am PDT \"The Union already checked the tattoo artists out so I feel comfortable with them and feel I can get more tattoos now,\" the 22-year-old Mississippi native tells CNN Sport. \"Everyone was happy about the appointment, even the guys who didn't have tattoos. We think it's pretty cool. \"It's kind of addictive. In my free time I look up ideas for tattoos. I have two pieces in mind. One with my club emblem from childhood and in another one I want to incorporate the Union in it.\"Being an individual in a team Half a century ago tattoos were the reserve of sailors and bikers, but the sight of athletes covered in ink is, these days, a familiar one no matter what the sport. What was once frowned upon is now fashion. Arguably, former Manchester United, Real Madrid and England midfielder Beckham, whose body is decorated with over 40 tattoos, was the first footballer to set the trend when he had the name of his first child, Brooklyn, inked across his neck.

His team was tasked with cracking messages sent using Enigma, the cipher tool used for communication by the Nazis and other Axis powers. Known as \"Prof\" to his peers, and renowned for his eccentricity, Turing developed the Bombe, a machine capable of deciphering the secret code.Enigma machines were used by the Axis powers to encode and decode secret messages during WWII.His efforts were critical to the interception and translation of tens of thousands of messages, helping the Allies change the course of the war, and saving thousands of lives.James Grime, mathematician and co-curator of the exhibition, told CNN it focused on \"two code-breakers, one a mathematician, Alan Turing, and one a linguist, Michael Ventris.

Freedom!\" and \"Rajoy, Rajoy, so you know we are leaving!\"Catalan President Carles Puigdemont was among the throngs, but he stopped short of declaring independence, as he had threatened to do earlier in the week.\"The Catalan institutions and the people of Catalonia cannot accept this attack,\" he said later in a televised statement, accusing Madrid of seeking the \"humiliation\" of the Catalan people. \"What is being done with Catalonia is directly an attack on democracy that opens the door to other abuses of the same kind anywhere, not just in Catalonia.\"Protesters hold signs reading \"Freedom for the two Jordis\" on Saturday, referring to two jailed Catalan activists.Other Catalan politicians were similarly defiant. Catalan parliamentary leader Carme Forcadell accused Rajoy of \"enormous political irresponsibility\" that  \"trespassed all limits.\" \"He announced a de facto coup d'etat with which he aims to take over Catalan institutions,\" Forcadell said Saturday. \"We will not take a step back. We were chosen by the people of this country as legitimate representatives, and as public servants we owe ourselves to them.\"Rajoy calls for new electionsRajoy is seeking to employ Article 155 of the constitution, which would allow the national government to suspend the autonomy of the Catalan regional administration. Rajoy said the measure would be sent to the Spanish Senate within the week.New elections should be called for Catalonia within six months, Rajoy said, adding that he wants it to happen as soon as possible.Under the measures proposed Saturday by Rajoy, Puigdemont, his vice president and ministers would be suspended and replaced by the administration in Madrid, where necessary.JUST WATCHEDHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfoldedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Catalonia's independence crisis unfolded 02:24\"The government had to enforce Article 155. It wasn't our desire, nor our intention. It never was,\" Rajoy said. \"But in this situation, no government of any democratic country can accept that the law is ignored.\"In undertaking these steps, the government has four goals, Rajoy said -- to return to legality; to restore normality and coexistence in Catalonia; to continue the region's economic recovery; and to hold elections under normal conditions.Spain's FM denies excessive use of forceCatalan media reacted Sunday to Rajoy's announcement with editorials goading Puigdemont to declare independence soon. The Catalan daily Diari Ara published photos of the march under the banner \"Freedom,\" while the daily El Punt Avui showed a photo of Rajoy in black and white overlooking the colorful protests under a the headline: \"Returning to the past.\" It also ran an editorial under the headline: \"An unacceptable attack.\"Every move Madrid has made to ward off an independence declaration, the Catalan people appear to have responded to with more vigor.Spanish police officers try to disperse voters at a polling station in Barcelona on October 1.Madrid sent thousands of police into Catalonia to stop the October 1 vote, but officers were seen using what many called excessive force, shooting rubber bullets at protesters, dragging voters from polling stations by their hair and restraining elderly people.Even though members of the Spanish government eventually apologized for the police's force that day, Dastis defended the police Sunday, saying that the use of force was \"limited\" and \"provoked,\" and that many of the images had been doctored and constituted \"fake news.\"Implications of independenceNearly 7.5 million people live in Catalonia, an economic powerhouse in the northeast of Spain. Spain's population is almost 49 million.More than 2.25 million people turned out to vote, with the regional government reporting that 90% of voters favored a split from Madrid. But the turnout was low -- around 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the referendum.READ MORE: Spain loses 20% of its economy if Catalonia splitsAn independent Catalonia would be outside the European Union and its single market, which is essentially a free-trade zone.EU leaders have backed the Madrid government in its handling of the crisis, which Rajoy insists is an internal matter.Catalonia would also sit outside the World Trade Organization, which could have consequences for the region's economic health.Amid the uncertainty, businesses have already started to move their legal headquarters out of Catalonia. According to a tweet Friday by the National Association of Registers, 1,185 companies began that process between October 2 and 19.CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Barcelona, while Angela Dewan and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

After a fifth win in six races since returning from the summer break, Hamilton now leads Vettel by 66 points with just three races remaining and now seems certain to become the first British driver ever to win four world titles. Follow @cnnsport\n\nOn a warm, sunny day at the Circuit of the Americas, with sprinting superstar Usain Bolt and former US President Bill Clinton watching on, the drivers were introduced to the crowd by legendary boxing MC Michael Buffer.

        "content": "Story highlights\"Catalonia cannot accept this attack,\" Catalonia's president saysThe region's succession could have dire economic effects for SpainBarcelona, Spain (CNN)The Spanish government aggressively moved to squash Catalonia's growing independence movement Saturday when Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced plans to dissolve the regional government, remove elected leaders as soon as possible and hold new elections.As nearly half a million people protested in Barcelona, Catalonia's biggest city, Catalan president Carles Puigdemont denounced Rajoy's decision and said, \"The Catalan institutions and the people of Catalonia cannot accept this attack.\"He called for the regional parliament to discuss \"the attempt to liquidate our self-government and our democracy, and act accordingly,\" but Puigdemont stopped short of declaring regional independence, as he threatened to do earlier in the week.Earlier in the day, Puigdemont joined the throngs, which police estimated at 450,000 people, that took to the streets after Rajoy announced his government would invoke rarely used constitutional powers to remove Catalonia's leaders, including Puigdemont. Demonstrators shouted, \"Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!\" and \"Rajoy, Rajoy, so you know we are leaving!\"Read MoreThe constitutional measures -- intended to end Catalan leaders' independence bid -- fall under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution and would allow the national government to suspend the autonomy of the Catalan regional administration.  Rajoy said the measure would be sent to the Spanish Senate within the next week.Rajoy, left, called Saturday for the removal of Catalan President Carles Puigdemont.The move followed weeks of division triggered by a contested independence referendum October 1.Nearly 7.5 million people live in Catalonia, an economic powerhouse in the northeast of Spain. Spain's population is almost 49 million.Ouster in Senate's hands Under the measures proposed Saturday by Rajoy, Puigdemont, his vice president and ministers would be suspended and replaced by the administration in Madrid, where necessary.\"The government had to enforce Article 155. It wasn't our desire, nor our intention. It never was,\" Rajoy said. \"But in this situation, no government of any democratic country can accept that the law is ignored.\"In undertaking these steps, the government has four goals, Rajoy said. These are to return to legality; to restore normality and coexistence in Catalonia; to continue the region's economic recovery; and to hold elections under normal conditions.READ MORE: Spain loses 20% of its economy if Catalonia splitsNew elections should be called for Catalonia within six months, Rajoy said, adding that he wants it to happen as soon as possible.Rajoy's Popular Party holds a majority in the Senate. Two Spanish opposition parties, PSOE and Ciudadanos, have also said they will back the Article 155 measures, Rajoy said.Senate Vice President Pedro Sanz said the Senate would hold a session Friday morning to vote on Article 155.Spain's national prosecutor's office told CNN it is preparing to file charges of rebellion if Catalan authorities make a declaration of independence. It did not name Puigdemont or any other officials as possible defendants.      'Incompatible with the rule of law'The crisis threatens to fracture Spain, one of the European Union's principal members.The campaign for independence in Catalonia represents fundamental European values, Puigdemont said in his televised speech, and he likened Catalonia to other European nations.\"What you are fighting for at your home, we are also fighting for in Catalonia, and we will continue to do so,\" he said.Puigdemont harshly criticized Rajoy, saying that \"imposing a form of government not chosen by citizens and without a parliamentary majority that supports it is incompatible with the rule of law.\"The big question Saturday was whether Puigdemont would declare regional independence. Thursday, he said that if Madrid kept blocking dialogue, the Catalan parliament reserved the right to formalize a declaration of independence that was suspended October 10.Instead, he called for a parliamentary discussion on Saturday. Catalonians will \"defend our institutions as we have always done, in a peaceful and civilized way, but with dignity and reasons,\" he said.Contested referendumPuigdemont has said Catalonia earned the right to become an independent republic in its October 1 referendum, which was held despite being  banned by Spain's Constitutional Court. Violent scenes unfolded as national police sought to prevent people from casting their ballots.More than 2.25 million people turned out to vote, with the regional government reporting that 90% of voters favored a split from Madrid. But the turnout was low -- around 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the referendum.Puigdemont suspended the effects of the vote to allow for talks with the Spanish government.People hold candles and a Catalan flag during a demonstration in Barcelona against the arrest of two Catalan separatist leaders on October 17.Puigdemont also demanded Spain end its \"repression\" of Catalan separatist leaders, two of whom were taken into custody on suspicion of sedition earlier in the week.Other Catalan politicians were defiant.\"Today President Rajoy, in an act of enormous political irresponsibility, trespassed all limits. He announced a de facto coup d'etat with which he aims to take over Catalan institutions,\" said Catalan Parliamentary leader Carme Forcadell. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau tweeted: \"Rajoy has suspended the Catalan self-government for which so many people fought. A serious attack against the rights and freedom of many, here and everywhere.\"READ MORE: Political crisis is scaring away tourists from BarcelonaProtesters gather in Barcelona's city center on Saturday. Rajoy urges unityRajoy said Saturday that Puigdemont had repeatedly rejected opportunities to talk to Madrid before calling the banned referendum and insisted his own government was acting to protect the interests of all Spaniards, especially Catalans.JUST WATCHEDCatalan families divided over independenceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalan families divided over independence 01:48\"I am fully aware this moment is difficult but all together we are going to overcome (it), as we have previously overcome very complicated events throughout our history,\" he said.Rajoy also warned that an independent Catalonia would be outside the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with dire consequences for the region's economic health.A combination of higher tariffs, lack of access to credit and \"disproportionate\" inflation would lead to \"impoverishment of the Catalan economy of between 25 and 30%,\" he said.Amid the uncertainty, businesses have already started to move their legal headquarters out of Catalonia, Spain's economic powerhouse. According to a tweet Friday by the National Association of Registers, 1,185 companies began that process between October 2 and 19.Spain's King Felipe VI said Friday that Spain was facing an \"unacceptable\" attempt at secession and that Catalonia must continue to be a central part of the nation. EU leaders have backed the Madrid government in its handling of the crisis, which Rajoy insists is an internal matter.European Council President Donald Tusk described the Catalonia situation as \"concerning\" but said there was \"no space for EU intervention,\" in remarks Thursday in Brussels.CNN's Claudia Rebaza reported from Barcelona, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Simona Halep: The current No. 1 became the first Romanian woman to ever hold down top spot.Read MoreAfter spurning opportunities to get to No. 1 in the spring and summer, Halep overtook Garbine Muguruza by reaching the final in Beijing earlier this month.But if that was a highlight for the 26-year-old, she has suffered some very tough defeats in 2017.Halep relinquished a set and 3-0 lead in the French Open final -- clay is probably her best surface -- to Jelena Ostapenko, fell to Johanna Konta in a quarterfinal thriller at Wimbledon and lost to Sharapova in the first round at the US Open in yet another superb tussle.Winning in Singapore, then, would be especially sweet for Halep. JUST WATCHEDFrench Open outsider's meteoric riseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFrench Open outsider's meteoric rise 01:10Garbine Muguruza: The Spaniard clearly loves the big stage.By the time Muguruza won Wimbledon, she had amassed four career titles -- and two of them were grand slams.The 24-year-old became the first Spanish woman to triumph at the All England Club since Conchita Martinez -- one of her coaches at Wimbledon --  in 1994 and the first player to defeat both Williams sisters in a grand slam final.It came weeks after a raucous crowd at the French Open left her in tears. The Venezuelan-born Muguruza had struggled in the aftermath of claiming the French Open in 2016 but ensured there would be no slump after her fortnight at Wimbledon as she was crowned champion in Cincinnati in August.

Elina Svitolina: The Ukrainian's year-end ranking has improved every year since turning pro -- and that will continue no matter what happens at the WTA Finals.Making her debut at the WTA Finals along with Ostapenko and Caroline Garcia -- Svitolina is perfect in finals this year, going 5-0. Her three biggest successes came in Dubai, Rome and Toronto.But like Halep, the counter-puncher was dealt some difficult losses: Surrendering a set and 5-1 lead to Halep in the French Open quarterfinals and 4-2 third-set advantage to Madison Keys in the fourth round at the US Open.\ud83d\ude01\ud83c\udfbe\u2708\ufe0f\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7#FlyWithCaro #WTAFinals pic.twitter.com/w3xLhBdn04\u2014 Caroline Garcia (@CaroGarcia) October 20, 2017\nWorth noting: The 23-year-old pulled out of her second-round match in Hong Kong last week with a leg injury.  Wozniacki, Venus return Caroline Wozniacki: After an injury plagued 2016, a healthy Wozniacki has been one of the tour's most consistent performers.When Wozniacki repeated as champion in Tokyo in September, it ensured that the Dane won a title for a 10th straight season.There must have been some relief for Wozniacki, since the 27-year-old lost all six of her previous finals this year.The former No. 1 is making her fifth appearance at the year-end championships, reaching the final in 2010 in Doha before falling to Kim Clijsters.Like Svitolina, Wozniacki was forced to give her opponent a walkover in Hong Kong, hindered by an elbow injury. Venus Williams: Williams is the lone former champion in the field, winning in 2008, then losing to Serena in the 2009 final.That appearance eight years ago was her last trip to the year-end championships. Venus -- now 37 -- turned back the clock, reaching the Australian Open final and Wimbledon final, along with the US Open semis.No one on the women's tour won more grand slam matches than the American. And if she had taken one of her two set points in the first set against Muguruza at Wimbledon, Venus just might have captured her first major since 2008. Jelena Ostapenko: Ostapenko was a high-profile junior, winning at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2014.But who saw her title at the French Open coming? The Latvian lost in the first round of the juniors in 2014, first round of qualifying in 2015 and in the first round proper in 2016. And she'd never won a top-level title before.Ostapenko, however, put it all together at Roland Garros, capping her run with the comeback victory over Halep. Ostapenko had a fruitful Asian swing, too, winning in Seoul and landing in the semifinals in Beijing and Wuhan.  If she goes to a third set, look out: Ostapenko is 22-8 in deciders this year, including winning 20 of her last 24.

The seven youngsters, aged eight to 18, are taking on the member states of the Council of Europe, who together produce at least 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. As signatories to the Paris climate accord, the countries have agreed to cut their emissions rates to help prevent global temperatures rising by more than 2\u02daC.\"Older generations should reduce the consumption of natural resources,\" says Sim\u00e3o, 11, one of the children in the court case.The children will ask the European Court of Human Rights to tell the nations to enforce stronger emission-cutting policies, and to stop mining fossil fuel reserves.Lead counsel Marc Willers QC, from London's Garden Court Chambers, says the legal action is a landmark case. If successful, it would set a historic precedent and be binding across Europe.

The Slovakian has just celebrated a decade at Napoli, moving from Brescia in 2007 and has gone on to become club captain.If Maradona is the \"God\" of Naples, then it might be fair to say Hamsik is rapidly becoming the second coming.READ: Mauro Icardi scores late as Inter triumph in thrilling Milan derbyREAD: Patrick Vieira looks to build a 'special' legacy in New YorkFor years, this one-club city has felt shackled by the memory of the great Argentine, unable to move on from the glory years which saw Napoli claim those Scudetti in 1987 and 1990.Arguably this season presents Napoli their best opportunity yet to find closure on that chapter of history and start writing a new one of their own.JUST WATCHEDCopa90: Milan Derby - Derby della MadonninaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCopa90: Milan Derby - Derby della Madonnina 04:13Not only has the club already laid down an early marker for Serie A's chasing teams, but Hamsik also needs just two more goals to break Maradona's 26-year record.The 30-year-old currently sits on 114 goals, needing one more to equal Maradona's 115-goal haul and there would be no better time to achieve it than on Saturday.At 7:45pm, the air in Naples, as former goalkeeper coach Xavi Valero described it, will be thick with the smell of football as Napoli welcome Inter Milan to the intimidating San Paolo stadium.Currently in second place, lurking just two points behind Napoli, Inter have been Italy's surprise package.

        "content": "Brussels (CNN)European leaders have indicated that they are ready to start discussing their relationship with the UK after Brexit, giving embattled British Prime Minister Theresa May a much-needed boost after months of talks that appeared to be going nowhere. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, said on Friday that EU leaders would begin internal preparations for the second phase of Brexit -- talks about a trade deal with the UK. Brexit negotiations had appeared to be in a state of deadlock, with the EU calling for clarification on the financial settlement or \"divorce\" bill while the UK pushed for parallel talks on trade. Tusk played down difficulties, saying that talk of deadlock had been overblown.Brexit will force Britain to spend more time dealing with EuropeGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel hinted in the early hours of Friday morning that progress had been made, assuring journalists she was confident that a good Brexit deal would be reached by March 2019. She criticized the British press for presenting the talks as shambolic or running behind schedule: \"I find that absolutely absurd. We are in a process,\" adding that Brexit \"will happen within the required timeframe.\" Merkel noted that although insufficient progress had been made to move onto formal negotiations with the UK on the future trading relationship, EU leaders wanted to build on the constructive progress of May's Florence speech in September, when the British Prime Minister struck a more conciliatory tone than before.Read More\"We have made progress, and it is perhaps the nature of the thing that we look at it step by step,\" Merkel said.Merkel spoke after a dinner where May delivered her view of talks so far and urged the EU to accelerate the process.It was originally hoped that that an agreement on outstanding issues such as the Irish border, EU citizens' rights and the divorce bill would have been reached by now. Such an agreement may now not come until the council's next meeting in December.Still, after months of frosty relations between the UK and European leaders, a change in tone was on display from the start of this summit:  Merkel and French President Emmanual Macron -- the two most influential European leaders --  were seen in a very public, cordial huddle with May.Merkel and Macron whisper to May at the European Council summit.This stands in stark contrast to last December's summit, when photographs of May casting a lonely figure were taken by many to represent the UK's isolation from the other European leaders.JUST WATCHEDBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UK 01:48On Friday morning, other EU heads of state followed Merkel's lead -- affirming a new impetus in the Brexit negotiations.Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat praised May's \"candid and sincere appeal that she wants progress to be made.\" The Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 was also optimistic: \"It was not expected to have a success in this European Council, we hope that we will be able and she will be able to have a success in December.\"What was geared up to be a tense standoff between the British Prime Minister and the EU leaders has ended on an optimistic and cordial note -- with  Merkel leading the change in tone. Formal discussions on the shape of the future partnership and trade deal between the UK and EU will not start immediately -- as had previously been hoped in London. But Theresa May has succeeded in improving relations with her EU counterparts ahead of the critical sixth round of Brexit negotiations next month.",

Hide Caption 17 of 17Military obligationThe search for an heir to Yang's throne goes on. Few have come closer than KJ Choi, a former powerlifter today recognized as Asia's most successful male golfer ever. The 47-year-old, nicknamed the \"Tank,\" has eight PGA Tour titles to his name, including the 2011 Players Championship, golf's unofficial \"fifth major.\"But, while he will always be remembered as the first South Korean to win on the PGA Tour -- having triumphed at the Compaq Classic of New Orleans in 2002 -- he was never able to capture one of golf's big four.KJ Choi celebrates winning the 2011 Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass.For Choi, an amendment to his country's mandatory military service may be required for South Korean men to mount a more consistent challenge in majors. \"I advise young players to fulfill their military obligation as quickly as possible,\" Choi tells CNN Sport. \"This may require a change in national policies, but for sure it will help produce more and more talented players.\"All able-bodied South Korean men must serve a minimum of two years between the ages of 18 and 35 as the country is still technically at war with neighbor North Korea. While exemptions are offered to athletes who medal at the Olympics or win gold at the Asian Games, PGA Tour titles are not yet deemed sufficient. Choi worked as a rifleman on a radar base before even earning his PGA Tour card, and was able to hit golf balls at two-day intervals.  But several contemporary players have challenged the conscription to no avail. Hot prospect Si-woo Kim might have become the youngest ever winner of the Players Championship just this year, but the 22-year-old has already consigned himself to switching clubhouses for barracks. Sang-moon Bae celebrates winning the Frys.com open in 2015.Sang-moon Bae, meanwhile, recently returned from his military commitment aged 31 -- two years after a career-best season during which he won the Frys.com Open and accumulated over $2.5 million. \"This will be my first time playing four rounds since there is no cut-off for this event,\" said Bae, looking ahead to this week's CJ Cup on Jeju Island, the first ever PGA Tour event in South Korea. \"I am trying to regain my sense of play on the field.\"'Will to survive' mentality  Several Korean-born players, including American Kevin Na and New Zealand's Danny Lee, have avoided conscription by emigrating at an early age. Even so Choi believes Korea's military history is inextricably linked to his country's love and aptitude for the game. \"When you look back into the history of Korea, we have always been a nation attacked and invaded -- we fought for our independence,\" he says.  \"Koreans possess a \"will to survive\" mentality and I believe this has transferred into the game of golf. We, the people in South Korea, are strong minded and strive to be successful.\" The son of two table tennis Olympic medalists, Byeong-hun An became the youngest ever winner of the US Amateur in 2009, aged 17.  Byeong-hun An, the youngest ever winner of the US Amateur, similarly praises the mental strength of South Korean golfers.\"I think our work ethic is pretty strong and that helps with preparation,\" the 26-year-old tells CNN Sport. For An, who became the youngest-ever winner of the US Amateur in 2009, it's distance off the tee where he and his compatriots on the PGA Tour have struggled.\"I think men's golf needs a bit more physical ability,\" he contends. \"We need to hit the ball farther and with more accuracy because of the long course set up. \"You see more Korean players are coming through now because they have the distance and good short games too.\" READ: Is manga the miracle cure for your golf game?     Legacy There are currently 11 South Korean women in the top 20 on the LPGA Tour, and 41 in the top 100. By contrast, Si-Woo Kim is the highest South Korean man in the Official World Golf Rankings at No. 39. Only two compatriots -- Jeung-hun Wang and Byeong-Hun An -- join him in the top 100. Choi believes it's only a matter of time before that changes. \"I'm not sure whether he will be South Korean, but I firmly believe an Asian-born golfer will become No. 1 in the world within the next 20 years,\" he tells CNN Sport.\"South Koreans strive to improve from a technical and academic standpoint and I know this will transfer out onto the golf course. No doubt we will see more and more Korean players compete, and win, on the world stage.\"Si-woo Kim is one of only two golfers born outside of the United States this side of World War Two to win two PGA tour events before their 22nd birthday. Success breeds success, says Kim, who has witnessed a succession of elite female players come to the fore in the wake of five-time major champion Se Ri Pak.\"What Choi and Pak have achieved is remarkable and they have made a huge impact on junior golfers,\" Kim tells CNN Sport. \"So many young kids are motivated by them.\"\"Korean golf history is not that long but many younger generations are starting to play these days.\" READ: South Korea's golfing women - 'You're either a champion, or nothing'Those younger generations will benefit from South Korea's impressive golf infrastructure, with around 500 courses, 4,000 driving ranges and some 9,000 certified instructors at present. And all agree that October's CJ Cup, won by Justin Thomas, will be instrumental in taking the country's game to the next level. \"With an initial one decade PGA-CJ Cup commitment set, we look forward to seeing an increase in the number of young golfers emerge at this tournament in the years ahead,\" Pious Jung, CEO of CJ America, tells CNN Sport.\"We are so proud of our roster of young golfers and look forward to helping South Korean golf grow more.\"The first official Regular Season TOUR event in South Korea.Preview THE CJ CUP @ NINE BRIDGES. pic.twitter.com/2Yfs5r2yaM\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) October 18, 2017\n\"It's very special,\" says Choi. \"For my home country to host an official PGA Tour event shows how far Korean golf has come along.

Competition was strong, with several major winners including having traveled -- something Choi believes could actually be beneficial to his compatriots in the long run. \"I think that this event will help in that many players will be given the chance to gauge what they need to do to join the tour,\" said Choi.\"For instance, it will give them a chance to see it for themselves what they need to improve, what they lack, and what preparations they need. This event, in that sense, will push Korean golf one step ahead.\"\"It's fantastic to be playing in my home country on the PGA Tour,\" An tells CNN Sport. \"I think we are getting closer to winning majors every year because there are more opportunities for us to play.\"Through patience and hard work, K.J.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nPatrick Vieira played for Arsenal between 1996-2005, winning three Premier League titles, four FA Cup trophies (though he wasn't in the squad for one of those victories) and was captain of the club's historic \"Invincibles\" season.JUST WATCHEDDavid Villa: Pep made me a better playerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDavid Villa: Pep made me a better player 02:40Arsenal has not won a league title since Vieira moved on, and while he acknowledges \"they're going through a really difficult period,\" the former midfielder continues to firmly believe in the man who brought him to North London.\"They have, I believe, one of the best managers in Europe with a lot of experience,\" he tells CNN Sport's Don Riddell.Read More\"They have some quality players. And they just need to put all the ingredients together and try to win games and try to fight for the Premier League.\" Asked if he has thought about managing a club like Arsenal one day, Vieira's answer is as graceful as one of his trademark runs through the midfield.

The good news is that Vieira, for the time being, remains fully focused on the job at hand. With all the sound and clutter surrounding his world right now -- living in the US as the manager of NYCFC, an ambitious Major League Soccer club in its third year, in a country coming to terms with missing out on a first men's World Cup since 1986 -- Vieira is calm and considered about a range of footballing topics.In their sophomore season, the 41-year-old head coach has led NYCFC back to the playoffs, and is hoping they can go further than last year's conference semifinal defeat to Toronto. Vieira is pictured at the Diambars academy in Senegal.Vieira's charges are currently in second spot in the table, heading into the final weekend of the regular season, which would mean a bye week ahead of the playoff run, and that may be welcome news for veteran star striker David Villa, who has 20 league goals to his name this campaign. After a celebrated career for some of Europe's biggest clubs and his country of France, where he won both the World Cup and European Championships, Vieira's more than solid start as a manager has unsurprisingly attracted attention from his homeland of France. Ligue 1 side St Etienne is reportedly one of a number of clubs keeping tabs on Vieira's progress as a manager, but the 41-year-old isn't looking towards Europe at this point in time. \"I'm really happy in New York,\" he says. \"I love our project.

Rajoy's Cabinet will meet on Saturday to agree measures to \"restore the constitutional order\" in Catalonia, where a banned referendum on independence took place earlier this month. The plan will then be put before the Senate, where Rajoy's Popular Party has a majority, for approval.The statement did not spell out what steps would be taken under Article 155, but the provision gives Madrid the power to take over the running of Catalan institutions and force new elections. It has never been invoked before.Catalan regional President Carles Puigdemont delivers a speech in Barcelona on October 15.The announcement came minutes after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont threatened that the region could formally declare independence if the Spanish government did not engage in dialogue.Read MorePuigdemont also demanded Spain end its \"repression\" of Catalan separatist leaders, in a letter sent shortly before a Madrid-imposed deadline for the region to drop its independence bid.

But he suspended the effects of the declaration to allow for talks.More than 2.25 million people turned out to cast their ballot in the referendum, with the regional government reporting that 90% of voters were in favor of a split from Madrid.

In comments made to the national parliament on Wednesday, Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy said he would not extend the deadline to wait for a clear answer from Catalonia's president, Carles Puigdemont.\"This requirement is firm and it expires in less than 24 hours and if this is not dealt with, Mr Puigdemont will provoke the application of Article 155 (of the constitution),\" Rajoy said.Invoking Article 155 allows the central government to take back control of regions, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, that were granted sweeping freedoms after the 1975 downfall of the Franco dictatorship --  if they acted beyond the law or threaten the national interest.Such a step would almost certainly mean officers from the Guardia Civil, the national security force, being deployed once again in the streets of Catalonia, a provocative act that risks sparking violence.Read MoreDivisive actShortly after the October 1 referendum -- in which 90% of ballots cast in what Madrid termed an illegal ballot were in favor of independence -- Puigdemont walked back on his pledge to take Catalonia out of Spain, saying that he was instead suspending the declaration in the hopes of talks. It is unclear what shape those talks might take, or who would mediate them.The referendum, marred by violence as Spanish police closed polling stations and dragged away Catalans attempting to vote, had a turnout of only 43% of the voter roll -- which Catalan officials blamed on the central government's efforts to stop the vote.The violent clashes left almost 900 people injured, according to Catalan officials.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street in France could face on-the-spot fines under a new sexual-abuse law planned by the country's minister for gender equality.The legislation aims to crack down on the kind of predatory behavior that Marlene Schiappa says restricts French women's everyday lives, making them afraid to leave their homes.\"In France .... every woman has experienced that situation,\" the minister told CNN. \"Going to work, in the subway, on the bus, between in her home and the office, she's been followed by men, she's been asked her number, she's been asked to talk.\" \"It's about freedom ... Women (end up saying) 'I'm not going (out) anymore, if it's that hard,\" the author and activist turned politician explained.\"You can't go to work if while you're walking between your house and your office, you are, you are constantly interrupted by men who are asking you for your number ... (or) following you.\"Read MoreLaw to shame catcallersSchiappa said the exact details of the punishments involved had yet to be decided, but that the law would mean police who spot women being targeted would be able to step in. Women's bodies are being weaponizedAnd more importantly, she said, it was about getting the message across to men that such behavior is completely unacceptable.\"The idea is, symbolically, to say it's not allowed. Because now in France, in the 21st century, you still have men who are saying 'It's ok, I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm just talking to her' -- talking to her for an hour by following her in 12 streets? No, I don't think so!\"She said she hoped the law would embarrass those who harass women into changing their ways.\"Feminists in France have said for a long time that shame has to change,\" she said. \"It's not about the victim feeling ashamed, it's about assaulters, rapists feeling ashamed.\"What 10 hours of street harassment in NYC looks likeBut she says there has been plenty of opposition to her plans. \"We still find men who say ... 'It's French culture, it's love \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise.' They don't want the law to say it's not allowed. There is cultural resistance. \"They're afraid we are forbidding them to talk to women. I think it's really important to have that debate, to say 'It's ok to talk but, it's not ok to assault, there is a real difference.'\"Weinstein scandalInterest in the proposed law has grown in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Hollywood mogul Weinstein faces accusations of sexual harassment, sexual assault or other sexual misconduct from more than 40 women. Through representatives Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. In response to the accusations, thousands of women have flooded social media sites with their experiences of harassment and assault, using the hashtag #MeToo.Harvey Weinstein is a symptom, but what is the deeper problem? But Schiappa said she didn't hold out much hope that the Weinstein case would spark a sea change in people's attitudes.\"We say that every time... Now we're talking about Harvey Weinstein, but who's next,\" she said.Schiappa, 34, a former deputy mayor of Le Mans, was appointed France's first gender-equality minister by President Emmanuel Macron in May.She founded the website \"Maman travaille\" (Mom works), which supports working mothers and campaigns for equal rights.Gender-based violenceSchiappa said harassment is part of a wider problem of sexual abuse and gender-based violence in France.According to the French Interior Ministry, one woman in the country dies every three days at the hands of her partner or ex-partner. Attention, men: stop with the catcallsSchiappa told CNN that more needed to be done to tell abusers that violence was not acceptable.\"I think it's a cultural fight: We have to say to the men they're not allowed to beat their wives. It's not romantic, it's not rock and roll, it's not fun. They are not bad boys, they are just losers.\"But she said she also wanted to see people who were aware of abuse cases standing up and taking action.\"When women are beaten, there are people who know about it ... neighbors, coworkers, bosses, the children's nanny ... there is always someone who knows, and who doesn't say anything. \"And we have to say to the people who know, you have to take the woman by the hand and bring her to the police or to associations or to speak with someone who can help her get away from that man.\"CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.",

No Chinese man, meanwhile, has ever been ranked inside the Top 100. Follow @cnnsport\n\nBut all of that may be about to change with the emergence of 18-year-old Wu Yibing, one of the country's most exciting prospects, who won both the junior singles and doubles titles at the US Open in September.\"When I was playing, they always asked: where are the Chinese men?,\" Li said at last month's Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open in her hometown of Wuhan in central China.  Li became a global star after she won the 2011 French Open title. She was the first player from Asia to do so.

The son of a boxer, he started playing tennis when he was six years old in order to lose weight, according to the website of the men's tour. After becoming the first Chinese player to win a junior US Open title, Wu announced his next goal would be to break into the Top 100.

Andy MurrayWu, who modelled his game on that of two-time Wimbledon winner Andy Murray, joined the Beijing-based academy of Carlos Rodriguez, the former coach of Li and former top-ranked Belgian Justine Henin, when he was 12. Now guided by Spanish coach Nahum Garcia Sanchez, Wu trains in China and Marbella, Spain. \"He's very good, a lot of talent, moves well and has a great backhand,\" former Australian grand slam doubles champion Peter McNamara said in Wuhan. McNamara is a former coach of the men's and women's teams of the Chinese Tennis Association and saw Wu play in the country's National Games. Peter McNamara at Wimbledon in 1981. \"He doesn't serve as big as he probably could but he looks like he's got something a little bit different to the last generation,\" said McNamara, who currently coaches Top 50 women's player Qiang Wang, also from China. \"I think he's got a big chance.

It's not easy but they have to.\" When asked why Chinese women have consistently outperformed the men, McNamara said: \"Attitude and culture.\" \"Boys get it fairly easy and girls don't in China,\" he said. \"They fight very hard, the girls, you can see their mentality on the court, their character and intensity and determination to prove themselves as a tennis player.\"\"The boys unfortunately don't have a role model, which they need,\" said McNamara, adding Wu's rise may inspire other boys. Wu has passed his first test with flying colors, clinching his first ATP Challenger title on the men's lower-tier tour on home soil in Shanghai a week after his triumph at Flushing Meadows. He's now ranked inside the Top 350.'Be yourself'Although Wu is on the right track, it's important he stays grounded, warned Shuo Liu, a former player on the men's ATP World Tour from China who coaches the country's second-best woman, Zhang Shuai. \"He is on the correct way for sure because he is coached by a Spanish coach and signed with a foreign agent,\" said Shuo.\"They know how to create a champion, how to become a big star. But I think we should just leave this boy very quiet... If the people are always saying 'very good' maybe you will lose your spirit.\"Li, who successfully fought the CTA for the right to hire her own coach and keep a larger stake of tournament prize money, has some advice for Wu.

This is what happens when the institutions of the state are incapacitated: the last person left standing is often a journalist. Which makes her the first person left dead.\"Read MoreCaruana Galizia, who had led the investigation into the Panama Papers and alleged corruption within political circles in Malta, was killed Monday after her car exploded soon after she left her home in Bidnija, close to the town of Mosta.A police investigation is underway with officials from the FBI and Dutch forensic experts also examining evidence, according to the Maltese government.Thousands of people gather for a candlelight vigil in Sliema in tribute to Caruana Galizia on Monday.A vigil was held on Monday night with mourners lighting candles in Sliema, near the capital city of Valletta.Caruana Galizia's popular blog, \"Running Commentary,\" was one of the most influential within Maltese politics. It was a leading factor prompting Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to call early elections four months ago after she alleged that he and his wife were linked to the Panama Papers scandal.The couple denied allegations that they had used secret offshore bank accounts to hide payments from the ruling family of Azerbaijan.In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Muscat said that there was \"no doubt\" that this was a targeted attack and called it a \"very professional job.\"He rejected the idea that the Maltese government \"has anything to do with this,\" and added that he needs \"to make sure that everyone has, in our country, as we have, the right to say and write whatever we want.\"Muscat also said that there \"will be absolutely no impunity for anyone\" involved in the attack.Mourners brought their own tributes to Caruana Galizia.Caruana Galizia was highlighted by politics website Politico as one of 28 individuals who would have a major impact on Europe in 2017 after her work in exposing corruption within Malta's political scene. Politico described her as \"a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta.\"Her son, Matthew, also a journalist, said that his mother's death was \"no ordinary murder.\"He wrote how he would never forget \"running around the inferno in the field, trying to figure out a way to open the door, the horn of the car still blaring, screaming at two policemen who turned up with a single fire extinguisher to use it.\"Ambulances on the scene of the explosion on Monday. In her blog, the 53-year-old journalist regularly reported on allegations of corruption across the country's political sphere.In her final blog post, which was published around 30 minutes before the explosion, she wrote: \"There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate.\"In a statement issued in the aftermath of the explosion, Muscat called the incident \"barbaric\" and said it \"goes against civilization and dignity.\"\"Everyone is aware that Ms. Caruana Galizia was one of my harshest critics, politically and personally, as she was for others, too,\" Muscat said in the statement. \"However, I can never use, in any way this fact to justify, in any possible way, this barbaric act that goes against civilization and all dignity.\"Caruana Galizia's son said her killing showed that Malta was a \"mafia state.\"But Muscat's statement has not reassured Caruana Galizia's son. He said that Malta had become a \"mafia state... where you will be blown to pieces for exercising your basic freedoms, only for the people who are supposed to have protected you to instead be celebrating it.\"He added: \"If the institutions were already working, there would be no assassination to investigate - and my brothers and I would still have a mother.\"CNN's Christiane Amanpour contributed to this report.",

All active fires in Portugal had been extinguished by Tuesday morning, Gaspar said, explaining that a combination of the agency's work and rain overnight had helped put out the flames.Galician President Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feijoo said Tuesday some fires were still burning in northwestern Spain, but none of them was considered a threat to population centers. Authorities in Galicia, where three people died, also declared three days of mourning Monday.The fires had blazed across northern Portugal throughout the weekend before spreading across the border into Spain. Many roads and schools in Galicia were closed, with several schools used as shelters for evacuees.The wildfires have been widely documented on social media.

        "content": "(CNN)The president of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, failed to clarify Monday whether his administration had officially declared independence from Spain and instead repeated his call for talks to resolve the ongoing constitutional crisis in the country.In a letter to the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Puigdemont asked for two months of dialogue over the status of the region in northwest Spain, which held a disputed independence referendum on October 1.Rajoy had set a deadline of 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) Monday for Puigdemont to say definitively whether an ambiguous speech he delivered to the Catalan Parliament last week in the wake of the referendum amounted to a declaration of independence.Catalonia had \"earned the right\" to become an independent republic, after 90% of voters in the October 1 referendum chose to split from Spain, Puigdemont told the Catalan Parliament. But he suspended the effects of the declaration to allow for talks.\"The suspension on our side of the results that come out of the vote on 1 Oct, shows our firm commitment to find a solution, and avoid confrontation,\" Puigdemont wrote in his letter to Rajoy on Monday.Read More\"Our call for dialogue is sincere and honest. That is why over the next two months our main objective is to to invite you to have dialogue, and that all those international, Spanish and Catalan institutions and personalities who have expressed their will to help establish negotiations, have the opportunity to explore this option,\" he wrote.Pro-independence supporters react as they watch on broadcast screens outside the Parliament of Catalunya as the Catalan President Carles Puigdemont announces he will abide by the referendum results on October 10, 2017 in Barcelona, Spain. In his letter to Rajoy, Puigdemont also called on Madrid to \"stop the oppression against Catalan people and Government,\" complaining that \"non-political\" Catalan leaders and the head of the Catalan police force, Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, were being investigated for sedition.Police chief Trapero was allowed to walk free from a court in Madrid on Monday, though he will have to surrender his passport and not allowed to leave the country without the court's permission.He will also have to present himself at the court nearest to his residence once every 15 days.But the leaders of two Catalan separatist organizations will remain in custody while they continue to be investigated for sedition, Spain's high court ordered on Monday.According to a court document detailing the decision, Judge Carmen Lamela Diaz determined that Jordi Sanchez, the head of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), and Jordi Cuixart, head of Omnium Cultural, represented not only a flight risk but that they could also hide, alter or destroy evidence against them. Spain's prosecutor's office alleges that Sanchez and Cuixart were not only responsible for the demonstrations on September 20 and 21, but also key in planning the October 1 referendum on independence that the Spanish government considered illegal.Thursday deadline Rajoy had put Catalonia on notice that, if it had officially declared a split, he would invoke provisions contained in Article 155 of the Spanish constitution, which allow the central government to dissolve the Catalan administration and order new elections.The Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told a press conference in Madrid that Rajoy had replied in writing to Puigdemont setting a deadline for a clear answer by Thursday.She said the Prime Minister asked Puigdemont  \"to answer with the clarity any democracy needs. We don't understand why he perseveres with being confusing unless it is his strategy to escalate the situation further.\"Rajoy's letter, seen by CNN, also underlined that EU countries have backed the Spanish government's claims that the referendum was illegal.Protesters wave Spanish, Catalan and European Union flags in a call for unity on October 8, 2017, in Barcelona, Spain. Puigdemont wrote that \"fundamental rights are being repressed\", with bank accounts frozen, media censorship, private mail being interfered with, civil servants arrested and \"brutal violent acts carried out by police against peaceful citizens on 1 October.\"\"Our call for dialogue is sincere, despite everything that has occurred, but it obviously incompatible with the current climate of escalating oppression and threats,\" he wrote.CNN's Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.",

According to local media, Caruana Galizia was reportedly killed soon after leaving her home in Bidnija, close to Mosta.Caruana Galizia, 53, was highlighted by politics website Politico as one of 28 individuals who would have a major impact on Europe in 2017 after her work in exposing corruption within Malta's political scene. Politico described her as \"a one-woman WikiLeaks, crusading against untransparency and corruption in Malta.\"Daphne Caruana Galizia was one of Malta's most respected investigative journalists.Her popular blog, \"Running Commentary,\" was one of the most influential within Maltese politics and was a leading factor in Muscat calling early elections four months ago after she alleged that the Prime Minister and his wife were linked to the Panama Papers scandal.Read MoreThe couple denied the allegations, rejecting accusations they had used secret offshore bank accounts to hide payments from the ruling family of Azerbaijan.This is a spiteful attack on a citizen and freedom of expression.

Lindsey Vonn, the most successful female ski racer of all time, is currently nine wins shy of the record so expect her to go full throttle at every race. The American has had her fair share of injuries and was forced to sit out the 2014 Sochi Winter Games. One of the big stars of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, where she won the downhill, the 32-year-old has said the 2018 Olympic course suits her aggressive skiing style.  Although Italy's Sofia Goggia beat Vonn twice in two days on that course in March, the American was on the comeback trail after breaking her arm in a crash in November.

On that same day, Anthony posted a tweet that she had reported the crime to police.

That woman alleges the man assaulted her in London in 2010, 2011 and 2015.London police have not referred to Weinstein by name in statements about its investigation into the sex assault allegations, but when asked, a spokesperson told CNN that the first report in London referred to Weinstein. 'It was disgusting'Anthony told the Times of how she and Weinstein met in 1982 when she was around 19 years of age. She had been cast in a leading role in the sci-fi film \"Krull.\" She and Weinstein became friends and had met on his trips to London, but he suddenly began stalking her, she said.  Harvey Weinstein claims investigated by London and New York policeShe told the Times that he grabbed her one night in the late 1980s at a home he had rented in the upscale London district of Chelsea, where she had met him for a drink. \"The next thing I knew he was half undressed and he grabbed me. It was the last thing I expected and I fled. I blamed it on myself because I was tired, a bit drunk and therefore so completely off my guard. He was a so-called friend I'd known for years and the clumsy fumble was the last thing I saw coming,\" she said. But it was on another occasion that Harvey turned up at Anthony's house and allegedly raped her. \"I was in my dressing gown and I answered the door to find Harvey standing there,\" she said. \"He pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack in my tiny hall and started fumbling at my gown. He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. It was disgusting.\"She said she tried to push him away but was unable to as he was too heavy.\"Finally I just gave up. At least I was able to stop him kissing me. As he ground himself against me, I kept my eyes shut tight, held my breath, just let him get on with it. He came over my leg like a dog and then left. It was pathetic, revolting. I remember lying in the bath later and crying.\"'I'd just given up'She explained that she felt pressured to continue to accept meetings with Weinstein over new roles, even after the alleged rape. Her recollection of those meetings echo those told by several other women who have accused Weinstein of sexual assault.Actress Lysette Anthony in New York in 1992.\"The meetings would start with a chat in a hotel suite. The assistants would disappear and then he'd disappear and return in a robe demanding a massage. By then I'd just given up. I knew I was powerless and at least I wouldn't have to do much. I was just a body, young flesh. It wouldn't take long and no one knew.\"An agent for Anthony told CNN the actress was not commenting further on the case. Correction: This piece has been updated to clarify which police department said the sexual assault claim from the 1980s was against Harvey Weinstein. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.",

The People's Party (OVP), which Kurz has led since May, is widely expected to form an alliance with the Freedom Party (FPO), putting the far right in an Austrian governing coalition for the first time in more than 10 years.According to preliminary results, the OVP has gained the largest share of Parliament's powerful National Council, with more than 31% of the vote. That should translate to 61 of 183 seats.  Sebastian Kurz and his girlfriend, Susanne Thier, leaving a polling station after voting in Vienna on Sunday.Kurz gave a speech at his party headquarters in Vienna following early results, promising a new style of leadership.\"We have been given a great responsibility by the voters today. We should be aware of that and that people are putting a lot of hope in our movement. There is a lot to do. It's about establishing a new political style in our country,\" he said.  Read MoreDetailed results will be announced October 19 and full official results will be declared on October 31.Sunday's election was widely watched across Europe, where there has been a rise of populist far-right parties, many of which have campaigned on anti-immigration platforms.Sebastian Kurz: Austria's answer to Macron and Trudeau?Unlike Germany's far-right AfD party -- which won its first seats in the Bundestag in the federal elections there last month -- the FPO has a long history in Austria's Parliament and was part of a coalition government between 2000 and 2005.The FPO came in second with 27.4% of the vote and is predicted to take 53 seats, according to preliminary results. Current Chancellor Christian Kern's Social Democrats (SPO) were just behind on 26.7% and 52 seats.While the result appears to be a clear win for the conservatives, it also puts the far-right FPO in the powerful position of kingmaker, after a campaign period that saw a marked shift to the right.Austria rejected a far-right presidency less than a year ago. But that vote was a close one, with the FPO's Norbert Hofer missing out by a narrow margin.Immigration takes center stageImmigration has dominated the campaign. Kurz has taken a hard line, calling for limits on the number of refugees entering Europe and benefits cuts for EU migrants living in Austria. In 2016, Kurz spearheaded a border crackdown across the Balkans designed to stem the flow of migrants, and this year he proposed plans to seal off the Mediterranean route to Europe.Christian Kern has been Austria's Chancellor since May 2016.Austria was governed by a coalition led by Chancellor Kern's SPO and Kurz's OVP, but that partnership collapsed in May, prompting a snap vote.    The decision to call an early election also followed the resignation of OVP's former leader and Austria's Vice-Chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner, who said the government was riven by infighting. With immigration dominating the campaign, the social issues at the heart of the SPO platform -- including wealth redistribution and fighting unemployment -- have been largely ignored.CNN's Nadine Schmidt in Vienna and Judith Vonberg and James Masters in London contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Voters in Austria are casting their ballots in a snap election that could put young conservative Sebastian Kurz at the helm of the nation in a coalition with the country's far right.The Sunday vote is being widely watched across Europe, where populist far-right parties are on the rise and are shifting political landscapes.Here's what you need to know. Who are the main players?Kurz, 31, is Austria's foreign minister and has led the conservative People's Party (OVP) since May. He is expected to become the new Chancellor -- and the country's youngest-ever leader. Read MoreBut that isn't an absolute given. Should his party win the most seats, Kurz is likely to depend on forming an alliance, and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) is most likely to find itself in the position of kingmaker. Unlike Germany's far-right AfD party -- which won its first seats in the Bundestag in the federal elections there last month -- the FPO has a long history in Austria's Parliament and was part of a coalition government between 2000 and 2005.Kurz's People's Party had been in a ruling coalition with Chancellor Christian Kern's Social Democrats (SPO), but that partnership collapsed in May.     Kurz called the snap election after the OVP's former leader and Austria's vice-chancellor, Reinhold Mitterlehner, resigned from both posts, saying the government was riven by infighting. Christian Kern has been Austria's Chancellor since May 2016.Polls predict heavy losses for Kern's party and gains for Kurz.The FPO is headed up by Heinz Christian-Strache, who has called for \"minus migration\" and a ban on \"fascistic Islam.\"Didn't Austria have elections recently?Yes -- Austrians went to the polls three times in 2016 to elect a new president. The first round of voting in April narrowed the field to two candidates, but the first attempt at the second round was annulled after the losing candidate -- the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer -- challenged the close result.A rerun in December ended with the same result -- and a larger majority for Hofer's left-wing rival, Alexander Van der Bellen, who described his win as a victory for \"freedom, equality and solidarity.\"Supporters of Alexander Van der Bellen, now Austria's president, celebrate the result of the re-run election in December 2016. But with almost half of the electorate casting their vote for a far-right, anti-immigration candidate less than a year ago, all eyes will be on the Freedom Party's performance in a parliamentary election in which 16 parties are fighting for seats.How does the vote work?Around 6.4 million Austrians are eligible to vote. Their ballots will decide the 183 members of the Austrian National Council (or \"Nationalrat\"), the largest and most important of the country's two assembly chambers.The SPO is currently the largest party with 52 seats, while the OVP has 47 and the FPO 40.      What are the key issues?Immigration has dominated the campaign. Kurz has taken a hard line, calling for limits on the number of refugees entering Europe and benefits cuts for EU migrants living in Austria. His stint as Foreign Minister suggests his tough stance is not just rhetoric designed to entice voters away from the anti-immigrant Freedom Party.In 2016, Kurz spearheaded a border crackdown across the Balkans designed to stem the flow of migrants, and this year he proposed plans to seal off the Mediterranean route to Europe.Thousands of refugees and migrants continue to make the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe.With migration dominating the campaign, the social issues at the heart of the SPO platform -- including wealth redistribution and fighting unemployment -- have been largely ignored.Unlike elsewhere in Europe, though, the presence of a strong far-right party has not propelled the European Union up the agenda. Most Austrians support the country's continued membership of the bloc, and even the Freedom Party is calling for EU reforms rather than withdrawal. Why does it matter?The biggest impact of an OVP/FPO coalition would probably be felt by those people seeking new lives in Europe.Europe's migrant crisis isn't going away, but it is changingA right-wing government led by Kurz would likely curtail the rights of migrants and refugees already in Austria and make it more difficult for others to enter.And although Austria is unlikely to leave the EU, the nationalist tendencies of Kurz and Christian-Strache could pose challenges to the notion of a liberal, centralized European Union defined by solidarity and cooperation, as championed by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.An OVP/FPO coalition would instead provide a boost for right-wing populists across the bloc, particularly in Hungary and Poland, who are part of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of nations that oppose immigration and want a more decentralized EU. Christian-Strache recently said he would like Austria to join the group, according to Reuters reports.That outcome would be more bad news for European social democracy in a year that has already seen support for center-left parties plummet in national elections in France and Germany.",

        "content": "(CNN)What were you doing at the age of 31? Whatever you were up to, it's unlikely you were preparing to take the reins of your country as its youngest ever leader.That's the prospect facing Sebastian Kurz, nicknamed \"Wunderwuzzi\" (roughly translated, it means someone who can walk on water) and the man widely expected to become Austria's next Chancellor on Sunday.Described by one political analyst as \"the dream son-in-law for middle class Austrian women,\" and another as Austria's version of Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau, Kurz's rise has been as remarkable as it has been improbable.Kurz took over as head of the center-right Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) in May. In the few short months since, he has transformed a party which has been in coalition government for the past 30 years into his own personal movement.He's re-branded, renaming it the \"The New People's Party\" and dumping its traditional black color scheme in favor of a bright turquoise hue aimed at giving it an \"anti-establishment\" look.Read MoreKurz has pushed his party to the right of its already center-right stance, and taken up a firm position on the big issue dominating this election: Immigration.Since the 2015 refugee crisis, Austria's political landscape has shifted to the right -- a move which analysts put down to the country having received more than 100,000 asylum seekers fleeing violence in the Middle East.          Shifting stanceKurz's tactics have led to accusations that he has copied the policies of the populist, far-right Freedom Party -- a year after it almost caused a political earthquake in Austria.In May 2016, the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer came within touching distance of the presidency, losing by just 31,000 votes to his Green Party rival Alexander Van der Bellen.Hofer then disputed the outcome, forcing the authorities to annul the election result over postal voting irregularities.Norbert Hofer, presidential candidate for the right-wing populist Austria Freedom Party came second in the 2016 election.The establishment rallied behind Hofer's opponent in the re-run, electing Van der Bellen as the nation's first left-wing president since World War II.But despite Van der Bellen's victory, the debate had been framed by Hofer, ensuring the Freedom Party's agenda remained center stage.That success was not lost on Kurz, so when a snap election was called after the collapse of the coalition government in May, he took the initiative.Austrian political analyst Thomas Hofer says the party leader has positioned himself \"smartly,\" boosting his party's popularity with right-wing voters.\"Kurz has managed to take over the Freedom Party issues and frame them in a socially acceptable way,\" he says. \"He has appealed to those who could have voted for the Freedom Party.\"Sebastian Kurzs is greeted by supporters before a television debate.In addition to backing plans to block refugee routes into Europe through the west Balkans and across the Mediterranean, he also supported a ban on the full face veil (implemented earlier this month) and pledged to crack down on radical Islam.\"The immigration issue has made Kurz into a star,\" Hofer added. \"It has moved the whole country to the right but it hasn't really changed people's lives.\"Most people in this country are not affected by another 100,000 migrants. It's more of a psychological issue.\"Kurz has advocated reducing benefits for migrants, while the subject of whether EU citizens living in the country should receive the same perks as Austrian citizens has become a hot topic.Kurz became Austria's youngest Foreign Minister at the age of 27.Thomas Hofer says he believes Kurz is attempting to bring about a \"soft change\" within Austria and in the country's relationship within Europe.But the political analyst rejects comparisons between Kurz and Hungary's right-wing leader, Viktor Orban, who has been censured for his treatment of migrants by the European Union.\"Even though Kurz is trying to devise policies to make Austria less attractive to migrants, he's not trying to be hostile like Orban,\" Hofer says. And while Kurz may bring Austria closer to the Visegrad group -- an alliance of European nations critical of EU integration and the EU's immigration policy -- Hofer says there is no appetite for leaving the bloc.Where now?Kurz's emergence on the political stage is likely to ensure his party remains in government, but the identity of his junior coalition partner remains in question.A year ago, the Freedom Party appeared to be in pole position. Unlike in Germany, where the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in recent elections caused a seismic shock, the Freedom Party has long been part of Austria's political landscape.Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party became the first of its type to go into government in post-war Europe, forming a coalition with the People's Party in 2000.Heinz-Christian Strache of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party after speaking to supporters at an election rally.Leader Heinz-Christian Strache, who took the helm in 2005, has sought to give the party a facelift, though accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamaphobia continue to linger.But political analyst Alexandra Siegl said it is facing a tough battle this time around. \"The image of the FPO has changed a lot since the presidential election,\" she told CNN. \"But voters don't have to vote for the 'bad' right-wing party if they can vote for the 'friendly' center-right party and still get the same package.\"The positions between the parties aren't that different any more. The FPO is trying to frame Kurz as somebody who is just a follower, not a leader, on the issue of migration.\"While the Freedom Party appear well-placed to enter what would be a right-far-right coalition, Austria's center-left Social Democrats are facing a tough electoral battle.Austria's Chancellor Christian Kern is expected to lose his position.Current Chancellor Christian Kern has endured a difficult campaign, blighted by allegations that one of his party's advisers had created a slew of websites which ran racist and anti-Semitic stories in an effort to damage Kurz's reputation.The Social Democrats appear unlikely to survive in their current role as the majority party in a coalition government, with relations between them and the People's Party strained by the scandal.Instead, the public are expected to put their faith in Kurz, a man presenting himself as the \"change candidate,\" despite having spent his entire career in politics.\"Kurz has never had another job,\" said Anton Pelinka, a professor at the Central European University in Budapest. \"He's a young face, but he's not a new face. \"He speaks well and although he talks about outrageous topics, he does it in a soft and civilized manner. He plays the insider who behaves as the outsider in a very polite way.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsLiverpool play Man Utd on SaturdayKlopp under pressure after poor resultsMourinho's United are unbeaten (CNN)There are those who follow the warm, ebullient one. The roaring, bespectacled man-hugger extraordinaire who can gesticulate as wildly on the sidelines as a broken windmill in a storm, energizing his team and fans with every yell and pointed finger. And there are those who are in awe of the revitalized one, the pragmatic Portuguese whose measured words always have a purpose. He is the man who would peacock on touchlines and in press conferences even before his greatness had manifested itself, achieving success with a snarl and a swagger. You are either rooting for one or the other. Never both. For not only are Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho chalk and cheese, but leaders of clubs whose rivalry has become a tribal loathing. 'Like being in the Vietnam War' Both managers have been at their respective clubs long enough -- Klopp celebrated his second anniversary at Anfield last weekend while Mourinho is in his second season at Old Trafford -- to know that Saturday's Premier League contest between Liverpool and Manchester United is more than a football match. Read MoreThe rivalry between English football's two most successful teams is a lesson in history. Rifts run deep. Feuding fans never forget.Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville once described the fixture as a \"blood feud that's Sicilian in intensity\" and ex-Manchester United boss Ron Atkinson likened going to Anfield to being in the Vietnam War after United's coach was attacked with tear gas before a league game. Referee Howard Webb holds United's Gary Neville away from Liverpool's defender Jamie Carragher during a United v Liverpool match at Old Trafford.In April 1992 a young Ryan Giggs was approached by a Liverpool fan as he was leaving Anfield. The supporter asked the curly-haired winger for his autograph and the Welshman obliged, writing his name on a piece of paper, only for the fan to tear it up in front of his face.Indeed, the last time a player moved between the two clubs was in April 1964 when Mancunian Phil Chisnall joined Liverpool.This intense contempt hasn't always been so -- in 1915 a handful of players from both clubs were banned for conspiring to fix a match so that United were not relegated, but the bitterness between the fans intensified during the 1980s and though Liverpool versus United may now be a global affair, and the main characters in this perennial mean-spirited play ever-changing, the antipathy which surrounds this fixture remains. For Klopp and Mourinho, however -- managers who have exchanged barbed words in the past -- the weekend's clash goes further than hatred and history. It is a critical moment, a measure of their managerial reigns in England's north west, a region \"where everything smells like football,\" according to Klopp in a recent interview with author Simon Hughes.Manchester United's Steve Coppell (left) attempts to tackle Liverpool's David Johnson during the 1977 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.Bringing back the glory daysEngaging and charismatic, Klopp and Mourinho are leaders charged with the same mission: to bring back success, bring back the chutzpah, to two footballing institutions that have enjoyed better times. On Saturday, onlookers will find out which manager is closer to achieving his objective. United's start to this Premier League campaign suggests Mourinho's men are title contenders, which would continue the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss' record of winning a league title in his second season at every club he has managed. With Liverpool seven points behind joint leaders United and Manchester City, victory for the Portuguese could plausibly end Liverpool's title hopes even before the start of Halloween's tricks and treats. However, defeat for United at Anfield -- their first fixture of the campaign against heavyweight opposition -- and Mourinho's second season revival after an indifferent first league campaign at Old Trafford could come under scrutiny. But it is Klopp who comes into this fixture under the most pressure. After all, Mourinho's men are unbeaten in the league and won three trophies last season. Klopp's has yet to accumulate any silverware at Anfield. \"The glory days are as far away as ever,\" said former England captain Alan Shearer this week, while author Hughes -- who interviewed Klopp for his latest book \"On The Brink\" -- believes the German is \"relying on the goodwill\" of his achievements as Borussia Dortmund manager, with whom he won two Bundesliga titles. Mourinho and Klopp argue on the touchline during a Premier League match between their sides in January Poor defending, poor results The Liverpool team this son of a salesman is building is still a work in progress. They have won just one match in seven coming into this fixture, conceding 12 goals so far in the Premier League -- which is more than Swansea who are in the relegation zone. Though Klopp's men have often dominated matches this campaign, so shoddy has their defending been that following their exit from the League Cup in September Klopp himself said he was \"really sick\" of his team's frailties. During the Reds' last league outing, the 50-year-old cut a frustrated figure against Newcastle as the newly-promoted hosts leveled courtesy of Liverpool's now familiar calamitous defending. There were no wisecracks in the post-match press conference. There was little to smile about. Klopp frustrated on the sidelines during his team's league encounter against Newcastle.Is the task of guiding Liverpool to a first league title since 1990 starting to change the usually irrepressible former Dortmund manager?\"Every Liverpool manager that's been through the door in the last 20 years has begun with a relatively positive mindset,\" says Hughes. \"It's a job that changes a person. They're certainly not the same person when they leave. \"But I've not seen a massive change in Klopp's demeanor and approach. I don't think he underestimated the scale of the job, but I think he's perhaps underestimated the frustration of the supporters.\" READ: How the English Premier League became a global playgroundREAD: The Premier League's 25 iconic moments READ: The match that changed footballLiverpool's heart and mind puncturedGeorge H.W.Bush was US President and Vogue by Madonna was No.1 in the British charts when Liverpool last won the title. It has been quite a wait. Indeed, it has been over five years since the club won a trophy.Making Klopp's task all the harder are two key events in Liverpool's history in the last decade: The disastrous reign of George Gillett and Tom Hicks which put the Reds on the brink of administration in 2010 and the disappointment of the 2013-14 season, when Liverpool lost out on the league title in the final week of the season. \n\n\n\"The Hicks and Gillett reign made the fanbase very suspicious of owners' intentions, which puts more pressure on the current owners and Klopp,\" explains Hughes. \"Equally, you have the disappointment of 2014. If Hicks and Gillett affected the mindset, that failure to win the title affected the heart. \"It seems that Liverpool have turned from a club that gets over the line, gets results, into a club that falls short. Klopp got to two cup finals in his first season but failed. \"There's been this perception that Liverpool played free-flowing attack during the glory years, but that isn't the case. They were streetwise. \"This Liverpool team isn't streetwise and that particularly affects the mindset of local supporters because they identify themselves as being streetwise. When they don't see that in their team, they lose patience. It's something he needs to pay attention to.\"Who will win Saturday's match at Anfield? Have your say on our Facebook page. Mourinho -- the specialist in winning trophiesKlopp and Mourinho will use different methods in an attempt to achieve success on Saturday. To worship the cult of either is to devote oneself to different styles. With their teams a reflection of their personalities, Liverpool and United play as differently as day is to night. Liverpool's manager is a lover of the high press; breathless, all-action counter-attacking, dubbed gengenpressing during his time in Germany.His forwards are, to varying degrees, midfielders and he will order them to run and run. He is also a football romantic, believing success on the pitch is possible even if others have deeper pockets. Jose Mourinho has won the league title with every club he has managed.Mourinho, by contrast, is more conventional. He spends big on seasoned professionals and builds a team on solid defensive foundations, prioritizing clean sheets, points and trophies.The Portuguese likes tall, powerful players --- United now have the second-tallest squad in the Premier League -- and employs a side full of specialists, acquiring prime poacher Romelu Lukaku and defensive midfielder Nemanja Matic in the summer. While the big-money acquisition of Lukaku has made United more potent in attack, it was only last month that Mourinho said his team were \"humble enough\" to play defensive football when necessary. It is a strategy which might not be as electrifying as Klopp's tactics, but it is ruthlessly efficient.\"Mourinho has always had a winning mentality,\" says Manchester-based journalist Richard Jolly. \"There are some very good managers out there who don't win many trophies. Last season he won the League Cup, which is something Mourinho specializes in because he knows it's the most winnable trophy, and the Europa League and Community Shield. \"Now they're getting into the habit of winning things. \"United was an oil tanker that needed turning around. It would need time, space and the right person at the wheel and the signs are that that's what they've got in Mourinho.\"'Everybody's friend but no-one's best friend'But for all their differences, both Klopp and Mourinho are much the same in some respects. They are both demanding coaches who create strong bonds and inspire loyalty and admiration. This week Liverpool's 20-year-old defender Joe Gomez talked of Klopp's \"emotional connection\" with the players. No manager seems to embrace a player in the aftermath of victory quite like the tactile German.Klopp regularly embraces his players after a match. \"Klopp was probably more serious than I expected,\" says Hughes. \"He's a very warm character, doesn't dodge any difficult questions and is prepared to speak about subjects people may veer away from. But if you upset him he'll let you know. If he doesn't like a question he'll encourage debate.\"I don't think Klopp wants to be liked by the players. One of the players told me that he's everybody's friend but he's nobody's best friend. That probably sums up the way he is.\"Mourinho is the charming son of an international goalkeeper who seduces the media and antagonizes opponents. He has an aura, though sometimes that has been punctured as his second spell at Chelsea, which ended in unrest, attests to. \"He knew everybody so deeply that he could control our emotions in every situation,\" former Porto goalkeeper Vitor Baia once said of his former boss.

It's as simple as that.According to a 2013 report by the Association of Neurological Surgeons nearly 90% of boxers suffer a brain injury of some extent during their career.Follow @cnnsport\n\nNo wonder then that one of the sport's biggest names -- Northern Ireland's former two-weight world champion, Carl Frampton -- has taken the unusual step of reducing the amount of sparring he does to lower the risk of developing \"problems\" later in life.Carl Frampton lost the WBA World Featherweight title to Leo Santa Cruz in JanuaryHowever, Chris Eubank Jr., a rising star of the super-middleweight division and son of former two-weight world champion Chris Eubank, has questioned Frampton's decision and says he would never consider cutting his sparring regime.\"Every fighter is different,\" Eubank Jr. told CNN Sport's Christina MacFarlane. \"For me, I believe sparring is the number one training method to becoming a great fighter so to cut that training method in half, it doesn't sound positive to me.\"Chris Eubank Jr. competes in the World Boxing Super SeriesRead MoreRisksThe Eubank family knows all about the risks of brain damage associated with boxing. In March 2016, Eubank Jr. beat a fellow British fighter called Nick Blackwell who suffered a bleed on the brain, was placed into a medically-induced coma and then forced to retire. Blackwell recovered but suffered a second serious head injury eight months later and is currently unable to walk.\"I'm celebrating. And then I turn around and Nick's on the floor with an oxygen mask on his face and paramedics all around him,\" Eubank Jr. told CNN in April 2016. \"It was a shock, you don't expect that. As a fighter, even if it's tough you don't expect somebody to go to hospital afterward.\"JUST WATCHEDFather-son boxing duo relive coma-inducing fight  ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFather-son boxing duo relive coma-inducing fight   03:27Eubank's father famously knocked out Michael Watson in 1991, inflicting near-fatal brain injuries on Watson who has never fully recovered. After the 2016 Blackwell fight, leading consultant neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn, who operated on Watson, urged the Boxing Board of Control to tell referees to stop fights earlier.\"From all the data we have looked at, post-Michael Watson, what we found was that title fights are the high-risk fights,\" Hamlyn told The Daily Telegraph . \"By definition these are the most dangerous fights, and the ones that should be being stopped early.\"Eubank Jr. trains in Brighton in September 2017However, sparring is a part and parcel of the job believes the 28-year-old Eubank Jr. who has said on several occasions that he would never quit in a boxing ring.\"Yeah sparring can be dangerous or painful, but that's something you have to go through as a fighter, to become a champion and to better yourself as a warrior.\"So, for me, I think sparring should be done, if not every day, then every other day. It should be intense, that's how I've gone throughout my career but every fighter is different.\"Father and sonThe British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) recognizes the danger of brain damage and says it has \"been active, and remains highly willing to join, in research particularly in areas that concern the brain\".Earlier this year, it was reported that The British and Irish Boxing Authority (BIBA) planned to introduce a portable technology device which can detect signs of head traumas in boxers.Last night was just the beginning. I'm not here to take part... I'm here to take over. pic.twitter.com/nQstVv88vr\u2014 Chris Eubank Jr (@ChrisEubankJr) October 8, 2017\nHowever, the BBBofC told BBC Sport it \"does not recognise\" BIBA and would carry on using its own safety policies to protect fighters.Eubank Jr. has lost just one of his 27 professional fights and currently holds the IBO Super-Middleweight world title.His dominant knockout-victory over Turkish fighter, Avni Yildrim, earlier this month has fired him into the semifinals of the World Boxing Super Series where he is set to face WBA world champion George Groves.If Groves wins his quarter-final against Jamie Cox -- and most experts predict he will -- the all-British showdown would take place in January and Eubank is convinced he would come out on top.\"Me and George have a long history of sparring and training together,\" Eubank Jr. said.\"I'm not going to go into detail but I know how I performed in those sparring sessions and that was very early on in my career and I wasn't half the fighter then that I am now, so I'm very confident in my abilities. George Groves beat Fedor Chudinov to win WBA Super-Middleweight World title\"I know what he is, who he is as a fighter. I know what he's capable of and I know I can exploit the weaknesses that he has.\"It's a huge fight, a fight that boxing fans and the British public have been asking for, for a number of years now. \"We have a rivalry, we have a history and that's a super fight, that's a stadium filler and that's the type of fight I've been chasing my entire career.\"Eubank Jr. and his father after win over Avni Yildirim Eubank's father is a constant presence by his son's side.The 51-year-old -- who is also known as \"English\" -- is a former WBO Middleweight and Super-Middleweight world champion and remains one of the biggest names in British boxing and certainly one of the most eccentric. His flamboyant style -- often pictured with a gentleman's cane, behind the wheel of a monster truck, or wearing a fake monocle on reality TV show \"I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!\" -- has also made him a British household name far beyond the boxing ring.Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"Cringe worthy to me?\" Eubank Jr. asks. \"No. I am used to him. He's a character, he's eccentric, he does things that aren't orthodox but, in terms of boxing, you can't have anyone better than that man in your corner. \"He's one of the most experienced and known figures in boxing in British history so to have a man like that, with all his experience and advice, it's only a benefit to me and my career. \"",
