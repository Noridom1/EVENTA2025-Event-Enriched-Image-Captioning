        "content": "(CNN)Roberto Firmino scored a wonderful bullet-header in the dying moments of Wednesday's match to stun Tottenham Hotspur and move Liverpool to the top of the English Premier League.With the game seemingly heading to a 1-1 draw after goals from Mo Salah and Son Heung-Min, Firmino produced a moment of real quality in the 90th minute, powerfully heading home from a corner to fire the visitors to a 2-1 victory. Although still early in the season, the result could prove pivotal in the title race, with both sides battling it out for the top spot ahead of kickoff. Victory moves the reigning champion three points clear of its nearest rivals.There was plenty of drama off the pitch, too, as the two managers, Jose Mourinho and Jurgen Klopp, were involved in a touchline exchange that seemingly ended amicably. \"I told him the best team lost,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime. \"He disagreed but that's his opinion. Read More\"By the way, if I behave the same way on the touchline like he does, I have no chance to stay there [...] for some reason I am different.\"Jurgen Klopp shakes hands and exchanges words with Jose Mourinho after the match. Klopp said there was \"no argument\" between the two men at full-time and added that his side deserved the late winner, in particular praising Firmino for just his third league goal of the season. \"It was a really, really good game from us. It's exactly the way you have to play. You have chances, you score the goal,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"I love talking about Bobby's [Firmino] goals but it always sounds like we are shocked [...] it's not that rare that he scores.\"He's a top-class player and he scores goals but he has some things to do for us which sometimes keep him outside of the box for us. I couldn't be more pleased for him and for us because it was a top goal and very important.\"Liverpool defender Trent Alexader-Arnold hit back at Mourinho's comment, posting on his Instagram account the caption: \"Best team won,\" which garnered supportive comments from his teammates.READ: Barcelona faces Paris Saint-Germain in pick of UCL round of 16 tiesRoberto Firmino (R) scores his team's winner on Wednesday. Liverpool is now unbeaten in its last 66 league games at Anfield, but it could have easily lost that record on Wednesday.As expected, Mourinho set his side up to punish Liverpool on the counterattack and his game plan almost paid off. Steven Bergwijn hit the post and Harry Kane missed from close range in a dramatic few minutes in the second half, but the visitor was left to rue missed opportunities. \"So close to winning, not so close to a draw,\" added a visibly frustrated Mourinho.\"We missed the chances, we had the chances, had the game under control. A draw would be a bad result so you can imagine how we feel with a defeat.\"Very good performance, of course some mistakes, some things to improve, a very unfair result. \"Today, Liverpool didn't look like a team that is champion, European champion, world champion. That difference was not on the pitch.\"Liverpool took the lead in the first half when Curtis Jones drove into the Tottenham penalty area and found Salah, whose deflected shot looped into the back of Hugo Lloris' net. Tottenham soon responded with a typical counterattacking move finished by Son -- like Salah, his 11th Premier League goal of the season -- but Firmino's late header ultimately settled the contest.

        "content": "(CNN)On a chilly English November morning, Alice Dearing has woken up before sunrise to do what she does every day of the week; swim back and forth, length after length, hour after hour, in her university's swimming pool. England is in the midst of a global pandemic, but the 23-year-old has history in her sights. In 2021, Dearing could become the first Black female swimmer to represent Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the Olympics. Only two Black swimmers have represented Britain at the Games - Kevin Burns swam at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and Paul Marshall won bronze in Moscow four years later.\"This is a chance to really help drive a positive and diverse change for a sport which does require it across the world, not just in Britain,\" Dearing tells CNN Sport.\"It's such a great opportunity to showcase the expertise that is in swimming across the Black community.\"Read MoreAs the only Black person on the British Swimming team, Dearing has sought inspiration from American Olympic gold medalists Cullen Jones and Simone Manuel and Jamaican Olympian Alia Atkinson.\"If I can help in any way display what Black swimmers can do, I want to do that,\" she adds.Dearing pictured training in Loughborough. Being the 'first' First on Dearing's radar is the rescheduled qualifier for the Olympic marathon in May in Japan, where she plans to be the highest British finisher in the women's race -- an achievement that would secure her a Tokyo 2020 spot.While she races in open water, Dearing trains nine times a week in the pool under the watchful eye of coach Andi Manley at Loughborough University in the East Midlands -- her base since 2015.She made history by playing football. Now she's changing livesAs a recognized elite training centre, the swimming pool and its gym was exempt from England's second lockdown restrictions, enabling high-performance athletes to continue with their training schedules. During her swimming session, Dearing glides through the water effortlessly, completing every drill with military precision. There is no hint of the additional stress often associated with being the \"first.\" The plaques recognizing world record holders and banners bearing the names of Olympians who have trained in what is often described as the \"Pool of Dreams,\" do not seem to phase her either as she jokes with Manley and her teammates during breaks. The daughter of a Ghanaian mother and British father, Dearing fell in love with swimming at the age of five and credits her mother, a keen swimmer, for nurturing her passion and her non-swimmer father for his constant support. \"Having two very supportive parents who want to see me succeed and will do anything in their power to help me succeed and be the best athlete I can be has been invaluable, a huge credit to my career,\" she says. Despite growing up in a diverse community in Birmingham, England's second-largest city, Dearing and her mother were often the only two Black people at swimming meets -- a fact she says she was oblivious to for the most part. She points out that while her experience within swimming has been largely positive, she has experienced racism in the sport. \"I heard a coach once referred to me as an n word. A coach who I don't know, I didn't know. I had nothing to do with them at all. So, it was quite interesting that that happened. But in general, I have had a really good experience in swimming,\" she says.More progress needs to be doneDearing is the 2016 World Junior Open Water champion. According to Swim England, only one percent of registered competitive swimmers identify as Black or mixed race. \"Our bones are too dense, we sink when we get in the water, swimming is just not meant for us, we're not meant to swim. This is what systemic racism has told Black people over decades,\" Dearing continues. \"And it's got to the point now where, of course, these myths and lies are believed because it's been repeated for so long.\"Dearing feels that while some progress has been made in diversifying swimming, more needs to be done to promote swimming as a life-saving skill and to expose ethnic minorities to the variety of career opportunities in aquatics. In a statement to CNN, British Swimming said diversity and access to aquatics sports was \"definitely on our agenda.\" \"Each of our disciplines already has action plans to enhance our representation, whilst more recently equality, diversity and inclusion has been added as a focal agenda item where it will remain at forthcoming board meetings,\" it read.Bodybuilder Rene Campbell wants to change the view of what women should look likeEarlier this year, Dearing, a 2016 World Junior Open Water champion, co-founded the Black Swimming Association (BSA), a charity which encourages swimming participation and works to prevent drowning in Black and minority ethnic communities. Over the next four years, BSA plans to reduce the percentage of Black adults and Black children who do not swim in England by five percent and also increase the number of Black children at school who can swim 25 meters by five percent. \"It's a difficult challenge, especially with the setbacks of Covid. But I really think with the partners we're working with, with having Swim England on our side, I'm really looking to connect with aquatic bodies not just in swimming, but across a whole range of sports to showcase that swimming is not just swimming, it's aquatics in general,\" she says. \"And learning to swim can open up a door, be it for being a lifeguard or surfing, or even just having a splash in a pool or in the sea on holiday.\"Dearing has also partnered with the brand Soul Cap, which makes swimming caps for thick, curly and voluminous hairstyles, like the afro.Taking it all in her stride Dearing hopes to see more people trying out swimming.Being the poster girl for Black swimming while also studying towards a master's degree in social media and political communications might be overwhelming for some, but Dearing takes it all in her stride. \"The opportunity that I have with potentially qualifying to the Olympics as being the first Black woman to swim for Britain at the Olympic Games, this is a chance to really drive home these changes, this diversity and cements that swimming is a sport for everybody,\" she adds. \"It's just about using my voice for positive change and I feel like this is the best year, well, it was meant to be year but now it's ended up being two years to do it.\"Once the Covid-19 restrictions are lifted and local swimming pools reopen for the general public, Dearing hopes to see more people trying out swimming. \"It absolutely changed my life in the most amazing way so I'd love for other people to have those opportunities and just give it a try,\" she says.While she acknowledges the importance of her advocacy work, Dearing wants her legacy to be centered on her achievements as a swimmer instead of her skin color. \"I wish that race didn't matter in the sport; it does matter,\" she adds. \"But I really hope we arrive at a place where it is just like you just get in and swim and you don't have to be seen for your color or anything like that.\"So, in the long run, I definitely just want to be remembered as a swimmer, not as the Black swimmer for Britain.\"",

The flaw in this approach, in my opinion, is obvious to any sane person,\" Lavrov said.On Monday, CNN and the investigative group Bellingcat published an exclusive investigation uncovering evidence that Russia's Federal Security Service (the FSB) formed an elite team specializing in nerve agents that trailed Navalny for years. Read MoreCNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned Navalny fell ill during a four-hour flight on August 20 from Tomsk to Moscow. The plane's captain diverted to the city of Omsk and requested medical help and it was later found that the Russian opposition leader had been poisoned by Novichok. He nearly died.Lavrov's comment marks the first reaction from a Russian official, as authorities have largely refrained from commenting on the findings. The Kremlin canceled their daily press briefings on Tuesday and Wednesday due to \"preparations\" for President Vladimir Putin's annual news conference on Thursday.In the United States, GOP congressman Michael McCaul said Wednesday that the CNN-Bellingcat report \"uncovers truly disturbing information about the Putin regime's culpability in the poisoning of Alexey Navalny.\"McCaul is the most senior Republican member on the House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs. In a short statement to CNN, McCaul urged the current US administration to complete an investigation into poisoning as requested by himself and Democrat Rep Eliot Engel. McCaul said the administration should \"release its findings immediately so the United States can hold those responsible to account for this inexcusable behavior.\"Navalny told CNN that he was certain Putin knew of the elaborate shadowing operation before he was poisoned. \"I am totally sure that Putin was aware,\" Navalny said on Tuesday, during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\"The operation of such skill and for such a long time cannot exist without a ruling from the chief of (the Russian Federal Security Service) FSB, Mr. Bortnikov. And he would never dare it without the direct order of President Putin.\"The European Union has since imposed sanctions on several senior officials including Alexander Bortnikov, saying he was \"responsible for providing support to the persons who carried out or were involved in the poisoning\" of Navalny.",

She died in hospital in February 2013 after suffering a cardiac arrest from which she could not be resuscitated, the coroner reported on Wednesday.The girl suffered from severe asthma that caused episodes of cardiac and respiratory arrest, and frequent emergency hospital admissions over three years.Her medical cause of death was listed as acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure. The coroner's conclusion was that Ella \"died of asthma contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution.\"Ella, who died in February 2013, is thought to be the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death.The charities Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation said Ella was the first person in world history to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate.Read MoreAssistant coroner Philip Barlow said that Ella's mother had not been given information about air pollution and asthma that could have led to her take steps which \"might\" have prevented her daughter's death, according to PA Media.\"Air pollution was a significant contributory factor to both the induction and exacerbation of her asthma,\" said Barlow as he gave his conclusions at Southwark Coroner's Court after a two-week inquest.New EPA rule could make it more difficult to limit air pollution\"During the course of her illness between 2010 and 2013 she was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter in excess of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.\"\"The principal source of her exposure was traffic emissions,\" he said, according to PA.Barlow said there was a failure in this period to reduce the level of nitrogen dioxide to within the limits set by EU and domestic law.\"We've got the justice for her which she so deserved,\" Ella's mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, said after the ruling.But she added: \"Also it's about other children still as we walk around our city of high levels of air pollution.\"\"Her legacy would be to bring in a new Clean Air Act and for governments -- I'm not just talking about the UK government -- governments around the world to take this matter seriously,\" said Kissi-Debrah, reported PA.\"I still think there's a lack of understanding about the damage it does to young lungs, especially that are not truly formed.\"Ella's mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, said her daughter got the justice she deserved.Kissi-Debrah said she would prefer to see a public awareness campaign about the damage air pollution can do \"rather than a blame game.\"A previous inquest ruling from 2014, which concluded Ella died of acute respiratory failure, was quashed by the High Court following new evidence about the dangerous levels of air pollution close to her home, PA reported.London Mayor Sadiq Khan called it a \"landmark moment\" and praised Ella's mother for her \"extraordinary\" courage and years of campaigning.\"Toxic air pollution is a public health crisis, especially for our children,\" he said in a statement. \"Today must be a turning point so that other families do not have to suffer the same heartbreak as Ella's family.\"Activists are fighting for a renewable future in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chinese coal projects threaten to dirty those plansA 2018 report by Stephen Holgate, a professor at the University of Southampton, found air pollution levels at the Catford monitoring station a mile from where Ella lived \"consistently\" exceeded lawful EU limits over the three years before her death, according to PA. \"If we want a healthy generation to come into the world, we are going to have to clean up our environment,\" Holgate told a news briefing after the inquest.He said the health and medical profession must start \"taking ownership of some of these problems\" as they had with smoking.\"Our hearts go out to Ella's family who have fought tirelessly for today's landmark outcome,\" said Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation.\"Ella's legacy has firmly put the spotlight on the invisible dangers of breathing dirty air,\" particularly for those with asthma or lung diseases, she said, criticizing \"inadequate air quality laws and policies.\"\"Today's verdict sets the precedent for a seismic shift in the pace and extent to which the government, local authorities and clinicians must now work together to tackle the country's air pollution health crisis,\" she added.A UK government spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with Ella's family and friends.\"The spokesperson said the government was delivering a \u00a33.8 billion plan to clean up transport, tackle NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) pollution and go further in protecting communities from air pollution, as well as setting \"ambitious new air quality targets.\"",

The new rules will see non-essential retail and services as well schools and kindergartens close until January 10, 2021, and Christmas gatherings will be reduced from 10 people to just five from two different households.Merkel warned the German parliament a week ago that nationwide restrictions brought in on November 2 had been ineffective and action was needed to prevent exponential growth in the figures. \"If we have too many contacts now before Christmas, and that ends up making it the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we will have failed.

It represents a stark warning for other countries battling a Covid-19 winter surge.Germany was previously hailed for its success in containing the virus thanks to decisive early action, a world-class health system and an exemplary test-and-trace program.An earlier version of this story misstated the gap in Saxony's figures released on Wednesday.

Vertonghen, who left Tottenham for Benfica at the end of last season, was bloodied and visibly dazed after colliding with former teammate Toby Alderweireld during a Champions League game in May last year. At the time, Vertonghen was treated by medical staff and cleared to keep playing. But soon afterward, he staggered to the touchline and had to be helped off the pitch, keeling over and retching.\"A lot of people don't know that, but for a long time, I suffered from it a lot: headaches and dizziness,\" Vertonghen told Belgium's Sporza TV on Tuesday, as the Belgian international reflected on how the incident had impacted his career.\"That's the first time I've said that now. I shouldn't have continued to play on and I was struggling for a total of nine months and I could therefore not bring what I wanted (to the pitch).\"Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresVertonghen is helped from the field during Tottenham's Champions League game against Ajax in 2019.The response was prompted when Vertonghen, 33, was asked about being substituted in the first-half of Tottenham's Premier League game against Southampton earlier this year. It appeared the Belgian international was frustrated at Spurs coach Jose Mourinho during the game in February, but he now says it was anger at his own performance due to the lingering effects of the head clash. \"At that substitution, everyone thought I was angry with Mourinho, but at that point I just couldn't (continue) anymore. \"I still had a year contract, so I had to play. But when I played, I played badly. Not many people knew that, that was my own choice, I am not blaming anyone.\"I just didn't know what to do. It was game after game and practice after practice. Each time there was a new impact. \"Then the lockdown came and I was able to rest for two months and afterward it was better.\"Vertonghen joined Portuguese club Benfica on a three-year deal in August having spent eight years with the North London club.Vertonghen left Tottenham for Benfica at the end of last season. READ: PSG faces anxious wait on Neymar injuryConcussion guidelinesCNN contacted Tottenham for comment but did not immediately receive a response. At the time, the club said its medical staff strictly followed the English Football Association's concussion guidelines. Vertonghen was judged to be alert after the incident and responded to questions \"correctly and lucidly,\" according to Tottenham.Mauricio Pochettino, who was then Spurs manager, said his medical staff and the referees were \"excellent\" and followed the correct protocols, while Tottenham also said Vertonghen had undergone further tests and seen an independent neurologist, after which it was judged he did not suffer a concussion. According to brain injury association Headway, dizziness and headaches are sometimes associated with what is often called post-concussion syndrome.\"In many cases, these symptoms resolve themselves within a few days or weeks. However, in some cases problems can persist for months, but still resolve themselves eventually,\" says Headway.On Wednesday, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), football's rule-making body, agreed to trial additional substitutions when players leave the field with a concussion from January 2021. \"The members agreed that, in the event of an actual or suspected concussion, the player in question should be permanently removed from the match to protect their welfare, but the player's team should not suffer a numerical disadvantage,\" said a statement from the IFAB.

        "content": "(CNN)It may sound a bit \"Dr. Doolittle,\" but it turns out kangaroos can communicate with humans.Researchers found that kangaroos \"intentionally\" communicated with humans -- a behavior that was previously thought to be reserved for domesticated animals, like dogs, horses or goats. Experts from London's University of Roehampton and the University of Sydney set up a task, known as \"the unsolvable problem task,\" where they presented kangaroos with food trapped inside a plastic container. After trying, and failing, to open the boxes, the kangaroos turned their gaze on a nearby human -- and sometimes even nudged or scratched them to ask for help, researchers said.It's all in the eyesRead More\"Their gaze was pretty intense,\" co-author Alexandra Green, a post-doctoral researcher in the Sydney School of Veterinary Science at the University of Sydney, said in a statement.\"We've previously thought only domesticated animals try to ask for help with a problem. But kangaroos do it too. If they can't open the box, they look at the human and back to the container. Some of them used their nose to nudge the human and some approached the human and started scratching at him asking for assistance.\"Sorry, folks -- your dog doesn't really know what you're talking about Based on these new findings, the team believe kangaroos -- considered social animals, like dogs and goats -- may be able to adapt their behavior to interact with humans.\"Through this study, we were able to see that communication between animals can be learnt and that the behaviour of gazing at humans to access food is not related to domestication,\" lead author Alan McElligott said in a statement.\"Indeed, kangaroos showed a very similar pattern of behaviour we have seen in dogs, horses and even goats when put to the same test,\" McElligott, who was previously associated with the University of Roehampton and is now an associate professor in animal behavior and welfare at City University of Hong Kong, added.Cats understand their names and are probably just choosing to ignore you, a study suggestsTen out of 11 kangaroos tested in the study \"actively\" looked at the person who had placed the food in the plastic container to get it. Nine of the 11 animals engaged in a \"heightened form of communication,\" researchers said, alternating their gaze between the container and the person present.The study involved captive animals from a number of zoos in Australia. The animals, although familiar with humans, were considered non-domesticated. \"Our research shows that the potential for referential intentional communication towards humans by animals has been underestimated, which signals an exciting development in this area,\" McElligott said. \"Kangaroos are the first marsupials to be studied in this manner and the positive results should lead to more cognitive research beyond the usual domestic species,\" he added.The research was published in the journal Biology Letters on Wednesday.",

        "content": "(CNN)Hungary's parliament has voted to redefine the concept of \"family\" in the country's constitution, a move that will effectively bar same sex couples from adopting children. The move has been met with outcry from human rights groups and LGBTQ advocates.The country's politicians approved the bill on Tuesday. The new law defines marriage as between a man and a woman and asserts that the \"foundation of the family is marriage and the parent-child relationship. The mother is a woman, the father is a man.\"  As a rule, only a married couple in Hungary can adopt, with some exceptions made for single people, which would have previously been the pathway for a same sex couple.Rights groups have decried the new law. \"This is a dark day for Hungary's LGBTQ community and a dark day for human rights,\" said David Vig, director of Amnesty Hungary.Hungary bans people from legally changing gender\"These discriminatory, homophobic and transphobic new laws -- rushed through under the cover of the coronavirus pandemic -- are just the latest attack on LGBTQ people by Hungarian authorities,\" Vig added.Read MoreMasen David, executive director of human rights organisation Transgender Europe, called on EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen \"to address the rights of LGBT parents, the attempt to erase gender diverse children, and the ban on legal gender recognition in the Commission's rule of law assessment and on-going Article 7 TEU proceedings against Hungary.\"While Hungary is a member of the European Union, Prime Minister Victor Orban has been forging his own path in recent years, passing a rash of laws that EU leaders have warned will undermine the country's democracy. In May, Hungary made it illegal for transgender and intersex people to change their gender on identity documents. And though the country currently recognizes legal unions for same-sex couples, the ruling Fidesz party and its leader, Orban, oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage. The Prime Minister's office on Tuesday hailed the bill barring same-sex adoption, saying it was intended \"to strengthen the protection of Hungarian families and the safety of our children.\"The stance of Hungary's conservative lawmakers was also clearly reflected in the justification section of Tuesday's bill, which states, \"The Fundamental Law of Hungary is a living framework that expresses the will of the nation, the form in which we want to live. However, the 'modern' set of ideas that make all traditional values, including the two sexes, relative is a growing concern.\"Earlier this year, Hungary lost points in a ranking of European countries for LGBTI rights by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) because of \"policies targeting LGBTI communities.\"The decision comes just months after a major EU survey found that six in ten LGBTI people in Europe avoid holding hands in public for fear of discrimination, and that 43% had been discriminated against in the past year.",

However, a heavy 3-0 defeat to Juventus in the final match day meant Barca became the first team in Champions League history to win its opening five matches and not finish top of the group.PSG, meanwhile, was beaten by Lyon on Sunday to leave the top of Ligue 1 looking very congested. Defeat leaves PSG in third and just one point off leader Lille, but just six points separates first and seventh.However, more worryingly than its patchy form, PSG star forward Neymar was stretchered off in tears with what appears to be a left ankle injury sustained after a heavy challenge from Lyon's Thiago Mendes.PSG now faces an anxious wait to find out the extent of the damage and whether Neymar will be fit in time to face his former club when the Champions League resumes in February.Neymar could miss PSG's round of 16 clash with an injury.Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid and Chelsea provide an intriguing match up of those two clubs' respective coaches, with the wily, battle-hardened Diego Simeone going up against the more inexperienced Frank Lampard.The London club have at times looked exhilarating in attack under Lampard, but have so far failed to find consistency. After only just scraping through last season's group stages, Chelsea progressed at a canter this time round, firing 14 goals and conceding just two to impressively top Group E.Conversely, Atletico has struggled to find form in the Champions League and needed to avoid defeat against RB Salzburg in the final group stage game to guarantee a place in the last 16.While domestic form, despite defeat to Real Madrid on Saturday, has seen Simeone's side set the early pace in La Liga, Atleti has so far failed to find its feet in Europe. Could this season see the Argentine coach prioritize trying to win a first league title since 2014 over European glory?Chelsea qualified comfortably for the round of 16, conceding just two goals along the way,Defending champion Bayern Munich has been handed a tricky tie against an exciting Lazio side.Bayern, like most of the teams in the knockout stages, has struggled to find domestic consistency in recent weeks -- in fact, none of the 16 teams remaining in the Champions League are currently top of their respective leagues.However, Hansi Flick's side remain a daunting opponent for any team and are rightfully the bookmakers' favorite to win back-to-back titles. In striker Robert Lewandowski, a would-be Ballon d'Or contender, it boasts the best striker in Europe, with the Pole already netting 13 goals this season.Perhaps most concerningly for Bayern's European rivals is that the Bavarian club arguably only got stronger following last season's triumph. Despite losing midfield maestro Thiago to Liverpool and Philippe Coutinho returning to Barcelona, Bayern has bolstered its ranks with the additions of Leroy Sane from Manchester City and highly-rated Spanish youngster Marc Roca, as well as the return of winger Douglas Costa.Intriguingly, Lazio boasts the only man that was able to surpass Lewandowski's goal tally last season. In Ciro Immobile, the Italian side possesses one of Europe's most dangerous marksmen. Bayern fans will remember the Italian for a less than impressive stint while at German rival Borussia Dortmund in 2014-15, but Immobile has found a happy home in the Italian capital as the focal point of Simone Inzaghi's forward-thinking side.It will certainly be a tall order to get past the juggernaut that is Bayern, but Lazio possesses the tools to cause an upset.Robert Lewandowski already has 13 goals this season.Draw in fullBorussia Monchengladbach vs. Manchester CityLazio vs. Bayern MunichAtletico Madrid vs. ChelseaRB Leipzig vs. LiverpoolPorto vs. JuventusBarcelona vs. PSGSevilla vs. Borussia DortmundAtalanta vs. Real MadridThe first legs of the round of 16 will take place on 16-17 February and the second legs on 9-10 March.Europa League drawWolfsberger AC vs. Tottenham HotspurFC Dynamo Kyiv vs. Club BruggeReal Sociedad vs. Manchester UnitedBenfica vs. ArsenalRed Star Belgrade vs. AC MilanRoyal Antwerp vs. RangersSlavia Prague vs. Leicester CityFC Salzburg vs. Villarreal FC Braga vs. AS RomaFC Krasnodar vs. Dinamo ZagrebYoung Boys vs. Bayer LeverkusenMolde vs. TSG HoffenheimGranada vs. SSC NapoliMaccabi Tel-Aviv vs. FC Shakhtar DonetskLOSC Lille vs. AjaxOlympiakos vs. PSV EindhovenThe first legs will take place on Thursday 18 February, with the second legs on Thursday 25 February.However, Tottenham Hotspur's home game against Wolfsberger AC will be on Wednesday 24 February due to UEFA Europa League clash with Arsenal, who are also seeded.

But a stunning last gasp 47-42 win against their division rival Cleveland Browns might just spark a thrilling end to the season for the team.The Ravens now hold an 8-5 record -- just one win fewer than the Browns in a tight AFC North division.The Steelers are out in front with an 11-2 record but, theoretically, any one of the three teams could still clinch the division title.The fine margins matter at the sharp end of the season, and that was no clearer than in Monday's barnstormer of a game.READ: The NFL is confronting racism, but are Black quarterbacks continuing to be stereotyped?With three games remaining, the third-placed Baltimore Ravens could still clinch the AFC North title.Read MoreComing up against a strong Browns team, which has secured its first winning season since 2007, an extra yard here and a dropped catch there, and the Ravens could have been on the losing side.It was a clash of differing offensive styles. The Browns looked to throw first as quarterback Baker Mayfield attempted 47 passes, making just 28 of those attempts -- nearly 10% below his average completion percentage. In contrast, the Ravens relied on Jackson's running ability to lead the team to victory. He rushed for 124 yards and two touchdowns -- his most rushing yards in a game since October 2019, and his first game with two rushing touchdowns since November 2019.A sloppy opening quarter saw the Browns penalized three times in the first 10 minutes of the game. Things got worse for the team as kicker Cody Parkey missed a field goal in the opening moments of the second quarter -- something that would come back to bite them.READ: NFL charging ahead with Super Bowl dreams as Covid-19 threatens to derail path to TampaBaker Mayfield threw three touchdown passes on Monday, but recorded an interception too.\nThe Ravens led 21-14 at the half, which soon became 28-14 at the beginning of the third quarter.Jackson went off with cramp in the third quarter, leaving back up Trace McSorley in charge. McSorley went down with an injury after just a handful of plays, leaving the Ravens without a quarterback. Jackson saved his team with an immediate return though, knowing they needed his help.A Mayfield interception in the third quarter was a setback for the Browns, but he led the surge in the fourth with a 22-point comeback. Their defense kept them in the game, and with two minutes remaining, the Browns led 35-34.One minute and two touchdowns later and the scores were level at 42-42.Then the Ravens drove upfield, ran the clock down and with seven seconds left, Justin Tucker slotted home a field goal to take the score to 45-42 with two seconds remaining.Justin Tucker was calm enough to slot home the game-winning field goal.On the final play, the Ravens forced a meaningless safety that added an extra two-points to their tally.Speaking after the breathless game, Ravens' coach John Harbaugh said it would \"go down in history.\"\"If you wrote a movie about this, people wouldn't believe it,\" Harbaugh said. \"They would say it could never happen.\"Jackson added that once he saw McSorley injured, he knew he had to step up.\"As I'm seeing [McSorley] go down, I was still stretching,\" Jackson said. \"I was catching an attitude, because it wasn't going the way we wanted it to. And then I saw him go down, and I was like, 'We've got to start now. We've just got to go out there now.' And I started running out there.\"\"And here comes Lamar Jackson!\"A moment we'll all remember. \ud83d\ude08 pic.twitter.com/q3HLI9U3Hg\u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) December 15, 2020 This nail-biting victory may be the lift the Ravens need after a disappointing 2020 season.Last year brought a 14-2 division-winning season, a spot in the playoffs and an MVP award for Jackson in just his second year in the league.This season has been a little tougher for the team, with more than 20 players sidelined at one point with Covid-19 -- including Jackson -- and a reported four strains of the virus found in the team's facility.Jackson's season hasn't mirrored his breakout 2019 season.Jackson had his best rushing game since the 2019 season, racking up 124 yards and two touchdowns. In 15 games in 2019, he threw for 36 touchdowns and only six interceptions, while rushing for 1,206 yards and seven touchdowns.This year, in his 12 games, he has thrown only 18 touchdowns with seven interceptions, rushing for 793 yards and six touchdowns. All sport is a game of 'ifs' and 'buts,' and that was no clearer than with Parkey's missed field goal. Maybe the game goes to overtime. Maybe the Browns win and go to 10-3, one step closer to their first playoff appearance since 2002.As things stand, the Ravens remain in the playoff hunt in a tough AFC.",

        "content": "(CNN)With 13th and 14th placed finishes in Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Scuderia Ferrari recorded its worst season since 1980. It has been a disastrous year.\"It has been a difficult season for us and it's a shame to end it like this,\" Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc told the team's website after Sunday's race. \"All the same, we have made some progress over the past few races, and hopefully we can continue doing so over the winter to come back stronger next year.\"READ: Will we ever see another Formula One champion like Lewis Hamilton?In 2020, Ferrari recorded its worst season finish in 40 years.Having finished second in the Formula One constructors' championship three years running -- from 2017 to 2019 -- Ferrari dropped to sixth this year.Read MoreIn 2019, the team notched 19 podiums finishes, including three wins, between its two drivers. This year, the team has achieved three podiums total.A crazy year and a very tough season.But we will remember this weekend as incredibly emotional \u2665\ufe0fUn grande grazie a tutti voi \ud83e\udd17#essereFerrari \ud83d\udd34 pic.twitter.com/AMjJDvqJB6\u2014 Scuderia Ferrari (@ScuderiaFerrari) December 14, 2020 In a sport where, year on year, progress is expected, Ferrari's drop in performance has been staggering -- and this in a season the team celebrated its 1000th Grand Prix.PA media's F1 correspondent Phil Duncan said it had been a year to forget for the Italian marque.\"If they're in a similar position next year as they have been this year, then that's just not good enough,\" Duncan told CNN. \"For a team like Ferrari, who are the most successful team in the sport, and haven't won a world championship since 2007. That's just not good enough.\"So what has gone wrong for the team of Michael Schumacher, Niki Lauda and John Surtees? And can it bounce back in 2021?The Vettel issueWith 16 constructors' titles, no team in F1 history comes close to Ferrari's success. Williams is second with nine.The Italian team started the new millennium well. Five constructors' titles and drivers' titles with Michael Schumacher between 2000-2004, before another duo of wins with Kimi Raikkonen in 2007. But then the winning stopped. In 2015, four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel joined and many believed more titles would be added to the team's roll of honors. The German finished second in the 2017 and 2018 drivers' title fights, but that's as good as it got and, over the last two years, 23-year-old Leclerc has outshone Vettel.Sebastian Vettel earned three wins with Ferrari in 2015, his first season with the team.Senior writer for Formula1.com Lawrence Barretto says Leclerc's rise will have changed how Ferrari perceived its supposed number one driver, and how Vettel saw himself too.\"When Charles came in and got seven poles last year, won races, it became clear that Sebastian wasn't as far ahead as I think Ferrari assumed he would be at the end of that year. And I think that put the pressure on him coming into this year,\" he tells CNN. Earlier this year it was announced Vettel would be replaced by Carlos Sainz at Ferrari, making it clear that rising star Leclerc was the team's future. But Duncan does not believe Vettel's loss of confidence stems from Leclerc's rise. \"He's gone up against Lewis [Hamilton] and Lewis has basically just wiped the floor with him,\" Duncan says. \"And he's been on a downward spiral now since about the middle of 2018 when he crashed out from leading the German Grand Prix.\"That race wasn't the only incident which indicated Vettel was starting to crack under the pressure of being Ferrari's number one driver.Vettel came up short going head-to-head with Lewis Hamilton in 2017 and 2018.In Azerbaijan in 2017, Vettel purposefully drove into the side of Hamilton's car after believing the Briton had brake-tested him -- purposefully jumping on the brakes in order to force the person behind to do the same or swerve out of the way to avoid a crash. He could have taken the 2017 championship lead in Singapore but, starting from pole position, a collision with Raikkonen and Max Verstappen at turn one ended the race for all three. Hamilton won the race and took a lead in the standings he wouldn't relinquish for the remainder of the season.In 2018, things got worse. Numerous grid penalties and unnecessary collisions mounted to a huge number of lost points. The incident in Germany was the most scarring of the lot.The effects of those errors were felt this year. The average starting positions on grid were 8.3 for Leclerc and 12.2 for Vettel, with average finishes -- excluding retirements -- of 5.4 and 9.2 respectively.Only at the Turkish Grand Prix have we seen a glimpse of Vettel at his best again.The 2020 Turkish Grand Prix brought Vettel his only podium of the year in difficult racing conditions.Recent resurfacing of the track and wet weather meant drivers struggled to get the power down. A freshly laid track is slippy without any rain, so the addition of poor weather in Turkey made matters even more difficult. Minutely too much throttle and you spin out. Too little and you're nowhere. The talent of Ferrari's drivers shone through as, in these tricky conditions, Vettel finished third with Leclerc a place behind.  So, Ferrari's slump isn't just down to the drivers -- to Vettel's loss of confidence, or a sophomore slump for Leclerc. The car hasn't been good enough when driving in ideal racing conditions.Regulation nightmareTowards the end of 2019, Ferrari had a run of six races where one of its cars started on pole position. That ended at the United States Grand Prix, when a rules clarification meant the engine had to be modified. Regular FIA (Federation Internationale de l'Automobile) checks hadn't found anything illegal, but the changes reduced the team's ability to race at the same level through the remaining two races. Ferrari maintains its innocence but, during the winter break that year, the team reached a private settlement with the FIA over its engine -- the details of which have not being made public.More engine rule changes prior to the beginning of the 2020 season also affected Ferrari more than any other engine supplier. It was recorded at the 2020 Belgian Grand Prix in August that the cars were, on average, 10 km/h (6 mph) slower than in 2019.Ferrari's incredible qualifying pace in 2019 brought Vettel and Leclerc an average starting position of 4.3 and 4.4 respectively, with average race finishes, excluding retirements, of 4.6 and 3.8.Ferrari were much faster in 2019, taking multiple victories including at Singapore where the team recorded a 1-2 finish -- the victory was the last of Vettel's at Ferrari, and is the team's most recent win in F1.As mentioned, in 2020, their average starting positions and race finishes were far worse just one year later.Yet Ferrari's standards should be higher than that. Fortunately for the team, it has been able to invest in the 2021 car and engine before the new budget cap is introduced next year. To create a more level playing-field, and to end the dominance of a single team -- Mercedes -- the cap begins at $145 million for 2021, $140 million for 2022 before staying at $135 million for 2023-25.For Ferrari, a team that reportedly spends $400 million per year, it has been imperative it prepares for 2021 during the 2020 season.\"[Ferrari] can hopefully make as many gains as it can and use its maximum resources up until obviously the deadline at the end of this year,\" says Barretto. \"From a power unit perspective, that's great.\"On the aerodynamics side, it's going to be slightly more challenging for them to make big gains because of the relative stability and regulations from this year into next year.\"In statement sent to CNN, Ferrari said the team had a \"difficult year.\"\"However, in the second part of the season, even though our results did not entirely show this, we've started to introduce a few upgrades which improved the performance of our car and confirmed the development is going in the right direction. This is a positive signal, in view of next season.\"True that in 2021 the basics of the car will be freezed for development, but there is the possibility to improve it in certain areas using the so called tokens allowed by the regulations, which we spent in the rear area of the car. Then, we will have a completely new PU [power unit] -- an area where development is free -- which is currently running at the dyno -- and feedback on performance is encouraging.\"Leadership and stabilityIn any other year, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto might have been fired for such a disastrous season.But, so far, the 51-year-old has retained the confidence of a team that, since 2014, has had three team principals -- a remarkable turnover for a team which, prior to 2014, had had only two team principals in 21 years. Mattia Binotto has been team principal of Scuderia Ferrari since late 2018.Former Ferrari chairman and chief executive Sergio Marchionne, who took over in 2014, applied constant pressure to his principals.\"The pressure was such that you had always your mobile [phone] next to you, day and night, because if he was sending you a WhatsApp, you had to reply within 30 seconds,\" Binotto told F1's Beyond the Grid podcast about life under Marchionne.Louis Camilleri succeeded Marchionne after the latter's untimely death in late 2018.In the same podcast, Binotto says of Camilleri: \"He understands the importance of stability, he understands the importance of investing.\"But the future is now uncertain after Camilleri resigned with immediate effect ahead of the final Grand Prix weekend of the season to be replaced by chairman John Elkann on an interim basis.Louis Camilleri's (center) surprise resignation as CEO of Ferrari has cast doubt over Binotto's position as team principal.Asked whether there would be a restructuring of management as a result of the performances during this season, Ferrari's statement said that \"during the course of the 2020 season, the Scuderia has gone through a reorganisation of its technical department to render it more effective and assure a better performance development.\"\"The structure of Scuderia Ferrari is in continuous and ongoing evolution, also to face the introduction of new regulations in 2021.\"With regards to the Team Principal Mattia Binotto, he always had and still has the full support of the top management,\" added the Ferrari statement.A new startIn 2021, Ferrari will be hoping new driver Sainz will help the recovery.Barretto says the team has a \"leader\" in Sainz, who replaces Vettel at Ferrari after two years with McLaren.\"He's going to move to Italy and spend as much time as he can at the factory and he's going to embed himself in there,\" says Barretto. \"I think when they see that hunger, they're going to want to try and build on that.\"Carlos Sainz joins Ferrari from McLaren for the 2021 season and has said the team needs to take a \"very big step\" to get back to the front of the grid.Earlier this year, Sainz said: \"I'll be the first one in the factory pushing to find more power and I'll be pushing everyone as soon as I get there.\"It's a long way -- they need to do a very, very, very, very big step to get back to where we all are but if anyone can do it, it's Ferrari.\"Ferrari is not a team accustomed to scrapping in the midfield of the grid, something which Duncan describes as \"depressing to see.\" A team that should be focused on winning and competing at the front has been reduced to hopes for the future. Barretto isn't as confident that huge improvements will happen in 2021. Instead, the regulation overhaul in 2022 could be key to Ferrari's return to the top.\"Because the [2021] regulations don't give you a chance to go wild, it's going to be difficult for Ferrari to make a jump back up to the front of the field. And I imagine that they are quite realistic about the fact that while they can make gains next year, the big gains will come in 2022.\"",

He decided to step down as manager of English side Aston Villa in 2011 after he suffered a dissection of the descending aorta.

The Frenchman then became joint manager of Liverpool alongside Roy Evans n 1998. Evans resigned just three months later, leaving Houiller to take sole charge of Liverpool, leading the club to a treble in the 2000-01 season. After undergoing that heart surgery in 2001, Houllier later returned to the dugout and remained at Liverpool for another three years before leaving in 2004. Transforming Liverpool into a more professional club is something Houllier is credited with during his time on Merseyside. \"I would say to the players that football is the only profession where you cannot enjoy the rewards until you retire,\" Houllier told the Telegraph in 2019.\"Do not go to the nightclub, buy it at the end of your career. Some players use their job to have a good time. You can do that in some professions -- have a good holiday, nights out. As a professional footballer you cannot.\"We had to convince players to change their diet and make sure they rested properly. I remember giving Jamie Carragher a list of players in England who were heavy drinkers, all past their peak at the age of 26.\"There were those who made the maximum of their career by realising that, while focusing on your job means you are not sure to succeed, if you do not you are sure to fail.

        "content": "(CNN)Michael Phelps, who retired as the most decorated Olympian in history in 2016, is not holding out much hope for a clean Olympics Games in Tokyo next year.Asked how clean he thinks the Games will be the 23-time Olympic gold medalist bluntly told CNN Sport's Don Riddell: \"Four or five\" out of 10.\"I can honestly say that throughout my whole entire career, I don't know if I ever competed in a clean field,\" added Phelps.  \"If that's the case, then yeah, I don't think anything's changed.  \"I think there's a lot of issues out there and the fact that we're not held on the same playing field is really upsetting.\"Read MoreThis year marked the eight-year-anniversary of the 2012 Olympics in London, where Phelps won four gold medals.Michael Phelps says the pandemic has been 'one of the scariest times' for his mental healthThose Games have been described as the dirtiest Olympics in history, with more than 130 athletes banned or disqualified for doping offenses, according to Olympedia.68 of those athletes were found via a re-analysis program that continues to re-test samples from previous Olympic Games.Meanwhile, according to a New York Times report, of approximately 11,000 athletes who competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, about one out of every 100 competitor had served suspensions or had to return medals because of doping.Phelps, who was outspoken on drug cheats throughout his career, says he can \"guarantee\" no athlete has been tested as much as he was on an Olympic level and insists everyone should be held to the same high standards. \"If we're all getting tested like that, great, but I know we're not,\" added the 35-year-old. \"Until we are, until we're all held on the same level, nothing's going to change.\" The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the drug testing at the Games, has maintained that fighting for clean sport is among its top priorities. CNN reached out to the World Anti-Doping Agency which referred it to the IOC. In response to CNN's request for comment, the IOC stressed a number of anti-doping measures that the organization had introduced, notably the work of an expert group, led by the International Testing Agency (ITA), to close testing gaps ahead of the Games.It also said the Olympic Movement spends $260 million every four years to fight against doping, with $136 million coming from the IOC directly.READ: US swimmer Caeleb Dressel breaks two world records in one hourPhelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump announced he had signed into law the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, allowing the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events.Named after whistleblower Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who helped expose the Russian doping scandal, the act passed through the senate unopposed in November. \"Doping will remain an enormous problem in the Olympics until dopers and their enablers face jail time for defrauding other athletes,\" Jim Walden, author of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act and lawyer for Rodchenkov, told CNN Sport on Friday. \"The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, just signed into law in the U.S. on December 4, 2020, is the necessary first step. Now the Department of Justice must create an ambitious program to implement it, and give it teeth. If DOJ does this quickly, I think we'll have a cleaner Olympics.\" 'It's good to see change'While Phelps hopes for a cleaner Olympics, he also thinks the Tokyo Games will be a chance for athletes to stand up for what they believe in.The IOC is currently consulting the organization's Athletes' Commission before deciding whether to relax its stance against protests.Current IOC guidelines ban any form of protest at the Olympics, including taking a knee, raising a fist or refusing to follow protocol at medal ceremonies.The consultation came about following the rise in sports stars taking a stand against racism, especially since the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum after the death of George Floyd.For example, English Premier League teams began taking a knee ahead of every game in opposition to systemic racism and NBA teams staged a walkout during the playoffs to protest police brutality after the shooting of Jacob Blake.Olympics chief Thomas Bach 'very, very confident' spectators can attend postponed Tokyo GamesThe United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) recently announced that they will not sanction Team USA athletes for peaceful protests during the Games. \"I feel like I have a platform to stand and to talk about the things that I feel like are important,\" said Phelps.\"I also feel like everybody has that opportunity. We all have the opportunity to stand and shout our values.\"It's good to see this, it's good to see change and I think we have to go through comfortable and uncomfortable times in order to see the change that we want in the long run.\"This year has been scary. It's been frightening. It's been overwhelming. But I feel like this year, I think we've learned a lot about everything and hopefully, we're able to catapult this into making significant change and not only in the US but worldwide.\"Phelps says he wouldn't be surprised to see athletes protest on the podium either way but just hopes they do so respectfully. \"The greatest part is standing on the medal podium, listening to your national anthem play with a medal around your neck. There is no greater thing that I can say in sports that I've ever experienced,\" he said.\"So if anybody is out there and they are doing that, I just say be respectful because, you know, for me, I'm a proud American, and standing on that, representing my country, that was something that was a tremendous honor.\" READ: Breakdancing to make its Olympic debut at Paris 2024JUST WATCHEDTokyo 2020's Olympic gymnastics test runReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTokyo 2020's Olympic gymnastics test run 03:24'I just don't see how it can happen'Phelps has been consistently open about his psychological struggles this year, saying the pandemic and resulting lockdowns put a severe strain on his mental health. He said he also worried for those athletes who had been preparing for the Games in 2020, only to be told they'd have to wait another year. Organizers have said they are confident the postponed Games will go ahead next year, but Phelps is unsure about the logistics of hosting such a large-scale event during such uncertain times.\"The fact that you're going to put ten thousand plus athletes, plus all the volunteers, plus all the coaches, it doesn't make sense to me. I just don't see how it can happen,\" he said. \"But fingers crossed that everything with vaccines and everything goes smoothly on that front. But, I mean, I don't know, there's just too much unknown.\"Phelps was speaking to CNN through his involvement with the Colgate Optimism Project.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Scientists have digitally rebuilt the brain of a dinosaur, revealing \"surprising\" insights into its diet and behavior.Using advanced imaging and 3D modeling techniques, researchers from the UK's University of Bristol \"rebuilt\" the brain of a Thecodontosaurus, a sauropod that roamed what is now England some 205 million years ago.New 'sea dragon' species discovered by amateur fossil hunter off English coastExperts found that unlike its plant-eating relatives Diplodocus and Brontosaurus, Thecodontosaurus may have eaten meat -- and could have walked on two legs.\"Our analysis of Thecodontosaurus' brain uncovered many fascinating features, some of which were quite surprising,\" Antonio Ballell, a PhD student at the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, said in a statement.\"Whereas its later relatives moved around ponderously on all fours, our findings suggest this species may have walked on two legs and been occasionally carnivorous,\" Ballell, the study's lead author, added. Read MoreDiagram shows evolution of the endocast -- the space inside the braincase that contained the brain -- in sauropodomorphs, Thecodontosaurus' closest relatives.Thecodontosaurus, whose name means \"socket-toothed lizard,\" was a dinosaur the size of a large dog and lived in the late Triassic age. Large fossils of the dinosaur, also known as the \"Bristol dinosaur,\" were discovered in the 1800s, but scientists have only recently been able to study the specimens in detail without destroying them, using 3D models generated from CT scans. Experts digitally extracted bone from the rock, and identified anatomical details about the dinosaur's brain and inner ear that had not yet been seen in the fossil.T. rex had a teenage growth spurt \u2014 but not all dinos did \"Even though the actual brain is long gone, the software allows us to recreate brain and inner ear shape via the dimensions of the cavities left behind,\" Ballell explained. \"The braincase of Thecodontosaurus is beautifully preserved so we compared it to other dinosaurs, identifying common features and some that are specific to Thecodontosaurus,\" Ballell said.Researchers found that the creature's brain cast revealed large floccular lobes, which are important for balance, indicating that the dinosaur moved on two feet. \"This structure is also associated with the control of balance and eye and neck movements, suggesting Thecodontosaurus was relatively agile and could keep a stable gaze while moving fast,\" Ballell said.Using CT scans of the braincase fossil, researchers generated and studied 3D models of the braincase (the part of the skull containing the brain and associated organs) and the endocast (the space inside the braincase containing the brain). This diagram shows how the 3D models of the fossil, the braincase and the endocast are related to each other.\"Our analysis showed parts of the brain associated with keeping the head stable and eyes and gaze steady during movement were well-developed. This could also mean Thecodontosaurus could occasionally catch prey, although its tooth morphology suggests plants were the main component of its diet. It's possible it adopted omnivorous habits,\" he added. Experts also reconstructed the dinosaur's inner ears, and estimated that Thecodontosaurus had a high hearing frequency, which would have allowed it to recognize noises made by other animals, and suggests it had some sort of social complexity.The research was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.",

The seven-time world champion missed last weekend's race in Bahrain after testing positive for the virus but has returned in time for the season finale. On Saturday, Hamilton qualified in third position for the race, behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas. But he says he's still not \"100% fit.\"\"I still have some feeling within my lungs,\" he said, per Reuters. \"Normally, I would drive even if one of my arms was hanging off. That's what we do as racing drivers and luckily that's not the case.\"It definitely won't be the easiest of races physically,\" he said, \"but I will manage and give it absolutely everything I've got.\"Read MoreREAD: Sergio Perez claims maiden Formula One win at Sakhir Grand PrixLewis Hamilton looks on after the qualifying session at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.'Recharging is not as easy'Mercedes confirmed Hamilton tested negative for the virus on Wednesday after spending 10 days in isolation.

Pound heading for a crash if Britain fails to get a Brexit trade dealThe move comes as Brexit negotiations between Britain and the European Union enter a crucial 48 hours, with both sides expressing skepticism about reaching a deal before a Sunday deadline.

        "content": "London (CNN)On December 12, 2019, Boris Johnson fulfilled his destiny.After three years of political deadlock had failed to deliver on the UK's vote to leave the European Union, the figurehead of Brexit won a landslide general election, giving him a parliamentary majority large enough to reshape the nation.Brexit's true believers celebrated: Their messiah would now be able to finish the job he had started in 2016.    Johnson had seemingly unified a bitterly divided Conservative party -- whose days in government during Theresa May's premiership had appeared numbered just months before. The good will Johnson's lawmakers held for their leader was palpable.A scant 12 months later, much of that goodwill has vanished -- despite his party continuing to perform well in opinion polls compared to the opposition Labour Party.A no-deal Brexit will destroy 300,000 jobs and push up food pricesRead MoreThe Brexiteers who celebrated Johnson's victory now fear a sell-out at the last minute, as the deadline for a deal with the EU could come as soon as this Sunday. And while Johnson's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been heavily criticized as insufficient and dangerous by his opponents, many in the UK Prime Minister's own party believe he has gone too far, seeing his readiness to batter the economy with lockdowns, restrictions and taxpayer-funded bailouts as a betrayal of Conservative values.For the purposes of this article, CNN spoke with multiple figures within the Conservative party, from Members of Parliament to former advisers and campaigners. Most agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, in order that they could be candid about what they perceive as the failures of their leader.       More than 20 Conservative sources across the party believe a significant catalyst for the gulf in trust between the PM and his party was the decision to hire Dominic Cummings -- the controversial brains behind the Brexit campaign led by Johnson -- to serve as his most senior adviser. They believed Cummings was a ticking timebomb whose unpredictability would inevitably land the PM in trouble. And although Cummings has resigned from his post and will no longer work for Johnson in the new year, many fear the damage has been done.  Boris Johnson drives a Brexit-themed JCB through a fake wall emblazoned with the word \"GRIDLOCK,\" during the 2019 general election campaign.Cummings was not a member of the party and, during the Brexit campaign, had made his contempt for Conservatives very clear.  Veteran MPs bit their tongues as Cummings' campaigning racked up victories in both the Brexit referendum and the 2019 general election, but when Johnson returned to Downing Street with a majority, his party's rank and file members believed they were being treated as an afterthought by a leader who felt invincible.       \"There was a real feeling among MPs that they no longer mattered,\" says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. \"The decisions were being made by a small group of people in Downing Street and they were simply expected to shut up, fall in line and defend the government no matter what.\"   This created problems when controversy began to swirl around Cummings. Over the course of 2020, the PM's top aide made headlines on two significant occasions.First came the revelation that he had personally hired someone to work in Downing Street who had supported eugenics and made racist remarks. Then, even as millions of Britons up and down the country were spending months largely confined to their homes because of the coronavirus pandemic, Cummings broke lockdown regulations to drive his wife and son from London to the northeast of England, shortly after an outbreak of Covid-19 in Downing Street. The story rumbled on for months and polling repeatedly revealed that the public thought Johnson had made a mistake in not sacking Cummings, and muddied the government's coronavirus message. Even now, it is a stain on the PM's reputation.  Boris Johnson leaves 10 Downing Street with Dominic Cummings before last year's general election.\"We were being asked to defend a man who most of us had never met, and whose behavior had led to us getting hundreds of letters from angry constituents,\" said one Conservative MP who is on the government payroll.Another senior Conservative MP said they were \"being pressured to repeat lines fed to us by Downing Street, without so much as a word of thanks or contrition from Dominic.\"       Cummings defended his decision to leave London during the lockdown at a press conference held in the back garden of Downing Street, saying he believed it was the best way to provide childcare for his young son.      If defending the behavior of Cummings wasn't bad enough, dozens of MPs told CNN that on more than one occasion during 2020 they were instructed to explain unpopular government policies, only for Downing Street to U-turn moments later.\"You can almost feel that the trust has gone,\" said the senior Conservative MP. \"Colleagues in parliament are increasingly hesitant to make any public statement supporting the government, because we have no idea how long a policy will stick.\"The worst example of this came when popular Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford \u200bpleaded with the government to provide free school meals for the poorest children over the holiday period. After days insisting their initial plan not to offer food vouchers was correct, Downing Street eventually gave in to public pressure.  \"There are only so many times you can be expected to defend the indefensible, only to have the government pull the rug out from under you,\" says Bale.Boris Johnson gives a virtual news conference last month, while self-isolating during the Covid-19 pandemic. Worst days to come?The numerous U-turns of 2020 have mostly related to Johnson's handling of the pandemic, which many Conservatives believe has been too stringent and unnecessarily hard.       \"All that good will he had for delivering our Brexit dream is being overwritten by the fact he's not behaving like a Conservative,\" explained a veteran Tory on the right of the party.     \"As far as many of us can see, the government is taking away the liberties and freedom of citizens without producing any evidence as to why,\" they said. \"I am afraid he does appear to have abandoned the principles we believed he once held.\"The criticism that Johnson has taken too many of these decisions without consulting his MPs comes up again and again.\"In terms of getting us involved in decision making, he has been poor, and it has led to the Balkanization of the party,\" says the MP on the government's payroll.        Numerous Conservatives suggest that a good example of how affection for Johnson has diminished over time can be seen in how his MPs talk to him in parliament about the pandemic. When Johnson had the virus himself, the empathy was enormous. Now, they question his policies and their efficacy with little regard for the fact that the disease nearly killed him.       For all Johnson's troubles in 2020, his worst days could be yet to come.    Brexit is yet to reach its conclusion. Both London and Brussels say a decision must be made in the next few days and are talking up the prospect of no deal being agreed. Despite this, many hardliners are braced for what they consider a sell-out from the man who once embodied Brexit, in order to strike a trade deal with the EU.   A Brexit countdown clock on the front of 10 Downing Street on January 31, 2020. \"When Boris was outside of government, he wound up the Brexiteers by rejecting [former PM Theresa] May's deal and demanding a harder Brexit. In some respect, he's simply reaping what he sowed,\" says a senior Conservative adviser. \"Many of the hardest Brexiteers really believe he is going to water it all down.\"   Another senior Brexiteer explains that \"most hardliners are unlikely to be happy with any deal that has even a sliver of EU involvement in Britain's domestic law,\" adding that their concern is \"if that sliver could turn into something that drags us back towards Brussels.\"      If Johnson really does want a deal, this is going to be a problem. \"The PM and his party have egged one another on in this fantasy world for years now, when it was always blindingly obvious that a deal would require compromises,\" says Bale.  Here's what you need to know about Brexit this week  The senior Conservative MP believes many of their colleagues were so strident in their belief that any concession to Brussels was a surrender that \"it's now virtually impossible for them to back a compromise without looking very embarrassed.\"While no one seriously believes that parliament would vote down a deal at this stage, the potential for a sizeable rebellion among Johnson's former supporters will be wounding. Worse, it could be the start of a trend for future revolts. One year on from their triumph, the Conservatives' champagne has well and truly lost its fizz.    Salma Shah, a former government adviser, says this was always a potential problem for Johnson: \"Every leader struggles with their backbenchers, regardless of the size of the majority. They didn't all immediately back Boris for PM. To some extent, they lent their support to him in order to have Brexit delivered.\"Johnson spent most of 2020 making decisions that seemed tailor-made to irritate many of the Conservatives who backed him to get the UK put of the EU. If the year ends with a perceived betrayal on Brexit and continued curbs on liberties, Johnson could find that minor grumbles grow into outright mutiny. And he may find himself increasingly isolated at a crucial moment in British history.",

        "content": "(CNN)Elite sports organizations have long been addicted to tobacco company sponsorships, almost since the inception of professional competition.Baseball's National League, which would much later go on to form part of Major League Baseball, is widely considered the world's oldest sports league. Not long after its founding in 1876, player trading cards could be found in tobacco boxes.By 1920, each team had its own tobacco sponsor.Over time, however, the juxtaposition of elite athletes or sporting events and a product that, according to the World Health Organization, kills more than 8 million people each year was seen as illogical and most tobacco sponsorships were gradually banned across most of the world.The 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was the last Games to feature an official cigarette sponsor, and the partnerships between tobacco companies and sports such as tennis, football, baseball and American football that were commonplace in the first half of the 20th century eventually came to an end.Read MoreExcept in one: motorsport.According to a study published by Stopping Tobacco Organizations and Products (STOP), a global anti-tobacco industry group, Formula One and its motorcycle counterpart MotoGP remain the only major global sports series to still allow tobacco brands to align with certain teams and events to target fans.Mission Winnow branding featured prominently on Ferrari's car in Bahrain last year.STOP's report found that by the end of the current season, Formula One will have made more than $4.5 billion from tobacco companies advertising their products during the sport's 70-year history, with more than $100 million spent during the current 2020 season.That means the past two seasons have seen the highest level of tobacco sponsorship in F1 since 2011, despite the FIA, international motorsport's governing body, announcing in 2003 that it should stop at the end of the 2006 season.The FIA had initially implemented a ban on tobacco advertising in 2001, but amended this ban in 2003 to make it a recommendation.During the 2019 season, according to the STOP report, Ferrari and McLaren received a combined $95 million in sponsorship payments from tobacco brands.\"Making lung cancer and addiction cool is a tall order; F1 sponsorship hits the spot perfectly,\" Professor Gerard Hastings, founder of the Institute for Social Marketing and Health, told CNN. READ: 'Proud to partner with Bahrainis,' says F1 boss amid human rights criticism'Undermines'In response to the STOP report, FIA President Jean Todt said he wasn't able to police the sponsorship deals made by individual manufacturers.\"The FIA remains firmly opposed to tobacco advertising and continues to stand by its 2003 recommendations,\" it said in a statement, sent to CNN by F1.\"We are not in a position to interfere with the private commercial arrangements of teams and their sponsors. We will continue to monitor the compliance with the applicable laws.\"From Michael Schumacher's iconic Marlboro-emblazoned red Ferarri to Mario Andretti's John Player-sponsored \"Black Beauty,\" some of F1's most iconic and successful cars were synonymous with their tobacco branding.Mario Andretti's John Player-sponsored Black Beauty.STOP says the FIA's inability to enforce a ban \"undermines\" the national bans that have been put in place to prevent tobacco sponsorships in sports.A European Union-wide ban on tobacco firms sponsoring international sporting events came into effect in 2005, with the Hungarian Grand Prix in July of that year the last F1 race in an EU country to have tobacco advertising. According to the STOP report, Philip Morris International (PMI) paid Ferrari an estimated $75 million, while British American Tobacco (BAT) paid McLaren an estimated $20 million during the 2019 season.Both PMI and BAT are part of what is known as \"Big Tobacco,\" the collective name for the world's five largest tobacco companies.\"For tobacco companies, the benefits are clear. This is a global sport that draws more than 500 million fans worldwide, mostly young and male -- a prized demographic,\" Caroline Reid of Formula Money, a co-author of the STOP report, said in a statement.\"And tobacco companies receive a real return on investment -- which we calculated to exceed $150 million last year. This figure is based on race coverage alone, not qualifying rounds, news reports or other media, so the total value is probably much higher.\"Ferrari's Mission Winnow branding at some of the races in 2019.In the 2019 season, branding for Mission Winnow, described on its website as a \"PMI-driven initiative\" which works in \"developing and testing less harmful alternatives to smoking,\" featured prominently on Ferrari cars in 10 of the 21 races.McLaren, meanwhile, featured branding for BAT's tobacco alternative products Lyft, Vuse and Vype, along with its slogans \"A Better Tomorrow\" and \"Accelerating Transformation\" at 13 different races.A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine in December 2019 linked vaping to long-term risk of respiratory disease.According to the World Health Organization, \"over 80% of the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries.\"\"Tobacco companies are plowing more money into F1 as they look to hook yet another generation on their harmful products. Sports-related advertising has been a key strategy in the tobacco industry's targeting of youth,\" said Phil Chamberlain, a partner in STOP. \"In a typically slippery move, PMI and BAT claim that they aren't directly advertising cigarette brands. But according to trademarks registered by the companies, these brands are associated with tobacco products. \"The money, ultimately, comes from manufacturing and selling products that contribute to the deaths of more than eight million people every year.\"McLaren's branding from BAT's initiatives.PMI has denied these claims and says the \"report's characterization is false and misleading.\"\"We have been very clear that Mission Winnow does not, and will not, promote any tobacco products or brands,\" a PMI spokesperson told CNN. \"Mission Winnow is designed to show how PMI is focusing on science and innovation for our future and is conducted in compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations.\"BAT told CNN in a statement that it is \"very proud of our global partnership with McLaren.\"\"Our partnership, rooted in technology and innovation, continues to be instrumental in helping us accelerate the transformation of our business as we build A Better Tomorrow by reducing the health impact of our business,\" a BAT spokesperson said.\"At the heart of this is our commitment to providing adult tobacco and nicotine consumers with a range of scientifically-substantiated, reduced-risk alternatives. It is only by making adult consumers aware of these products that they will be able to choose to use them.  \"To be clear, our partnership has nothing to do with BAT's cigarette brands.\"Ferrari and McLaren did not immediately respond when contacted for comment by CNN.Ferrari featuring Marlboro at the 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix.'Addicted'It's not just F1 that has a craving for associating with tobacco brands.MotoGP, the world's premier motorcycle series, has thrust PMI branding to the forefront of its digital operation, announcing last week the launch of a new podcast called \"Mission Winnow Presents: Powering Innovation.\"Mission Winnow branding also features prominently on the Ducati team's motorbikes and uniforms, while Yahama's World Superbike team features prominent branding for Rizla, a French brand of rolling papers that was sold to Imperial Tobacco, another of the Big Tobacco brands, in 1997.\"We comply with all international and local regulations,\" an Imperial spokesperson told CNN.MotoGP doesn't fall under the FIA umbrella, instead having the FIM as its global governing body. \"We always follow the national advertising and sponsorship regulations from every country where a MotoGP event is held,\" a MotoGP spokesperson told CNN. \"Therefore, since 2006 we did not have any tobacco or nicotine-containing product sponsorship in our Championship. \"We have an agreement with Philip Morris International but it is not about promoting their products or brands. In fact, Philip Morris International is the only company that has publicly committed to replacing cigarettes with science-based alternatives for those who would continue smoking. \"As said before, we respect all applicable laws regarding advertising and promotion of tobacco and other smoke-free products.\"In a statement sent to CNN, a Yamaha Superbike spokesperson said: \"The simple position is that Rizla, as a rolling paper product, is not included within the legislation referred to. \"In territories where separate legislation relating to rolling papers does exist, as the contracted team that holds the Rizla sponsorship agreement, Crescent always complies with all international and local regulations.\"Rizla branding features on the side of the Yamaha WorldSBK bike.Ducati was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN.'Image and identity'According to market research company Nielsen, 62% of new Formula One fans accumulated over 2018 and have been under the age of 35, one of the demographic Liberty Media has been targeting the most since taking ownership of the sport in 2016.With the exception of only the NBA, F1 is now the sport with the highest proportion of fans under 25, according to STOP.F1 television viewers in the US and Europe are also more likely to be higher earners than the general population, according to GMR Marketing, which STOP says makes them \"a prime audience\" for the tobacco industry's new products.\"Marketing of any established product, but especially one like tobacco, is principally about emotional connections and imagery,\" Hastings told CNN. \"There is little or no objective information in any form of tobacco promotion. \"Sponsorship is so attractive to tobacco marketers because it brings with it robust ready-made and very attractive imagery.\"What is particularly troubling is that this sort of emotional, image-based appeal is most powerful with the young where the marketing aim is to recruit new users. Established smokers are simply addicted to the nicotine, so have little interest in imagery,\" Hastings added.\"For the new user, nicotine -- however it is delivered -- has no practical benefits; it is all about image and identity. Then they get addicted and it's a different story.\" With STOP predicting sponsorship to have increased in the current 2020 season, F1 doesn't appear to be weaning itself off tobacco money any time soon.",

        "content": "Sydney, Australia (CNN)As regulators around the world race to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, several other vaccine candidates have been ditched or delayed. On Friday, British and French pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur said the release of their vaccine would be pushed to late next year, while one of Australia's four vaccine candidates was axed after trial participants returned false positive test results for HIV. The announcements could present a potential setback in the global effort\u00a0to gain control of the pandemic, given that experts believe that multiple vaccine options will be required to do so. But there could be a silver lining in stopping a trial, or deciding to move slower in another, as the pace of vaccine development has contributed to concerns in some populations. Study results 'are not as we hoped'Developers from GSK and Sanofi's vaccine candidate announced they had hit a roadblock on Friday, saying that interim results of their vaccine's data showed \"insufficient immune response\" in the elderly and that the release of their vaccine would be delayed until at least mid-2021, if not later.Read More\"Insufficient response in older adults demonstrates the need to refine the concentration of antigen in order to provide high-level immune response across all age groups,\" the companies said in a joint press release. Why Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine could do more for the world than other shotsThomas Triomphe, executive vice president of Sanofi Pasteur, said the companies were \"disappointed by the delay,\" but that they had identified a path forward.The companies said they are now planning to run a new study in February using an improved antigen formula, which could be followed by a global Phase 3 study that could potentially start in April. The Phase 3 studies were initially expected to start this month. The drug makers said they have updated governments and the European Commission, \"where a contractual commitment to purchase the vaccine has been made\" on the delay. The EU has so far secured up to 300 million doses of the Sanofi vaccine for the bloc as part of as joint procurement program. This summer, GSK and Sanofi won a commitment from the US federal government to pay up to $2.1 billion to help them move forward with their candidate as part of Operation Warp Speed. Roger Connor, president of GSK Vaccines, said that \"the results of the study are not as we hoped,\" and that it was now \"clear that multiple vaccines will be needed to contain the pandemic.\"There are ten coronavirus vaccine candidates currently in Phase 3 trials, according to Gavi, the vaccine alliance. Spreading the riskMeanwhile, in Australia, health experts have praised the University of Queensland researchers for ending the trial of their joint program with Australian biotech company CSL after participants returned false positive test results for HIV.\"Although it might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success,\" said Diego Silva, an health ethics expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health, in an emailed statement.The vaccine had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials. Australia had hoped the vaccine would be available by mid-2021.In a statement, CSL said that no serious adverse effects had been reported in the 216 trial participants, and the vaccine was shown to have a \"strong safety profile.\" However trial data revealed that antibodies generated by the vaccine interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.If the vaccine was rolled out nationally, CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community.\"Follow up tests confirmed that there is no HIV virus present, just a false positive on certain HIV tests. There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection,\" the statement added.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday morning that the vaccine \"will no longer feature as part of the country's vaccine plan.\" Australia had pre-emptively ordered 51 million doses of the CSL vaccine in October.Prime Minister Scott Morrison reacts during a press conference in the Prime Minister's courtyard on December 11 in Canberra, Australia.Morrison said that Australia had backed four vaccines that showed promise but \"at no stage ... believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process.\"\"So that's why we spread our risk. That's why we backed important projects. And that's why we pre-prepared to ensure that we could deal with any issues along the way,\" he said. In addition to the University of Queensland vaccine, Australia had previously ordered a combined 73.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccines.Australian Minister for Health Greg Hunt said that following the announcement, Australia would be ordering an extra 20 million units from AstraZeneca and 11 million from Novovax.A vaccine has to pass through three stages of trials before it can then be considered for approval for public use. Australia has yet to grant approval to a coronavirus vaccine candidate.When can I get a coronavirus vaccine?Adam Taylor, early career research leader in emerging viruses at Griffith University's Menzies Health Institute, said in an emailed statement that the false positive HIV results were a result of the technology used to create the vaccine.\"The (vaccine's) molecular clamp is made from a HIV protein, which on its own is harmless. The molecular clamp stabilizes the coronavirus spike protein and presents it to the body in a way that promotes a good immune response. This is why the clamp technology is so vital,\" Taylor said.He added that the clamp model vaccine had shown \"good safety and immune response\" against the coronavirus in early clinical trials, and the possibility for generating an HIV positive result had been thought to be low.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Europe is in meltdown again as daily Covid death tolls reach record highs and countries scramble to expand testing and rescue hospital systems that are buckling under the pressure.Health experts warn that despite hopeful news with a vaccine rollout starting in the UK, drastic action is still needed to save lives as coronavirus tears through nations attempting to regain some semblance of normality.Russia and Germany reported record daily Covid-19 deaths on Friday, and October was Russia's deadliest month in a decade. Stockholm's intensive care units hit 99% capacity as Sweden proposed a spring \"pandemic law\" to potentially force closures of certain public spaces. And France said its lockdown would not be eased as planned on Tuesday after daily case numbers rose on Thursday compared with last week.Germany tallied 598 fatalities in a span of 24 hours, according to the country's center for disease control, the Robert Koch Institute.  The nation also added a record 29,875 new infections on Friday, roughly 6,000 more than the day before. Read MoreGerman lawmakers are set to meet in the coming days to tighten lockdown measures in a bid to get the surge in infections under control. Chancellor Angela Merkel this week made an impassioned plea for Germans to limit their social contacts ahead of the holidays and called for more restrictions.Despite the country's much-vaunted health system and success in containing the virus earlier in the pandemic, its recent partial lockdown has failed to stop the second-wave surge. \"Germany clearly is very worried and you can see their numbers are absolutely going in the wrong direction,\" Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN.A German Red Cross worker at a rapid test station in T\u00fcbingen, Baden-Wuerttemberg on Thursday.She said that was probably down to fewer restrictions and \"the fact that their testing and tracing system has been under real strain.\"Bauld said countries such as Spain and France had made some progress thanks to recent lockdowns, but while the UK had taken some steps forward, areas including Wales were moving backwards.\"In a number of parts of Europe, there have been restrictions that are now being loosened, and when they get loosened, people really take advantage of that and that's exactly what's happened in Wales,\" she added. \"It's just human behavior.\"I think January is going to be really difficult, and probably February as well.\"High stakesUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned on Thursday that the number of Covid-19 cases was rising again in some regions after flattening in recent weeks in the wake of England's November lockdown. The UK is averaging 16,000 new cases a day, a higher number than last week. Hancock said in a daily briefing that he was \"particularly worried\" about the number of cases in London and nearby Kent and Essex. In London, schoolchildren aged 11-18 account for the most cases while the rate in adults is \"broadly flat,\" he said.To combat the rise while keeping schools open, mass testing is to be offered to all children in that age group in the worst-affected parts of these regions.London had the highest prevalence of Covid-19 in England in the week to December 6, fueling speculation that restrictions in the city could be tightened on December 16 when the government will review regional tiers. This would mean pubs and restaurants being forced to close. 'Light at the end of a long dark tunnel.' UK residents respond to mass vaccine rolloutThe UK recorded 20,964 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, a rise of almost 5,000 in the previous 24 hours, and 516 deaths. It brings the case count to almost 1.8 million and the death toll to 63,082.\"People just really need to understand what the stakes are and that most of these deaths will be avoidable if we can just hold on a bit longer,\" Jennifer Dowd, associate professor of demography and population health at University of Oxford, told CNN.\"I really want people to hunker down and I know that it's a big sacrifice for us to stay away from our loved ones and our friends but I think the fact that we can see the end point now is really exciting.\" France has decided the easing of restrictions scheduled for December 15 will not happen in the light of recent Covid-19 infection figures, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said at a news conference on Thursday. \"On December 15, we will move to a new stage, but the rules will be stricter than what we had envisioned,\" Castex told reporters, adding that the target of 5,000 new cases per day -- which President Emmanuel Macron had set as a precondition to lifting the lockdown -- would not be met by that date. Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran reported about 14,000 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, compared to 12,000 last Thursday, warning that cases could rise with low winter temperatures and holiday gatherings. Cultural venues including theaters and museums that were due to reopen on December 15 will remain closed for three more weeks, Castex said. France's 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew will be extended to 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., the Prime Minister added. One exception to that restriction will be made on Christmas Eve.However, French citizens will not need certificates to leave their homes from December 15 and they will be allowed to travel to other regions. Restaurants and caf\u00e9s are still scheduled to reopen on January 20. Castex emphasized that the country's health situation had \"considerably improved in recent weeks\" but that improvement had slowed in the past few days. Record deaths and hospitals in perilMedical staff at the infectious diseases department of Russia's Volgograd City Clinical Emergency Hospital No 15, which treats Covid-19 patients, on December 4.Russia also reported its highest ever single-day death toll with 613 deaths on Friday, according to data published by the country's coronavirus task force. It reported 28,585 new cases, bringing its total to 2,597,711 cases with 45,893 deaths. CNN and other media previously reported that Russia's counting method of coronavirus fatalities has been questioned by independent observers and the real toll could be much higher. Russian statistics agency Rosstat on Thursday published mortality figures for October, which suggested almost 23,000 deaths were linked to coronavirus that month. The task force, which provides daily figures on new cases and fatalities, reported only 7,344 cases that month. Rosstat has recorded roughly 164,000 excess deaths in Russia between April and October compared to the same period in 2019. The agency also reported more than 205,000 deaths in October, making it the deadliest month in a decade.The Swedish government -- which famously opted not to lock down during Europe's first wave of the pandemic -- wants to introduce a temporary \"pandemic law\" in the spring that would give it powers to potentially force closures of certain public spaces, as health officials said 99% of intensive care beds in Stockholm were full.  Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren and Minister of Culture Amanda Lind said Wednesday that the proposed law, if passed by parliament, could take effect on March 15. \"We are currently in a serious situation and we need help,\" Stockholm's Health Director Bjorn Eriksson told a news conference Wednesday. Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Eriksson said a shortage of healthcare workers has prompted conversations with private providers \"to see if we can get reinforcements so that the care staff at our hospitals have time for recovery.\"He said that as of Thursday morning, \"our hospitals had 10-12 intensive care units available and at the same time we are opening up more intensive care units; so the situation is constantly changing.\"He added that coronavirus patients also had access to \"intermediate care, which is something in between a regular inpatient care and an intensive care unit,\" which helps take the pressure off ICUs.Now the vaccine rollout has started in Europe, there is hope, but Dowd says people need to make a final push to prevent unnecessary deaths.\"I think if we can we somehow psychologically get there to think, let's sort of hibernate for the winter,\" she said. \"And when we wake up in March and April, things will be a lot better.\"CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Claudia Otto, Sandrine Amiel, Lindsay Isaac, Robyn Kriel and Schams Elwazer contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)Without the adrenaline that comes from playing in front of fans, athletes have had to find other ways to motivate themselves during 2020.  Some have turned to their faith without supporters to urge them on. Others have relied on individual strategies, such as artificially generating their own emotions, to get themselves pumped up for the big stage. For Kim Sei-Young, on a deserted Aronimink Golf Club course in Philadelphia in October, with nothing but the trees and the wind to keep her company, she found motivation in a more rhythmic source. The catchy tones of \"Dynamite\" by her compatriots and super boy band BTS provided an inspirational tune for Kim as she dominated the Women's PGA Championship, eventually securing the first major win of her career by five shots. For someone who had previously had a reputation for being very successful on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour without a major victory, focusing on her mental state and using music to affect her mood was important to Kim in finally securing that elusive major. Read More\"I think motivation is critical to athletes,\" Kim told CNN Sport. \"If you don't have that motivation, you won't have the will and the thought to go forward, so I think motivation is really important. \"I usually listen to a lot of emotional music and watch funny videos, but during the tournament I listened and watched stuff that would motivate me.\"I've always had regrets [about] my mentality [during tournaments], so this time I watched videos of how world leaders control their mind and overcome certain situations, which I was able to empathize with in nervous and competitive situations.\"READ: Emily Kristine Pedersen is a star on the rise after back-to-back Tour winsKim poses with the trophy after winning the 2020 Women's PGA Championship.Righting historySince joining the LPGA Tour in 2013, Kim quickly earned a reputation for being one of the more successful players. Her victory at the Women's PGA Championship in October was the 53rd time that Kim has finished in the top 10. It was also her 11th career win. A subsequent LPGA victory in her next tournament at the Pelican Women's Championship gave Kim her 12th career title. Prior to PGA success, the 27-year-old's reputation as one of women's golf's more successful players without a major victory had gnawed at her.\"Yes, I was aware,\" she revealed. \"Other wins are valuable as well, but I longed for a major, since I didn't have one. It's so valuable to have won the KPMG. It feels like I've completed the unfinished puzzle.\"In fact, the first time Kim came close to winning her debut major at the Women's PGA Championship in 2015 bore a lot of similarities to her victory in Philadelphia. In 2015, Kim was in the final group with the eventual winner, Inbee Park, finishing five shots behind her compatriot. This year, Kim finished five shots ahead of the second-placed Park who was paired with her in the final group.Back in 2015, Park was already a five-time major champion, a reputation that left Kim \"scared\" of playing with her. But five years on and with countless hours of experience on the course, she was able to overcome the \"legend\" Park. \"At that time, I was a rookie and Inbee was about my current age,\" Kim remembers. \"Back then, I was full of passion to challenge and win somehow, but this time, I think my proficiency and competence was the reason I was able to win rather than that kind of passion. \"I'm in a different position now compared to then. I have the experience of competing in the LPGA for  six years, so now I can come up with plans on what I have to do, rather than just jumping into it like I used to.\"READ: Haley Moore overcomes bullying to become LPGA professionalInbee Park (second left) and her caddie walk down the fairway with  Kim (right) and her caddie during the final round of the 2015 Women's PGA Championship. 'Go easy'Whereas previously she might've tried too hard and been too rigid at majors, relaxing and playing her natural game at the Women's PGA Championship this year was key to Kim's success. \"What I did differently is, I used to play hard in other major tournaments as they are at a high level, but this time I decided to go simple despite the difficult course. To go easy. I actually didn't ask my caddie for information I could've asked for and played only being aware of the distance.\"I got familiar with the course during the practice round, but I didn't get my caddie's information on where to hit the ball -- the tactics I would say -- which are usually specific like: 'It's this far from the green, this many meters until the middle point and the pin.' But this time he only told me the distance to the pin and I just played, not minding other information.\"That familiarity worked wonders for the South Korean, as she shot a record-equalling final round of 63 having started the final day two shots ahead of previous major champions Anna Nordqvist and Brooke Henderson. Kim shot seven birdies -- four in five holes on the back nine -- to both tie the lowest round in the tournament's history and also set a championship scoring record of 266.In an attempt to channel the finishing ability of 15-major winner Tiger Woods, Kim also adopted the tradition of wearing red clothing for the final round of majors in middle school.And after playing well in those red trousers -- she says: \"Tiger Woods wore red t-shirts, so I wanted to copy him, but red trousers worked better than a red t-shirt!\" -- she believes it has become her \"trademark.\"\"Red trouser is a good jinx for me. When I wear this, I play well, and it worked well. So, now people call it my trademark. It feels like I've become a character! \"I repeatedly won when I wore red trousers, so the confidence kept rising. Isn't it amazing?\"READ: Anne van Dam: A rising star in women's golfKim chips onto the seventh green during the final round of the 2020 Women's PGA Championship.Looking aheadAfter speaking to her family shortly after her debut major victory on that memorable Sunday, Kim didn't have long to wait before she was back on the plane to South Korea. She says the 14-hour flight \"felt so short, like three to four hours. I was having my own emotional festival during the flight,\" she said. Kim's PGA victory also demonstrated the strength of the LPGA -- nine of the last 10 major champions had never won one before. And with nine out of the top 10 players in women's golf below the age of 28 -- the only one older being Inbee Park -- Kim believes the recent competitiveness shows the health of women's golf and how its popularity and professionalism is growing. \"Currently, the age of the players competing in the LPGA has gotten so much younger ... Lifting weights was not a necessity before, but now it's very systematic, and I think the players are spending more time at the golf field than before. Kim celebrates after winning the LPGA Pelican Women's Championship.\"During practice, I felt that all players have increased their practice time in average. I don't think the women players used to practice that much before, but in the recent few years I could feel the players have been significantly increasing their practice time.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosAlready the world No. 2, Kim now has the top spot in her sights. \"I'd like to win the rest four majors and achieve a Grand Slam. I'm ranking second now, but I want to become the first. Long-term, I hope to make it to the Hall of Fame -- I think that's my career goal as a golfer.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A British fossil hunter has found a previously unidentified \"sea dragon\" on the southern English coast.Steve Etches unearthed the well-preserved ichthyosaur fossil in limestone on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. He thought the fossil was so unusual that he gave it to experts at the University of Portsmouth, southern England, to study.Megan Jacobs, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and a PhD student at Baylor University, Texas, who has spent years working on ichthyosaurs, identified it as a new genus and species. The two-meter long ichthyosaurus, which lived 150 million years ago, has been named the \"Etches sea dragon\" (Thalassodraco etchesi).Antarctic fossil could have been the biggest flying bird ever, study findsEtches said in a press release published by the University of Portsmouth Wednesday that he was honored the discovery was named after him.Read More\"It's excellent that new species of ichthyosaurs are still being discovered, which shows just how diverse these incredible animals were in the Late Jurassic seas,\" Etches added.Scientists have now identified five species of ichthyosaur from the Late Jurassic period in the UK.They are known as sea dragons because of their usually large teeth and eyes.Fossils of ichthyosaurs from this period are rare, according to Jacobs, but this one was well-preserved because it settled in a very soft seafloor when it died.This meant the front part of its body sunk into the mud, protecting it from scavengers that ate the tail end.Steve Etches pictured with a drawing of the newly identified Thalassodraco etchesi.\"Thalassodraco etchesi is a beautifully preserved ichthyosaur, with soft tissue preservation making it all the more interesting,\" said Jacobs in the press release.Ichthyosaurs were highly adapted marine predators with big eyes, streamlined bodies and lots of conical teeth for catching fish.The newly identified species has a deep ribcage, small flippers and smooth teeth, which mark it out from other ichthyosaurs.125 million-year-old dinosaur found buried by a volcanic eruption in China\"It almost looks like a barrel with tiny little flippers sticking out,\" Jacobs told CNN.Thalassodraco etchesi likely would have glided through the water using its tail for propulsion rather than its fins, added Jacobs, and its deep ribcage correlates with large lungs which would have allowed it to dive deep underwater.The newly discovered species has even larger eyes than other ichthyosaurs, covering almost a quarter of its whole skull, which would have allowed it to see in low light conditions deep underwater, said Jacobs, who explained that its tiny smooth teeth were probably\u00a0used to catch soft prey such as squid.This is the smallest ichthyosaur found so far. The largest known ichthyosaur lived in North America during the Triassic period and had skulls measuring almost five meters in length -- 10 times larger than the Thalassodraco etchesi.The fossil will be displayed at the Etches Collection, a museum in Dorset which also houses Etches' many other discoveries.The research was published in the journal PLOS ONE on Wednesday.",

Two months after her last appearance on the golf course, she married Golden State Warriors executive Jonnie West. And a few months later, Wie West found out she was pregnant.Initially the prospect of becoming a mom cemented the idea of retirement.Wie walks off of the third tee with ice on her wrist during the second round of the PGA Championship in 2019.\"I never saw myself playing either pregnant or after I had a kid,\" the 31-year-old Wie West told CNN Sport's Christina Macfarlane.Read MoreThen Wie West discovered she was going to have a girl -- the golfer gave birth to daughter Makenna Kamalei Yoona West on June 19 -- and that \"changed everything.\"\"It just completely shifted my perspective.

It's that slow change. But every year I do feel like there is some progress being made,\" she said.However, despite women making up 40% of all participants in sports, it receives just 4% of sports media coverage.

However, for this week's Women's US Open which is set to kick off on Thursday -- Wie West says she entered her name for but is not yet \"comfortable flying\" with her daughter yet, so pulled out -- there is no other professional golf happening in the US, meaning all eyes are likely to be on Cypress Creek Course in Houston, Texas.To be able to showcase their skills to a mainstream audience could be \"fantastic\" for women's golf, according to Wie West.Wie lines up a putt on the 10th green during the first round of the PGA Championship.\"We're in direct competition with the PGA Tour and they have a strong product. They always have,\" the 2014 US Open winner said. \"And when we go head-to-head against them, as of right now, it's a little bit difficult.\"You always hear the argument why our purses are so much lower, it's because our TV viewership is lower. And that's a lot of time because we're in direct competition with a product that has been historically bigger and better. And we never had a chance to shine.\"We never had the same TV slots. We've never had the same production cost, production value. So I think this way the USGA [United States' Golf Association] is really taking charge of that.\"As well as enjoying family life, Wie West has being finding her feet as a broadcaster on golfing events.She is also a passionate painter. In an 2014 interview with CNN, Wie West talked of her love of painting. Her artwork is dark, bold and often somber, with black figures and sinister skulls splattered across the canvasses. \"My mom was like, 'You were obsessed with skulls ever since you were a baby,'\" she explained. She has also become an ambassador for the United States' Golf Association's 'Women Worth Watching' campaign which aims to \"shine a brighter light on the incredible athletes\" that play in women's championships.\"It's just a reminder that the men are really fun to watch, but we are worth watching as well. There's a lot of great stories that you should not just gloss it over because it's a women's sporting event. That there are so many great stories within this tournament, within our tour.\"It's really cool for these young girls to be like, I want to play a sport that means something and is worth something.

And at the 2004 Sony Open she became only the fourth -- and youngest -- female to play on the men's PGA Tour. She turned pro in 2005, just shy of her 16th birthday.BJ Wie (left) and his wife Bo Wie watch their daughter during practice for the 2004 Curtis Cup Matches.Since blossoming into the LPGA Tour's biggest stars from such an early age -- with five wins including her debut major victory in 2014 -- Wie West has lived much of life in the public eye.Despite the attention, Wie West says she's fortunate she grew up with \"pretty much no social media.\"\"It was wild. When I was a kid, I mean, well, we had MySpace maybe and Facebook really wasn't a thing and there certainly wasn't Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat. And I'm very fortunate of that because my parents really hid all of that from me, like all the articles that were written on me.\"If she had grown up nowadays and had \"the same amount of attention and the same amount of scrutiny and same amount of articles written\" about her, Wie West isn't sure she would've achieved the same level as success she's enjoyed.\"But back in the day, if your parents really want to hide news from you, they could. And I'm just really glad because in my own bubble, my own personal bubble, my life felt very normal. I still went to school full-time. I had my same friends that didn't know anything about golf and that was the same case when I went to college as well, too.\"So I feel very fortunate that I grew up in that era where social media really wasn't a thing. It's tough as a kid.

        "content": "(CNN)The suspended Champions League match between Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir began with a powerful show of solidarity, less than 24 hours after it was marred by an alleged racist incident involving a match official.Before the game, both sets of players, as well as the new match officials, knelt together around the center circle as the Champions League anthem played, the vast majority of them also raising their fists.New officials appointed for Champions League match suspended after alleged racist incidentPlayers and the coaching staff from both sides wore special t-shirts with the words \"NO TO RACISM\" emblazoned on the front, along with the badges of both clubs. UEFA, European football's governing body, also ordered for there to be banners placed in the stands of the empty Parc des Princes bearing the same message.PSG striker Kylian Mbappe -- whose two goals in the 5-1 win meant he became the youngest player to score 20 goals in the Champions League -- says now is the time for action. \"Of course, I am proud of what was done. A lot of things were said but, in fact, there's nothing better than actions,\" he told reporters afterwards. Read More\"We are tired, we don't want to go through this (racism incidents) again. We're all human beings and this was intolerable. People are fed up and we had to do something.\"We were not disappointed not to play. We made that decision. We were proud. The more you let these things slide, the more you're led to believe that it's normal. But no, it's not normal.\"On Tuesday, the match was halted when both teams walked off the pitch in protest after Romanian fourth official Sebastian Col\u0163escu was accused of making an alleged racist comment towards Basaksehir assistant coach Pierre Webo, who is Cameroonian.Players and officials kneel before the resumption of the match.After being shown a red card by the match referee, Webo could be heard over the broadcast of French channel RMC Sport repeatedly asking: \"Why [did] you say negro?\" and pointing at Col\u0163escu.UEFA told CNN that Webo's red card has been put on hold as it investigates the incident.During the incident, Basaksehir striker Demba Ba could be heard over the BT Sport broadcast saying: \"You never say 'this White guy,' you say 'this guy.' So why when mention a Black guy, you have to say 'this Black guy'?\"Both teams refused to resume Tuesday with Col\u0163escu still involved so UEFA announced a new officiating team for Wednesday's resumption. Dutch referee Danny Makkelie led the new team of officials and was supported by fellow countryman Mario Diks and Poland's Marcin Boniek.Poland's Bartosch Frankowsky was the new fourth official, while Italy's Marco Di Bello and Maurizio Mariani oversaw VAR.The events of the past 24 hours could serve to draw a line in the sand in football's fight against racism, marking the first time two teams have walked off the pitch and caused a match to be abandoned following an incident of alleged racism.The fourth official was accused of making an alleged racist comment towards Pierre Webo.Five-star PSGWhen the match resumed with 14 minutes on the clock, Istanbul Basaksehir were by far the superior team. Fredrik Gulbrandsen had two great opportunities to give the visiting side the lead, his first effort was blocked by PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas and the second he sent high over the bar.However, it only took PSG five minutes to find its feet and Mbappe really should have given his side the lead, but failed to test Basaksehir goalkeeper Mert Gunok when through on goal.It was a sign of things to come, though, and the French sided did find the breakthrough after 21 minutes thanks to a brilliant individual effort from Neymar. The Brazilian spun brilliantly after receiving the ball from Marco Veratti and produced a delightful nutmeg on Carlos Ponck, before curling the ball past Gunok into the top corner.The match was resumed with a different set of officials.PSG needed a victory to guarantee top spot in Group H ahead of RB Leipzig after the German club's 3-2 victory over Manchester United on Tuesday and looked to have all but wrapped up the three points just minutes after scoring the first.This time it was a blistering counter-attack that Neymar finished off, receiving a pass from Mbappe and squeezing the ball under the foot of Gunok.Defender Mitchel Bakker thought he had added a third for PSG less than a minute later, finishing off the loose ball after Neymar had been challenged by Gunok. However, after two lengthy VAR consultations, Bakker was ruled offside and Gunok adjudged to have fouled Neymar, eventually resulting in a PSG penalty.Players and coaching staff wore t-shirts with the message 'NO TO RACISM.'Up stepped Mbappe to score his first Champions League goal of the season and cement PSG's place at the top of Group H.Early in the second half, Neymar completed his hat-trick with another stunning goal, playing a quick one-two with Angel Di Maria before curling the ball into the far corner.Mehmet Topal scored a scrappy consolation goal for Basaksehir, but Mbappe scored his second goal just five minutes later to wrap up a convincing 5-1 win and top arguably the hardest group in this season's competition.Ben Church and Aleks Klosok contributed to reporting.",

Earlier this week, a joint statement by Johnson and von der Leyen cited three \"critical\" sticking points: fishing rights, the UK's ability to diverge on EU standards, and legal oversight of any deal.The last-ditch effort to propel talks forward on Wednesday began with a meeting and continued over dinner.In a statement after the meeting, von der Leyen said negotiators would resume work immediately. \"We had a lively and interesting discussion on the state of play across the list of outstanding issues.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)A new report from the French Senate alleges that the country's health policy authority failed to heed expert warnings about its stockpile of personal protective equipment, leaving it under-equipped for this year's outbreak of Covid-19.The report, which is the product of several months worth of hearings and investigations by a Senate commission of inquiry, also accuses J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, a senior health official, of attempting to cover up the alleged misstep.Salomon leads the country's General Directorate for Health, which forms and executes health policy. The agency has defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing. The report accuses Salomon of ordering a stockpile of only 100 million surgical masks two years ago, despite recommendations from an independent committee of public health experts that the country keep 1 billion on hand in the event of an emergency. The report included emails supplied by Salomon, which it claims show that he \"intervened directly\" in an attempt to push the committee to modify its mask stockpile recommendations memo. It also alleged that the publicly available version of those recommendations was modified from the initial version.JUST WATCHEDEuropean countries announce sweeping new Covid-19 restrictionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEuropean countries announce sweeping new Covid-19 restrictions 02:01Read MoreIn a statement released Thursday night, the General Directorate for Health denied that Salomon had exerted any undue pressure on the independent committee regarding its PPE stockpile recommendations. It also said that Salomon had been completely transparent -- pointing to the fact that he voluntarily provided his email exchanges with members of the commission.\"Discussions took place between the General Directorate for Health and France's public health agency to make changes to the reports, exchanges that are part of a normal relationship between a public agency under supervision and its supervising authority within the framework of its missions,\" the General Directorate for Health statement said. The resulting changes \"were accepted by all contributors,\" it said.Both the General Directorate for Health and France's public health agency -- which is in charge of epidemiological surveillance -- are part of the French Health Ministry.Senator Catherine Deroche, a member of the opposition conservative party who sat on the committee, said the decision in 2018 proved costly to French taxpayers.France spent 450 million euros ($546 million) on masks this year. Had they ordered the masks in 2018, when demand was down, it would have only cost 27 million euros ($33 million), according to Deroche.Deroche also alleged that Salomon ordered that 613 million masks that did not comply with new health standards be destroyed \"without referring to the political authorities\" and \"without even checking that supply capacities would be sufficient in the event of a crisis.\"",

The crime was only uncovered during an inspection of the aircraft at Beriev Taganrog Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex, officials revealed Monday. Exclusive: On board the 'Doomsday' plane that can wage nuclear warA cargo hatch was found to have been opened and 39 pieces of radio equipment were reported as missing from inside the aircraft. The suspects have not been identified. Security has now been stepped up at the site, according to the Kremlin, which is investigating the incident. Few details of the aircraft are available, as the plane and its contents are a state secret.Read MoreDmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, described the episode as an \"emergency situation\" in a conference call with journalists and said: \"Of course, there will be an investigation, and measures will be taken so that this does not happen again.\" Peskov did not specify who is responsible for the aircraft's security.X-15: The fastest manned rocket plane everThe plane had been undergoing routine maintenance to its landing gear rods before the theft, Russian news agency Tass reported, and all equipment was in place at that time. Airborne Command Posts were first nicknamed doomsday planes by the United States, as they are designed for use in the event of nuclear war or a major disaster that would see ground-based command infrastructure destroyed. The most famous models of such specialized aircraft are the US Boeing E-4B, based on the Boeing 747, and the Russian Ilyushin-80, based on the passenger Il-86.  According to Tass, the country's armed forces currently have four Il-80s in service.Zombie apocalypse preparednessRussia's \"doomsday\" planes can take off from any civil or military airfield, according to state news agency RIA Novosti.  Each has a powerful engine, modern communication facilities and a life support system that enables it to remain airborne for several days. Aside from the cockpit windshield, the plane does not have any windows, so those onboard are not blinded by a nuclear explosion, RIA Novosti said. The tail section houses an outlet cable antenna for communication with submarines.Air Force 'doomsday' planes damaged in tornadoWhile specifics of the equipment on board the aircraft are not known, it is believed to have everything necessary to control the armed forces, while also accommodating high-ranking passengers with areas for both work and relaxation. Back in October, Tass reported that the planes were set to be upgraded. An aircraft industry source told Tass the updated version would be based on an Il-96-400M quadjet, long-haul, wide-body airliner.The source said the new version would \"significantly increase the period of airborne combat duty and to extend the radius for troop command.\"",

A warming climate means a vast amount of sea ice is melting in the region, and rising temperatures are also preventing seasonal ice -- which melts and recurs annually -- from forming in places it once did. Several seal species -- polar bears' main prey -- rely on sea ice, Aars explains, and more often than not, where sea ice can be found, so too polar bears. But these creatures are being forced to move with the times.\"Because conditions change, (polar bears) will use more time on land and look for different options,\" he explains. \"They hunt reindeer, they will take more birds and eggs. We have seen that bears are in different areas than they used to be -- so much further north.\"Find out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable futureAlong with the tracking collar, the Institute weighs bears and takes samples to monitor their health and diet, as well as testing for evidence of pollutants. The collar can also record body temperature, which can tell scientists if a bear has moved inside a den -- an indication the animal is going to give birth.A sedated polar bear awaits testing and tracking by the Norwegian Polar Institute.Sea ice loss is also having an impact on where polar bears are born, says Aars: \"A layer of sea ice on top of the ocean makes it possible for bears to walk long distances. Important areas that they used to go to give birth to cubs are more or less lost, because you don't have sea ice on those islands anymore.\"By learning to think like a puffin, this conservationist has saved seabirds around the worldBears are now swimming as far as 200 kilometers (124 miles) to reach an island den, he adds, something they did not need to do 20 years ago.\"Polar bears are optimistic animals,\" Aars says. \"It seems that they are quite resistant, and they are doing quite well despite the fact that they've lost a lot of their habitat.\" Despite the odds, Svalbard's polar bear numbers do not appear to have decreased in the last 20 years, he says. That may not always be the case, though. According to NASA, summer ice in the Arctic is shrinking by more than 13% each decade, and this year the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) reported the second lowest levels of summer sea ice ever recorded. The 14 lowest levels of sea ice have all occurred in the past 14 years, according the NSIDC.Aars, who has worked on Svalbard since 2003, says \"glaciers are not where they used to be,\" and have retreated hundreds of meters, even kilometers.Put simply, the prognosis is not good. \"You don't find polar bears anywhere in the Arctic where you don't have sea ice at least seasonally,\" says Aars. \"Change is so significant and so fast, we will reach some stage in the future where it will get much harder to be a polar bear in Svalbard.\"In the meantime, his research could reveal how to help his pen pals hold out a little longer. \"What is important for us is that all this data tells us how they will respond in the future,\" he adds. \"Of course, you cannot do a lot ... but if you still have some sea ice, enough that they would be able to be there, then it is very important to know what else you can do to make sure those species can do as well as possible.\"Tell us on social media what you're doing to preserve the health of the planet, using #CalltoEarth.",

The issue kicked off a frantic dash from coaching staff to secure black hair dye from nearby salons. However, one player from Fuzhou University was ordered to leave the game after the opposition team reported that her hair was still \"not black enough,\" Global Times reported. The referee then decided that Fuzhou University would forfeit the game because they couldn't field the minimum seven players required.Read More\"One of the rules regulates that hair dye is not allowed among players,\" a member of staff from Fuzhou University's PE department told Dazhong News, Global Times reported. \"In practice, simple or partial dyeing is acceptable, but 'weird' colors are not allowed.\"The Campus Football Alliance said on Weibo that the league organizers' rules state that athletes will be disqualified if they \"dye their hair, grow long hair (for boys), wear strange hairstyles, or wear any accessories.\"The referee's decision split opinion on Chinese social media.\"This incident makes it hard to get my hopes up for Chinese soccer,\" said one Weibo user. \"Hair dyeing is just a way one expresses his/her personality and pursuing (a better-looking) image. It does not go against social morality or public order.\"Another user disagreed and said: \"These players often become idols among students and their behavior can influence more people. Stricter grooming requirements for soccer players could set a better direction (for others).\"'Politically correct values'This isn't the first time that Chinese football players have faced scrutiny for their appearance. In 2018, some players from the men's national team wore bandages covering their arms after censors from the ruling Communist Party condemned tattoos in a directive to state broadcasters.Later that year, China international defender Wang Shenchao was banned from playing for 12 months after he wore a necklace during a game against Myanmar.\"Unfortunately this incident is not an isolated one,\" said Cameron Wilson, founding editor of the Wild East Football website. \"This issue is very unfortunate because it is obvious that someone's sporting ability is not linked to their fashion sense.\"Wilson added that these stringent rules are in place to \"promote politically correct values.\" \"The players are primarily considered role models for society due to the influential role they can play with their elevated profiles,\" he said. \"It's understandable that a country wants its football team to have a positive impact on the general population, but unfortunately the definition of what is positive in China seems very narrow.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Rich countries have bought enough Covid-19 vaccine doses to immunize their populations three times over, an international vaccine watchdog has said, but developing countries are being left behind in the global sprint to end the coronavirus pandemic.In 67 poorer nations, just one in 10 people can hope to receive a vaccine by the end of next year, the People's Vaccine Alliance said on Wednesday.But in the developed world, where a rush to secure vaccine supplies began in the first weeks and months of the pandemic, a surplus has been ordered; with nations representing just 14% of the world's population owning more than half of the most promising vaccines.The group urged pharmaceutical companies to share their technology and intellectual property with the World Health Organization, and called on governments to commit to sending vaccines to the developing world, in order to close the economic disparity between nations as they look to emerge from the devastating Covid-19 crisis.\"No one should be blocked from getting a life-saving vaccine because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket,\" said Anna Marriott, Health Policy Manager at Oxfam -- one of the charities that makes up the People's Vaccine Alliance, along with Amnesty International, Global Justice Now and others. Read More90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person in the world to receive a fully vetted Covid-19 vaccine, as the UK began its rollout on Tuesday.\"But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 for years to come,\" she added.On Tuesday, the United Kingdom became the first nation to start vaccinating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 shot, marking a major milestone in a pandemic that brought the world to a standstill. But 96% of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine doses that Britain has started administering have been bought by rich countries, the People's Vaccine Alliance said. Similarly, every one of Moderna's doses -- another leading candidate whose trials have demonstrated a high rate of efficacy -- have been acquired by wealthy countries.In Canada, enough doses have been purchased to immunize citizens five times over if all the leading vaccines are approved, the group said.'We're injecting hope'Those prospects stand in stark contrast to the situation in the developing world.In particular, the group identified 67 countries most at risk of being shut off from the pathway out of the pandemic. Five of them -- Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ukraine -- have reported more than 1.5 million combined cases.\"The hoarding of vaccines actively undermines global efforts to ensure that everyone, everywhere can be protected from Covid-19,\" said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International's Head of Economic and Social Justice. \"By buying up the vast majority of the world's vaccine supply, rich countries are in breach of their human rights obligations.\"At least 172 countries have or are considering participating in COVAX, an initiative led by the World Health Organization that aims to provide worldwide access to effective Covid-19 vaccines, according to the body.But a study by Duke University's Global Health Institute last month found that only 250 million doses have been confirmed as purchased under the scheme.The US Food and Drug Administration will meet Thursday to consider granting emergency use authorization for the Pfizer vaccine in the United States. If approved, the country could join the UK in administering doses in the coming days.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"I came, I saw, I conquered,\" read Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tweet confirming he was leaving MLS at the end of last season. The Swedish soccer star might be confident he conquered North American football, but Ibrahimovic is a notable omission in the MLS' list of its 25 greatest ever players.Reaching its landmark 25th season in 2020, MLS released \"The 25 Greatest\" on Wednesday to acknowledge the players who, in the words of the league, \"achieved the most on the field, drove the narrative off the field and helped lay the foundation or set the course going forward.\" And with the likes of David Beckham, Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan and Carlos Valderrama making the cut, Ibrahmovic was squeezed out.Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored 52 goals in 56 appearances for LA Galaxy.It was in March 2018 that Ibrahimovic announced himself to American sports fans with a ludicrous long-range volley on his MLS debut as he helped his Los Angeles Galaxy side beat crosstown rivals LAFC. Until his departure at the end of the 2019 season, Ibrahimovic feasted on defenses at the rate of nearly a goal (52) every game (56) and undoubtedly helped raise the profile of the league globally, just as Beckham did during his spell in Los Angeles a decade earlier.'I came, I saw, I conquered': Zlatan Ibrahimovic confirms LA Galaxy exit Read MoreCocksure swaggerIbrahimovic's brief spell in the league will forever be remembered for not just his trademark goals but cocksure swagger. Not for nothing did the Swede make his stateside move official by taking out a signed full-page advert in the Los Angeles Times, with only the words \"Dear Los Angeles, you're welcome\" above his name.Ibrahimovic cared little for the observation that foreign footballers join MLS in the twilight of their careers, with a twinkle in his eye telling CNN Sport in early 2019, \"imagine what will happen this season\" when it was pointed out that he once said, \"the older I get, the better I get, like red wine.\" The goals flowed, with his vintage performances often leaving supporters drooling in admiration. But Ibrahimovic could not bring trophies to Los Angeles, unlike his spells in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France and England.Aged 39 now, Ibrahimovic is currently top scorer in Serie A with 10 goals in six appearances.Now aged 39 and playing for AC Milan, Ibrahimovic continues to make good on his prophesy that he improves with age.Milan are undefeated and five points clear at the top of Serie A, and Ibrahimovic is the league's top scorer, with 10 goals in only six appearances.He is not the only notable foreign name missing from \"The 25 Greatest.\" Thierry Henry, David Villa, Carlos Vela and Wayne Rooney are all missing too, with domestic talents such as Michael Bradley omitted as well. Don Garber, Commissioner of MLS, said he thought Ibrahimovic should have made the list of the league's 25 greatest players.Older generationOne unabashed supporter of the Swede making \"The 25 Greatest\" was MLS Commissioner Don Garber, who admitted to CNN Sport that he thought \"Zlatan should have been on that list.\"While noting that he did not get a vote, Garber felt the forward was \"one of the more exciting and productive players in the short time that he was in MLS.\"The former US Men's National Team midfielder and two-time MLS Cup winner Cobi Jones -- who did make the list -- told CNN Sport this week that \"it looks like they [MLS] are giving a little bit of love to some of that older generation within MLS that helped kick it off, even though there is a sprinkling of others along the way.\" Ibrahimovic certainly sprinkled his magic over the best part of two years but it was not deemed enough. Perhaps he will take out another newspaper advert to express any updated thoughts on the matter. The 25 players to make the list are:\u2022 Jeff Agoos\u2022 Kyle Beckerman\u2022 David Beckham\u2022 Carlos Bocanegra\u2022 Dwayne De Rosario\u2022 Clint Dempsey\u2022 Landon Donovan\u2022 Marco Etcheverry\u2022 Robin Fraser\u2022 Sebastian Giovinco\u2022 Kevin Hartman\u2022 Cobi Jones\u2022 Robbie Keane\u2022 Chad Marshall\u2022 Josef Martinez\u2022 Tony Meola\u2022 Jaime Moreno\u2022 Eddie Pope\u2022 Preki\u2022 Steve Ralston\u2022 Nick Rimando\u2022 Carlos Valderrama\u2022 Diego Valeri\u2022 Chris Wondolowski\u2022 Bradley Wright-Phillips",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Germany was praised among European nations for its handling of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. But on Tuesday it suffered its deadliest day yet and infection rates are still rising. So what's gone wrong?Speaking in the German parliament Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that nationwide restrictions brought in on November 2 had not proven effective enough, with too many people now dead or in intensive care units with Covid-19.A day after the country reported a record 590 deaths, Merkel grew emotional as she appealed to her fellow Germans to keep one another safe by reducing their social contacts before the holidays, especially if they plan to visit older people.\"If we have too many contacts now before Christmas, and that ends up making it the last Christmas with the grandparents, then we will have failed. We should not do that,\" she told a budget session in the Bundestag.Europe pushes to rescue Christmas despite sacrifice of other religions The Chancellor added that the daily death toll was a price too high for keeping some shops open, including much-loved waffle and mulled wine stands in the festive season. \"There are still 14 days until Christmas and we have to do everything we can to prevent exponential growth again,\" she said.Read MoreMerkel urged federal state leaders to start the Christmas holidays sooner, on December 16 rather than December 19, to help people limit their contacts and allow them to isolate for longer before seeing older relatives.The Chancellor also wants a full lockdown to be implemented for several days, possibly two weeks, after Christmas in order to bring down infection rates. But for that to happen, she needs to get the leaders of all 16 states on side. As Europe's second wave of coronavirus infections gathered steam going into the autumn, some European nations -- like France and England -- imposed national lockdown measures. However, Germany's state and federal leaders agreed on lighter restrictions.A nationwide partial lockdown was imposed which required restaurant and bars to remain closed, but schools and shops remained open. People were urged to avoid travel, keep their contacts to an absolute minimum and limit public meetings to no more than five members of two different households.Rich countries are hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and leaving the developing world behind, People's Vaccine Alliance warnsThese restrictions are due to be relaxed over the Christmas period in much of the country, allowing people to meet in groups of up to 10 people, not counting children. While some states, like Bavaria, favor stricter measures, others are opposed. Meanwhile, Germany is struggling to contain a surge in new infections and death rates have continued to climb.The country suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic Tuesday, with 590 known fatalities, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said Wednesday. The previous record was 487 known deaths, reported December 2, according to RKI, the country's disease and control agency. The RKI also reported 20,815 new daily infections on Wednesday, about 3,500 more than the same day of the previous week. The total tally of Covid-19 infections in the country is now 1,218,524.At least 19,932 people have died of Covid-19 in Germany, the public health agency's data shows. This figure is still much lower than that of fellow European nations such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain, reflecting Germany's success in handling the first pandemic wave.Shoppers walk past Kurf\u00fcrstendamm avenue in Berlin on December 6.Health Minister: 'It cannot go on like this'Addressing the Bundestag, Merkel said Germany was finding the second wave more demanding than the first, although the country could see \"light at the end of the tunnel\" thanks to progress on Covid-19 vaccines. Calling for state leaders to back tougher measures, she said it was wrong, in her opinion, that hotels were open during the Christmas season, as it could create an incentive for relatives to make overnight trips.\"I also think it's right to close the schools during this time either by extending the holidays until January 10, or doing digital lessons, whatever, but we need fewer contacts,\" Merkel said.Europe's social safety net is often considered the gold standard. Coronavirus has exposed its holesGermany's leaders warned last month that if the country failed to rein in rising infections, its much vaunted healthcare system could collapse within weeks.Health Minister Jens Spahn reiterated that message in an interview Tuesday with ARD TV, saying: \"High costs, high death tolls, high strain on our intensive care units. It cannot go on like this. We have to look out for one another -- even if some don't want to hear it anymore.\"The head of Germany's Interdisciplinary Agency for Intensive Care Medicine (DIVI) urged people Wednesday to try not to visit their loved ones during the holidays.\"At that moment you all get together for Christmas and say it will all be under control,\" said Uwe Janssens, president of DIVI, in an interview with CNN affiliate N-TV. \"Then seven days later, your grandma gets a high fever, another seven days later she gets transferred to the ICU and another three days later, maybe, she is dead. Maybe then your eyes will open, but then, unfortunately, it will be too late.\"Police officers walk in an empty pedestrian shopping street on December 8 in Mannheim, one of  several German cities to have imposed a post-9 p.m. curfew.'Hard lockdown' in SaxonySeveral German states have already decided to tighten restrictions to try to get the coronavirus situation under control.The state of Saxony, in southeast Germany, will go into what officials there call a \"hard lockdown\" next week, closing most shops and moving schools to online classes.Bavaria, which has some of the highest numbers of coronavirus infections, also agreed Tuesday on tighter lockdown restrictions. Its governor, Markus Soeder, criticized people who shrug off high death numbers as he gave an emotional speech in Bavaria's state parliament.\"I think it is highly disturbing and extremely outrageous if the reaction is just a shrug of the shoulders. Death tolls are not just statistics,\" he said. \"Of course it is mostly older people, but we are talking about our parents and grandparents. How can some react so heartlessly and coldly when talking about this subject?\"His comments come against a backdrop of skepticism in some parts of German society. A string of demonstrations has taken place against the country's anti-pandemic measures, with many protesters denying the severity of the virus.CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Berlin and Stephanie Halasz from London, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.",

Words are made up of speech sounds, which, if changed, alter the entire meaning -- for example, \"dog\" can turn to \"dig.\" 'Genius Dog Challenge' kicks off to determine whether 6 of the world's smartest dogs can learn new namesResearchers at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest measured the brain activity of family dogs using a technique called electroencephalography, which involved taping electrodes to the animals' heads.The researchers played the dogs recorded instruction words they knew (such as \"sit\"), similar but nonsense words (\"sut\"), and then, very different nonsense words (\"bep\").Read MoreExperts found that dogs, who had not been specifically trained for the experiment, could quickly and clearly tell the difference between the known instruction words and the very different nonsense words.\"The brain activity is different when they listen to the instructions, which they know, and to the very different nonsense words, which means that dogs recognize these words,\" lead study author Lilla Magyari told CNN. The family dogs had electrodes attached to their heads and were played a series of words while brain activity was measured.However, the animals did not pay attention to the small differences between known words and similar-sounding nonsense words. Instead, the canine study subjects processed them as the same word, Magyari, a postdoctoral researcher at the department of ethology at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, told CNN. At least five types of dog existed by the end of the Ice Age, 11,000 years agoDogs are renowned for their auditory capacity and their ability to hear words and sounds well, Magyari said, and they are able to differentiate speech sounds.\"But it seems like they don't really pay attention to all of the speech sounds,\" she said, adding that further research could explain why.\"They may just not realize that all details, the speech sounds, are really important in human speech. If you think of a normal dog: That dog is able to learn only a few instructions in its life,\" she said. While our canine companions may not recognize all the nuances, Magyari said that the study also confirmed that dogs actually listen to human speech, as suggested by previous studies -- and don't just respond to familiar humans or body language. \"It really shows that dogs can differentiate the words that they know from nonsense words,\" she said, noting that family dogs registered brain activity even when listening to instruction words delivered by an unfamiliar voice, delivered through a speaker. The findings were published in the Royal Society Open Science journal on Tuesday.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"The time has come to open a new stage in my life,\" said Cristiano Ronaldo as it was announced he would be leaving Real Madrid for Juventus in a transfer headline writers in Italy were calling the deal of the century. At $117 million, now the sixth most expensive transfer of all time, the Portuguese star was not arriving in Turin at a bargain price but there was an expectation that Ronaldo, even in his 30s, would help the Serie A side achieve what had long evaded the club -- the Champions League trophy. Having helped Real to four Champions League titles in five seasons, scoring in the 2014 and 2017 finals, the forward was to be the missing piece in the Juventus jigsaw. The player who could sate what had become an obsessive pursuit. Has the digital age changed football fans?Juventus has reached nine finals in the competition's various guises, winning just twice. It is the first club to lose seven finals. Only Bayern Munich, AC Milan and Real Madrid have played in more finals, and all three clubs have a better conversion rate, winning at least six or more titles each. But despite Ronaldo's arrival in 2018, Juventus is yet to add a third European Cup to its roll of honors. Three years and three managers later, is the club further away than ever from winning Europe's biggest prize? Indeed, the best Juventus has achieved during the Ronaldo years is the quarterfinals (in 2018 and 2019). Read MoreDominant in its own league -- Juve has won nine Serie A titles in a row -- the club has been unable to transfer such authority onto the European stage. Inflicting a first home Champions League defeat on Barcelona since 2013 on Tuesday suggests this season could be different, but tougher opponents than a poor Barca await. \"It almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. They are the team that will always lose in finals,\" says Adam Digby, author of \"Juventus: A history in black and white.\" \"Sometimes they do not help themselves. Back in the 2012/13 season they got to the Europa League semifinals, got a good result in the first leg and didn't rest any players and got eliminated in the second leg. \"If they'd gone on and won the Europa League that season, they would've had the experience of playing in European finals. They were so far behind the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid, winning a trophy would've helped them compete.\"Casemiro celebrates as Real Madrid goes 4-1 up in the 2017 Champions League final.  Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresUnlucky or lacking belief?Juventus' two most recent finals -- in the 2016/17 and 2014/15 seasons -- ended in defeats to Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively. According to Digby, Juventus played those finals with an \"inferiority complex.\" On its way to the 2017 final in Cardiff, Juventus performed brilliantly and started the final full of confidence. One of the great Champions League goals by Juventus' Mario Mandzukic leveled the match at 1-1, but after the break Juventus crumbled and succumbed to the club's fifth Champions League final defeat since last winning the trophy in 1996. The way the team folded suggests the issue is more than misfortune. \"In both games, they managed to get on level terms, and then they just got blown away in the second half of both matches,\" adds Digby.\"That speaks to a lack of belief that they were the best team. As soon as they fell behind the second time in both matches, you could see that they gave up.\"Dejected Juve players after Barcelona scores its third goal in the 2015 Champions League final. But Barcelona and Real were the dominant teams of the era, boasting the likes of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and those two most recent final defeats came before the Ronaldo era, and before a spate of other signings. In addition to Ronaldo, in recent years Juventus has bought the coveted Matthijs De Ligt in what was a coup for the Turin club, as well as Aaron Ramsey from Arsenal, midfielder Adrien Rabiot and defender Luca Pellegrini. On paper, it is a strong squad that should challenge Europe's best. Instead, under Maurizio Sarri last season -- the man who replaced Max Allegri after the Italian left having won five Scudettos in five years but, significantly, no Champions League -- Juventus lost to Lyon in the quarterfinals. \"When it comes in Europe, they just don't seem to have the belief that they can do that. I think it all keeps feeding into that. The longer it goes on, the worse it gets almost,\" says Digby. \"That Champions League win has almost become a necessity, to almost validate the things that they've done. Right now, it has never felt further away than it has at any point over these last 10 years.\"Big statementsJuventus players celebrate after wining the leaue title in April, 2019. The signing of Ronaldo, the changing of the club's badge, were indicators that Juventus was a team on the verge of making the next step, joining the likes of Real, Barcelona and Bayern in Europe's upper echelons. \"A new era begins,\" declared the club's website when it announced its new logo. But after Sarri's departure following just one season in charge and the arrival of former player Andrea Pirlo in the dugout -- a man with no prior coaching experience -- to guide a young and much changed squad, Digby says the last few months have been a \"restart.\"\"There's a real feeling that it's moved further away than it was three years ago when Ronaldo first arrived, because the team's not as experienced and as proven as it was before,\" he says. Ronaldo, however, is still performing to a remarkably high level. Aged 35, he is still scoring -- four in four European matches so far this season, including two at the Nou Camp against Barcelona, and eight in five in Serie A. His is a star not on the wane. \"Any team that has Ronaldo has got a chance to win the Champions League,\" says Digby. \"I think that the opinion that you should be there or thereabouts because we've got Ronaldo is absolutely right.Ten years on from humiliating Real Madrid 5-0, Barcelona is a club in turmoil\"People already think that you have this team who comes close to winning the Champions League and then falls short, usually in the final. They couldn't even do it with Ronaldo will be the next line of that. \"It really is almost a damning indictment of Juve's struggles in the Champions League that even with Ronaldo ... with Juve failing to build a team around him that can even get to the final at the moment is pretty poor. \"If they don't win it during Ronaldo's time at the club, that has to be seen as a massive failure. You don't sign a player of that caliber unless you want him to take it to the next level.\"Juventus has been far from flawless this season -- Pirlo's team is six points behind Serie A leaders AC Milan, having drawn five of 10 league games -- but the Italians have secured progress to the last-16 of the Champions League. The 3-0 defeat of Barcelona in the final game of the group stage ensured Juve qualified as group winners. Barcelona, despite its league struggles, had won each of its five group games this campaign prior to hosting Juventus, but the Italians overcame Lionel Messi and co with ease on Tuesday to suggest that this season a near quarter of a century quest to be recognized as Europe's best could finally end in success.",

        "content": "(CNN)Super Bowl LV is scheduled to take place in Tampa, Florida on February 7, but right now the NFL's path to the Sunshine State threatens to be derailed by a global pandemic running wild in the US. According to Johns Hopkins University's tally there have been over 14 million cases of coronavirus in the US and more than 270,000 people have died.  An update from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on Friday projected over 500,000 Americans could die from the coronavirus by April.  Every loss has a ripple effect, devastating families and communities. Professional sports leagues, including the NFL, have had to make tough choices, balancing the need to keep their players safe and bring in revenue.  Read MoreBy playing in a bubble, the NBA finished its recent season without a single player, coach, or staff member testing positive for Covid-19, but the NFL decided that option was too logistically complicated. That's because there are 32 NFL teams each with a 53-man roster plus a practice squad. Only 22 teams were present in the NBA bubble, each with a roster no larger than 15. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresA fan displays a sign during a game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens at Heinz Field on December 2.But as infections soar in the fall and into the winter, the league's strategy is coming under greater pressure.   \"It's not about whether or not guys want to play,\" said Baltimore Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III this week after Wednesday's 19-14 defeat by the Pittsburgh Steelers. \"It's about whether or not our safety is actually being taken into account. I can't say much more than that.\"  Griffin added that players are afraid to report potential illness, for fear of coming across as lacking desire and losing their place in the team.  \"Those things don't get reported,\" he said. \"So, when people think, 'Oh, maybe they just don't want to play. They just don't want to do this.' It's not that -- we love football. We want to play football, but we also want to make sure our families are safe.\"I pulled a hamstring today,\" added Griffin, blaming the lack of full practices for increased injuries. \"I've never pulled a hamstring in my life. You see guys going down left and right.\"   Baltimore Ravens quarterback Robert Griffin III rushes the ball against the Pittsburgh Steelers.The NFL declined to comment when asked about Griffin's remarks. Griffin was playing because Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson had tested positive for Covid-19, tweeting: \"Praying for my brother @Lj_era8 and every player, staff member and their families dealing with COVID-19. Ensuring the safety of the entire organization is important. Handling this outbreak within the team is bigger than football,\" on November 26.  Meanwhile in another game, a breach in Covid-19 protocols prevented the Denver Broncos from fielding a single one of their quarterbacks.  READ: Jerseys bearing the last names of Jordan, Kaepernick and Obama break records in online auctionThe Broncos were forced to call up Kendall Hinton, an undrafted rookie wide receiver who had played quarterback at Wake Forest, from the practice squad to play a key position against the New Orleans Saints with 24 hours' notice.  Hinton played valiantly but the fact that he threw more passes to the opposition than to his teammates graphically demonstrated his inexperience. A coronavirus outbreak forced the postponement of the Ravens-Steelers matchup three times. Due to be played on Thanksgiving, the game was postponed twice more, before finally going ahead on December 2.  Denver Broncos' Kendall Hinton looks for a pass against the New Orleans Saints on November 29.The Steelers won and increased their unbeaten season to 11-0. But eight-time Pro Bowl center Maurkice Pouncey, starting running back James Conner and starting defensive end Stephon Tuitt were all absent after being put on the Reserve/Covid-19 list.   The Ravens fared worse. With 17 players on the Ravens' Reserve/Covid-19 list, the team was forced to activate 10 players from the practice squad as replacements for the game.  Deputizing for Jackson, Griffin -- in just his second start for the team -- finished with seven completions from 12 attempts for 33 yards, throwing a pick-six in the first quarter to open the scoring for the Steelers. That was before he went off with that hamstring injury in the fourth quarter, leaving third-stringer Trace McSorley in charge.   Both teams struggled, especially in the first quarter which saw a collective four turnovers.  During halftime in a televised interview with NBC's Mike Tirico, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell smiled, looked into the camera and said: \"It's a great game.\"   Steelers coach Mike Tomlin had a very different interpretation. Despite earning the win and maintaining the winning streak, he said: \"We did enough to win, but that's all. It was really junior varsity to be quite honest with you.\"  Pittsburgh Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin celebrates during his side's game against the Baltimore Ravens on November 1.Goodell is confident that the league will finish the 2020 season. Speaking on the league health and safety media conference call on Wednesday, the NFL commissioner said that the league is \"focused on finishing strong,\" but understands the challenge Covid-19 presents.  During that halftime NBC interview, Goodell reiterated: \"We do think it's safe to continue. Listen, there's challenges. We're seeing virus spread. And that's a challenge for us. We believe the protocols we've established are working.\"  Ravens coach John Harbaugh was similarly optimistic.  READ: Brady loses battle against reigning Super Bowl MVP Mahomes\"I just feel like the league did their best. We did our best,\" Harbaugh said. \"We didn't bat 1.000. Nobody did. The league didn't. Nobody did. You can't bat 1.000 against this thing. But I think our response, in terms of our effort, was a perfect effort.\"  Yet the coronavirus testing data released by the NFL and NFL Players Association tells a more worrying story.  Between August 1 and October 31, there was a total of 162 positive tests among players and personnel. During November, that figure has more than doubled. Maurkice Pouncey (left) faces the Tennessee Titans on October 25.Since testing began on August 1, a total 156 players and 270 personnel have tested positive for the virus. 33 players and 53 personnel tested positive during the November 22-28 window alone. This represents a 23% total increase on the previous week, which itself was a 35% increase on the week before. The number of new cases every week is rising.The trend isn't related to the season though. The NFL's chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills says there is no evidence that Covid-19 has spread during games.   \"We have seen zero evidence of transmission player to player on the field, either during games or practices, which I think is an important and powerful statement,\" Sills said in a media call. The only conclusion is that, if the spread is not caused by the games themselves, it is by wider society, and by players and personnel not following protocols. And as the number of cases increases in wider society, more NFL players and personnel will be infected by the virus. Lamar Jackson passes in a game against the New England Patriots last month.After missing the Broncos game at the weekend, starting quarterback Drew Lock apologized for his part in failing to follow coronavirus protocol, saying: \"We got too lackadaisical with it. It ended up hurting us and it hurt this program and I apologize for letting that happen. We could have been better.\"  The league is trying its utmost to enforce safety though, doling out punishments where it sees fit.  The Raiders had a draft pick taken in November and saw head coach Jon Gruden fined for failing to follow coronavirus protocols. Steelers coach Tomlin was also fined.  But we're now seeing decisions taken in the world outside the NFL affecting the league itself.  READ: On the same day that NFL celebrates landmark moment, Colin Kaepernick says he's being 'denied employment'Santa Clara County in California, home of the San Francisco 49ers, banned contact sports for three weeks, forcing the team to move all operations to Arizona, where they will play two of their remaining home fixtures.There's an argument that any notion of fair competition is being lost given the absent players and some teams being unable to play in their home stadiums. Fan support may also wane depending on whether individual states allow public attendance at games.   The NFL made it clear near the beginning of the season that the burden would fall more heavily on teams than the league and its schedule. In the league's \"Competitive Principles for 2020 Season,\" it says: \"If a game is postponed due to one club's inability to play because of Covid cases, the burden of any competitive, financial and other consequences will fall more heavily on that club, particularly if the club has not adhered to the health and safety protocols or has failed to cooperate in contact tracing or other reviews in response to positive tests among club players or staff.\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell speaks from his home in Bronxville, New York during the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft in April.Speaking after the Broncos debacle, Goodell maintained that games would not be postponed even if there is a distinct competitive disadvantage.  \"As we discussed in October at the fall league meeting, we will not postpone or reschedule games due to Covid issues affecting multiple players, even within a position group if we feel comfortable that the rest of the team is not at risk,\" he said.  \"This was exactly the case in Denver. Isolating high-risk contacts like we did in Denver is a key component of our protocols and our health-and-safety-first approach. The data shows it's working. In fact, more than 20 individuals have been identified over the season as high-risk close contacts that have turned positive.\"  The lines between competitive considerations and health and safety appear to be becoming more and more blurred though.  On paper, the Broncos failing to have a quarterback available due to breaches in Covid-19 protocol is safe as it prevents any potential spread of the illness. But arguably it's not all that safe to field an undrafted wide receiver rookie as a quarterback in football,  which has one of the highest injury rates in professional sport. Meanwhile with five weeks left of the regular season, the playoffs are coming into view.  Rather than the usual 12 teams, 14 teams will be in the playoffs this year. This may right an imbalance, but if teams are limping into January with reduced rosters due to the coronavirus, and subsequent injuries due to a cramped schedule, there is a distinct possibility that the football on show will not be representative of the highest level. 49ers players stretch during practice on December 3.Those opening Wild Card playoff fixtures begin on January 9.   By then the NFL might be grappling with the potential wider consequences of the pandemic really running out of control.  Friday's IHME projection suggests that daily Covid-19 deaths will peak near 3,000 per day in mid-January, though the death rate is expected to drop by February. So, it's likely that in the early part of 2021 the NFL will still be dealing with the coronavirus' impact when Super Bowl LV is staged at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Goodell and the league are fervent in their desire to finish the season on February 7. But as the rates of infection and death rise in the US, the NFL looks to have quite a challenge on its hands.",

A shock Week 5 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders says otherwise, but on current form, the reigning NFL champion looks Super Bowl bound for the second successive year.A 22-16 win against the Denver Broncos on Sunday sealed their place in the playoffs for a franchise record-equaling sixth successive year.READ: NFL charging ahead with Super Bowl dreams as Covid-19 threatens to derail path to TampaPatrick Mahomes threw only one touchdown pass against the Denver Broncos, less than his season average per game.Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes averages nearly 2.5 passing touchdowns every game he plays this year, but threw just one touchdown against the Broncos, to Travis Kelce.Read MoreTight end Kelce racked up 136 receiving yards alongside his touchdown, putting his tally for the season at over 1,000 yards.According to NFL research, no other tight end in NFL history has five total seasons of 1,000 receiving yards.The Broncos led for much of the game, but, as Kelce said afterwards, football is \"the ultimate team game.\" And when this offense isn't able to blow away its opponent, the rest of the team steps up.Travis Kelce has become the first tight end to have five 1,000 receiving yard seasons in NFL history.Fifteen of the Chiefs' 22 points were scored by kicker Harrison Butker alone.Additionally, on the defense, All-Pro safety Tyrann Mathieu had a standout game with two interceptions, including one to end the game as the Broncos marched down field in the dying seconds of the final quarter.Curiously, the Chiefs had a touchdown ruled out in the second quarter after officials incorrectly believed the ball had touched the ground as Tyreek Hill caught it in the endzone. Had the call been challenged by head coach Andy Reid, their margin of victory would have been far more evident.Saints marching on and record-breaking RodgersElsewhere in the league, the absence of Drew Brees has failed to halt the Saints' march to the playoffs. After victory against the Atlanta Falcons, the 10-2 Saints are the first team in the NFC to seal a berth in the playoffs.Saints quarterback Taysom Hill had two passing touchdowns alongside 83 rushing yards against the Saints' bitter rivals. Hill has been referred to as the \"Swiss Army Knife\" quarterback owing to the multitude of ways he has been employed by the Saints across not just the offense, but the defense and special teams too.READ: The NFL is confronting racism, but are Black quarterbacks continuing to be stereotyped?The Swiss Army Knife quarterback Taysom Hill has secured two wins in two games as starter with Drew Brees out injured.Hotly pursuing the Saints in the NFC are the 9-3 Green Bay Packers. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers had three passing touchdowns in the Packers' victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, taking him to 400 career passing touchdowns.In doing so, Rodgers became the quickest player to do so, reaching the milestone in only 193 games. The previous record holder, Brees, had taken another 12 games to break 400.Rodgers also became the first quarterback to have five 35-touchdown seasons.In his characteristic wry but humble fashion, Rodgers played down his achievements after the game.\"Those are fun milestones for sure,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm not sure how long I'll be able to hold on to the second one. There's some really good young quarterbacks I'm guessing are amassing some numbers in that vicinity. But it does speak to the consistency over a long period of time that I'm very proud of.\"Aaron Rodgers, right, became the quickest quarterback to reach 400 career passing touchdowns on Sunday, doing so in just 193 games.The other surprise of Sunday was the Cleveland Browns bringing up their ninth win of the season, guaranteeing a winning record for the season. The team have only done so three times since 1990, and have only reached the playoffs twice in that time. At 9-3, the Browns have the third best record in the AFC, and joint-fourth best across the entire NFL, giving them an excellent chance of making the playoffs for the first time since 2002. If they can win two of their remaining four games, they will have their best season record since 1994. Jets celebrate tankThe Browns will feel good about their chances of a historic season finish; in one of their four remaining games they will face the 0-12 New York Jets.The Jets nearly had their first win of the season on Sunday, in a tightly fought game against the Las Vegas Raiders.A Hail Mary pass to Henry Ruggs III sealed the win against the 0-12 New York Jets for the Las Vegas Raiders.Down by four, with 13-seconds left on the clock, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr threw a \"Hail Mary\" pass that was caught by rookie wide receiver Henry Ruggs III to win the game.The Jets played a \"zero blitz\" defense, committing eight of 11 defenders to chasing the quarterback rather than defending the endzone.I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but watch this and tell me the #Jets weren't trying to lose this game.Cover 0, with 13 seconds left & you spy Derek Carr like he's Mike Vick in his prime?? pic.twitter.com/FR53RF1sxU\u2014 Emmanuel Acho (@EmmanuelAcho) December 6, 2020 After the game, Jets safety Marcus Maye criticized coaching staff for the play call.\"That situation, just has to be a better call,\" Maye said. \"We gotta execute, but you gotta help us out at the same time.\"",

The 26-year-old won the South African Open on Sunday to become the first man to win back-to-back European Tour titles since 2017 but his life could have been very different. When he was just two-years-old, Bezuidenhout accidentally drank rat poison in a grocery store after mistaking it for a can of soda.In a blog post written for the European Tour in 2019, the golfer says it was a moment that changed his life forever. Inspired by BTS and the tradition of Tiger Woods: Meet first-time major winner Kim Sei-Young\"As a result of that moment of naivety, I almost died,\" he wrote.Read More\"The hospital had to pump my whole stomach to get rid of all the poison, but the poison affected the whole nervous system in my body, and one of the long term effects of this led to me having a stutter.\"The stutter caused Bezuidenhout to withdraw from social interactions as his self-confidence was affected by anxiety. He was scared to pick up the phone or even answer a question. As a result, he says he suffered from depression and was eventually prescribed beta-blockers by his doctor when he was 14. He says he used the medication, which is supposed to reduce anxiety, for seven years throughout his amateur career but while competing in the British Amateur at Royal Portrush in 2014, Bezuidenhout was randomly chosen for a drug test. He declared taking beta-blockers for his stutter and thought nothing more of it. READ: Emily Kristine Pedersen is a star on the rise after back-to-back Tour winsBezuidenhout tees off on the 8th hole during the final round of the South African Open.'Inconsolable'In his 2019 blog post, Bezuidenhout says he then received a phone call from his father who told him he had been suspended for two years for failing the test -- a sanction eventually reduced to nine months.The International Golf Federation did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Bezuidenhout's suspension and its subsequent reduction.\"The worst part of it all were all the stories that came out from people in the golf industry and supposed close friends back home,\" wrote Bezuidenhout.\"I was accused of using it to better my performances, which really hurt me and my family. A lot of nasty things were said and I was known as the guy banned from golf for a drug related incident.\"After being left \"inconsolable,\" the South African decided to use his enforced break to develop as a player and return stronger than ever. In his first event back, he won by seven shots and his career has only been heading in one direction since. He's now won three European Tour titles and has his eyes firmly set on the majors after winning on Sunday.\"It's unbelievable to stand here with this win. It's any South African golfer's dream to win his national tournament,\" he said after winning the event by five strokes.\"It's unreal. I've fought hard today. Font nine, things didn't really go my way but I dug deep to come out with a win today.\"",

His trip to the war-torn country could be his first outside of Italy since the coronavirus pandemic began. Francis is set to \"visit Baghdad, linked to the memory of Abraham, the city of Erbil, as well as Mosul and Qaraqosh in the plain of Nineveh\" from March 5-8, the Vatican communique said. \"The programme of the journey will be made known in due course, and will take into consideration the evolution of the worldwide health emergency,\" it added. The Pope's visit \"represents a historic event and support for all Iraqis of all sectors,\" Iraq's foreign ministry said in a statement. \"It also represents a message of peace to Iraq and to the region as a whole, affirms the unity of the humanitarian position in confronting extremism and conflicts, and promotes diversity and tolerance. And coexistence.\" The Pope has long sought a trip to Iraq, Vatican News reported Monday, and told a meeting of Catholic aid agencies last year that he wanted to travel there in 2020.Read More\"I think constantly of Iraq -- where I want to go next year -- in the hope that it can face the future through the peaceful and shared pursuit of the common good on the part of all elements of society, including the religious, and not fall back into hostilities sparked by the simmering conflicts of the regional powers,\" Francis said during the June 2019 meeting. Pope Francis met with Iraqi President Barham Salih at the Vatican on January 25 and they spoke about \"preserving the historical presence of Christians in the country\"  and \"highlighting the need to guarantee their security and a place in the future of Iraq,\" Vatican News reported. Pope Francis refers to China's Uyghurs as 'persecuted' for the first timeOn Monday, Salih called the planned visit \"a message of peace to Iraqis of all religions.\" \"The journey of Pope Francis to Mesopotamia - cradle of civilization, birthplace of Abraham, father of the faithful - will be a message of peace to Iraqis of all religions & serve to affirm our common values of justice & dignity,\" Salih said in a tweet. Around 1% of Iraq's population is Christian from a number of denominations. The country has seen an exodus of Christians in recent years as Iraq was wracked by cycles of violence, including the rise of ISIS. Extremist groups have repeatedly targeted churches since the 2003 US invasion triggered over a decade of civil unrest. Prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Pope Francis visited several Muslim-majority countries, including the United Arab Emirates. His trip to the UAE in February 2019 marked the first-ever visit by a pontiff to the Arabian peninsula.Despite its shrinking Christian population, Iraq figures heavily in the Bible. The Tower of Babel, Abraham's plains of Ur, the Garden of Eden and other biblical places are located in Iraq.",

        "content": "(CNN)Towards the end of 2019 the pressure on Mick Schumacher was intense. As the son of a Formula One great, he had always garnered attention, even as a young racer working his way through the ranks. But when the then 20-year-old finished his first season in Formula Two in 12th place, 213 points behind the eventual champion despite driving for the best team in the championship, questions were raised. Perhaps Michael Schumacher's son would not only never become an F1 world champion but would never make it into the top echelon of motor racing? Afterall, F2's previous two champions -- Charles Leclerc and George Russell -- had won the title in their debut seasons. The 2020 season was make-or-break.Lewis Hamilton vs. Michael Schumacher: Who is the greatest? It was following the final race of that season in December that the young Schumacher, a member of the Ferrari Driver Academy, met with his PREMA Racing team for the sort of leave-nothing-off-the-table discussions that are often a must if there is to be positive change. \"After the last season, we sat down with Mick and spoke frankly, an open discussion between each other, and we pointed out the most important thing where he had to improve, and us as well -- where we had to improve -- and we worked out a plan to be ready for the first race [of the next season],\" team principal Rene Rosin tells CNN Sport. Read MoreIn less than 12 months, and in a season curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, Schumacher's fortunes have transformed. On December 6 he was crowned F2 world champion, winning the title by 14 points on the final weekend of the season, and a few days prior to his triumph in Bahrain it was announced he would race in F1 next season, where his father, a brilliant seven-time world champion, became a global name. Mick Schumacher could win the F2 championship this weekend. The 21-year-old Schumacher has always been a talented driver, Rosin says, he merely needed time to adapt following his promotion from European Formula 3, where he won the championship in his second year following an inauspicious first season. He needed to learn, for example, how to manage tires, from driving with the Hankook ones he was accustomed to in F3 to Pirelli, and adjust to a heavier, more powerful car. \"One of the strong points of Mick is once he learns something ... it's something that nobody would move [from] him, that's a very strong point,\" Rosin adds. \"He's a very technical guy, he wants to understand everything 100% before putting it in place.\"We've been working together already five years, and he's grown up as a driver and grown up as a man. He's part of our team and an amazing driver to work with.\" Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosNot just another young driver Mick Schumacher racing as Mick Junior for KSM Racing Team at the German Karting Championship on 5 October 2014, in Genk, Belgium. A championship which is held on F1 race weekends, F2 is a breeding ground, a place where drivers can showcase their skills as the undercard fighters before the main bout. Current F1 drivers, Ferrari's Leclerc, Williams' Russell, McLaren's Lando Norris are all previous F2 champions, as is Lewis Hamilton, though when F2 was under a different guise. But Schumacher has never quite been like most other young drivers. There is a febrile interest in his progress. During his karting days, Schumacher chose to race under the pseudonyms of Betsch -- his mother's maiden name -- and Junior, as he attempted to learn his trade under the radar. \"He knows he has his name, he knows he has to manage the pressure, and he's capable of managing the pressure,\" says Rosin. \"We're not treating him any differently to any other drivers. He's one of the drivers of the team and we want to give him our best to make sure he can perform. Mick Schumacher to drive in dad Michael's old Ferrari at Hockenheim\"All his life he's been used to pressure. On the other hand, if you want to win the championship and want to be a leader in the sport you have to be able to handle the pressure, otherwise you will not go to Formula One, or be in the top categories of motorsport.\"Schumacher has not only improved on the track over the last 12 months, but seems more confident off it. Last year his answers to journalists were often guarded, but this year he is a more open interviewee. He has spoken recently about Michael, who suffered serious head injuries in a skiing accident in 2013, reportedly saying in an RTL documentary that he was using tips given to him by his father. Lawrence Barretto, F1.com's senior writer, interviewed Schumacher in Bahrain last year and again in Germany this season, where Schumacher was set to make his F1 practice debut only for the September rain to delay his bow.\"He's well trained in terms of the media because he's advised by the same people who advised his Dad,\" Barretto tells CNN Sport.\"This year, he's relaxed more into his role as a racing driver. He is much more expansive and open about his experiences and Formula One, and he speaks very eloquently about his Dad, and he's coming across more as a confident driver who should be able to handle the media pressure that will come with the Schumacher name.\"Does he merit his F1 seat?Mick Schumacher steps into his father's Ferrari F2004 before the F1 Grand Prix of Tuscany in September. Announced as one of two new drivers for American team Haas for the 2021 campaign, is Schumacher good enough to compete in F1? As Schumacher himself has said, \"My name won't put me to the top of the championship.\"\"He more than deserves his chance in F1 next year,\" adds Barretto. \"Admittedly, he's got the best team in F2, but you've still got to make the most of that package. I also arguably think that he's got it harder than most of his rivals because of the pressure that comes with his name.\"It would be very easy for him to succumb to the pressure, to make mistakes, to ultimately not be as fast as what his father used to be, but he seems to be coping with everything super impressively and delivering results consistently.\"If you can deal with pressure, that's a huge part of impressing in Formula One. If you look at many drivers on the grid throughout the years, it's the pressure that seems to tell, even if they're super talented.\"He's going to be a good [F1] driver. I don't think there are many people in our lifetime who will be able to match what Michael's done. You've got Michael and Lewis [Hamilton] up there and they're comfortably ahead of anyone else. \"From what we've seen, I don't think he's going to be matching Michael, but I still think that he has the potential, he's shown enough so far to be a race winner and contend for world titles. I just don't think we've seen enough yet to suggest that he's going to come close to matching his father.\" 'The Schumacher name will excite people'It would be unrealistic perhaps to expect the 21-year-old to match the feats of his father, a driver who dominated the sport in the '90s, winning 91 Grand Prix races, gaining 68 pole positions and 155 podium finishes -- all records before Hamilton came along to break them all. In Schumacher's favour next season will be the fact he will be racing for a team not expected to be in contention for race wins, let alone the title. He can, says Barretto, learn at his own pace because an F1 driver needs to absorb copious amounts of data, spend hours with his team and work relentlessly to get the best out of the car over a race weekend. \"He can use next year as an opportunity to learn all those skills without too much expectation that he's going to deliver big results because, ultimately, the car won't be able to do that,\" Barretto explains. \"His key thing next year is essentially to make sure he beats his teammate [Nikita Mazepin] and if he does that then that's a win for him.\" Michael Schumacher celebrates after winning the Chinese Grand Prix in October, 2006 in Shanghai. For Rosin, he has no doubt Schumacher will succeed in motorsport's toughest category. \"He's a race winner, he's a driver who works with engineers, he's a driver who understands the technical, how the car is behaving and, of course, he has a great race craft. His race craft his amazing, he sees the first couple laps of the race he knows where to put the tires.\"No-one should expect too much too soon from a driver whose rise has been gradual. Rosin describes Schumacher's recent success in F2 as a five-year process. But Schumacher's presence on the F1 grid will no doubt be a boost to the sport and his team.\"It's important for the future of Formula One, and this next generation, that we have big names that excite people, and this Schumacher name is going to excite people, regardless of whether they're interested in F1 or not,\" says Barretto.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Britain's healthcare providers are gearing up to start giving the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, less than a week after the United Kingdom became the first Western nation to approve a Covid-19 vaccine.Vaccinations are set to begin on Tuesday in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland said it would start administering the vaccine early in the week but did not specify which day.The process, which is complicated by the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under strict conditions and give each recipient two doses, three weeks apart, will be closely watched from around the world. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that 50 hospital hubs across England had already received their allocation of the vaccine, and that the distribution of the vaccine was \"really well underway now.\"This is what the UK's vaccination cards will look likeUK health officials expect to have up to 4 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, available by the end of December, Cordery said.Read MoreThe government has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine so far, enough to vaccinate 20 million people, or a third of the UK population. More deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.The speed with which UK regulators approved the vaccine -- ahead of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in the United States -- raised questions in some quarters. But Cordery said the process had been \"incredibly robust.\"\"Yes, it has been shorter than other vaccine approval processes, but that's because everything all has been thrown at this all in one go,\" she said.The head of the UK medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is \"as safe as any general vaccine\" and that those receiving it would be monitored by health officials.Pfizer vaccine doses are stored in freezers ahead of their expected first administration Tuesday in the UK.\"You might have a mild symptom but it will probably disappear in a day or two, and nothing at all of a serious nature,\" June Raine, head of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told the BBC.According to the MHRA, more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.Asked about the potential impact of Brexit on the vaccination program, Raine said: \"We've practiced, we are ready and we are fully prepared for any possible outcome.\"The transition period for the UK's exit from the European Union comes to an end on December 31. Last-ditch talks between EU and UK leaders on a trade deal continued over the weekend, amid dire warnings over the economic and logistic chaos that would result from a hard crash out of the world's largest trading bloc.\"Our goal at the HMRA is to make sure that whatever the outcome, whatever the deal, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines reach everyone in all parts of the country in the same way without any interruption at all,\" Raine said.Logistical challengeThe first doses of the vaccine reportedly arrived in the UK on Thursday night, carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel from Belgium to undisclosed storage facilities in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, according to CNN affiliate ITV News.The UK government's announcement of its approval a day earlier had been followed by confusion over who would get the vaccine first and how it could be administered safely, given the logistical constraints. Here's a look at how the different coronavirus vaccines workThe vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature only possible in special freezers. Once taken out of the freezer, the MHRA authorization requires the doses to be kept refrigerated and used within 5 days. Batches can only be moved and repacked into smaller numbers of doses a limited number of times and under strict conditions. Once a vial is diluted for injection, it cannot be transported and must be used within six hours, or discarded.The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended vaccinating residents of care homes for older adults and their staff first, followed by people aged over 80 as well as health and care workers.But the challenges involved in getting the vaccine to care home residents means health workers now plan to administer it first to people aged over 80 who are about to be discharged from hospital, or are attending out-patient hospital appointments.\"Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics,\" a statement from NHS England said Sunday. \"Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid.\"A temperature-controlled cold storage haulage truck leaves the Pfizer facility in Puurs, Belgium, on December 3, 2020.Raine told the BBC the exact timing might be \"variable\" but that she expected to see the vaccine reach care homes \"definitely within the next two weeks.\"Northern Ireland's Health Ministry said Friday an initial consignment of almost 25,000 doses had arrived, paving the way for \"vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.\"Scotland is set to receive 65,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the initial batch of 800,000 doses distributed in the UK, Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said in an op-ed for the Mail on Sunday.He added that the Armed Forces were involved in the planning and logistics of the vaccination program.Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said those giving the vaccinations would be the first to receive it, followed by care home residents and staff, then all those 80 years of age and over and front line health and social care workers.She acknowledged the challenges around transporting the vaccine to care homes and individual residences, but added: \"For all the difficulties that lie ahead, it should give us all real hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.\"Fauci apologyOther nations are not far behind the UK when it comes to taking a decision on approving the vaccine.The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss Pfizer/BioNTech's emergency authorization application. It will meet again on December 17 to consider the application for Moderna's vaccine candidate.Why Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine could do more for the world than other shotsDr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, apologized Thursday after suggesting a day earlier that UK regulators had not scrutinized the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as carefully as their US counterparts.News of the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was welcomed by many Britons as a ray of light at the end of a dark year.There are hopes that UK approval could soon follow for Moderna and the vaccine candidate developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University.But the four chief medical officers for the United Kingdom warned in a letter that this winter would still be \"especially hard\" and that people must not let down their guard against the virus.\"Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,\" they said.Russia starts mass vaccinationMeanwhile, vaccination centers across Moscow started to distribute Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, initially to groups such as teachers, health professionals, and municipal services workers.Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered large-scale vaccination with Sputnik V to begin across the country from this week.Putin orders Russian officials to start large-scale Covid-19 vaccination campaignRussia became the first country in the world to approve its coronavirus vaccine in August, authorizing the treatment for public use even before crucial Phase 3 trials -- which are still underway -- were conducted. The move drew criticism from scientific circles. \"Civil vaccination has started at 70 points in Moscow today. We work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week,\" Natalya Nikolaevna Kuzenkova, chief doctor of Moscow's Hospital 68, told CNN on Saturday. Kuzenkova shrugged off questions about vaccine safety. \"If there is a question between getting sick or getting a vaccine ... this is a very dangerous disease which leads to quite serious consequences. So the answer is obvious here,\" she said.\"The vaccine has officially been registered. Two stages of clinical trials have passed and we are now completing the third stage. Therefore, within the framework of a pandemic, in these conditions, this does not at all contradict any regulatory norms,\" she added. Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin suggested early participation was enthusiastic, saying more than 5,000 people had registered for vaccination in the first five hours.One of those getting vaccinated Saturday told CNN she was \"not at this point\" afraid of having the vaccine before trials are over.\"Well, of course there are some concerns. But I try not to think about it,\" said the woman, who works as an administrator at the hospital and identified herself only as Nadezhda. \"I wanted to get immunity from the new Covid-19 infection. Protect myself and my family. In order not to get sick, not to get complications, not to infect my loved ones.\"Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said last week that more than 100,000 Russian citizens had already had the Sputnik V vaccine.Officials say there are enough doses for more than 2 million people across Russia, which has a population of about 145 million.CNN's Sharon Braithwaite, Amy Cassidy, Zamira Rahim and Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Brisbane  (CNN)With their rear lights flashing, two huge trucks slowly backed down the suburban Australian driveway, delicately carrying two-thirds of a 100-year-old house.Workers had spent two days sawing the house's timber frame into three pieces 30 meters (98 feet) long and 8 meters (26 feet) wide, so it could be moved from Bald Hills, an outer suburb of Brisbane, to a town 170 kilometers (105 miles) away -- and reassembled for new owners. Two bedrooms and the reception room were strapped on to one truck, with the dining room, a third bedroom and the living room on the other. The sun room and kitchen would follow later.Usually it is homeowners who move, not houses. But in the state of Queensland, at least 500 properties were moved last year, according to estimates from several companies. \n\n\n\nThe house wobbles as it goes over a traffic island. Credit: Hilary Whiteman/CNN\nMost, like Number 36 -- as it was known before the move -- are Queenslanders. Read MoreNamed after the Australian state, these timber properties, typical at the turn of the 20th century, were built on stilts to let the humid summer air flow beneath them.Queenslanders fell out of fashion in the 1930s, when homeowners started to look to the US and Europe for art deco and Spanish mission-style brick homes. But in recent years, the classic local design with its wide verandas has become highly sought after.But buyers often can't -- or don't want to -- live in the homes in their original locations, and so are taking the extraordinary step of cutting up and moving them. It's relatively affordable to move a Queenslander, due to their timber design, and trying to replicate the style in a new build misses the point. \"People who live in one of these won't build a new house,\" said John Wright, who has been relocating Queenslanders for 40 years. \"No walls are ever perfectly level and straight, and they certainly have a classic sort of character to them.\"  Experts say the trend is both a boon -- it is preferable to the properties being demolished -- and a loss for conservation: it divorces the properties from their past. Local historians say each time a Queenslander is moved, leaving behind an empty plot or making way for a new development, the character of a suburb subtly changes. And, the stories of each home like Number 36 become harder to find.   Photos: Inside Number 36The interior of Number 36 was from another era. Patterned carpet clashed with embossed wallpaper and the previous owners' love of embellishment had even spread to the ceilings. Alan Brough painted the white plaster, and spent decades touching it up, according to his son Dean.Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos: Inside Number 36The formal lounge seemed to have been frozen in time.

It was the first time the property had been on the market since the 1960s. We didn't want any Queenslander, we wanted a house with a bit of historyDiane McClay-MacGeorgeBut there was a catch: only the house was for sale -- the land it stood on had already been bought by a property developer who planned to clear the site for a new childcare center. If unsold, the house would be demolished.  Diane McClay-MacGeorge, a support worker for people with disabilities, and Chris MacGeorge, a hydrological engineer, had been searching for a new home for four years. The couple, in their early 60s, fell in love with the Queenslander's painted plaster ceilings, including the gold-trimmed burgundy hallway, which they had suspected was the handiwork of a local artist.They could see the house had a story and wanted it to be part of theirs. \"We had always dreamed of getting a Queenslander, but we didn't want any Queenslander, we wanted a house with a bit of history,\" said McClay-MacGeorge.The couple had already bought a block of land at Wolvi, a rural area home to fewer than 500 people about two hours' drive north of Brisbane, the state capital. The house would sit on the banks of a man-made lake, surrounded by dense Australian bush. \"From the road you'd be looking down across the water to the property, which will then be backdropped by the trees that surround the natural river and landscape,\" said MacGeorge. The scene was set for the house -- they just had to get it there.Moving a house Brothers John, Kevin, and Simon Wright have been moving houses since they were barefoot teenagers, starting off working for pocket money at their father's company. Queensland House Removers is now a third-generation company. Over the decades, the brothers think they've moved more than 7,500 homes. \"You've got to be a truck driver, you've got to be a carpenter, you got to be all sorts of different trades,\" said John Wright.Not all houses can be moved. The wooden frames need to be in decent condition and not damaged by termites or covered with asbestos, the fibrous building material that was popular in Australia before it was banned in 2003 for causing certain types of cancer. \"A lot get knocked down because they're too expensive to move, there's too much renovation to do,\" said John Wright. For those that pass muster, each move follows a similar process. The interior is cleared of all possessions and anything that could become damaged during transit, such as light fittings and balcony railings. The roof is dismantled to bring the height of the house down to about 5 meters (16 feet), low enough to fit under bridges. Special hydraulic trailers are reversed under the house to support its weight while workers knock out the stumps from beneath it. The wooden frame is then cut from front to back, along the edges of rooms, so the pieces are as structurally sound as they can be for the journey. Extra beams are sometimes added for support. At the new site, the house is reconstructed. Timber beams are fixed to the old frame, making the structure even stronger than it was before. The roof is also rebuilt, in the same style as the original. The longest part of any move is getting local council approval, which can take months. Often roads have to be closed, and every power line along the route must be measured to ensure it is high enough to clear the load. Other hazards, such as traffic islands, can be negotiated with the trailer's hydraulics.\"Sometimes we'll have to tilt the house so one side is nearly down on the ground, going over an embankment or something like that. And we'll tip one side down to go under power lines and keep the other side up so it stays level,\" said John Wright. The trailers are made in New Zealand, where some people also relocate wooden homes.Number 36 isn't the oldest or the biggest house the Wrights have ever moved, but its painted plaster ceilings required extra protection. \"We've been assured that they can bring it intact because its four ceilings are just magical, just beautiful,\" said McClay-MacGeorge, before the move.Scaffolding was added so the plaster didn't crumble during the trip. With a neat, solid load, the trucks can travel up to 90 kilometers  per hour (56 miles per hour). For this move, they'd sit on around 55 kph (35 mph). The forgotten USBWhen Alan and Leona Brough bought Number 36 in 1966, the house was surrounded by pastures with grazing dairy cattle, says their son Dean Brough, who grew up there with his brother David. \"It was a quiet road in front, just a suburban street,\" he said. Before long, the government acquired part of the front yard and widened the road outside to four lanes. More traffic brought more people, and more modern bungalows started appearing in the area.\"The house was too close to a major road (but) my parents loved it, it didn't worry them,\" said Dean Brough. When his father died last year, he put his parent's home on the market. His mother moved in with him, and they started the painful process of selling decades of memories. \"There were thousands and thousands of items,\" Dean Brough said. \"They'd been there since the 1960s, so they just collected and collected.\"Leona and Alan Brough bought the house in 1966.As he prepared the house for sale, he gave most of his parent's prized possession to an auction house -- just before the city went into coronavirus lockdown. \"They had some online auctions but not many. We didn't get that much money, but that's life,\" he said.By the time the MacGeorges bought the house, it had been cleared of its contents. Then, workers who were preparing to move the house found a USB stick in a pile of debris. It contained dozens of images of how the interior had looked two years ago. Photos: The ground floor of Number 36A lost USB stick found beneath the house revealed a crowded interior packed with antiques and memorabilia collected over 60 years. These photos were taken in December 2018, more than one year before the house was sold to new owners and dismantled, ready to be moved.Hide Caption 1 of 5 Photos: The ground floor of Number 36The Broughs' memorabilia included old-fashioned arcade machines.

Credit: Hilary Whiteman/CNN\nBuying and sellingPeople sell Queenslanders for many reasons. Increasingly, it's to subdivide older, larger blocks of land to build new, smaller houses to sell at a profit. Removing an unwanted home can subsidize the cost of a new build -- instead of paying for its demolition, they can sell it on. In an ideal scenario, houses are moved straight to their new site. When that's not possible, the house movers take it to a holding lot, much like a used car yard, until the owner is ready to receive it. One house has been in the Wright's lot for more than three years. The owner sold her land to developers, Kevin Wright said, but couldn't bear to part with the house. She pays them weekly rent to store it.If houses can't move directly to a new block, they sit here in the Queensland House Removers holding yard until their new owners are ready to take them.House researcher Marianne Taylor is conflicted about the relocation of houses. On one hand, it saves some from demolition. On the other, it severs the house's connection with the site and erodes their historical value.\"From the heritage perspective, we're taught in best practice that the context of a building is crucial to its history as well. That's why relocating houses is only ever supposed to be a last resort when you're trying to protect a building,\" said Taylor. It's also much harder to learn the origins of a relocated home -- especially if it's been moved by different owners more than once. Researcher Magnus Eriksson advises talking to neighbors, scanning satellite images and searching newspaper archives for clues. He says that each year, the task is getting easier as more old records are digitized. \"Never give up and walk away. Park it for a few years and then go back -- you're going to know more 10 years down the line than you do now,\" he said.Diane McClay and Chris MacGeorge followed the house as it was driven onto their new property at Wolvi, Queensland.A new beginning It's thought Number 36 was built in the 1920s, decades after Scottish European settlers first arrived in Bald Hills in the mid-1800s. They cleared the land for farming, but the area proved better suited for dairy cows that supplied milk to Brisbane city, 21 kilometers (13 miles) away.Despite its age, there were no restrictions on moving Number 36, to the disappointment of some neighbors who were sad to see it go. \"When I saw them starting to board up the leadlight windows, I thought, this is going to be a fairly historic move,\" said one local, Scott Benson.In total, the MacGeorges paid 1 million Australian dollars (about $730,000) for their new home. That breaks down to 130,000 Australian dollars ($95,000) to buy the house, and 140,000 Australian dollars ($102,000) for the move, including raising it on new foundations, with the rest going on the land. Renovating and extending the home will cost even more. The MacGeorges plan to double the size of the house by building underneath and adding an extension to the back. Eventually, they hope to have enough rooms so their eight children and their families can come and stay.They're also planning to provide holiday accommodation.Some of the Broughs' memories will live on, however. Having learned that Alan made the hand-beaten copper cabinets, the MacGeorges have incorporated them into their new kitchen design. They're also renovating an old commercial range cooker they hoped had been part of the original property. Dean Brough confirms his father bought it on a whim while picking up a secondhand jukebox when he was a kid -- they never used it. The house now sits a long way from any main roads. Surrounded by bushland, it'll look out onto a lake, where guests can take a boat to a small island.The plaster ceilings also survived the four-hour trip on the back of the truck and will be preserved as a feature. Leona Brough didn't paint the ceilings, as the MacGeorges suspected. That was Alan, who spent decades touching up the paint. Leona was a landscape painter, whose work can be seen in the photos, hanging in many of the rooms before the home was emptied.She's in her 80s and doesn't paint much now. \"I took her out the last time to see the house before it sold. And she was, yes, that's how it is, we have to sell,\" said Dean Brough.\"It's pleasing that people who bought the house are obviously quite interested in the integrity and the history of the house,\" he added. \"It's excellent the house will have a new life with new owners.\"",

In footage on social media, fans at The Den, Millwall's home ground in southeast London, can be heard booing as players from both sides take a knee before kick-off.Across English football, players have been taking a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and to protest against racism and discrimination following the death of George Floyd earlier this year.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MoreMillwall players kneel before their side's game against Derby County.All Premier League clubs have continued to kneel before games this season, while some teams in the English Football League, the second, third and fourth tiers of English football, stopped at the start of this season.Millwall issued a statement on Sunday saying the club was \"dismayed and saddened\" by events at the game.\"The club has worked tirelessly in recent months to prepare for the return of supporters and what should have been a positive and exciting occasion was completely overshadowed, much to the immense disappointment and upset of those who have contributed to those efforts,\" it said.It also said that the club, its academy and community trust staff would meet with representatives from anti-racism body Kick It Out and other organizations to ensure the events from the game become \"a catalyst for more rapid solutions which have an impact both in the short and long-term.\"The statement added: \"There is much work to be done and at Millwall everyone is committed to doing all that is possible, both individually and collectively, to be a force for good and to ensure that the club remains at the forefront of football's anti-discrimination efforts.\"On Friday, Millwall issued a statement reaffirming the club's stance on players taking a knee.\"As a squad we are fully supportive of the entire football family's efforts in ridding the sport, and society generally, of all forms of discrimination,\" the statement said. \"It is our duty as players to reinforce the positive messaging and action of clubs, community trusts, charities and governing bodies, and we do so with great pride and knowledge that so much good work is being done up and down the country.\" Derby celebrates scoring against Millwall.Saturday's game ended 1-0 in favor of Derby, the Rams' second league victory of the season.Sanjay Bhandari, chairman of Kick It Out, said the organization is \"saddened\" by the booing of players taking a knee at Millwall.\"What this demonstrates is that players are right to continue standing up to discrimination, whether that is through taking the knee or speaking out,\" he said. \"The fight for racial equality continues and we will continue to work closely with clubs across the country to tackle discrimination in all its forms.\" In a statement, the English Football Association said it \"supports all players and staff that wish to take a stand against discrimination in a respectful manner, which includes taking of the knee, and strongly condemns the behaviors of any spectators that actively voice their opposition to such activities.\"CNN has contacted Millwall for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",

        "content": "(CNN)Sergio Perez secured his first ever Formula One win in a thrilling Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain on Sunday.It has taken Perez 190 starts before securing victory, which finally came in a highly entertaining race that looked to be going the way of George Russell, another driver chasing a maiden F1 win.Russell switched from his usual Williams to Mercedes after Lewis Hamilton tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week and opened a commanding lead after jumping ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas on the first turn.But the 22-year-old had to pit twice late on -- first when his team informed him the wrong set of tires had been put on his car and then again when he suffered a puncture -- to rob him of victory.Russell's bad luck was Perez's gain. The 30-year-old Perez is without a team for next season having announced in September that he would be leaving Racing Point despite signing a three-year contract in 2019. Read MoreIt proved to be a stunning day for Racing Point, too, with Lance Stroll finishing third -- the Canadian's third podium and the team's first-ever double podium. Renault's Esteban Ocon, meanwhile, placed second to secure his first-ever podium.Sergio Perez celebrates his winning his first Grand Prix on Sunday, December 6.READ: Can Mick Schumacher emulate his father in F1?\"I'm speechless, I hope I'm not dreaming,\" Perez said after the race.\"Ten years it took me. Incredible ... I don't know what to say ... the luck hasn't been with us this year but we've finally got it and I think we won today on merit.\"Now facing a season without a team, Perez is confident he still has a future in the sport. \"It just gives me a bit more peace with myself, to be honest,\" he said of the win. \"What happens is not so much in my hands at the moment, but I know I want to keep going. If I'm not in the grid next year, I will be back in 2022.\"Perez sits atop the podium at the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain on Sunday, December 6.READ: 'Proud to partner Bahrainis,' says F1 boss amid human rights criticismThe victory was even more remarkable given Perez had dropped to the back of the grid after an incident involving Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on the fourth turn of the first lap.Both Verstappen, arguably the pre-race favorite, and Leclerc were forced out of the race after the collision, but Perez rallied and quickly started gaining places through the grid.And when Mercedes chose to pit both Russell and Bottas during a safety car period, Perez moved into the lead.George Russell, center, led for much of the Sakhir Grand Prix. He was under pressure from a charging Russell in the closing stages, but the puncture cost the Briton and saw him drop to the back of the grid.In a disappointing race for the usually dominant Mercedes, Russell eventually finished ninth -- his first championship points in F1 -- while Bottas finished eighth.The F1 season, which has already seen Hamilton crowned world champion for a seventh time, concludes in Abu Dhabi next weekend.Romain Grosjean, who escaped his burning car after a dramatic crash at last week's Bahrain GP, will miss the final race of the season after returning to Switzerland to continue treatment for burns he sustained.\"For my health and safety, it is better I don't take the risk to race in Abu Dhabi,\" Grosjean said in a video posted on social media. \"It is a very difficult decision, but it is the best one for my future.\"",

C\u00e1diz, which has now beaten Barcelona and Real Madrid upon its return to La Liga, took the lead early on when \u00d3scar Mingueza headed a corner towards his own goal, producing a save from Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen that fell into the path of \u00c1lvaro Gim\u00e9nez to score from close range. Barcelona leveled when Lionel Messi found Jordi Alba in the box, whose cross was deflected off Pedro Alcal\u00e1 for an own goal.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresRead MoreHowever, just six minutes later, C\u00e1diz's lead was restored when Alba's defensive throw-in was missed by Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet and a clearance from ter Stegen was blocked by \u00c1lvaro Negredo.The striker was left to tap into an open net to score his side's second and secure the victory. Messi looks on during Barcelona's defeat. \"We lost because of an incredible error. That is not the level I expect from my team,\" Koeman told Catalan network TV3 after the match, according to Reuters.\"It shows we were not concentrating. The attitude was not good tonight. I'm very disappointed and we have to improve.\"Despite having won all five of its Champions Leagues fixtures so far this season, Barcelona has struggled in the league, winning just four of its first 10 games. Many predicted the Catalan side would struggle this year following a tumultuous summer that saw Messi come close to leaving the club. In October, beleaguered president Josep Maria Bartomeu resigned along with the entire board of directors, and while uncertainty about the club's future leadership remains, on the pitch Barcelona has to play catch-up more than a quarter of the way through the domestic season.C\u00e1diz players celebrate their opening goal against Barcelona.\"It's very difficult to explain the goals we are conceding lately. It could be down to a lack of concentration,\" said Koeman.\"When we equalized, we had half an hour left to score again but then we conceded a goal that we cannot afford to concede, from a throw-in. We also lacked aggression when we didn't have the ball today.\"He added: \"It's a gigantic step back for our chances of fighting for the title.\"We have to see it like that after getting such a disappointing result today. 12 points is a very big distance but we have to keep going.\"In Saturday's other games, an own goal from goalkeeper Yassine Bounou saw Real Madrid secure an important 1-0 away win against Sevilla, while second-half goals from Thomas Lemar and Marcos Llorente gave table-topper Atl\u00e9tico Madrid -- the league's only undefeated side so far this season -- a 2-0 victory over Valladolid.",

Performing arts student Olivia Fox sang a powerful rendition of the national anthem, first in the language of the Eora Nation -- a group of Indigenous clans from the Sydney metropolitan area -- and then in English, before Australia's' Tri-Nations test against Argentina at Western Sydney Stadium. Fox, a Wiradjuri woman, was supported by the 23 Wallabies players, who were wearing their First Nations jerseys with an Indigenous design for only the second time this year, and could be seen belting out the words behind her. Indigenous Australians had their languages taken from them, and it's still causing issues today\"We were practicing it during the week and we were very proud to have that opportunity to do it, and I think it sounded pretty good too,\" said Australia captain Michael Hooper, according to Reuters. \"Wearing an indigenous jersey and singing that was great to be a part of.\"Read MoreIt was the first time Australia's national anthem -- Advance Australia Fair -- had been sung in an Indigenous language at a major sporting event and prompted an outpouring of pride and praise. Former Wallabies player Matt Giteau said on Twitter that it was a \"Special moment in Australian sport.. well done Wallabies.\"Australian rugby journalist Christy Doran called the anthem \"spine-tingling.\"\"The finest rendition of the Australian national anthem. That was brilliant. Never felt more proud of our anthem,\" he posted on Twitter.Other nations have Indigenous languages as part of their national anthems -- New Zealand's anthem, for example, is sung in both Maori and English.CNN sports anchor Alex Thomas said on Twitter: \"A long way to go for Australia to connect with its indigenous culture in the same way as NZ but hats off to the Wallabies.\"Australia sings the national anthem during the Tri-Nations rugby match between the Australian Wallabies and Argentina Pumas on December 5, 2020 in Sydney.Australia's controversial national anthem But Indigenous National Rugby League star Latrell Mitchell criticized the version performed on Saturday, saying the anthem still had the same flawed meaning, according to CNN affiliate Seven News. \"When will people understand that changing it to (an Indigenous) language doesn't change the meaning!\" he reportedly wrote on Instagram.Many Indigenous people in Australia consider the anthem to be racist and there has been  pushback against the phrase \"for we are young and free,\" given that Australia is home to one of the world's oldest known civilizations.Why US protests have prompted a conversation about race in Australia\"We aren't young and free. We're the longest-living culture in the world,\" Mitchell, who has been a long-time critic of the Australian anthem, previously said, according to Seven News. There is entrenched discrimination against Australia's Indigenous population.While the country's Indigenous population makes up just 3.3% of its 25 million people, they account for more than a quarter of its prisoners. Indigenous Australians are also almost twice as likely to die by suicide, have a life expectancy that is almost nine years lower, and have higher infant mortality rates than non-Indigenous Australians.The Black Lives Matter protests in the US, and around the world, this year once again brought these issues to the fore in Australia, with protests demanding an end to Indigenous deaths in custody.",

As part of the new deal, James is set to earn $41 million in the first year of the extension, before he earns $44.5 million in the final year of his contract.READ: How LeBron James stacks up against basketball's greatsLeBron James has agreed a two-year extension with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won the 2020 NBA Championship in October.Read MoreAt the age of 38, he will become a free agent again in 2023 -- the same year his eldest son Bronny graduates from high school.Last year, NBA commissioner Adam Silver opened up the possibility to go straight from high school to the NBA -- like James did back in 2003 -- rather than attend college or play in a foreign league first. Earlier this year, Silver doubled down on this plan, saying: \"We haven't made it a secret recently it is our intention, although we still need to work out the details with the players association, to return to an entry age of 18.\"In 2018, James indicated he wanted to play with his son, saying, \"If I'm on the same court as my son in the NBA. That would be No. 1 in my lifetime as an NBA player. I've thought about it because my son is about to be 14, and he might be able to get in there a little earlier.\"Bronny James is currently a sophomore at Sierra Canyon high school in Los Angeles, and is considered to be one of the best high school basketball prospects in the country.Bronny James is considered to be one of the best sophomore high school prospects in the country.In addition to James' new contract, on Thursday the Lakers also announced that Anthony Davis had re-signed with the team.Davis was a crucial part of the Lakers' championship winning team, averaging 27.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game during the playoffs.Per team policy, the terms of the deal were not released. However, it has been reported by the NBA that it is a five-year contract worth up to $190m. Ball brothersElsewhere in the NBA, another family has had their dream come true, as all three Ball brothers now have contracts with NBA teams. The eldest and youngest brothers have had more high profile entries into the league with Lonzo chosen second overall by the Lakers in the 2017 NBA Draft and LaMelo chosen third overall by the Charlotte Hornet's in this year's draft. Lonzo has since been traded to the New Orleans Pelicans.Now, middle brother LiAngelo Ball has signed with the Detroit Pistons. According to The Athletic, he reportedly signed a one-year, non-guaranteed contract on Wednesday. LiAngelo has had a more tumultuous journey to the NBA than his brothers. During his time at UCLA, he and two other teammates were arrested days before the 2017 season-opener in China and were questioned about shoplifting sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store, and UCLA  Athletic Director Dan Guerrero confirmed the trio shoplifted from three stores near their hotel. Potentially faced prison time, US President Donald Trump intervened and asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help, with the charges eventually dropped.If two Ball brothers were to play on the same roster, and faced the third brother, they could emulate the Holiday brothers. In December 2019, the Holidays became the first trio of brothers to play in the same game in league history.Brothers LaMelo Ball, LiAngelo Ball and Lonzo Ball (left to right) all now have contracts with NBA teams.Westbrook moves againMeanwhile, after reportedly demanding a trade away from the Houston Rockets after just one season, Russell Westbrook has got what he wants.The highest profile trade of this year's offseason sees 2017 NBA MVP Westbrook sent to the Washington Wizards in return for 2010 first overall pick John Wall along with a lottery-protected first-round draft pick.Russell Westbrook's trade to the Washington Wizards is his second in two seasons.Like Westbrook, Wall had reportedly also wanted out of his team. Wall leaves Washington after 10 years in which the team made the playoffs just four times, and never made it further than the second round.The upheaval in Houston may not be over just yet.The 2018 NBA MVP James Harden has also privately asked for a trade, but it is hoped the addition of Wall may entice him to stay with the team. According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Harden desires a trade to the Brooklyn Nets where he could play alongside perennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.",

        "content": "Turner Sports is a division of WarnerMedia as is CNN International (CNN)Ask anyone who the original baseball great is and they'll tell you the same name: Babe Ruth.A seven-time World Series champion with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, and a 12-time American League (AL) home run leader, Ruth played in Major League Baseball from the age of 19 until he was 40. Ruth was a vaulted star of baseball, the first great sports star in American history. He was baseball's Michael Jordan before the Chicago Bulls great's father was even born. He is undoubtedly a great of the game, yet he played at a time when baseball was segregated. Babe Ruth won the World Series seven times during a 21-year career.During first half of the 20th century, the major leagues of baseball were White only.Read MoreConsequently, many key Black figures in the early days of baseball in the United States are forgotten.One in particular, Andrew \"Rube\" Foster, is considered by many to be the father of Black baseball, and was instrumental in the foundation of the Negro National League in 1920. Andrew \"Rube\" Foster is considered by many to be the father of Black baseball.To mark the 100th anniversary of the Negro National League, Turner Sports produced a feature series, entitled \"Field of Dreams...Deferred\", which explores the history of Black baseball in the US.Senior vice president and creative director at Turner Sports' Drew Watkins told CNN that it was important to tell the story of the Negro Leagues, which has been slowly forgotten over time.\"The exploits of these players in these teams, however great they were, were not told the same way that the exploits of -- a lot of times -- their white counterparts playing professional baseball were,\" Watkins says.\"Everybody knows who Babe Ruth is. Of course, they know who he was. He's the guy, he's the best baseball player ever. This is the same time period that we're talking about. And these players, a lot of them, but if you go by the stories and the accounts, a lot of these players were, you know, as good, if not better.\"The father of Black American baseballFoster was a terrific player before he became a team owner and league commissioner. Foster had a large build, just like Ruth, but unlike Ruth he was primarily a pitcher rather than batter. In fact, many credit him with inventing the screwball.Legend has it that he was hired by New York Giants manager John McGraw to teach the screwball to the team's star pitcher Christy Mathewson, as the color line prevented Foster from playing for the Giants himself.Foster was made for bigger things than just playing thought. By 1910 he owned and managed his own team, the Leland Giants -- which later became the Chicago American Giants. Rube Foster (top right) played for the Chicago Leland Giants, which was managed and owned by Frank Leland, before taking over management and ownership of the team himself in 1911.A decade on, and after meetings with many different Black team owners, and the Negro National League was formed, with Foster installed as league president.Black Americans had their own league now, but racism was still rife. And as with contemporary life, racism manifested itself in the economic stability and logistics of the league.In the series, 'Field of Dreams...Deferred,' Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, says \"the one fundamental difference\" between the Major Leagues and the Negro Leagues was economic.\"Talent? No different,\" he says. \"But the Major Leagues had more money. And they had their own stadiums.\"Black owners like Foster had to rent stadiums from White teams, which cut into profits. The series later explores the struggle for integration and it is revealed that part of the MLB's resistance to integration stemmed from White owners not wanting to give up the stadium rent income that was a necessity for the Negro Leagues to pay in order to put on games.MLB team and stadium owners were profiting off segregation in baseball as long as it existed.Subsequently, during the early days of the Negro National League, teams were on the road constantly due to not having a fixed home stadium. Teams also needed their own bus as they could not ride trains during a time of segregation. Many couldn't stay in hotels as they were for White patrons only. So, they slept on the bus floor. Additionally, they were unable to eat at many restaurants too.Under the ownership and management of Rube Foster, the Chicago American Giants won the first three Negro National League championships from 1920-22.It is estimated in the series by Larry Lester, a Negro League baseball author and historian, that White Major League players earned between six and seven times as much as their Black counterparts in the Negro Leagues.Despite the social and economic hardship faced by the leagues, they gain popularity and prosper. The first 'Colored World Series' takes place in 1924.A year earlier in the White-only MLB, Ruth won the fourth of his seven World Series titles and his only AL MVP award. In the same year, he won his only AL batting champion title. History was being made by both Black and White players and organizations in baseball, but society's overt and covert racism means only a few have been historically valued and kept alive by collective memory.Watkins says his team wanted to give a platform to keep these stories alive, and remember the Black baseball greats of the past that aren't held in the same regard as Ruth because of their skin color.\"It's an important thing to find the people who have the knowledge and to give them a platform to keep these stories alive because all things were certainly not equal,\" he says. \"And the kind of record keeping and accounting and tracking of these stories, it's not just you don't hear about it because they actually weren't that good. No, they were actually pretty good. \"You didn't hear about them because of the color of their skin, basically.\"Black empowermentAt the end of the 1920s, further and irreconcilable hardship came with the Great Depression. As Larry Lester puts it, \"When we have an economic setback like the Great Depression, White America catches a cold. Black America catches pneumonia.\"Many Black Americans were out of work, so teams had no means of income coming through the turnstiles. Foster dies a year later of a heart attack, and in 1931, the Negro National League folds.\"The death of 'Rube' Foster devastated the Negro National League,\" Kendrick says. \"But then you couple that with the Great Depression and it had virtually no shot.\"The league was later revived and Foster's impact had taken hold.Earlier this year, MLB teams wore Negro National League throwback jerseys with a badge commemorating the centennary of the league.While the story of the Negro Leagues of baseball may have been underrepresented in baseball history books, Foster's significance to Black Americans and the Black community in sport is not and should not be downplayed.Since 1971, players of the Negro Leagues have been considered for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Some 35 \"Negro Leaguers\", including Foster, are among the 333 baseball figures currently enshrined in the Hall of Fame alongside White greats like Ruth.It is not just this accolade where the significance of figures from the Negro Leagues is found though.For Kendrick, Foster's story, and the story of the league, is one of economic empowerment and unprecedented leadership within the Black community.When the Negro Leagues folded following integration, the Black community lost sports team owners, executives and coaches -- and with that, the loss of Black role models in positions of power in sport that were not just players.In Major League Baseball now, there is only one Black owner: Derek Jeter, CEO of the Miami Marlins, who owns a 4% stake in the team -- but the majority owner Bruce Sherman is White.Derek Jeter, who owns a 4% stake in the Miami Marlins, is the only Black owner of an MLB team.It isn't just ownership where Black representation is noticeably low in American sport. Compared with the NFL and the NBA, the percentage of Black Americans playing in Major League Baseball (MLB) is far lower.In the NFL, nearly 60% of players are Black, while in the NBA as many as 81% of the players are as well. In the MLB, that figure is 7.8%.And in terms of fan interest, a 2019 study showed 5% of African Americans call baseball their favorite sport, as opposed to 37% who prefer football and 29% who prefer basketball. Perhaps that figure would be higher with more Black Americans in positions of power.By remembering the Negro Leagues and people like Foster, America remembers a story of Black empowerment.Andrea Williams, author of 'Baseball's Leading Lady: Effa Manley and the Rise and Fall of the Negro Leagues', says as the series closes, \"If we were able to accomplish what we were able to accomplish in 1920 with far less resources, what are we capable of now? I think the legacy, honestly, is that we are more powerful than we know.\"",

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Residents of a community in central Germany have unexpectedly inherited property and a stock portfolio worth \u20ac6.2 million ($7.5 million), following the death of an elderly neighbor.Renate Wedel had lived in the Weiperfelden district of Waldsolms in Hesse, central Germany, with her husband, Alfred Wedel, since 1975, according to a statement from the Waldsolms district, which is made up of 6 villages. Germany's ex-royals want their riches back, but past ties to Hitler stand in the way Alfred, who was \"successful\" and \"active\" on the stock exchange, died in 2014, and Renate, who had been receiving care in a nursing home in Frankfurt since 2016, died in December 2019 at the age of 81. In April this year, the district said, it was informed that Renate had bequeathed it a bank balance, shares and valuables. Renate's sister, who was her original heir, had already died, local media outlet Hessenschau reported.Read MoreThe news came as a shock to the authorities. \"I thought at first, this is simply not possible, I thought a comma had slipped, something is not quite right,\" local mayor Bernd Heine told Hessenschau.The municipality also inherited a property in Weiperfelden, which was initially left as a legacy, but was declined by the initial inheritor because of the cost of maintaining the house and outbuildings and because residents' contributions were due for work on a local road. Hydrogen-powered trains could replace diesel engines in GermanyThe community is obliged to use the inheritance, valued at \u20ac6.2 million, for \"community facilities and infrastructure.\"\"The community of Waldsolms posthumously thanks the Wedel couple for this important inheritance,\" the community said in a statement. \"We will deal with it very responsibly, develop our community for the good of all and keep an honorable memory of both,\" it added.Local residents have some ideas about what the money should be spent on. Heine told Hessenschau that money was needed for cycling paths, buildings and a kindergarten, while residents suggested the money should be spent on an outdoor pool, public transportation and facilities for local children.",

        "content": "London (CNN)When the United Kingdom became the first Western nation to approve a Covid-19 vaccine earlier this week, the news was greeted with praise from some health officials across the pond. But there was one notable exception.Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert and perhaps one of the world's most recognizable scientists, suggested that UK regulators had not scrutinized the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as carefully as their US counterparts, and that the British approval had been \"rushed.\"\"We have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the [Food and Drug Administration]. The UK did not do it as carefully and they got a couple of days ahead,\" Fauci told Fox News on Wednesday.Fauci's comments were the opening salvo in a verbal jousting match between US and UK officials that experts said risked undermining public confidence in the safety of vaccines.By Thursday evening, Fauci had apologized on British television for his earlier comments.Read More\"There really has been a misunderstanding, and for that, I'm sorry and I apologize for that. I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the UK,\" he told the BBC.\"We do things a certain way in the United States, possibly a little different, not necessarily better or worse than what's done in the UK, and I think that's where we slipped, where I slipped. I made it seem one was better than the other. We just do it a little bit differently.\"Dr. Anthony Fauci at a White House task force press briefing on November 19. Getting down and dirtySo how did the UK leapfrog the US in the race to approve a vaccine? There is one main difference in approval process between the two countries -- the way regulators treat data. The UK's independent regulator -- the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) -- typically uses data reports from drug makers to come to a decision on approval. This is also the approach taken by several other regulators worldwide, including the EU regulator the European Medicines Agency (EMA).America's FDA, however, usually re-analyzes the raw data from drug companies before signing off on approval, which can take a bit longer.FDA chief meets with Meadows again as Trump remains frustrated with pace of vaccine approval\"We in the United States are in a unique position, which is that among all global regulators, we are the ones that actually don't just look at the companies' tables. We actually get down and dirty and we look at the actual adverse event reports, the bad spelling errors that are made by physicians sometimes, et cetera,\" Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told an American Medical Association webinar Thursday. Professor Stephen Evans, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Sciences, said he didn't know how often the FDA's re-analyses resulted in different conclusions to the presentation of data from drug companies. \"My suspicion is that that would be rare,\" he told CNN. \"If it all leads to the same numbers, one might argue that it's a delay that hasn't given any gains.\"Evans also said the MHRA had more flexibility when it came to organizing meetings to discuss vaccine data and approvals.  The FDA is required to hold public meetings which are scheduled well in advance. \"The FDA provides its own full written assessment of the application, and then both the company's application and the FDA's assessment are reviewed at a day-long public meeting by an independent expert advisory group,\" Mark McClellan, a former FDA commissioner, told CNN in an email. \"Preparing for, conducting, and responding to the input at this meeting takes a bit of additional time. But it not only helps assure a thorough review -- it also creates more public transparency about important decisions and can help with confidence in the decision in the medical community and the public. Those things are very important as well.\"When can I get a coronavirus vaccine?In a statement on Friday, MHRA chief Dr. June Raine said that \"the way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards. We are well aware of our national situation and therefore we have mounted teams, built our capability and worked in parallel. I want to thank the colleagues who have worked day and night, weekends, to enable us to come to this position. The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world.\"  President Donald Trump, meanwhile, is showing frustration that America didn't get there first. FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn was summoned to the White House several times in recent days to explain why the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine hadn't been approved yet.But the US is not far behind the UK. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss Pfizer/BioNTech's emergency authorization application. Tensions over vaccinesFauci, in his apology on Thursday, suggested that there would have been blowback in the US if the FDA had approved a vaccine as quickly as the UK.\"If we had approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society that has, really I think, in some respects in the United States, too much skepticism about the process.\"Melinda Mills, Nuffield Professor of Sociology at the University of Oxford, criticized Fauci for initially casting doubt on the UK's vaccine approval process at a time when governments are struggling to convince enough citizens to take the vaccine to bring an end to the pandemic.\"The allegation [from Fauci] is extremely damaging to public confidence when we already know [vaccine hesitancy] is high,\" Mills told CNN, adding she was pleased that Fauci had clarified his comments. UK Education Minister Gavin Williamson didn't help matters when he offered his own theory on how the UK had beaten the US and European allies to the punch on approving a vaccine. \"We've obviously got the best medical regulators, much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have,\" he told London's LBC radio station Thursday. \"That doesn't surprise me at all because we're a much better country than every single one of them.\"Why I put my hand up to be part of a Covid-19 vaccine trialMills also said Williamson's comments were \"really unhelpful\" and noted there was blame to be shared on both sides of the Atlantic. Sergio Della Sala, Professor of Human Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh told CNN that governments and officials should stop combining politics and health policy in a bid to treat vaccine approvals as a race to victory.\"The issue is now one of communication. We should avoid mixing politics with health, alienating EU and US partners and players by claiming an alleged superiority, hence provoking their reaction which could be damaging,\" Della Sala said.Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser to the Operation Warp Speed in the US, praised the UK's approval earlier this week, describing the MHRA as \"an external regulatory agency of the highest caliber and standards equivalent to those of the FDA\" and saying it should give Americans more confidence in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.The first doses of the vaccine reportedly arrived in the UK on Thursday night, carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel. The first shots are set to be administered next week.US officials, meanwhile, are preparing for their December 10 meeting to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.Despite the two countries taking different initial approaches to approval, both may begin the New Year on a similar footing.",

Yet the movement also spread outside Britain's big urban centers, as anti-racist campaigners challenged institutional racism in smaller towns and cities which have less ethnic diversity and are less known for their activism. The tragedy of Floyd's death inspired ordinary people, thousands of miles away in the UK, to fight for institutional change in their communities under the banner of \"Black Lives Matter\" (BLM).Six months later, here are some of the voices of those continuing to fight for racial equality outside of the global spotlight.Read More Maia Thomas\nEquality activist, Exeter\"I've been assaulted, required security protection and had threats against my life for speaking up.\"Maia Thomas, 21, is an activist who campaigns for Black history and anti-racism to be taught in English schools.In June, Thomas used social media to organize a peaceful protest and vigil for Floyd in Exeter, a small, historic city in the English county of Devon, around 170 miles southwest of London.\"People were shouting at me in the street 'you're pretty for a Black girl, you should use your looks instead of your voice,' and 'White supremacy will always win.'

After the protest she said she required security patrols in the city's shopping center where she worked.\"I was given a key card to go through the back-exit doors just in case I was being followed,\" she said. \"At times my manager escorted me. It was serious.\"Despite the violence Thomas says she experienced, she regards the march as a success.\"There were more Black people at the protest than I've ever seen in the whole time that I've lived in Devon,\" Thomas said.Many parts of Britain are predominately White. In Exeter alone, out of an estimated 128,900 residents, around 93% are White according to the UK's most recent census, in 2011.Thomas' views on education had an immediate impact. Scores of schools and other educational institutions have asked for the 21-year-old's help to run equality workshops. Activists are also pushing to diversify England's national school curriculum, though this has caused a backlash.Kemi Badenoch, a Black government minister, for example, criticized the influence of BLM on education in an October 2020 speech in parliament. Thomas is also a part of \"Black Lives Matter Somerset,\" helping to produce Black History packs for schools and working to increase diversity within her local council. Next year she will attend a conference in Berlin as a UK delegate to speak about Britain's BLM movement.She has no intention of stopping anytime soon, but says campaigning can feel overwhelming: \"Every organization, business, school and individual does not realize how draining it is to constantly relive trauma because no one has actually wanted to listen until now.\"I realized in Zoom calls, assemblies and talks if it was any other subject, the school or council would pay for a speaker,\" she added. \"So why should we as activists and educators be doing this for free?\"Liza Bilal\nAll Black Lives UK branch founding member, Bristol \"Black people shouldn't have to be brutalized for White people to care.\"Liza Bilal is a 21-year-old student and one of the most prominent faces in Britain's BLM movement. In June, Bilal and five young activists arranged a protest in Bristol, a port city in southwest England that has strong historic links to the UK slave trade. Britain enslaved 3.1 million Africans between 1640 and 1807, transporting them to colonies around the globe, according to Historic England, a public body. Many of them left on ships from Bristol.Bristol is now 78% White British with a growing Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic population at 16%.An estimated 10,000 people marched in support of the BLM movement in Bristol on June 7. The peaceful protest culminated with demonstrators toppling the statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and hurling it into the River Avon. Their act of resistance became a focal point for protests in the UK. It ignited a national conversation on slave trader memorials, and Colston's empty plinth was secretly occupied with the statue of a BLM protester. That was removed 24 hours later by the local authority. The protests were a call to be heard, said Bilal. \"People have been petitioning for the statue to come down for decades and were routinely ignored by the council.\"Bilal believes Floyd's death forced people outside the US to reflect on their own issues with racism. She said the brutality of his death awakened \"a lot of people that hadn't really thought about systemic racism before.\"The backdrop to 2020 has also been a deadly pandemic, where Britain's ethnic minorities are up to 50% more likely to die than White Brits, according to a recent government review. Bilal believes it's time for the UK to address institutional racism.\"Black and Brown people have been disproportionately affected. We know that's nothing to do with biology and everything to do with systemic racism,\" she said.In November, the UK Human Rights Committee said the coronavirus death rate disparity in the UK is in part due to \"deep-seated inequalities.\" The inquiry found that major factors include minority groups being more likely to work in frontline jobs and less likely to be protected with adequate PPE.Yet the surge of protests has also had unintended consequences. Bilal fears the summer's demonstrations have emboldened Britain's far-right groups.\"In the summer I saw a group of White supremacists. I think there were maybe around 200-300 guarding the Cenotaph [war memorial] which is next to the plinth from which Edward Colston was torn down,\" she told CNN.UK security experts warn that far-right extremism in the UK is increasing. In June more than 100 people were arrested after violence broke out at a far-right counter-protest in London targeting BLM demonstrations. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the disruption as \"racist thuggery.\"The backlash hasn't halted the All Black Lives campaign's mission. They continue to hold monthly protests and weekly panels.\"We have to have a resilience that is unbreakable in the face of something as pervasive as White supremacy,\" said Bilal.Graham Campbell\nScottish National Party councilor, Glasgow \"You can get rid of every statue, and every street name, and still have institutionalized racism.\"Since Scottish National Party (SNP) councilor Graham Campbell moved from London to Glasgow 20 years ago, Scotland's largest city has become increasingly ethnically diverse. Around 12% of Glasgow's population is from an ethnic minority, according to the 2011 census, and more than one in five students in the city's primary schools are from non-White backgrounds.In 2017 Campbell became Glasgow's first African Caribbean councilor. He's determined to see the city's growing diversity reflected in its workforce, citing the underemployment of qualified Black professionals. A 2016 analysis of government data by the UK's Trades Union Congress found that Black and ethnic minority graduates with a first degree were more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their White counterparts. \"They're not getting interviewed. They're not getting the breaks. There's been a lack of awareness that something structural [has] to adjust,\" Campbell told CNN.In June, hundreds of people staged anti-racism rallies in the center of Glasgow. Campbell said the protests were the Black community's demand for change.\"This generation has decided that the racism, daily microaggressions, and experiences of exclusion from a job market -- they're no longer prepared to tolerate it. They felt the George Floyd moment. They said no more,\" Campbell said.Since joining the local authority, Campbell has seen its ethnic minority workforce double. He wants to reach a proportionate level of employment by 2030. \"Had we relied on the rate that we were going, I calculated it would take 107 years before we got a proportionate level of Black employment,\" he said.Campbell helped create an employment working group that monitors diversity in council departments. He worries that without enforcing inclusive hiring initiatives, equality would remain a pipe dream.According to Campbell, changing place names and removing statues isn't enough to fight racism in Britain. Instead, he believes consciously challenging racism is necessary.\"People in Scotland too often presumed that you are anti-racist by default. In a racist society, especially one with a colonial history like Britain, you have to be actively anti-racist,\" said Campbell.\"It's the unconscious biases, that translate into institutional practices, that discriminate against non-White people.\"Robert Walcott & Robert Cotterell\nDirector and chairman, Sheffield and District African Caribbean Community Association, Sheffield \"Black Lives Matter needs to matter to us as Black people. A lot of it seems to be trying to convince White people -- if they don't know by now, they never will.\" -- Robert WalcottSheffield is one of Britain's biggest cities, with a population of 575,400 in 2016 and around 20,000 Black residents, according to the 2011 census. The Sheffield and District African Caribbean Community Association (SADACCA) provides a space for the local African and Caribbean communities to socialize in the northern English city.Robert Walcott, a director of SADACCA, believes BLM should primarily help Black people in their day-to-day lives, rather than educating White audiences.\"I want to focus on what we are doing after the protests. I'd like to see more of what we're doing to support ourselves as opposed to trying to raise the issue to a White audience,\" he told CNN.Walcott's mother is a part of the Windrush generation, the Caribbean immigrants who moved to the UK from the late 1940s at the invitation of the government.The Windrush generation was invited to Britain to rebuild the country after World War II. They comprised the UK's first large wave of Caribbean migration and were named after the Empire Windrush passenger liner that carried some of them across the Atlantic. The cruel consequences of tougher immigration policies implemented from 2012 were revealed five years later, in what came to be known as the Windrush scandal. Those who had arrived decades earlier, without papers to prove their legal status as citizens as such documentation wasn't needed before, had been denied government services, wrongly detained or even deported.\"I think there is a slight disconnect between the Windrush elders because they don't fully understand why there is such hostility from young people towards the situation,\" he said.Walcott said that \"racism was a fact of life\" for the Windrush generation, who see younger Black people as currently having more opportunities than they did. \"There have been more opportunities for Black people [created] in their lifetime,\" he added.\"There is a fragility of people who are still refusing to accept that racism is the world's number one pandemic. Still people don't even know what racism is or about England's major role in the slave trade,\" said Robert Cotterell, SADACCA chairman.BLM grabbed headlines in 2020 but the movement has been active since 2012, when Trayvon Martin's death sparked the hashtag. The deaths of several African Americans at the hands of police have kept protesters marching since.Before the protests \"there were no conversations at all from institutions and key players in the city,\" said Cotterell.SADACCA has continued discussions with authorities and institutions in Sheffield that \"traditionally have had, and still have, issues around institutional structural racism.\"Despite the growing interest in hearing Black voices, Cotterell says anti-racism activists aren't fairly compensated for their time and work.\"They can't keep using us as the experts because if we were White, we'd be getting paid for our knowledge,\" Cotterell told CNN. \"If we were White, we would become consultants, we'd be getting paid... \u00a31,500 a day.\"A CNN/Savanta ComRes poll this year found that Black Britons' experiences with racism differ from other ethnic groups. \"Black people are considerably more dissatisfied with race relations in Britain than other ethnic minorities,\" said Chris Hopkins, associate director of Savanta ComRes.Nadia Thomas\nBLM activist, Chepstow \"I had to block a relative because he would constantly send me negative memes, articles and videos of Black people.\"Nadia Thomas, 25, says she was forced to cut ties with a close family member after receiving relentless offensive messages due to her supporting BLM.While 95.6% of the population of Wales is White, in Chepstow, a small town near the border with England, that figure is 98.1%.\"My relative sent me a meme from the film 'Zulu' where all the British soldiers took over South Africa and knelt, about to go into battle. It said, 'me and the boys, hashtag taking the knee,'\" Thomas told CNN.With a mixed-race background and having both White and Black parents, Thomas was shocked by her White relative's insensitivity. The relative had worked for her Antiguan father for many years.\"It's an awakening and it goes beyond ignorance,\" she said.In June this year Thomas and a group of friends organized a BLM protest. \"At first, I couldn't take part, I didn't even want to turn on the TV,\" she said.As Thomas watched the cause spread globally she became less skeptical.She felt responsible for confronting the racism within her own town -- no matter how small or rural. \"Since Brexit, [Donald] Trump and Boris [Johnson]... people aren't afraid to be racist. I always thought it was a passive ignorance in this country and now I see blatant racism. It's clearly always been here and it's now allowed by people in power,\" Thomas told CNN.In post-Brexit Britain, overt racism appears to be growing. Last year a report found that 71% of people from ethnic minorities in the UK had reported experiencing racial discrimination, an increase of 13 percentage points since the 2016 Brexit vote.Thomas is working on ways to tackle racism in Chepstow. \"I've got a meeting with the Labour Party and my constituency to do with Black history and diversity workshops in school curriculums,\" she told CNN.\"Nationally, this needs to be addressed. I don't want to just protest. I want to shake up the world.\"Khady Gueye\nLocal Equality Commission founder, Gloucestershire \"A lot of people in the UK don't acknowledge racial violence. They think this is a US problem. Actually, racism is rife in the UK.\"When Khady Gueye co-organized a BLM protest in Lydney, Gloucestershire, a small town in southwest England, she didn't know it would come with controversy. Members of the local council wrote an open letter demanding the demonstration be canceled, two local councilors resigned in protest due to the letter, and Gueye began to feel unwelcome in her hometown, though the event eventually went ahead.\"We were followed home. We were threatened. We were told people were coming to find us. I moved out of my house for a few weeks just because someone followed me home,\" said Gueye who is mixed-race Senegalese-British. In response to the backlash, she founded the Local Equality Commission, a racial equality group that runs workshops to challenge racism in rural areas.\"The main aim of that was to try and suture some of the divides that occurred because of the protests that we organized,\" Gueye told CNN. \"We wanted to reaffirm to people that this isn't a problem that's going away.\"According to Gueye, education on racism is needed most in rural areas: \"The UK doesn't seem to understand how the BLM movement in the US resonates with the UK. In rural areas we don't have the exposure to diversity. There is no exposure to this knowledge.\"The voices of Gueye and others in small towns demonstrate the power of protest, education and allyship. As the national focus on BLM dies down, Gueye aims to keep the conversation alive in Gloucestershire.\"George Floyd's murder is the perfect example of the police brutality that happens frequently throughout the world, throughout the US, throughout the UK. We are in a system that is failing Black people,\" said Gueye.\"Everything that has happened over the past six months has been a trajectory towards change,\" she added. \"It's about trying to engage with people who don't necessarily understand or empathize with what we're trying to fight for.\"Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Khady Gueye as the co-founder of the Local Equality Commission. She is the founder of the group.",

        "content": "(CNN)Scientists are a step closer to restoring the sight of blind people using brain implants, researchers from the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience said, after a series of successful experiments on monkeys. Researchers developed implants containing 1,024 electrodes -- conductors that carry electrical currents into and out of the brain -- and implanted them in the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes visual information, in two macaque monkeys.By sending electrical signals to the monkeys' brains, researchers created \"phosphenes\" -- dots of light that could be \"seen\" or perceived by the brain, and can be used to create the illusion of shapes and objects.Paralyzed man uses experimental device to regain hand movements  Lead researcher Pieter Roelfsema told CNN that the team wanted to show that it was possible to induce \"vision of objects\" through direct electrical stimulation of the brain, explaining that the visual cortex has \"a sort of visual map of space.\"\"You can work with it like a matrix board along the highway. If you stimulate or light up multiple boards, you can see patterns,\" he told CNN. Read MoreThe monkeys performed a series of tasks, and, using their artificial vision, they were able to recognize shapes and \"percepts\" including lines, moving dots and letters, researchers reported Friday in findings published in the journal Science.Wider implications for restoring sight The team believes that such technology could one day be used to simulate sight in blind people who have been able to see at some point in their lives. Roelfsema told CNN that when people's eyes stop functioning and they lose their sight, their cortex is deprived of input. \"What you then do is then bypass the malfunctioning eyes, and directly plug the images that you normally see into the visual cortex,\" he said. \"If you stimulate with one electrode, you get one dot of light. If you stimulate with a pattern of electrodes, you can create a pattern of these dots, and from these patterns, of dots you can reproduce meaningful images,\" he said, explaining that dots could be used to create letters of the alphabet.Elon Musk is making implants to link the brain with a smartphoneIn the future, Roelfsema said, a person could carry a camera on their glasses which could translate the images into electrical stimulation patterns for the brain, and send them to the electrodes. \"The electrodes would then activate the appropriate cells, and the person would be able to see maybe a car that's coming by, or a person who is walking into the road. It will give rise to a form of vision,\" he said, adding that he hopes the technology will be ready to trial in humans by 2023.'Holy grail' of researchResearchers from around the world are looking at the cortex as a way of restoring vision. This year, a team from Spain's Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University revealed they were able to use brain implants to temporarily restore rudimentary vision in blind patients. \"The ability to artificially impose patterns of neural activity that resemble those in the brain is a holy grail of neuroprosthetic research,\" Tom Mrsic-Flogel, director of the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour at University College London, told CNN via email. How technology is changing what it means to be humanMrsic-Flogel, who was not involved with the research, told CNN that the team from Amsterdam \"demonstrate that non-human primates can react to complex patterns of stimulation in the visual cortex in a way that is similar when viewing normal shapes. \"Although we will never know what another animal perceives, it is tempting to speculate that electrical stimulation resulted in visual perception,\" he said.\"This transformative study adds to the growing body of evidence that links neural activity and sensation.\"Studies like these will pave the way for brain implants that augment the function of the brain when it becomes compromised, for example when we lose peripheral vision or hearing,\" he added.",

        "content": "(CNN)David Beckham is perhaps as famed for his looks as he is for his football career -- but a new campaign is showing him as you've never seen him before.The 45-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder has been given a digital makeover which imagines what Beckham might look like in his 70s. It is part of a campaign from the British arm of US nonprofit Malaria No More, which says there is an agreement among scientists that malaria can be defeated within our lifetime. Beckham, who also played for LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, appears to travel forward in time in a campaign video, which is encouraging people to share their support on social media.David Beckham reflects on newly formed Inter Miami's 'long, tough journey'Appearing as an older man -- Beckham looks to have aged about 30 years -- he tells an audience in the film that the world has defeated malaria -- \"humankind's oldest and deadliest enemy\" -- to a round of applause.Read MoreThe video then flits back to 2020, with the sportsman giving a sobering message.\"Right now, the fight is harder than ever. And as a father it breaks my heart that a child dies every two minutes from malaria,\" he says.\"A future free from this disease is possible in our lifetimes. We must unite and tell our leaders that we won't stop until the job is done. Join me and share to declare that malaria must die so millions can live.\"Malaria, which kills around 400,000 people a year -- the majority children younger than five -- is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent across sub-Saharan Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease is preventable and curable using mosquito nets and antimalarial drugs.Malaria No More said in a press release that, against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, it hoped the campaign would \"reignite the belief that humankind is capable of uniting to defeat diseases.\"As well as his nonprofit work, Beckham is part of a five-person ownership team headed by Miami-born MasTec chairman Jorge Mas running MLS side Inter Miami.Mapping the future with Africa's first drone academyThe former England captain -- Beckham played 58 times for his country -- is a founding member of Malaria No More UK Leadership Council. \"The fight against malaria is a cause close to my heart because the disease remains a huge killer of children and we have the opportunity to change that in our lifetime,\" said Beckham.Pedro Alonso, director of the WHO Global Malaria Program, added: \"The emergence of Covid-19 has shown the world how critical our health systems are. \"It is crucial that 2021 sees the world getting back on track towards achieving existing targets to reduce malaria as we come through the pandemic. \"By investing in ending malaria, we will not only save lives that would otherwise be lost to this deadly disease; we will also protect current health systems.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Neymar produced one of the performances of this season's Champions League as he helped Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-1 victory against Manchester United. The Brazilian superstar scored twice and consistently tormented the Manchester United defenders on Wednesday evening.His opening rifled finish stunned a Manchester United team full of confidence having won the reverse fixture in Paris earlier in the competition and coming off the back of a dramatic comeback previously in the Premier League. Although Marcus Rashford's deflected strike leveled the score, Marquinhos' second-half goal put the French side on top before Fred was sent off for his second yellow card. And Neymar's masterful skill and dribbling played a key part in PSG's third goal to seal the victory and left three teams tied atop the group alongside RB Leipzig.

But just as it did the year before, a late Rashford strike stunned the French side, and left PSG's Champions League qualification hopes in tatters. So, travelling to Manchester, PSG was out for revenge and immediately looked a much-improved side, with some slick interplay inside the first 10 minutes unlocking a static Manchester United defense to open the scoring thanks to Neymar's low drive. Marquinhos celebrates scoring against Manchester United.And with PSG on top, Manchester United was handed a lifeline after Brazilian midfielder Fred was surprisingly shown a yellow card rather than a red by the referee after he seemingly moved his head towards to Leandro Paredes in an aggressive manner. However, against the run of play, Rashford once again got Manchester United back into the game, although it was accompanied by a large slice of luck, after his long-range shot was deflected past the despairing Keylor Navas in goal. After the break, Manchester United created a whole host of chances, with Anthony Martial blazing over from close range and Edinson Cavani chipping onto the bar. And those chances went begging as PSG took the lead. A corner that wasn't cleared properly eventually pinballed around the box before Marquinhos was able to stab it home. From the resulting kickoff, the game went from bad to worse for the English side as Fred was shown his second yellow after clipping a PSG attacker, although it was a close call. Against 10 men, Neymar's class shone through, twisting defenders throughout. As the defenders tired, he linked up expertly with Mbappe and his other attackers to finally stretch PSG's lead and seal the result. Neymar celebrates after he scores his team's third goal against Manchester United.\"It was a disappointing night. We wanted to win the game, win the group. Football is a game of fine margins,\" Manchester United defender Harry Maguire told BT Sport afterwards.\"We had better chances. Their two goals are scrappy goals -- richochet and pinball around the box. I feel we deserved something. You've got to take your chances and not give away soft goals. We're still in control of going through to the knockout stages.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosWith just one round of fixtures remaining, all of PSG, Manchester United and Leipzig are tied on nine points with United travelling to Germany to face Leipzig while PSG host \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir.",

        "content": "(CNN)Two days after being disciplined, Pablo Matera has been reinstated as Argentina's rugby captain and, along with teammates Guido Petti and Santiago Socino, had his suspension from the squad lifted following an investigation into \"discriminatory and xenophobic\" social media posts dating from between 2011 and 2013.The trio were suspended on Tuesday for the derogatory posts that included remarks directed at Bolivian and Paraguayan domestic staff, women, Black people and insults about religion.However, the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) announced on Thursday that the players' apologies and good behavior in the intervening years meant these punishments were now \"unnecessary.\"\"During the statement, the three players expressed their deep regret, reiterated the apology, ratified that it is not what they think and that it was a reckless act typical of immaturity,\" the UAR said in a statement. \"However, they take full charge and responsibility.\"The Disciplinary Committee has considered and valued the attitude of the three players during this process, and understands that they have not repeated similar actions during these more than eight years, and that they have shown during this time to be people of firm and upright values and worthy of being part of our team.Read More\"The disciplinary process continues and the Commission will reach a final resolution in the next few days according to the procedure times, in this first instance it considers that the maintenance of preventive measures is unnecessary, for which it resolves to lift the suspension of the three players and restore the captaincy of Pablo Matera.\"'Caused disappointment'Guido Petti takes part in a training session with Argentina on November 27.The derogatory posts surfaced after the Pumas were criticized for not doing enough to pay tribute to Diego Maradona during their match against New Zealand following the death of the Argentine football great last week.In a video posted by the Pumas on Twitter, Matera apologized that the team's tribute -- which, according to Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn, amounted to wearing black ribbon on their shirt sleeves -- \"caused disappointment.\"Head coach Mario Ledesma told a press conference in Sydney that the trio would not be in the squad for Saturday's test against Australia after the players had received \"lot of hate\" during the week.\"All I can say about these three fine players and great men is that they are great human beings,\" said Ledesma, per Reuters.\"They have been suffering a lot this week, their families have been suffering a lot this week, and it's really sad to see. Obviously they acknowledge what they did and they are really regretful and ashamed of what they did, and we all are.\"\"It would be inappropriate to comment while the UAR undertakes its investigations,\" a World Rugby spokesperson told CNN.Matera plays club rugby for Stade Francais and in a statement on its website, the Parisian team said the Argentina captain \"has always been irreproachable in his attitude towards his teammates and opponents, both on and off the field.\"\"Upon his return from selection, the player, who has already publicly apologized, will be summoned by the club's management,\" added Stade Francais.Matera's social media posts from between 2011 and 2013 have attracted criticism from one South American sporting great.\"Mr. Pablo Matera, Bolivians and Paraguayans are honest, hard-working people, but not racist. You do a lot of damage to rugby and to your beautiful country, you have not won anything,\" tweeted former Paraguay international goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert on December 1.\"Mr. Pablo Matera, you damaged rugby and rugby did not polish you.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered his government to start large-scale vaccinations against Covid-19 from next week. Russia became the first country in the world to approve its coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, in August, authorizing the treatment for public use even before crucial Phase 3 trials were conducted. The move drew criticism from scientific circles.On Wednesday Putin, speaking during a televised government meeting, said Russia should begin a widespread vaccination effort.\"Over two million doses have been produced or will have been produced in the next few days. The first registered vaccine against the coronavirus infection in the world, Sputnik V, will reach this level of production. This allows us to begin -- if not mass -- a large-scale vaccination,\" the Russian leader said.Putin added that the primary focus should be the \"vaccination of the two risk groups: of doctors and teachers.\"Putin still hasn't taken Russia's vaccine, months after his daughter didRead MoreHe was addressing Russia Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, who is responsible for the country's coronavirus response. \"If you believe that we are close to this step I would ask you to organize work in a way that by the end of next week we would start this large-scale vaccination,\" he told Golikova.Golikova replied that Russia will be able to start large-scale vaccination in December. She reiterated that the first priority was to inoculate doctors and teachers but added that she was looking at vaccinating larger groups.\"I would like to state again that obviously, it will be voluntary, free of charge for citizens and this week I hope... I'm sure we will finish all the preparations to report that we are ready to start it next week,\" Golikova said during the meeting.Putin replied: \"Let's agree that you will not just report, but will start the large-scale vaccination, okay?\"Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said Wednesday that to date more than 100,000 Russian citizens had already been vaccinated with Sputnik. Murashko didn't specify a breakdown of the 100,000 people but phase 3 trials are currently underway which involve more than 40,000 volunteers. More than 20,000 people have received their first dose of Sputnik V as part of the Phase 3 trial, and 16,000 participants have received the second dose, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has funded the vaccine. Putin urges Russian officials not to sugarcoat pandemic struggles as situation remains 'challenging'The vaccine developers have previously said Sputnik-V was administered to a group of 10,000 volunteers from the \"red zones\" of Russian hospitals in September. Moreover, the Russian military said last week 2,500 servicemen had been vaccinated with more to come by the end of the year. The jab has already been administered to some Russian frontline health care workers, teachers and several top level officials outside the clinical trials.Putin's order to intensify the vaccination program comes after the UK became the first Western country to authorize the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday.",

Not a single person has been officially charged in this case, although many are being investigated, including Cosachov.Speaking to local media in Buenos Aires on Tuesday, Cosachov's lawyer Vadim Mischanchuk said the raids weren't surprising.\"It's a measure that doesn't surprise us at all,\" Mischanchuk said. \"Whenever [the circumstances into] a person's causes of death are investigated, these measures are usually taken.\"Read MoreMischanchuk also expressed his client's willingness to cooperate with the authorities, adding that Maradona's medical homecare recommended by Cosachov met the proper medical criteria. Speaking to Argentina's official news agency Telam on Tuesday, Mischanchuk said Cosachov felt \"calm\" regarding the \"medical decisions she made\" in treating Maradona.  READ: Maradona did 'everything better and bigger, but fell more dangerously and darker'Aerial view of the burial of the late Argentine football legend Diego Armando Maradona.Further raids On Sunday, Argentine police had raided the home and office of Maradona's doctor, Leopoldo Luque, where they retrieved documents and cell phones. On November 3, Luque performed successful surgery on Maradona for what is more commonly known as a blood clot on the brain. He was subsequently discharged from hospital on November 11.Argentine prosecutors investigating potential gross negligence in Diego Maradona's death Luque has repeatedly told local media that he will cooperate with authorities and insists he did everything he could for Maradona, who he has described as his friend. Earlier on Monday and without a previous request from authorities, Luque presented himself to the Prosecutor's Office in the province of Buenos Aires to testify.However, his statement was not taken because authorities are still working on the investigation's file.Maradona died on Wednesday at the age of 60 in a house in the town of Tigre, Argentina. The cause of death was an \"acute secondary lung edema due to exacerbated chronic heart failure,\" a source from the Argentinian Justice Ministry present at the time of the autopsy told CNNE.Maradona struggled with substance abuse and addiction during a glittering career on the soccer field and, according to Luque, did not always welcome medical care.",

This is a significant increase from previous surveys, which have taken years.The result is a new atlas of the universe, according to Australian science agency CSIRO, which developed and operates the telescope. \"ASKAP is applying the very latest in science and technology to age-old questions about the mysteries of the universe and equipping astronomers around the world with new breakthroughs to solve their challenges,\" said CSIRO CEO Larry Marshall in a statement on Tuesday.Our ASKAP radio telescope has conducted its first survey of the entire southern sky in record speed and detail, creating a new atlas of the Universe. @CSIRO_ATNF https://t.co/yayzqGMhjm\u2014 CSIRO (@CSIRO) November 30, 2020\n\nIt marks the first time ASKAP has been tested in its entirety.

The incident occurred on the third corner of the first lap as Grosjean plowed into the barriers following contact with Daniil Kvyat.The Frenchman said he \"saw death coming\" after the car split in half and was instantly engulfed in flames.Dramatic live footage showed the Frenchman jump out of the burning wreckage after what he said was 28 seconds, before being taken to hospital where he was treated for burns on the back of his hands.Haas F1 has since confirmed he was discharged from the Bahrain Defence Hospital (BDH) on Wednesday and will remain in the country to receive private treatment for his burns.

I couldn't finish my story in Formula One like that,\" Grosjean told TF1. \"For my children, I told myself that I had to get out. I put my hands in the fire, so I clearly felt it burning on the chassis.\"I was more afraid for my family and friends, obviously my children who are my greatest source of pride and energy, than for myself in the end.\"I think there's going to be some psychological work to be done, because I really saw death coming.\"READ: 'Proud to partner with Bahrainis,' says F1 boss amid human rights criticismA fire is pictured following Romain Grosjean's crash.

It shields the drivers' cockpits and can withstand the weight of a double-decker bus, according to F1.After his miraculous escape, Grosjean says he's determined to participate in the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi on December 13 in what could be his last in an F1 car.The 34-year-old is without a seat for next year after Haas announced in October that Grosjean and teammate Kevin Magnussen would be leaving at the end of the 2020 F1 season.\"There is the need to get back in the car, if possible in Abu Dhabi, to finish my story with Formula One in a different way,\" he added. \"It was almost like a second birth.

        "content": "(CNN)Altamura Man is one of the most complete and best preserved Neanderthal skeletons ever discovered. His fossilized bones, however, have remained hidden from view at the bottom of a sinkhole near Altamura, a town in southern Italy. That's where he fell and starved to death more than 130,000 years ago. Cavers came face to face with his skull, covered in limestone deposits, for the first time in 1993. Frustratingly for scientists, though, its inaccessible location -- a 20-minute journey from the surface through narrow crevices -- has made study of the skeleton extremely difficult. The body remains lodged in a small chamber deep in the karst cave system.\"They used the rope to bring me down and many of my colleagues. For me, it was a totally amazing experience. When you get in that corner and you see the skeleton there, you're really blown away,\" said Jacopo Moggi-Cecchi, a professor in the department of biology at the University of Florence. \"This individual must have fallen down a shaft. Maybe he didn't see the hole in the ground. We think he sat there and died,\" said Moggi-Cecchi. \"The original shaft he fell through is no longer there. It's been filled by sediment so we are confident the entire skeleton is there. No animals could have got there.\"Read MoreNeanderthal who fell into a well gives scientists oldest DNA sampleThis new research, published in the journal PLOS on Wednesday by Moggi-Cecchi and his colleagues, is beginning to yield more information about the man. Based on photos, videoscope footage and X-rays taken in the depth of cave, scientists have published an initial study of the man's jaw, including an almost complete set of teeth. They suggest that the man was of adult age, but not old, and he had also lost two teeth before he died.\"The tooth loss is something interesting. We have a large fossil record of Neanderthals, and it's not typical. In terms of oral health, they were in good shape,\" said Moggi-Cecchi.The roots of some teeth were exposed, which could suggest gum disease was at play, he said. Some teeth in the lower jaw also had deposits of dental calculus -- calcified plaque that's familiar to dentists today.Homo neanderthalensis walked the Earth for a period of about 350,000 years before they disappeared, living in what's now Europe and parts of Asia. They disappeared about 40,000 years ago -- although it's believed that they overlapped with Homo sapiens geographically for a period of more than 30,000 years after some humans migrated out of Africa.Earlier research, published in 2016 based on DNA analysis of the man's shoulder bone, confirmed that the body was indeed Neanderthal and that he had lived between 130,000 to 172,000 years ago.Accessing the Neanderthal skeleton is a 20-minute journey from the surface through narrow crevices.Toothy grin and 'third hand'Like other Neanderthals, this ancient man's front teeth are larger than those of modern humans -- but his molars are the same size as those of humans. Neanderthal jaws are broader, and they lack the protruding chin that's typical of modern humans. Analysis of wear marks and calculus on other Neanderthal teeth has given us information about the Neanderthal diet and how they used their teeth for tasks other than eating. Frozen moss reveals fatal final journey of 5,300-year-old ice mummyOur archaic relatives used their front teeth almost as a \"third hand\" to hold meat while cutting it or to hold skins or leather for preparation, Moggi-Cecchi explained. Altamura Man had \"marked wear\" that might be related to this kind of activity. For a more detailed analysis, however, Moggi-Cecchi said that it would be necessary to get the skull inside a lab as the teeth, like the rest of the skeleton, are covered in calcite -- mineral deposits from the limestone karst.Shown here are researchers at the entrance to the cave system where the fossilized skeleton is located. Scientists hope one day that the skeleton, or at least part of it, will be removed from the cave to allow in-depth study. Ultimately, Moggi-Cecchi said the man could become a Neanderthal version of Otzi the Iceman -- whose 5,300-year-old frozen body was found by a couple hiking in the North Italian Alps in 1991. Otzi has become a window into early human history for scientists and tourists alike. Nearly every part of him has been analyzed, including what he may have sounded like, the contents in his stomach and how he died. \"The fact that we can get this kind of information simply by looking at the specimen in situ, imagine what the possibilities are if we can extract the specimen from the cave. \"",

The push to save the celebration comes despite the fact that other religious festivals -- including Christian ones -- have been marked in a muted fashion in recent months.The UK government on Tuesday unveiled plans to temporarily relax coronavirus restrictions for five days, from December 23 to 27, allowing up to three households to celebrate together in \"Christmas bubbles.\" This means small groups of family and friends will be able meet in person for what may be the first time in months.England is currently under its second national lockdown and the UK as a whole has recorded more than 1.5 million Covid-19 cases. \"This year, Christmas will be different,\" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \"Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends, irrespective of our faith or background, and yet we cannot throw caution to the wind. The virus doesn't know that it's Christmas.\" Read MoreThe previous day, Johnson cautioned that while the festive period may be \"the season to be jolly ... it is also the season to be jolly careful, especially with elderly relatives.\"Rules relaxed for ChristmasThe message that stricter autumn rules could lead to a more relaxed Christmas period has been repeated across Europe.In France, a second national lockdown was imposed at the end of October, but despite non-essential businesses across the country being closed, the government has permitted the sale of Christmas trees, by decree. The Champs-Elysees Avenue and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris with Christmas lights on November 22.A slowdown in the spread of the virus means France's lockdown will begin to ease this weekend, President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday. The restrictions could be lifted further on December 15, if the daily number of cases drops under 5,000 and there are only 2,000-3,000 in hospital ICUs.\"We will therefore once again be able to travel without authorization, including between regions, and spend Christmas with our family,\" Macron said. In a speech earlier this autumn, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italians could enjoy Christmas if they abided by the country's Covid-19 restrictions. But since then, officials have struck a more cautious note. Sandra Zampa, an undersecretary at Italy's Ministry of Health, said on November 11 that the government wanted to avoid large Christmas parties. Instead, she said gatherings would likely be limited to close relatives such as parents, children and siblings. \"I don't think we can go any further,\" Zampa said in a local television interview.The Irish government is set to ease restrictions for nearly two weeks around the Christmas period and is considering allowing up to three households to gather for the holidays, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told state broadcaster RTE on Wednesday.And in Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel asked the public to obey social distancing restrictions in October, in order to preserve the country's Christmas celebrations.\"We must do everything to ensure that the virus does not spread in an uncontrolled way. Every day now counts,\" she said on October 17. \"How the winter will be, how our Christmas will be, that will be decided in the coming days and weeks.\" German MPs are currently considering a draft proposal which would allow up to 10 people to celebrate Christmas and New Year together, CNN affiliate n-tv reported.Celebrations shifted onlineChristmas occupies a unique and outsize place in the religious calendar. But since the epidemic began, Passover, Easter, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, Rosh Hashanah and Diwali have all been celebrated across Europe.  Muslims wearing protective masks perform Eid al-Fitr prayers at the Mevlana mosque in Berlin on May 24.All were marked quietly, without government debate. None attracted the fervor inspired by the prospect of a pandemic Christmas. Anjana Singh, 48, runs Amikal, a Hindu community group in Berlin. Singh organized an all-day virtual Diwali celebration to replace the more traditional festivities this November. \"Usually we have a lot of spectators, 500 to 1,000, this is how usually we celebrate Diwali,\" she told CNN. \"In February it was evident that corona was here. So Amikal decided, let's do it online.\"\"Christmas could also easily be celebrated online,\" she added. \"Through the digital platform we all can be together, yet we can be safe.\"The exterior of the Tate Britain art gallery in London is lit up by neon lights to mark Diwali on November 14.The sense that some festivals are prioritized over others also exists in Britain. Many Muslims in northern England were caught off guard in July when the government restricted people's movements in some areas, just hours before Eid al-Adha prayers were due to begin. \"I think it was right to go into lockdown during the Eid period,\" said Nadir Mohamed, the executive director of the Centre for Muslim Policy Research, a think tank based in London. \"I think it wasn't so much that people disagreed with the lockdown itself, it was ... a very last hours sort of thing,\" he said. \"There was no effective, or timely communication [about the restrictions.]\"Secular and spiritual event Elizabeth Oldfield, the director of Theos, a Christian think tank, told CNN that Christmas' importance now extends beyond religion, making it a national and secular event as well as a spiritual one. \"Christmas is less the crux of the [Christian] theological year compared to Easter,\" Oldfield told CNN.This year, she pointed out, \"Christians weren't able to mark Good Friday or celebrate Easter Sunday, which for the majority of Christians is really important.\"She added: \"This 'saving Christmas' is almost entirely a cultural, civic Christian [idea.] This is not about religion at all, it's about national identity, civic identity.\"Oldfield also said governments know that a large number of people celebrate Christmas in Europe, compared to other religious days. In the UK alone, a 2018 survey by polling company YouGov found that nine out of 10 people celebrated Christmas with gifts.\"Sometimes I feel there are two festivals at the same time,\" Oldfield said. \"There's the secular, pagan and consumer-led festival which brings its own joys and then there's the actual Christian festival.\"The Christmas markets still going ahead in 2020Mohamed said: \"Christmas is an occasion that isn't seen in the UK as a purely Christian thing. We're way past those days, everyone gets involved in the festivities one way or another.\"Regardless of government efforts, some hallmarks of a European Christmas have already been canceled due to Covid-19. In Belgium, all Christmas markets have been canceled, as has the market in the German city of Cologne. The Viennese Christmas Dream market in Austria, the Strasbourg Christmas Market in France and the Basel Christmas Market in Switzerland are all going ahead, however. On November 10, Estonia announced that all events in the country, including Christmas parties, would be canceled, though the government added that: \"Celebrating Christmas with family is, of course, allowed.\"Restrictions set to returnIn Britain, government medical adviser Susan Hopkins has said that if people mix during the Christmas break, everyone will need to reduce their contacts again following the holiday.\"Coming into Christmas, we'll need to be very careful about the number of contacts that we have and to reduce transmission before Christmas and get the cases as low as possible,\" Hopkins said on November 18.But other experts believe people should not risk gathering for the holidays at all.\"We have not made nine months of sacrifices to throw it all away at Christmas,\" Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, tweeted on November 19.Epidemiologist Shikta Das agrees with Scally.\"The pandemic is going to stay here. The government is doing its [best] but these decisions won't help. We will go into lockdown after Christmas and the R rate will go up,\" Das told CNN. \"If you have a very ill person in your family, it's probably better not to meet. Probably not a very good idea,\" she added.If Europe does choose to celebrate Christmas with a softening of lockdowns, there may be a price to pay in the new year. Canada has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in the three weeks since its citizens celebrated Canadian Thanksgiving in October. Its largest city, Toronto, went back into lockdown earlier this week.  Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said the country was a cautionary tale for the holiday season. \"The question is, have you got the disease under enough control to start with, and can you, in a sense, allow people a little bit more freedom over ... the Christmas period, which generates a sense of confidence and a sense of joy in the community, which people need right now -- without letting the virus let rip again within our communities. And this is a very important tradeoff,\" Ryan said at a news briefing on Monday. Oldfield points out that it is natural for people to want to gather together to celebrate. \"Sometimes this saving Christmas [idea] feels bonkers, because you don't want more deaths in return for your pigs-in-blankets,\" she told CNN. \"But at the same time there's a very deep theological [concept] about thriving through human connection. This is really [happening] because we just want to be together.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Pablo Matera has been stripped of his role as Argentina's rugby captain and suspended alongside teammates Guido Petti and Santiago Socino for \"discriminatory and xenophobic\" social media posts dating from between 2011 and 2013, the Argentine Rugby Union (ARU) announced on Monday. All three players have featured in the ongoing Tri Nations tournament against New Zealand and Australia, with Matera instrumental in the Pumas' first ever victory over New Zealand last month. The decision means the trio will miss Saturday's Test match against Australia.\"The Argentine Rugby Union strongly repudiates the discriminatory and xenophobic comments published by members of the Pumas squad on social media,\" said a statement from the governing body.It added: \"Although the messages were expressed between 2011 and 2013 and do not represent the integrity as people that they have shown during this time with Los Pumas, from the Argentine Rugby Union we condemn any expression of hatred and we consider it unacceptable that those who express them represent our country.\"Read MoreThe derogatory posts include remarks directed at Bolivian and Paraguayan domestic staff, women, Black people and insults about religion.They have surfaced after the Pumas were criticized for not doing enough to pay tribute to Diego Maradona during their match against New Zealand following the death of the Argentine football great last week.In a video posted by the Pumas on Twitter, Matera apologized that the team's tribute -- which, according to Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn, amounted to wearing black ribbon on their shirt sleeves -- \"caused disappointment.\"Guido Petti takes part in a training session with Argentina on November 27. The board of directors decided to revoke flanker Matera's captaincy and suspend him alongside second-row Petti and hooker Socino following an emergency meeting, according to the ARU, which also said that it has resolved to start a disciplinary process.The three players will remain suspended until that process has concluded and the board also requested that staff present a new captain to them to replace Matera.The players have now closed their Instagram accounts to the public and their profiles are no longer available on Twitter, but before doing so they released apologies that were published by Argentine media. CNN was unable to verify the posts given the closure of their accounts, but screen grabs of the derogatory comments have been widely shared by Argentine media and on social media. According to Clar\u00edn, Matera released a post on Instagram on Monday in which he claimed to feel \"very ashamed\" and apologized to \"all those who were offended by the atrocities I wrote.\"He added: \"Today I have to take responsibility for what I said nine years ago. I'm also sorry to my team and my family for the moment they are going through because of my actions and thanks to the people who love me for their support.\"In screen grabs visible in a report by Clar\u00edn, Socino asked for \"forgiveness from those who may have been offended by what I said,\" while Petti said his posts \"do not at all represent the person I am today. I made a mistake and I wanted to express my sincerest apologies.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresCNN has contacted the players via the ARU and their representatives but did not immediately receive a response.Having started its Tri Nations campaign with an historic victory over the All Blacks and a draw against Australia, Argentina was defeated 38-0 by New Zealand over the weekend.Given the points difference between the teams, it is highly unlikely that Argentina or Australia will be able to overtake New Zealand at the top of the Tri Nations table in their final game.

Bravery, 17 at the time of the incident, was jailed for at least 15 years in June.The injured boy's family said he is feeling less pain, has had his medication lowered and is trying to sing, in an update to well-wishers.\"Our son's memory is once again greatly affected. He no longer remembers what he did that day or what day it is,\" they said Monday in a statement posted on a fundraising page created to support the family.\"Despite everything, he continues to make efforts and progress: he begins to walk with a tetrapod cane while we hold him by the back of the coat for balance.\"A teenager who threw a 6-year-old boy from London's Tate Modern museum has been jailed for at least 15 yearsRead More\"He also has less pain, so the doctors were able to lower his medication. He tries to do more and more things with his left arm like holding his tube of toothpaste or his glasses case to close it.\"\"He continues to recover his breath. He still speaks very slowly, but now speaks word by word and no longer syllable by syllable,\" his family added. \"He tries to sing and make up songs with rhymes. And he was able to start using the blowpipe with the rehabilitators to continue improving his breathing.\"The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered life-changing injuries as a result of falling five floors from a 10th-floor viewing platform, including a bleed to his brain and a number of fractured bones.In an initial hearing in August last year, a court heard that the child was visiting the modern art museum with his family on August 4 when he was approached by a stranger, who picked him up and threw him off the viewing platform.At the hearing it emerged that the child's life was probably saved by the slant of the fifth-floor roof on which he landed.Bravery was sentenced to at least 15 years in June. \"You had intended to kill someone that day,\" Justice Maura McGowan said in her judgment. \"The injuries you caused are horrific. That little boy has suffered permanent and life-changing injuries.\"McGowan noted that a clinician said Bravery had an autism spectrum disorder and a personality disorder, which were \"overlapping,\" but, she said: \"Those conditions alone do not explain your offending and your general behavior.\"She noted that Bravery searched the internet on the day and day before the attack \"for information about killing people and what effect autism would have on sentencing.\" CNN's Schams Elwazer, Amy Woodyatt and Samantha Tapfumaneyi contributed reporting.",

        "content": "(CNN)For the second time this season, Spanish giant Real Madrid has been stunned by Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Having lost 3-2 in October in Madrid, the 13-time winner fell 2-0 in Kiev on Tuesday thanks to a second half goals from Dentinho and Manor Solomon. The Brazilian forward, who came on as a first half substitute because of an injury to teammate J\u00fanior Moraes, was the beneficiary of some sloppy defending from Rafael Varane and tapped home the first goal of the game. And it was another quick counterattack that carved Madrid open yet again, with Solomon driving from inside his own half before powering the ball home. A victory in Ukraine would have secured a last-16 spot for Madrid but defeat leaves it third in Group B with just one round of fixtures left. Read More\"In the first half we were very good, but we didn't cap things off with a goal,\" coach Zinedine Zidane said afterwards. \"We pressed well, played the ball well, but the ball didn't want to go in tonight and then things just got more complicated.\"It would have changed the dynamic hugely if we'd got that first goal. When Shakhtar scored it really damaged us because we'd been playing really well. We made two or three really good chances and hit the post. Yes we are on a bad run of results but the only way forward is to continue. This was a 'final' and we prepared well for it; the ball just wouldn't go in tonight. Now we have a game left -- we must win it and go through.\"I'm an optimist, this is a complicated moment but we have to draw on our character and pride. It's a real pity about this because we didn't deserve to lose here. Now it's time to believe.\"READ: Manchester United's Edinson Cavani apologizes for social media post as FA investigatesIsraeli forward Solomon, left, celebrates scoring his team's second goal against Real Madrid.Another upsetDespite having the prestige and the high-value players, Real Madrid has stuttered during the 2020 Champions League. The memorable upset by Shakhtar in the opening round of fixtures -- in which the Ukraine side was without seven starting players, and 10 in total due to a combination of positive coronavirus cases and injuries -- perhaps offered a glimpse of what was to come for Real. A dramatic equalizer salvaged a point at Borussia Monchengladbach before two wins against Inter Milan gave Madrid hope. However, after a run of inconsistent results in La Liga, including three games without a win -- two defeats and one draw -- Madrid looked bereft of ideas after traveling east. Despite the inclusion of young, attacking players Martin \u00d8degaard and Marco Asensio, it was the Ukraine side who looked the most dangerous throughout. Dentinho celebrates with his teammates after scoring against Real Madrid. Without creating too many openings, Madrid dominated possession but were eventually caught on the break, as Dentinho was the quickest to react after a deflected pass just missed Varane's clutches to fire past Thibaut Courtois. Zidane threw on exciting attackers Vinicius Junior and Isco in the hopes of creating an opening but yet again, with men thrown forward, was caught cold. Having picked up the ball well in his own half, Solomon drove at a backpedaling Real Madrid defense before extending the Ukraine club's lead. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosMadrid huffed and puffed for the final 10 minutes but created very little, as the game fizzled out with Shakhtar overtaking the Champions League specialists with just one game left in the group stages.

Maradona died on Wednesday at the age of 60 in a house in the town of Tigre, Argentina. The cause of death was an \"acute secondary lung edema due to exacerbated chronic heart failure,\" a source from the Argentinian Justice Ministry present at the time of the autopsy told CNNE.

The 40-year-old Escoffier said he was forced to abandon his yacht after a wave \"folded the boat in two\" off the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, on Monday. Revolutionary 'flying' yachts take Auld Mug into new realm. \"You see the images of shipwrecks? It was like that, but worse. In four seconds the boat nosedived, the bow folded at 90 degrees,\" he said.\"I put my head down in the cockpit, a wave was coming. I had time to send one text before the wave fried the electronics. It was completely crazy.\"Read MoreRace organizers responded by diverting Le Cam on a rescue mission, with the Frenchman the nearest competitor to the scene. The 61-year-old had made initial visual and voice contact with his compatriot but it took multiple attempts to successfully rescue Escoffier in the early hours of Tuesday, amid strong winds and big waves.\"I told myself I would stay on standby and wait for daylight. Then I thought that in the dark it might be easier to see his light,\" Le Cam said.\"One moment when I was on deck I saw a flash, but in fact it was a reflection that glinted off a wave. \"But the more I got closer to the light I saw it more and more. It is amazing because you switch from despair to an unreal moment in an instant.\"Le Cam himself was rescued in this race in 2009 after spending 16 hours in his upturned yacht and Escoffier said he was not scared as soon as he saw his rival in the distance. \"As soon as I had seen Jean I was sure I would be saved,\" he said.

'A miracle' Organizers had escalated the operation by sending a further three competitors to help with the rescue but all those dispatched are free to return to the race and the lost hours will be deducted from their final time. \"It is the outcome we were hoping for. It was pitch black, not easy conditions but finally the outcome is almost a miracle,\" said race director Jacques Caraes.\"It was not easy to pick Kevin up in the middle of the night, Jean is an extremely experienced sailor and he always followed our instructions to the letter. \"We had lots of unknowns, lots of different positions. We had to be positive all the time and believe in things. We were lucky, luck was on our side.\"Dubbed the \"Everest of the seas,\" the Vendee Globe started from Les Sables d'Olonne on the November 8.The winner of the 2016-2017 edition was Armel Le Cl\u00e9ac'h, who completed the race in a record breaking time of 74 days, three hours, 35 minutes and 46 seconds.",

I witnessed the rise of Nazism firsthand.

Large contributions will also be made to three foundations supporting health workers, children with leukemia and animal rights, according to a press release from the town hall. Read MoreLe Chambon and nearby villages welcomed Jewish refugees, mostly children, after 1940, according to the town hall website. Barack Obama mentioned the village in his remarks at the Holocaust Days of Remembrance Ceremony in April 2009 and Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, awarded the commune the title of Righteous in 1990.A German man's Nazi grandfather took over a Jewish man's store. He tracked down his descendants to apologizeSchwam's father was a doctor and his mother helped establish a library at the Rivesaltes camp, one of many set up by the Vichy regime to imprison Jews. Thousands were transported from there to Auschwitz, according to the Jewish Virtual Library. Friedel Reiter, a young Swiss social worker who voluntarily helped refugees at the time, recorded the family's information and it is likely she helped move them to Le Chambon when the Rivesaltes camp shut down in 1942, said the town hall. When he was just 12, Schwam was taken into the care of Secours Suisse, a sub-sector of the Red Cross of Switzerland which specialized in helping children during the war, where his mother also worked. Schwam registered on a pharmacy course at the University of Leon in 1950, graduating in 1957. The town hall is unsure whether he returned to Le Chambon regularly and is appealing for more information about \"the little Viennese Jewish boy\" who was so generous more than 75 years later. \"We did not know Mr. Schwam, we are now trying to establish who he was and what happened to him here,\" said Vallat.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)The foundation set up by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has called on US President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on at least eight high profile Russian figures it says are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin.   Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) said it had submitted a broader list of 35 people in total in a letter addressed to Biden, dated Friday, with eight named on a \"priority shortlist.\" The letter says seven of the 35 individuals are already on US sanctions lists.The move comes ahead of nationwide protests planned this weekend in support of Navalny, who is being held in detention ahead of a court hearing next week.In a copy of the letter obtained by CNN, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is named on the \"priority shortlist,\" for what FBK describes as being a key enabler and an alleged beneficiary of \"Kremlin kleptocracy.\" Abramovich is the owner of English Premier League soccer club Chelsea. A spokesperson for Abramovich said in an email statement to CNN that \"there is no basis for such claims which are entirely without foundation.\"Roman Abramovich applauds as Chelsea players celebrate their league title win at Stamford Bridge in London on May 21, 2017.

CNN has reached out to the Russian Health Ministry for comment. FBK executive director Vladimir Ashurkov, who signed the letter, told CNN on Saturday that the foundation was calling on the US to put pressure on Putin to release Navalny.JUST WATCHEDAlexey Navalny to remain in detention ahead of hearingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAlexey Navalny to remain in detention ahead of hearing 02:21\"The letter is addressed to the President of the United States -- the most powerful country. [The US] has a history of imposing sanctions on people who are involved in corruption. If anyone can do anything, it is the USA,\" Ashurkov told CNN. The letter seen by CNN says Navalny for years has called for sanctions against individuals who he says are key to \"aiding and abetting\" Putin in the \"persecution\" of those who \"seek to express their opinions freely and expose corruption in the [Russian] system,\" adding that existing sanctions don't target \"enough of the right people.\" \"The West must sanction the decision makers who have made it national policy to rig elections, steal from the budget, and poison. It must also sanction the people who hold their money.\" The letter continues: \"anything less will fail to make the regime change its behavior.\"   Ashurkov said he and Navalny had worked on the list of 35 Russians before Navalny returned to Russia from Germany earlier this month, initially focusing on the main eight.In the letter, the list of 35 people is divided into three groups: \"Oligarchs upon whom Putin has bestowed wealth and power, and who wield it on behalf of the regime;\"    \"Human rights abusers and those who suppress fundamental civil and political freedoms;\"    \"Individuals specifically involved in persecution of Navalny and our organization.\"  \"We didn't want to make this list public until we did the full dossier on them. But after his [Navalny's] arrest we knew we had to act,\" Ashurkov told CNN. Opposition leader Alexey Navalny appears via video link during a court hearing on January 28 of an appeal against his arrest. Navalny was detained on January 17, moments after arriving in Moscow following months of treatment in Germany after being poisoned in August 2020 with nerve agent Novichok.

Now she is piling pressure on Vladimir PutinHe's currently in custody ahead of a court hearing on February 2 where a court will decide whether his suspended sentence on fraud charges in a 2014 embezzlement case should be converted into a jail term due to what Russian authorities say is the violation of the terms of his suspended sentence. The letter states that the eight shortlisted individuals are of \"particular priority.\" They were discussed with Navalny shortly before he boarded the plane to travel back to Moscow, Ashurkov said.  Ashurkov said Navalny's team plans to submit the same request to the European Union and to the UK government.  In an interview earlier this week with CNN, former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who served more than 10 years in a Russian jail after he fell out with Putin for highlighting official corruption, also said the new US administration must take the global lead to make sure his fate does not also befall Navalny.Speaking from exile in London, Khodorkovsky said personal sanctions must be imposed by Biden and others in the West on those closest to Putin, rather than broad sectoral sanctions. Khodorkovsky said targeting Putin's entourage would be extremely painful for the Russian President and would affect the stability of his power.CNN's Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",

        "content": "London (CNN)The UN General Assembly in September last year was a pivotal moment in the pandemic, when leaders began to show some unity as global deaths approached a million. They had learned hard lessons from the damage that hoarding protective equipment had done, they said. When a vaccine was developed, the world's most vulnerable would be first in line, they claimed. The vaccines are now here and that solidarity has frayed. Between the United Kingdom and the European Union, it has disappeared entirely and given way to an all-out battle over who is more entitled to tens of millions of doses produced by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca. Meanwhile, many countries in the global south have yet to administer a single vaccine.The ugly vaccine nationalism that the World Health Organization and other public health advocates feared is here. And it's beginning in Europe, the region that usually boasts the world's greatest levels of equality by many measures.German officials say AstraZeneca vaccine shouldn't be given to over-65s, citing lack of dataThe spat revolves around the EU's deal with AstraZeneca, which recently informed the bloc it would not be able to supply the number of vaccines the EU had hoped for by the end of March. EU leaders are furious that the company appears to be fulfilling its deliveries for the UK market and not theirs.And while the EU's complaints are largely directed at AstraZeneca, the dispute has triggered animosity on both sides of the Channel, the two sides having only just emerged from four years of bickering over the terms of their Brexit divorce.Read MoreOn Friday, Brussels imposed controls on vaccine exports to keep track of how many doses were leaving the continent and where they were going, in what leaders called a transparency measure but what looks like a targeted export ban.\"The measure is not targeting any specific country,\" European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said during a press briefing in Brussels. But as he announced the measure, he also released a list of dozens of countries exempt from the controls, including many low-income nations. Unsurprisingly, the United Kingdom was not on it. People queue before receiving the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in Folkestone, southern England on January 27.\"The UK has legally-binding agreements with vaccine suppliers and it would not expect the EU, as a friend and ally, to do anything to disrupt the fulfillment of these contracts,\" a 10 Downing Street spokesperson said.The EU also said it would invoke a clause in the Brexit deal to impose controls on exports to Northern Ireland to ensure doses wouldn't funnel through the region into the rest of the UK. It then backed down from the threat in the late hours of Friday night after UK and Irish leaders sought urgent clarification from Brussels over the highly controversial move.Who should get UK-made doses?EU leaders say AstraZeneca is prioritizing the UK in its deliveries. In response, it conducted a spot inspection of an AstraZeneca plant in Belgium on Thursday to ensure it was telling the truth about low supplies there. Some Brexit hardliners have lashed back at the moves, branding the EU as slow and incompetent.Peter Bone, a Conservative British lawmaker, said EU leaders were \"bullies\" for inspecting the Belgian plant. In an interview with talkRADIO on Friday, he accused them of \"trying to cover up for their own failures\" and reversed the EU's accusation, saying Brussels was trying to divert UK-made vaccines to its own people. But the EU's contract with AstraZeneca -- which Brussels published on Friday -- states that doses for the bloc could indeed come from a supply chain that includes UK-based plants. Equally, the UK is receiving doses from Europe as well -- a person familiar with the matter said that the UK is still receiving small numbers of vaccines made in European plants, and that its initial doses had come from Europe too. Europe has a vaccine shortage. So why is it fighting with AstraZeneca? The UK government, which is miles ahead of the EU in vaccinating its population, has not released its contract with the company and has repeatedly declined to disclose to CNN how many doses it has in hand, citing \"security reasons.\"The UK's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) told CNN that a \"majority\" of doses in the country came from within the UK, admitting some came from elsewhere.Redactions of the published contract make it impossible to know just how badly the bloc has been hit, but AstraZeneca confirmed Friday it was aiming to ship at least 31 million doses to the EU by the end of March. Reuters had earlier reported the company had slashed the first quarter amount from 80 million doses to 31 million. What the EU wants to know is why it isn't receiving doses from the UK. BEIS did not answer CNN's question on whether the UK had asked to be prioritized in its contract with AstraZeneca, saying only that it had ordered 100 million doses and had agreed timescales for delivery. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot, however, said openly that the company was supplying the UK first. \"The contract with the UK was signed first and the UK, of course, said 'you supply us first,' and this is fair enough,\" he told Italy's la Republicca on Wednesday. The EU contract, on the other hand, did not legally bind the company to a particular schedule, he said. Vaccine shortages in the EU have seen countries like Germany delay its inoculation program.EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides denied that claim. \"We reject the logic of first come, first served,\" she said at a press briefing on Wednesday. \"That may work at the neighborhood butcher's but not in contracts and not in our advanced purchase agreements.\" Much of the problem appears to come down the use of the term \"Best Reasonable Efforts.\" In its agreement with the EU, AstraZeneca agreed to making its best efforts in building capacity to produce the doses the EU had ordered. Any legal challenge would involve a decision on whether the company had indeed tried its reasonable best to produce and deliver. At an AstraZeneca briefing on Friday, Soriot did not reveal any new details of its arrangement with the EU, saying only that the issue was \"very unfortunate\" and that the company was \"working 24/7\" to source new materials and improve supply.\"The manufacturing of vaccines is extremely complicated, it's not like doing an orange juice, it's extremely complicated and the teams that are manufacturing those products have to be trained and they have to master the process,\" he said, adding that the UK had a head start in addressing inevitable teething issues.Johnson warned against vaccine nationalismIt is understandable that the EU and UK would want to secure as many doses as possible in this early stage of their vaccination programs. The pandemic has hit both the UK and the bloc profoundly.Of the world's worst-affected countries, the UK now has one of the highest confirmed Covid deaths proportionate to its population. EU nations too have struggled with devastating waves that have ripped through its elderly and vulnerable citizens.But as the UK continues to give hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 shots by the day, Spain had to partly suspend its vaccination program this week, so low are its vaccine supplies. Germany has delayed its program and France says its program too is under threat.EU and AstraZeneca fight over vaccine delays while death toll mountsThere is a lot riding politically on a successful vaccine program. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has been lambasted by much of the media and public for a shambolic Covid-19 response. But the country's leadership in developing, approving and now distributing vaccines is being widely celebrated. It's a political win Johnson sorely needs.The European Union too is determined to appear strong and functional after the UK officially left the bloc on December 31. Brussels will not want to make its decision to centralize vaccine procurement and distribution, in the name of equality and fairness, appear like a failure. What appears not to be happening is any kind of civilized discourse between the UK and EU over what to do about the vaccine shortfall. Contracts aside, the unprecedented challenge of scaling up vaccine doses in the tens of millions could be an opportunity to coordinate to ensure the most vulnerable are vaccinated first.EU Health Commissioner Kyriakides gives a press statement on vaccine deliveries on January 25.It was only in September at the UN General Assembly that Johnson said \"it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage.\"\"The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about.\"Terje Andreas Eikemo, director of the Centre for Global Health Inequalities Research at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said that vaccines should be shared among the world's most vulnerable people first, regardless of where they live.\"It's natural for governments to want to put their own populations first, and this is something that happens when there is a good that is limited. When you have that in a society, it will very often result in what we're seeing with the EU and UK,\" he told CNN.\"Everyone's trying to gain what's best for their populations, but we need to stay inclusive. This is a global problem, this is not a national problem.\"The global south waits There is a huge sense of nervousness in much of the developing world: people there are watching some of the richest nations scramble for doses after buying up huge numbers of vaccines in advanced purchase agreements before they were even proven effective.Dr. Nashwa Ahmad from the South City Hospital in Karachi, Pakistan, told CNN that she and her colleagues have been waiting for weeks to hear of news of access to vaccines.\"That means our healthcare workers still have to continue to do their jobs for endless hours without the protection of the vaccines. It's very difficult,\" she said.Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine is 66% effective in global trial, but 85% effective against severe disease, company saysMeanwhile, rich nations are continuing to expand their already large advance purchase agreements. The UK has secured more than 360 million doses in advance and plans to buy more than 150 million between from Johnson & Johnson and Valneva. That would be enough to cover nearly four times its entire population.The EU has secured almost 1.6 billion doses, enough to cover the population three times. Other countries are also overstocking. Canada, for example, has purchased enough to cover its population almost four times its size.At the World Economic Forum hosted remotely from Davos, Switzerland last week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa slammed rich nations for hoarding, and urged them to share them with the world's most vulnerable.The spat began when AstraZeneca informed the bloc it would be unable to supply the number of vaccines the EU had hoped for. \"Some countries have even gone beyond and acquired up to four times what their population needs, and that was aimed at hoarding these vaccines. And now this is being done to the exclusion of other countries in the world that most need this,\" he said.In anticipation of this problem, the COVAX initiative was established in June last year with the aim of making 2 billion vaccine doses available to be distributed to parts of the world where there were gaps, largely in the global south. Even that will only cover around 20% of people in each eligible country. Indeed, the same rich nations accused of hoarding are donating to the scheme, with the UK being the largest single-country donor.The tussles for supplies have renewed calls for all countries to work within a centralized system to avoid this uneven distribution of Covid-19 shots.Novavax says Covid-19 vaccine is 89% effective in UK trial, but less so in South Africa\"While many have commendably contributed large sums of money to COVAX, they undermine its effectiveness, and the overall effort to end the pandemic as rapidly as possible for everyone, when they simultaneously engage in vaccine hoarding,\" Obiora Okafor, the UN's independent expert on human rights and international solidarity, said in a statement recently.But there appears to be little hope of that actually happening. Even the WHO -- whose chief in September said initial vaccines should reach \"some people in all countries, rather than all people in some countries\" -- appears to have lost hope of a truly collaborative response.When asked by CNN at a press briefing whether the UK should be allowed to oblige AstraZeneca to provide it with vaccine doses first, WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said that \"solidarity does not necessarily mean that each country in the world starts at exactly at the same moment.\"CNN's James Frater, Chris Liakos, Luke McGee, Schams Elwazer and Sophia Saifi contributed to this report.",

For the first time at a grand slam since last year's Australian Open, players will be met by the noise of a significant number of fans in the stands. Victoria state sports minister Martin Pakula announced Saturday that up to 30,000 supporters per day will be permitted entry when the tournament gets underway, around 50% normal capacity.

In December, tens of thousands of Australian citizens and permanent residents were unable to return home due to the country's strict international arrival caps.On Tuesday, 2009 Australian Open champion Rafael Nadal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that some players needed to have a \"wider perspective,\" something the philosophical Kenin has plenty of.READ: Djokovic says 'good intentions' were 'misconstrued' following backlash to list of proposalsJUST WATCHEDAustralian Open: Controversy surrounds tournament as players complain of lack of practiceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAustralian Open: Controversy surrounds tournament as players complain of lack of practice 03:32\"It's obviously the first time I've ever experienced something like this,\" she said. \"But I'm obviously grateful for starters to Tennis Australia, to the Australian government for allowing us to be here.

When standing, he towered over people at a massive 7 feet and 5.5 inches tall (226 cm).Height-wise, Freddy stood somewhere in between NBA greats LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal.The dog lived to be 8 and a half years old, Guinness World Records said Wednesday. Most Great Danes live between eight to 10 years, according to the American Kennel Club. \"He was my life. My reason. My joy.

To test this, we exposed Whisky and Vicky Nina to the new words in two different conditions,\" Claudia Fugazza, first author of the study and a researcher at the department of ethology, said. Dogs likely migrated to the Americas with humans over 15,000 years ago, study saysOne scenario was an exclusion-based task, and another was within a social, playful context with their owners. Read More\"Importantly, in both conditions the dogs heard the name of the new toy only four times,\" Fugazza said.Presented with seven known toys and one new toy, the dogs were able to select the new toy when presented with a new name. Researchers say this proves that dogs can choose by exclusion -- when confronted with a new word, they selected and retrieved the only toy which did not have a known name.However, when researchers presented two newly named toys and asked them to retrieve one, they failed. Vicky Nina among her toys. While preliminary evidence seems to show that most dogs do not learn words (i.e. names of objects), unless eventually very extensively trained, a few individuals have shown some exceptional abilities.The research team also noticed that both dogs were able to identify and retrieve newly named toys after hearing the name only four times from their owners during play.\"Such rapid learning seems to be similar to the way human children acquire their vocabulary around 2-3 years of age,\" said Adam Mikl\u00f3si, head of the Department of Ethology and co-author of the study.Analysis of ancient DNA reveals details about the dire wolf, inspiration for 'Game of Thrones' creatureBut not all dogs learn words this way.In a test of 20 other dogs, researchers found that none of them learned the new toy names. It was concluded that, without formal training, the capacity to learn words rapidly is very rare and is only present in a few gifted dogs.Researchers also found that both Whisky and Vicky Nina forgot the new toy names quickly, and in some tests, within little over an hour of first learning them.The research was published Tuesday in the journal Scientific Reports.Meanwhile, in spite of their \"human-like\" auditory capabilities for interpreting speech sounds, dogs do not hear the subtle differences between words in the way that humans do, a team of researchers from the same university reported last year.Dogs are renowned for their auditory capacity and their ability to hear words and sounds well and they are able to differentiate speech sounds. But experts said it seems they don't pay attention to all of the speech sounds.Correction: A photo caption in an earlier version of this story misstated Whisky's sex. Whisky is a very clever girl.",

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool showed glimpses of last season's title-winning pedigree to return to winning ways on Thursday, beating Jose Mourinho's Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 in the Premier League.Jurgen Klopp's side had previously been winless in its past five league games, which culminated in a home loss to Burnley last week, ending its 69-game undefeated run at Anfield.However, despite having to deal with yet further injury woes -- Fabinho missed Thursday's match -- Liverpool was able to capitalize on mistakes and hesitation by its Tottenham counterparts to score three times, with goals from Roberto Firmino, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Sadio Man\u00e9 pushing the Premier League champion back in to the top four. Pierre-Emile H\u00f6jbjerg scored for Tottenham to make it 2-1, but the home team struggled to capitalize on the Danish international's goal.In truth, the loss of superstar striker Harry Kane to an ankle injury really stunted any hope Tottenham had of making a comeback, and left a frustrated Mourinho after the game pondering his own side's mistakes. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris might have done better for Liverpool's first two goals, while Joe Rodon was arguably at fault for the third.Read More\"I believe it was a very good, solid performance in the first half, with two mistakes, one in the first minute, one in the last minute,\" he told Spurs TV following the defeat. \"The mistake in the last minute took us to half-time at 1-0, then at half-time we lose Harry, and we come into the second half with good ambition, good determination, again, a defensive mistake brings the 2-0, good spirit, good reaction, Pierre's goal, I think he reflects the spirit of the team, and again, when you are dominating, when you are in the opposition half, another mistake, unfortunately this time from a boy in Joe who for me played, so, so well. Again, punished by our own mistakes.\"READ: Title-chasing Manchester United stunned by bottom side Sheffield United as crazy Premier League season gets crazierMourinho gestures during the  match against Liverpool.Dealing with setbacksWith injuries to experienced defenders Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez early on in the season, Klopp's title-winning defensive line has had to be reshuffled, with Brazilian midfielder Fabinho stepping in. However, he was missing for the trip to the Tottenham Hotspur stadium. And after Cameroon international Joel Matip suffered an \"ankle ligament\" injury at halftime, Liverpool's already makeshift central defensive unit comprised midfielder Jordan Henderson and  the relatively inexperienced Nathaniel Phillips.After surviving an early video assistant referee scare when Son Heung-Min's strike ruled out for offside, Liverpool scored its first league goal in 482 minutes on the stroke of halftime. Brazil international Firmino was the quickest to react to Mane's cross ahead of Eric Dier and Lloris to tap home from close range. Kane lies on the pitch with an apparent injury during the game against Liverpool.And if it wasn't bad enough already for Tottenham, the removal of its main striker and goal threat -- Kane -- due to ankle injuries will have had fans watching between their fingers.Mourinho after the game confirmed the England captain would be out for \"a couple of weeks.\"Liverpool came out the blocks flying in the second half, Alexander-Arnold doubling its lead just minutes afterwards. With five goals and 16 assists, the right-back has been involved in more goals than any other Premier League defender since the start of last season. And despite Hojbjerg halving the deficit with his first goal for Tottenham, Spurs was unable to breakthrough the makeshift Liverpool defense to equalize. Midway through the second half, Mane was once again quickest to react, pouncing on an error by the otherwise impressive Rodon to extend the lead again to two goals. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosMane celebrates with Andrew Robertson and teammates after he scores his sides third goal against Tottenham.Afterwards, Klopp expressed his delight at the result, calling the victory \"necessary.\"\"We made great runs, scored obviously the first goal in a perfect moment pretty much, scored the goal [and] could go into half-time in the dressing room,\" he said. \"We got aware of the struggle of Joel Matip with his ankle, so no chance to play on, so then we tried to tell the boys that it would make sense to do a couple of things again. They did and fought really hard, made a proper, proper fight of it the whole night and I'm really happy about that, and played football. So, good game, deserved win, good.\"While Liverpool move to four points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, having played a game more though, Tottenham's first defeat of 2021 means it remains sixth in the table.",

But it was subsequently stashed in the corporation's archives, reportedly at the request of Buckingham Palace, and hasn't been aired since the 1970s.  It isn't known how the program, titled \"Royal Family,\" was unearthed or who posted it to YouTube. The video was swiftly removed from the video-sharing platform after a copyright request was made.UK minister calls on Netflix to tell viewers 'The Crown' is fictional before each episodeIn the film, the monarch reportedly compares the US ambassador to a gorilla. \"There was a gorilla.

        "content": "(CNN)For years, scientists have been wondering why wombat poop is cube-shaped (yes, really). Now, they say they have got to the bottom of the mystery. Bare-nosed wombats, or common wombats, can be found in the woodlands of hilly landscapes in south and southeastern Australia and in Tasmania. The furry marsupials are renowned for producing distinctive, cuboid poop, which researchers believe they then disperse tactically in order to communicate with one another. Now, scientists at the University of Tasmania have discovered more about the curious phenomenon.It is believed that wombats place their cube-shaped poop in tactical areas to communicate with one another.Using laboratory testing and mathematical models, a team of researchers found there are two stiff and two flexible areas around the circumference of the wombat intestine. The intestine, at 33 feet long, is around 10 times the length of a wombat's body. Read More\"This ability to form relatively uniform, clean cut faeces is unique in the animal kingdom,\" Scott Carver, a wildlife ecologist from the University of Tasmania, said in a statement.\"They place these faeces at prominent points in their home range, such as around a rock or a log, to communicate with each other. Our research found that these cubes are formed within the last 17 percent of the colon intestine,\" he said. The researchers say the distinctive cube shape of wombat poop is caused as a result of the drying of the faeces in the colon, and muscular contractions, which form the uniform size and corners of the poop. Giant wombat-like creatures, the size of black bears, once walked the earth \"Bare-nosed wombats are renowned for producing distinctive, cube-shaped poos. This ability to form relatively uniform, clean cut faeces is unique in the animal kingdom,\" Carver added.In people, food travels through the gut in one or two days, but a wombat's digestive process can take up to four times as long, so the animal can extract all possible nutritional content from its food. The creatures also produce poop that is much drier than human feces -- because they are better at extracting water from the intestine.Carver said the discovery that the cubes are created inside a soft tube reveals \"an entirely new way of manufacturing cubes,\" which could have implications for manufacturing, clinical pathology and digestive health.  The research, published in the aptly named journal Soft Matter expands on previous research from the team.",

It is the last major pact of its kind between Russia and the US after the US pulled out of a separate nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), under the Trump administration in 2019.Putin and US President Joe Biden spoke on the phone on Tuesday expressing \"satisfaction\" over the exchange of diplomatic notes between both countries on extending the treaty. The Russian Parliament voted to ratify the five-year extension on Wednesday.The landmark treaty was first signed for a period of 10 years by former US President Barack Obama and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010. It took effect on February 5, 2011.The treaty limits the number of strategic offensive weapons both countries can have.Read MoreBiden confronts Putin over several issues in first call, White House saysThe treaty limits each side to no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and heavy bombers; no more than 1,550 warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs and heavy bombers for nuclear armaments; and a total of 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers.\"Renewing the Treaty meets the national interests of the Russian Federation, makes it possible to maintain the transparency and predictability of strategic relations between Russia and the United States and to support global strategic stability; it will have a beneficial effect on the international situation, and contribute to the nuclear disarmament process,\" the Kremlin said in the statement published Friday evening.Last week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters \"that the New START Treaty is in the national security interests of the United States, and this extension makes even more sense when the relationship with Russia is adversarial, as it is at this time.\"She added that it was the \"only remaining treaty constraining Russian nuclear forces and is an anchor of strategic stability between our two countries.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)In between a surging pandemic and a global scramble for vaccines, the fate of this year's Olympic Games has become shrouded in uncertainty.  Last November, three weeks before the first vaccine doses became publicly available in the United Kingdom, International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said he was hopeful an effective vaccine would help the Games to proceed safely. Fast-forward to January 2021 and organizers may not be able to rely on vaccine rollout in the way they might have hoped as delivery delays have hindered the rollout process, particularly across Europe. \"I think a lot of people had this vested belief that once the vaccine started to roll out, that would really spell the end of Covid and what we would see is that transmission rates would start to plummet, things would get more controlled and we would have some ability to go back to a more normal lifestyle,\" Jason Kindrachuk, an infectious disease expert at the University of Manitoba in Canada, tells CNN Sport. \"The fact is that even with good vaccine rollouts in a number of regions of the world, we're having trouble getting a hold on transmission.\" Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresJUST WATCHEDOlympic prep continues in Tokyo despite rumors of cancellationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOlympic prep continues in Tokyo despite rumors of cancellation 03:32Athletes happy to wait their turnBach also said organizers would \"undertake a great effort\" to ensure that \"Olympic participants and visitors will arrive (in Tokyo) vaccinated,\" while also rejecting suggestions that vaccinations would be mandatory for athletes -- something echoed by Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto during a conference call on Wednesday.Where Olympic participants rank in the priority list for a vaccine is likely to be a topic of contention. Among athletes, the general sentiment is that they are prepared to wait.  \"I think everyone -- as far as I can tell on Team USA -- is on the same page,\" steeplechaser Colleen Quigley, who competed at the 2016 Rio Olympics, tells CNN Sport. \"Yes, we want to get vaccinated so we can safely go to the Games and we can safely have an Olympic Games, but also realizing that we're not first on the list.  \"There are plenty of people, old people and people who are working in grocery stores and who are teachers and in hospitals -- all these people who are on the front lines, they definitely are going to be in front of us.  \"We're all pretty young, healthy individuals. And we're just going to wait our turn. I feel as much as we want it, we realize we're not going to be first in line. And I think everyone's totally fine with that.\"  Colleen Quigley (right) competes in the women's 3000m steeplechase final at the Rio 2016 Olympics. There could also be logistic hurdles when it comes to vaccinating athletes on a global scale -- especially given how vaccine access, often tied to national wealth, varies around the world. \"We already have issues in high-income regions of trying to get vaccines rolled out in areas that bought millions of doses and trying to figure out: how do we actually target people that are high risk versus those that maybe don't fall politically within that sphere of high-risk disease?\" says Kindrachuk.  \"Then you start looking at more middle- or low-income areas of the world -- they're not even at a point of being able to think about what the vaccine rollout is going to look like because of the logistical concerns, storage concerns and the fact that the majority of doses have already been bought up by the wealthiest countries in the world.\" When contacted regarding vaccine rollout issues, the IOC pointed to a statement released on Tuesday outlining a \"toolbox of Covid-19 countermeasures\" to be implemented during the Games, including \"immigration procedures, quarantine measures, testing, personal protective equipment, contact tracing and vaccinations.\" Pulling off Tokyo 2020 will be a logistical nightmare ... and the clock is ticking\"Vaccines are one of many tools available in the toolbox, to be used at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way,\" said the statement. \"The IOC continues to strongly support the priority of vaccinating vulnerable groups, nurses, medical doctors and everyone who is keeping our societies safe. \"The IOC will work with the NOCs [National Olympic Committees] to encourage and assist their athletes, officials and stakeholders to get vaccinated in their home countries, in line with national immunization guidelines, before they go to Japan. \"This is to contribute to the safe environment of the Games, but also out of respect for the Japanese people, who should be confident that everything is being done to protect not only the participants, but also the Japanese people themselves.\" Logistical challengeTokyo 2020 organizers told CNN Sport that meetings were held last year about how the Games could operate even without vaccinations taking place, adding: \"It is our understanding that vaccination policies are being formulated by the government of Japan and other bodies.\"More than 11,000 athletes from over 200 countries took part in the Rio Olympics. Add in support staff and media personnel and the IOC has a major logistical and health challenge on its hands in the age of coronavirus, especially with the Games just six months away. Japan and IOC determined to hold Tokyo Olympics despite cancellation rumors\"We can't just think about this in terms of the athletes, because it's not only the athletes that that are going to be a part of the Olympics -- you have the organizing committees that are involved, you have all the people that are providing support, you have all the trainers,\" says Kindrachuk. \"All of those are potential wheelbarrows for the virus coming into the community ... You look at this idea of putting people into an international location from all over the world -- we only need one individual to kick off that transmission chain.\" Tokyo was placed under a state of emergency earlier this month as Covid-19 cases reached record levels, and across Japan members of the public are concerned about holding the Games given the current state of the pandemic. A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Olympics should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year The Australian Open, which gets underway on February 8, has provided a snapshot of the potential difficulties facing Olympic organizers, who say they have been monitoring events in Melbourne as well as sporting competitions elsewhere. A total of 72 players were placed under strict, 14-day hotel quarantines ahead of the tournament following positive tests on their flights. Others have been allotted five hours each day to train in bio-secure bubbles. JUST WATCHEDRafael Nadal calls for 'wider perspective' from players ahead of Australian OpenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRafael Nadal calls for 'wider perspective' from players ahead of Australian Open 14:25Following concerns that those quarantining players would be disadvantaged during the tournament, organizers amended the warm-up schedule and also announced that practice sessions, gyms and ice baths would be prioritized for players who had been placed under hard quarantine.There's no doubt that reducing onsite transmission will be one of the main challenges facing Olympic organizers, and leagues like the NBA have demonstrated how sporting \"bubbles\" can operate effectively. But only 22 teams were present in the NBA bubble, each with a roster no larger than 15. \"It will be very difficult to eliminate infection risk with a group that size,\" Professor Alastair Grant of the University of East Anglia tells CNN Sport, reflecting on the challenge of trying to cope with thousands of athletes living together in the Olympic Village where competitors are traditionally based. \"If you lock people up in their rooms as they have done for the Australian Open, you can reduce the chance of that happening. But it's really very hard to control transmission in a large group, communal-living fashion.\" Organizers insist that the Tokyo Olympics will get underway on July 23. Bach bullishAs they continue to evaluate how to host the Olympics safely, organizers have also had to quash reports saying the Games will be canceled altogether. Last week, the Times of London, citing an unnamed senior member of the ruling coalition, said Japanese authorities had privately concluded that the Olympics could not proceed amid the pandemic -- a report labeled as \"categorically untrue\" by the IOC.  Tokyo 2020 organizers, meanwhile, offered assurance that they were \"fully focused on hosting the Games this summer.\" At a press conference on Wednesday, Bach reiterated that the IOC is \"confident\" of delivering the Games safely.\"We are not speculating on whether the games will take place, we are working on how the Games will take place,\" he said, adding that \"more than 7,000 sports events have been organized by the international federations this winter ... and none of them developed into a hotspot (of infection).\"Meanwhile, the final artistic swimming qualification event ahead of the Olympics due to be held in Tokyo in March has been postponed until May amid travel restrictions in Japan, organizers announced on Thursday.The event, originally scheduled to take place from March 4-7 at the Tokyo Aquatics Center, was also set to double up as an Olympic test event with Covid-19 countermeasures in place.CNN's Aleks Klosok and Homero De La Fuente contributed to this report.",

Lacking inspirationFresh of the back of a dramatic FA Cup victory over fierce rivals Liverpool on Sunday and with the added motivation that it could move above other rivals Manchester City with a win, a home match against lowly Sheffield United looked like a walk in the park.Not least because the big guns of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood, Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba were in the starting line-up.However, despite dominating possession throughout, the group of Manchester United superstars lacked inspiration and creativity to unlock the stout Sheffield defense, who came into the game with the worst record, after 19 matches, in Premier League history.And it was the bottom-of-the-table team that eventually stunned its host to take the lead, Bryan's first-half glancing header for the Yorkshire side sneaking past David De Gea in the Manchester United goal.Bryan scores Sheffield United's first goal against Manchester United.Martial had an equalizer ruled out as Maguire was adjudged to have fouled Sheffield goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, but he eventually drew the sides level, heading in just past the hour mark.And despite the home side piling on the pressure, the Sheffield United defense made up of three centre-backs -- Chris Basham, Ethan Ampadu and 38-year-old Phil Jagielka -- remained resolute, contributing 18 clearances between them.Eventually, the porous Manchester United defense cracked, as Burke's 74th deflected winner sent the away side into jubilation, as it secured just its second win of the season.The matchwinner Burke expressed his delight at the result.\"Amazing result, really was a must-win for us and I'm chuffed for the boys, they put in a great shift. Amazing feeling and amazing for me to get the goal, I am buzzing for the boys and hopefully we can take that into our next games,\" the Scotsman said afterwards.\"We showed great courage and great determination. We show great character and never stop, every game we have showed great football but just not taken three points.\"After the defeat, Martial and United defender Axel Tuanzebe were subjected to racist abuse on social media, with a number of racist comments and symbols appearing on old photos on Instagram.\"Everyone at Manchester United is disgusted by the racial abuse received by players via social media after last night's game,\" said the Premier League club in a statement on Thursday.\"We utterly condemn it and it is encouraging to see other fans condemn this on social media also.\"Manchester United has zero tolerance of any form of racism or discrimination and a long-standing commitment to campaigning against it through our All Red All Equal initiative. \"Identifying these anonymous mindless idiots remains problematic.

He continues to be held at the Matrosskaya Tishina detention center, in the northeast of the capital.The opposition activist was ordered to spend 30 days in custody during a surprise hearing on January 18.

We believe that everything that is happening to Alexey is happening for political reasons -- in order to rule out his political activities,\" she said.Russian law enforcement conducted searches Wednesday at Navalny's Moscow apartment and his team's headquarters, according to his aides.The raids came as Navalny's allies called for a second round of unsanctioned nationwide demonstrations, planned for Sunday, to demand the activist's release from detention.Last weekend, tens of thousands of Russians took to the streets, resulting in nearly 4,000 detentions, according to monitoring group OVD-Info.People clash with police during a protest against the jailing of Navalny in St. Petersburg, Russia, on January 23, 2021.Tycoon urges US pressure on PutinMikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who was once Russia's richest man, spent more than 10 years in a Russian jail after falling out with Putin.Yulia Navalnaya's husband was poisoned and detained.

On Thursday the government extended the restrictions a further two weeks until February 14.More demonstrations against the ruling have been planned for Thursday and Friday in the capital Warsaw and towns across the country.

That announcement sparked weeks of mass protests, some of the largest the country had seen since the Solidarity movement of the 1980s, which helped end Communist rule, analysts say.Read MoreAbortion has emerged as one of the most divisive issues since PiS took power in 2015, promising poorer, older and less-educated Poles a return to a traditional society mixed with generous welfare policies, Reuters reports.The court's verdict was published in the official gazette late on Wednesday.\"This idiotic ruling will not prevent abortions,\" said Cezary Jasi\u0144ski, a 23-year-old student, standing in front of the Constitutional Tribunal building in central Warsaw.A demonstrator gestures as people take part in a pro-choice protest in the center of Warsaw, on January 27, as part of a nationwide wave of protests against Poland's near-total ban on abortion.Last year's protests quickly morphed into an eruption of anger against the government, particularly among young people, suggesting PiS may face a fresh challenge from new voters in coming years.On Wednesday, officials said the government would now focus on assisting parents of disabled children, although PiS as well as its centrist predecessors have been accused by critics of not doing enough in that regard.\"The state can no longer take a life away only because someone is sick, disabled, in poor health,\" PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski said.The party denies opposition criticism that it had influenced the court, called the Constitutional Tribunal. It is one of the judicial bodies PiS overhauled during reforms that the European Union said has politicized the courts.\"No law-abiding government should respect this ruling,\" Borys Budka, leader of Poland's largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters.Budka criticized PiS leader Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski on Twitter: \"By setting fire to Poland, he wants to cover up the traces of the government's defeat in the fight against covid, the failure of the vaccination program and the drama of entrepreneurs. But this time, he will not escape the responsibility.\"Access to abortion has declined even without the legislative curbs as more doctors refuse to perform them on religious grounds and many women seek abortions abroad.Pro-choice protesters hold banners as they march towards the Law and Justice Party Headquarters on January 27, 2021 in Warsaw, Poland.In a justification published on Wednesday, the tribunal left open the possibility of the parliament regulating some circumstances covered by the law.Marek Suski, a PiS lawmaker, said the party would consider introducing new rules that could allow the most extreme fetal deformities to be excluded. But political commentators say consensus between PiS and its arch-conservative governing allies would be difficult to achieve.\"In cases when the fetus doesn't have a skull or has no chance to live outside the womb, there should be a choice. We will work on this,\" Suski told public radio.Opinion surveys have shown some decline in PiS popularity in recent months, but an opinion poll by the government-affiliated CBOS pollster showed it edging back up to 35% this month, from 30% in October. PiS and its two small parliamentary allies won re-election in 2019 with a 44% share of the vote.",

        "content": "(CNN)Three-time tennis grand slam champion Naomi Osaka says she has invested in National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) franchise North Carolina Courage.Named Forbes' highest paid female athlete in 2020, Osaka is the daughter of a Haitian father and Japanese mother and, like the members of the Courage, used her platform prominently in 2020 in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.During each match of last year's US Open -- which she eventually won -- Osaka wore a mask bearing the name of a Black victim of alleged police or racist violence in the US.Currently in Australia as she prepares to compete in the first grand glam of the year at the Australian Open, Osaka said part of the reason she teamed up with the Courage was a shared interest in social activism.\"I also admire everything the Courage does for diversity and equality in the community, which I greatly look forward to supporting and driving forward,\"  Osaka said in a statement on the club's website.  Read More\"My investment in the North Carolina Courage is far beyond just being a team owner, it's an investment in amazing women who are role models and leaders in their fields and inspirations to all young female athletes,\" added Osaka. The 23-year-old is the first investor in the Courage since owner Steve Malik acquired and relocated the team to North Carolina in 2017. The Courage most recently won the NSWL championship in 2019.Women's world No. 3 Osaka uses a video camera as she returns with teammates to her hotel after a practice session in Adelaide, one of the locations where players have quarantined for two weeks upon their arrival ahead of the Australian Open.Courage owner Malik praised Osaka's social activism upon her arrival. \"Naomi embodies the values we have been striving to cultivate at our club, and she brings an invaluable viewpoint on topics beyond sports. I cannot think of anyone better to help us as we continue to make a difference in our community and inspire the next generation of women,\" said Malik.READ: Rafael Nadal calls for 'wider perspective' from players in quarantine ahead of the Australian OpenNorth Carolina Courage players kneel during the national anthem during a game against the Washington Spirit.'It just felt instinctive'With sport one of the few live events that people could still watch on TV during 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the protests athletes made in the wake of George Floyd's death and Jacob Blake's shooting were viewed far and wide. it was the decision by the WNBA side the Washington Mystics team to take to the court wearing white T-shirts printed with seven bullet holes in Blake's honor that inspired Osaka to also take matters into her own hands, said the tennis star. Osaka wears a mask with the name, Ahmaud Arbery, stenciled on it.\"Very quickly, I realized that I was going to have to do something myself. It was a moment in time I will never forget. It just felt instinctive,\" Osaka wrote in a column for The Telegraph newspaper's Women's Sport supplement. The protest that she organized -- wearing seven masks with seven names of Black victims of alleged police or racist violence in the US -- caught many people by surprise given her self-professed \"reserved\" nature. But from Breonna Taylor in her first round-match against Misaki Doi to Tamir Rice in the final against Victoria Azarenka, each name resonated around the world, and highlighted to Osaka the impact she could potentially make.\"I never really knew the size and scope my voice might have when I set out. It was just raw emotion and deciphering wrong from right. It was not a political statement, and it was not for me, or about me. It was for others,\" she wrote.

        "content": "Berlin (CNN)Germany's vaccine commission said the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine should not be given to people older than 65 years, amid a bitter dispute between the European Union and the drugmaker over delayed supplies.The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) at Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the country's main public health authority, found there is insufficient data on the effectiveness of the vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, for this age group, according to a statement from the interior ministry on Thursday. \"Due to the small number of study participants in the age group \u226565 years, no conclusion can be made regarding efficacy and safety in the elderly. This vaccine is therefore currently recommended by STIKO only for persons aged 18-64 years,\" the panel said in its recommendation.Responding to the announcement, an AstraZeneca spokesperson said \"latest analyses of clinical trial data for the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine support efficacy in the over 65 years age group.\" The drugmaker is awaiting a regulatory decision by the European Union medicines regulator, the spokesperson added. Thursday's announcement by the German Interior Ministry came amid an ongoing dispute between the European Union and AstraZeneca over delays to the delivery of its coronavirus vaccine to the bloc.Europe has a vaccine shortage. So why is it fighting with AstraZeneca? Read MoreAstraZeneca has said it can't deliver as many doses as the EU expected, citing production challenges. But the European Commission, which ordered the vaccine on behalf of EU member states, says this is unacceptable, and the drugmaker must find a way to increase supply.The dispute comes as EU countries, including Germany, run low on vaccines, In Spain, the regional government of Madrid has paused administering first doses of the vaccine, to ensure there is enough to provide second doses for those who already got their first shots. Concerns over expected shortages of the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines means some French regions, including Paris, will push back or cancel appointments for first injections, the French health Ministry said in a press statement on Thursday.EfficacyThe United Kingdom, whose regulator approved the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine nearly a month ago, has been administering doses to people older than 65.In its report, UK regulator MHRA, said there was \"limited information available on efficacy in participants aged 65 or over, although there is nothing to suggest lack of protection.\"Responding the German announcement, MHRA Chief Executive Dr. June Raine said \"current evidence does not suggest any lack of protection against Covid-19 in people aged 65 or over.\"\"The data we have shows that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s. More data is continually becoming available for this age group and our Public Assessment Report, available on our website, will be updated to reflect this,\" her statement added.The EU has ordered 300 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which could be approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as soon as Friday -- with an option to purchase an additional 100 million doses.AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in an interview with Italy's la Repubblica newspaper Tuesday that \"the issue with the elderly data is not so much whether it works or not. It's that we have today a limited amount of data in the older population.\"Soriot said this was because the Oxford scientists running the vaccine trials did not want to recruit older people until they had \"accumulated a lot of safety data\" for those aged 18 to 55.\"Essentially, because Oxford started vaccinating older people later, we don't have a huge number of older people who have been vaccinated. So that's what the debate is,\" he said. \"But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people. It's possible that some countries, out of caution, will use our vaccine for the younger group.\"A member of medical staff draws up the AstraZeneca/Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine at the NHS Nightingale North East hospital on January 26, 2021 in Sunderland, England.Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stressed that the German decision was \"not a regulatory decision, but draft advice on usage\" in comments to the UK's Science Media Centre.It was \"well known that the clinical data for this vaccine were limited for those aged 70 and over,\" he said, because AstraZeneca recruited older age groups later than younger age groups, allowing less time for cases to accrue.\"There is no reason at all for anyone in the UK or elsewhere to think that this Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is ineffective at any age,\" Evans said. \"Its ability to be delivered to people in GP surgeries and care homes makes it a vital component in the attempts to reduce hospitalisation and deaths, especially in the elderly.\" Jim Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute and professor of structural biology at the University of Oxford, also sought to allay concerns, noting that German scientists had concluded that the vaccine was safe and effective for under-65s.\"Their assessment is that effectiveness is not yet demonstrated for over 65s. They have not said the vaccine is ineffective for over 65s,\" he told the Science Media Centre.  \"Good faith discussions about what evidence is needed for vaccine effectiveness are really important. Experimental evidence and reasoned debate, not over heated rhetoric, will resolve this issue.\"EU-AstraZeneca disputeEU and AstraZeneca fight over vaccine delays while death toll mountsAs the dispute between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccine delays rumbled on, Belgian health authorities -- at the request of the European Commission -- conducted \"an inspection\" of the UK-Swedish drugmaker's Belgian production facility Wednesday. The purpose was \"to ensure that the delay in the delivery of the vaccines is indeed due to a production problem at the Belgian site,\" France Dammel, a spokeswoman for Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke, said in a statement.\"Belgian experts are looking into the elements obtained during this inspection visit, together with Dutch, Italian and Spanish experts,\" Dammel said, adding that the report is expected in a few days.The German government expects the country to face shortages in its supply of the coronavirus vaccine for at least another 10 weeks, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Thursday amid backlash over the pace of the government's vaccine rollout program.Meanwhile, the number of coronavirus infections per 100,000 residents across seven days in Germany has fallen below the critical threshold of 100 for the first time in three months, to 98, the RKI said Thursday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has outlined the government's plan to reduce the incidence rate to less than 50 new infections per 100,000 residents within seven days in order to be able to track and trace infections.

        "content": "Tokyo (CNN)UFC had \"fight island.\" The NBA had \"the bubble.\"Tokyo 2020 might need a miracle. After the Covid-19 pandemic forced organizers to delay the Summer Olympics last year, the Games are now set to begin in less than six months on July 23, and major questions remain as to how Japan plans to pull off what could prove to be the most complex sporting event ever held -- one involving more than 11,000 athletes from more than 200 countries who must be kept safe from a virus that has infected 100 million people and killed more than 2 million.On Wednesday, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach vowed that the event would go ahead.\"Our task is to organize Olympic Games and not to cancel Olympic Games,\" he said, adding that the IOC is working \"day and night\" to host a safe event.Read MoreIt might just be doable. The UFC and the NBA proved last year that it's possible to safely hold a major sporting event during the pandemic, as long as those involved are willing to make some sacrifices and get creative. UFC moved all its fights to an island in Abu Dhabi, while the NBA finished its 2019-2020 season at a campus in Disney World with stringent rules to keep the virus out. Both proved successful, but those two events pale in comparison to the Summer Olympics in terms of sheer size and complexity. People wearing face masks walk past the Olympic Rings on January 22 in Tokyo.The Rio de Janeiro Games in 2016 involved 11,000 athletes from 206 different countries competing in 306 different sporting events across 37 venues, all of which needed to be meticulously prepared to meet the exacting standards required of the world's most elite athletes and the global media. More than 25,000 journalists from across the world were accredited to cover the Rio Games so fans could follow in whatever language they speak. Organizers are now racing to determine how Tokyo can hold the event safely, especially considering much of Japan is under a state of emergency amid a third wave of infections. Authorities must figure out how to protect not only athletes but also citizens of the world's most-populous metropolitan area, a daunting task considering Japan's huge elderly population and its slower-than-expected rollout of coronavirus vaccines.The Olympics organizing committee said in an interim report published in December that it would pursue a host of Covid-19 prevention measures for athletes and spectators, if the latter are even allowed.JUST WATCHEDOlympic prep continues in Tokyo despite rumors of cancellationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOlympic prep continues in Tokyo despite rumors of cancellation 03:32The report, however, lacked specifics. It's not clear what happens if one competitor tests positive or who needs to quarantine upon arrival, or who would pay for it -- not all Olympic competitors are professional athletes with the budget for such an expense. What is clear is that the Games will look incredibly different to Rio. From the opening ceremonies to the competition itself, change is coming to most of the event, save for the name -- organizers chose to stick with the Tokyo 2020 moniker.Dick Pound, the longest-serving member of the IOC -- and one of its most outspoken -- said he's \"confident\" the Games will go ahead, and puts the likelihood of that happening at about 75%.\"I think unless some drastic changes occur, this is a manageable proposition and I hope that we're able to pull it off,\" Pound said, while adding a note of caution.\"There are no certainties in life and what might happen with the virus.\"Arduous arrivalsThe first major task will be preparing for an influx of so many athletes coming from all over the world.  The Australian Open just proved how challenging that can be -- and that competition only involved about 250 players.Australian authorities required all players to quarantine for two weeks, and most were allotted five hours each day to go out and train in strict bio-secure bubbles. However, any player whose flight to Australia was found to have a confirmed Covid-19 case had to undergo a 14-day quarantine ahead of their grand slam matches. That meant 72 players were not allowed to leave their hotel rooms after passengers on their flight tested positive. Some tennis stars have expressed anger and frustration at being kept cooped up ahead of the first grand slam of the tennis season, including record eight-time Australian Open men's singles winner Novak Djokovic. One player said athletes on board a charter flight were unaware of the policy, but Daniel Andrews, the Premier of the Australian state where the Open is held, said that tennis players were briefed on the rules before they came to the country.Men's singles world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic of Serbia sits on his hotel balcony in Adelaide, Australia, on January 18, one of the locations where players have quarantined for two weeks upon their arrival ahead of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne.The whole ordeal shows just how important it will be for the Tokyo 2020 organizers to formulate a plan that is clearly communicated to athletes and allows them to continue their training regimen while in quarantine. That way, Olympians are not put at a disadvantage during quarantine and can compete at a high level for an event they've likely been preparing for their entire lives.   Pared back eventsThe IOC announced in December that the Opening and Closing Ceremonies will be pared-back. A report in the Japan Times earlier this month said that 6,000 people will likely attend the iconic opening parade at Japan National Stadium, and an Olympic official has said that participation would be limited to athletes and a maximum of six team officials per country. That scaled-down ceremony is in keeping with an overall simplification of the Games.Explaining what that simplification could look like, Pound said: \"You can certainly reduce the level of services; you can reduce the degree of hospitality that's being offered and things like that. \"But you know the track and field competition involves all the track and field events and the heats and the semis and finals. All of that, which do have to be dealt with in let's say a normal fashion.\"Japan National Stadium, where opening ceremony and many other events are planned for postponed Tokyo 2020 Olympics, is seen from a rooftop observation deck on January 21 in Tokyo.The IOC has said athletes should arrive no more than five days before their first day of competition and leave no more than 48 hours after they're done competing. Athletes, coaches, broadcasters and anyone traveling to the Games are likely to face a self-quarantine period in their home nation before traveling to Japan. That will be followed by tests on arrival at the airport, and regular tests for those staying in the Athletes Village, in Tokyo, which can sleep about 18,000 people.Competitors will be tested at least once every four days and traced throughout their stay, and have limited interaction with other people, according to the report published in December.That means participants won't be able to go sightseeing in Tokyo or take part in the notorious partying that goes on in the Olympic Village after athletes finish competing. In fact, when athletes travel between the village and the competition and training venues they should do so by designated vehicles, wearing masks. Equipment will be introduced to \"prevent the spread of droplets\" according to officials.Fan experienceAbout 4.45 million tickets have been sold domestically, and 1 million have been purchased by foreigners. Japan has offered refunds to people who could not attend the Olympics on the new dates.  Officials have said they will decide by the spring how many fans can attend -- and if that will include international arrivals. Japan's borders are currently closed to foreign nationals.If visitors are allowed, their experience will likely be high-tech. The government is developing a contract tracing app for attendees using GPS that will reportedly link visas, proof of test results, tickets and other information, authorities said. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, wearing a face mask, speaks to the media during a visit to the Japan National Stadium on November 17, 2020 in Tokyo.Visitors who show proof of a negative Covid-19 test and agree to use the contact tracing app will not need to quarantine for 2 weeks, according to local media reports. However, according to the committee's report, a quarantine may be necessary depending on which country the person is coming from.   'It's now or never'Publicly, Japanese and international organizers are committed to holding the Games at their delayed start. The government's Olympic Minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said Tokyo 2020 will be held in 2021 at \"any cost.\" Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has also vowed the Games will go ahead.The prospect of holding the Olympics, however, has looked particularly bleak in recent weeks, due to the spike in cases. Japan has recorded 376,000 cases of Covid-19, and 5,387 deaths from the virus.Japan's vaccine rollout plan has gone slower than those in other developed nations, such as the US, China or the United Kingdom. The country plans to start inoculating medical workers in late February and the elderly by March. No timeline has been announced for vaccinating the rest of the population. Convincing people to get inoculated in Japan will bring its own challenges, as vaccine skepticism is widespread, driven by a history of vaccine safety scares and concerns about side effects.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, second from right, speaks during a meeting of the coronavirus infection control headquarters at his office in Tokyo on Friday, January 22.Furthermore, there is growing public opposition to Japan hosting the Olympics altogether. A poll by national broadcaster NHK foud that 77% of people in Japan think the games should be canceled or further postponed.\"The government is obsessed with hosting the Olympics,\" said Kumiko Suto, the founder of Hangorin No Kai, an anti-Olympics group in Tokyo. \"It's becoming clear during this coronavirus disaster that the Olympics would sacrifice people's lives.\"But Pound, the IOC official, said another postponement may be prohibitively expensive for Japan and logistically impossible, especially considering the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics are now about a year away. \"It will further complicate a crowded sports schedule ... you're going to have the World Cup and football going on, and at some point it's just there's just too much congestion in the overall system,\" said Pound.Canceling the Games would be a major blow to Japan's pride and finances. At $25 billion, this was already going to be the most expensive Summer Olympics on record before the delay. Longtime former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had billed the event as an opportunity to show off Japan's mighty recovery from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and years of a stagnating economic performance. People wearing face masks walk and ride past an Olympics decoration installed along a street in Tokyo on Thursday, January 21.Without the influx of tourists, Japan is unlikely to get the economic bounce from the Games that most countries enjoy. Holding the Olympics with spectators could result in an economic loss of up to $23 billion in Japan, according to Katsuhiro Miyamoto, an honorary professor at Kansai University. But it is perhaps the athletes who have trained all their lives for this moment who have the most to lose.\"Something (like) north of 70% (of the athletes) never get to a second Olympics,\" Pound said. \"For them, it's now or never.\"CNN's Selina Wang reported from Tokyo and Josh Berlinger wrote from Hong Kong.

        "content": "(CNN)Mass Covid-19 vaccination programs are underway in many countries around the world, offering the first glimmer of hope that life as we knew it could be back within our reach.The UK was the first country to begin vaccinating its citizens with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 vaccine, and is among the countries with the highest number of vaccines deployed per capita. But just how quickly can the UK -- and perhaps the rest of the world --  expect to return to some form of normality? The truth is, not very soon.Public health experts largely agree that it's unrealistic to bet on the vaccine being a magic bullet to end the pandemic; they say coronavirus safeguards, such as masks and social distancing, are likely to remain in place for several months at least. Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told CNN that many factors must be considered before the UK's lockdown is relaxed  -- starting with a big drop in severe cases and deaths. Read More\"The issue comes down to numbers really,\" Hunter said. He explained that if the UK was in a similar position to that in August 2020, when the number of number of new cases was below 1,000 on most days -- and dipped to lows of 600 -- and hospitalizations fell below 100 and daily deaths below 10, then the country would be in a better place to ease some of the current restrictions -- given that the vaccination rollout is underway. Three weeks into harsh lockdown, weary Brits fear it will take much longer to beat the new variantBut outbreaks are still running out of control across the UK, where on Wednesday, more than 25,000 new cases and 1,725 coronavirus deaths were recorded, taking the number of Covid-19 deaths in the country to 101,887.Last week, the picture was also bleak, with more than 35,900 cases reported each day and an average of more than 1,240 daily deaths, according to a seven-day average of government data. Two weeks ago, the UK recorded the highest death rate in the world. More than 37,500 Covid-19 patients are in UK hospitals, with an average of 3,825 patients being admitted on a daily basis, according to the seven-day average of government data. So how quickly the vaccine can flatten the curve remains a key question.There are also many unknowns around the vaccines in use, such as whether or not they can stop transmission -- and for how long they provide immunity. This means it is possible that vaccinated people may still spread the virus, or catch it at a later date, if social distancing measures were to be completely relaxed.  And while the UK's vaccine program has been largely successful so far, there's another key factor to keep in mind: Its coverage rates. Firstly, the vaccines are currently only available to priority groups, which make up around 20% of the UK's population: The elderly, those who are clinically vulnerable, and health care workers, all of whom, research suggests, are much more likely to take up the vaccine. A woman from the top four priority groups receives the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine at a church in Yorkshire, northern England on January 23. As the vaccine becomes available to the wider population, the take-up rate is expected to drop, since some parts of the population will be unable to take it (children and those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, for example) -- while others might remain hesitant to take it. For example, multiple surveys have shown resistance among ethnic minority groups, including a recent study commissioned by the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) that found uptake among these groups in the UK ranged widely. The study, based on surveys taken in November, found that 72% of Black or Black British respondents said they were unlikely or very unlikely to take the vaccine. Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups were the next most hesitant minority ethnic group, with 42% unlikely or very unlikely to be vaccinated. This means certain measures may have to remain in place to protect vulnerable people in unvaccinated communities, Hunter said, noting that another surge in cases in the fall and winter is possible, depending on the percentage of the population that is either immune or vaccinated by then. 8 myths about the Covid-19 vaccine \nThese factors, along with the fact that multiple vaccines are in use and no one vaccine is 100% effective, all take the likelihood of herd immunity -- a situation where enough of the population becomes immune to the virus to block its survival -- off the table, as outlined in a recent paper that Hunter co-wrote. The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed.But Hunter told CNN he is hopeful that some form of normality could come as early as the summer, under a \"lot more light touch restrictions,\" such as mask-wearing and social distancing. This is because, while vaccines may not provide herd immunity, they will help to reduce transmission, since they reduce the risk of developing symptoms and severe disease, and symptomatic cases are around three times more likely to transmit the infection, he said.This should, in turn, push the R number to below one -- a key measure of whether the epidemic is shrinking or growing.The arrival of new coronavirus variants, though, threatens  this hope, because experts simply don't know how the vaccines will react to the new variants. Studies already suggest that variant B.1.351 -- first seen in South Africa -- may evade immunity induced by vaccination. Preliminary studies suggest that Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine is effective against the variant first seen in the UK, but on Monday, Moderna said that while their vaccine is \"expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date,\" including the one from the UK, early studies have suggested it may be somewhat less effective against the variant first reported in South Africa. Moderna said it was developing a new booster vaccine to help fight this reduction. It is unclear if the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which began its UK rollout earlier this month, will be impacted by the new variants. An Oxford University spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that they are \"carefully assessing the impact of new variants on vaccine immunity and evaluating the processes needed for rapid development of adjusted COVID-19 vaccines if these should be necessary.\"While the variants continue to present fresh challenges for vaccine programs, scientists are plowing ahead with models to predict a glimpse of what the future may hold. Best-case scenario One study, developed by John Roberts, a member of the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, earlier this month, predicts that by the end of March, deaths in the UK may be reduced by nearly 90% and that by mid-March, hospitalizations could fall by almost 60%But the forecast model assumes a best-case scenario where the government meets its target of administering the first dose to all vulnerable groups by February 15 -- and where all those who are offered a shot accept it.Roberts' model also relies on the assumption that the vaccine is 70% effective at preventing infections and 100% effective in preventing serious illness that would lead to hospitalizations and deaths, which the new variants are now threatening.Some experts say it is unclear whether vaccines offer full protection against severe disease and death, arguing that clinical trials have assessed the efficacy against developing symptoms but that data was more limited on severe disease. Others also say a full uptake is unrealistic.Taking these caveats into account and creating a wide range of plausible scenarios could help to predict when we may hope to see some impact -- which is what researchers from the University of Warwick, University of Edinburgh and Imperial College London have done.Covid-19 has killed 100,000 people in the UK. Experts say the government is still getting it wrongLast week, the scientists presented a wide selection of models that aim to address the various factors bringing the vaccine rollout -- and its success -- into question. One model explored the options based on vaccine rollout and uptake in light of the B.1.1.7. variant, first seen in the UK. The research, by Dr. Anne Cori and Dr. Marc Baguelin from Imperial College London, found that, unsurprisingly, there would need to be \"more restrictions to get the same level of control,\" due to the arrival of the variant, but also that 78% of the population would need to be protected -- either by vaccination or through immunity, because of a previous infection -- to bring the R number below one.And with various uncertainties around the efficacy of the vaccines being rolled out, they predicted that there would need to be an uptake rate of over 80% to achieve herd immunity -- and that even with a very ambitious vaccination program of 3 million doses per week, it would take four to five months to cover 80% of the UK's population with their first dose.Last week in the UK, more than 2.5 million people received their first dose of the vaccine and 18,177 received a second dose. The researchers estimate population-level immunity in the UK was 19% from past infection as of mid-January.Ultimately, the Imperial models found that the full lifting of restrictions before the summer will \"lead to prolonged and potentially multiple periods of pressure on hospitals, and substantial additional deaths.\"Professor Mark Woolhouse and his team at the University of Edinburgh found similar outcomes.They charted 44 scenarios looking at different coverage rates, variants, mixing patterns, degrees of relaxation of restrictions and how much protection the vaccine offers (versus natural protection from getting sick and then recovering) -- and saw that an extremely gradual relaxation of control measures, starting in the spring and continuing into early 2022, would be a far less risky approach, and could help exit the pandemic without overwhelming the UK's National Health Service (NHS).Valuable data and surveillancePeople line up outside a Covid-19 vaccination center in Stevenage, in central England, on January 11.While none of the UK models can be applied to other countries, Roberts says nations taking similar approaches to the UK -- for example by rolling out the vaccine to the most vulnerable groups first, alongside national lockdowns or other severe restrictions -- might see, or \"hope to see,\" comparable results.Hunter urges caution in extrapolating and comparing outcomes seen across different countries, but highlights that the strength of the UK's post-vaccine surveillance has been successful, and that data from it may be of use to other countries in the near future.Within a few months, scientists in the UK should be able to examine the impact of a large range of factors, including who has had which vaccine, which doses, and with how big a gap. It's a key step in understanding the effect that the vaccines are having, Hunter explains.\"That is going to be of value throughout the world,\" he said, noting that the UK model could, in turn, help to inform how other countries might plan their rollouts  -- and pave the long road back to normal life.

But for others, issues persist for months or cause damage that might lead to other health issues in the future. This is known as \"long Covid.\"The program -- described as the first of its kind -- uses singing techniques to help patients who are experiencing breathlessness and anxiety.An initial six week trial involved 12 participants, and the program will now benefit up to 1,000 patients at more than 25 participating healthcare centers across England, in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Cheshire and Merseyside in the next few months.Read MoreThe English National Opera (ENO) is based in the Coliseum theater in London.Participants reported \"positive impacts for them both emotionally and physically,\" said the press release.\"It has really aided me enormously with my breathlessness and also my anxiety a little around re-integrating myself back into society,\" a patient named Richard is quoted as saying in the press release.The program involves weekly online group sessions, plus digital resources designed to help participants focus on their breathing.Covid-19's 'serious, long-term impact' can improve with time, early evidence suggestsSinging practice uses traditional lullabies, which are designed to calm people down. Participants are taught breathing and singing exercises by professional specialists, and encouraged to practice in their own time using online resources.\"We are hugely proud to be able to roll out ENO Breathe nationally, enabling us to support many more patients in their recovery from Covid and journey back to wellness,\" said Jenny Mollica, director of ENO Baylis.Dr Sarah Elkin, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust, said: \"Ongoing breathlessness is debilitating and can be frightening. We hope this program will support people to improve and help reduce their symptoms.\"Participants in the trial ranged from early 30s to early 70s in terms of age and were racially diverse, the release said.Older patients, women and those with variety of early symptoms most at risk of 'long Covid,' paper suggests  All of the participants said they would keep using their breathing exercises after the trial finished, and all said they would \"definitely recommend\" the program to other \"long Covid\" patients, the release added.Older people, women and those with a wide range of symptoms in the first week of their illness appear to be most likely to develop \"long Covid,\" according to a preprint paper posted online by researchers at King's College London in October.The paper defines \"long Covid\" as having symptoms persist for more than four weeks, while a short duration of Covid was defined as less than 10 days, without a subsequent relapse.The UK continues to record thousands of new coronavirus cases per day, and on Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that more than 100,000 people had died.",

But for 27-year-old golfer Kamaiu Johnson, it has turned into a nightmare few days.The American was supposed to make his PGA Tour debut on Thursday at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, but after testing positive for Covid-19, Johnson has been forced to withdraw. On top of that, he took to Twitter to inform fans that his mother was hospitalized with the virus. \"This is turning into a nightmare from hell my mom has just been rush(ed) to the hospital not being able to breathe due to COVID 19. Pray for my family please,\" he said on Wednesday. Read MoreREAD: The teenage twins pushing each other to pro golf successJohnson plays a hole at Seminole Legacy Golf Club. A few hours later, Johnson once again took to Twitter with the good news that his mother was \"feeling better.\"\"I've been talking to my mom all day today and she's feeling better and she's (in) really good spirits. I told her she basically has the entire world praying for her and she told me to tell you guys to keep praying and thanks for all the support.\"Although he reports feeling well, Johnson expressed that he felt \"disappointed\" that his debut will have to wait, but is remaining positive nonetheless. \"To say that I'm disappointed would be a massive understatement. I've dreamed of playing on the PGA Tour for a long, long time, but health and safety come first,\" Johnson said. \"It's times like these where you have to keep focusing on the bigger picture at hand, and from my experience, a fork in the road often has an interesting way of leading to new opportunities. Getting a brief glimpse of the Farmers Insurance Open and what it would be like to play on the PGA Tour only further ignites the fire inside me to work that much harder to chase the dream of playing on Tour full-time. \"I am so thankful to Farmers Insurance and the entire team at the Century Club of San Diego for not only providing me with this opportunity, but also for all they're doing to promote diversity in golf and beyond.\"Johnson's rise into golf has drawn much attention given his humble beginnings. An eighth-grade dropout, his future was forged by the foundation of golf. Having initially been shown the game with just a stick in his grandmother's garden, Johnson -- who never knew his father -- found a home at a golf club where the assistant professional gave him work in exchange for one-dollar rounds. Johnson hits a tee shot on the 10th hole during the final round of an APGA Tour event on the Slammer & Squire Course at World Golf Village.Having grabbed every opportunity presented to him, the Advocates Pro Golf Association Tour (APGA) -- \"a non-profit organization with the mission to bring greater diversity to the game of golf\" -- is where he honed his game. He carded five straight top-10s on the APGA Tour, finishing with victory over former PGA Tour pros Tim O'Neal and Brad Adamonis at the APGA Tour Championship in September. The invite to make his PGA Tour debut followed shortly, with Johnson saying at the time that for real change to be made, players have to take advantage of these moments. \"There are really good players on the APGA Tour that, if they got more opportunities, could play on the PGA Tour,\" he said. \"People don't understand how much it takes to get through Q school and everything. It's a lot of money.\"He continued: \"We have to put ourselves in position to take advantage of those opportunities. Make it to the weekend and show we can play out there just like those guys.\"And although he has been forced to delay his debut -- replaced in the field by friend Willie Mack III -- Johnson is keen to stress that he will be back. \"This isn't the end of my story,\" he said.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)\"Why are you detaining me? Have I violated any laws?\" demanded Yulia Navalnaya, as four policemen surrounded her on Saturday. She was on her way to a protest in Moscow, where thousands had gathered to demand the release of her husband, Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, from jail.She was freed a few hours later, once riot police had dispersed the crowds. Nevertheless, the promptness with which Moscow police tracked her down and detained her speaks to the fears she and her husband spark in the Kremlin, as protests rage across Russia.  While Alexey Navalny rose to prominence first as a blogger, then as a politician, Navalnaya, 44, chose for herself a life largely outside the spotlight. She followed him to several protests and supported Alexey during his mayoral and presidential campaigns, but made few speeches or public appearances.    Hundreds, including Navalny's wife Yulia, detained as protests in his support sweep across RussiaBut in late August, her husband was poisoned with nerve agent Novichok. As he lay comatose in a clinic in Omsk, Navalnaya suddenly stepped into the center stage of a battle with the Russian state -- and her image of a stoic, calm, and collected woman became a story in its own. Russian independent media have since compared her to former US First Lady Michelle Obama, and supporters now wonder if she might lead the country's opposition movement one day.Read MoreNavalnaya moved quickly to put public and international pressure on the Russian government after her husband was poisoned -- and in doing so may have saved his life. She held impromptu press conferences on the clinic's doorstep telling journalists she believed her husband remained in grave danger while in Russia. Local doctors were refusing to let him be medically evacuated to Germany, likely due to pressure from Russia's secret service, Navalnaya alleged. \"This is being done so that the traces of the chemical substance disappear from Alexey's system,\" she said, masking any emotion with black sunglasses. \"He is not in a very good condition, we can't trust this hospital, and we demand that he is given back to us.\"Yulia Navalnaya (right), at least in public, has often laughed off the hardships that her husband (left) has brought on the family through his battle with the Russian state.To further pressure the Kremlin, Navalnaya even went to the man her husband believes was behind the attack, the Russian President himself. She wrote directly to Vladimir Putin demanding that he allow her husband to leave the country. Putin later said that he \"immediately gave the order\" to let Navalny go when he received Navalnaya's letter. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning.  She and the comatose Navalny were soon flown to Berlin, along with some evidence gathered from his hotel room that would later be crucial in helping European labs identify Novichok, a military grade chemical weapon first developed by the Soviet Union.\"Yulia, you saved me,\" Navalny wrote on Instagram, shortly after he regained consciousness at Berlin's Charite Hospital, crediting her for his remarkable recovery.  In the spotlightThe couple met shortly after Yulia, a Moscow native and the daughter of a scientist and an employee of the state consumer-goods ministry, graduated from Plekhanov University of Economics, where she studied international relations. She worked in a bank before leaving to care for their eldest daughter, Darya, who is now studying at Stanford University in the United States.   Returning from maternity leave, Navalnaya helped her parents-in-law sell furniture for a few years, but after her and Navalny's son, Zakhar, was born -- and with Navalny increasingly in the spotlight -- she decided to focus solely on the family.  Before Navalny's near-fatal poisoning, Navalnaya's most famous public appearance dated back to 2013, when she spoke out to support his run for Moscow mayor. \"In Russia ... we don't see the politicians' wives at protests, but politics storms into families' lives whether you like it or not,\" Navalnaya said from the stage where at a concert in her husband's support, she described how members of her family had frequently found themselves the target of law enforcement due to Alexey's activism. CNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned In the over seven years since, politics has indeed caused her family a fair share of trouble. In 2014, Navalny was on the brink of getting a three and a half year-long prison sentence in an embezzlement case he believes was fabricated to bar him from running for public offices again. His brother Oleg was imprisoned, while Alexey got away with a suspended sentence following a court decision many viewed as a way for the authorities to avoid fueling public support for the Kremlin critic. Navalny has spent weeks on end in detention centers after anti-government demonstrations and been physically attacked by radical groups. In 2017 Navalny was splashed in the face with an antiseptic green dye that damaged vision in one of his eyes. Their family has also been under constant surveillance for years. According to a CNN-Bellingcat investigation, phone and travel records suggest members of a Russian intelligence team followed Navalny to at least 17 cities since 2017.  Yulia Navalnaya appealed directly to President Putin to allow her husband to be flown to Germany for treatment.Navalnaya herself may have been poisoned while on a family vacation in Kaliningrad last year. Flight manifests obtained by the investigation show at least three members of FSB flew to the city at the same time, and security cameras at the hotel were turned off for the duration of their stay, a source told Bellingcat. On July 6, hours after the FSB team returned to Moscow, she fell ill, experiencing what Navalny would later describe as sudden exhaustion and disorientation.  Yulia recovered, and the exact cause of her illness was not determined. But experts have told CNN that such symptoms are consistent with a low dosage of poisoning, and looking back, Navalny believes the symptoms were \"absolutely the same\" as those he would experience while recovering from his encounter with Novichok.'The First Lady' Alexey Navalny regained consciousness at Berlin's Charite Hospital in September and credited Yulia for his remarkable recoveryNavalnaya, at least in public, has often laughed off the hardships that her husband's battle with the state has brought on the family.  \"Everyone always wants me to say or hint that yes, I'd like it [for Alexey to stop what he is doing]. No. I support what he does, I say that sincerely,\" she said in her first comprehensive on-camera interview, with the prominent Russian blogger and filmmaker Yury Dud, filmed after Navalny's poisoning. \"Dropping everything half-way, that's just not cool.\"  When their personal bank accounts were frozen last year as a result of an embezzlement case against Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which he believes was also politically motivated, the family was forced to rely on cash for all purchases, she told Dud.  \"I just learned that I'm a member of a criminal gang called 'Navalny's allies,' and all of our funds have been frozen,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time. \"I'm furious. Why is Alexey Navalny the leader of the gang? Maybe I'm the criminal boss here, and he is just a supporter of mine.\"  Navalnaya's supporting role in her husband's political career stands in stark contrast to the spouses of most Russian and Soviet leaders. Putin's wife Lyudmila Putina was rarely seen in public and has faded into obscurity since they announced their divorce in 2013. JUST WATCHEDKhrushcheva: Navalny changed equilibrium in RussiaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKhrushcheva: Navalny changed equilibrium in Russia 19:40\"Navalny never denies the exceptional role Yulia played in his life, and this is one of his strengths,\" Novaya Gazeta reporter Vera Chelishcheva wrote after the paper named her one of its heroes of the year for 2020. \"He is not hiding his wife, he openly confesses his love to her, but is not showing off, he posts her photos on Instagram, protects her and does not hide that she is the one who saves him in life.\" Just over a week ago, the couple flew back to Russia after spending five months amid the idyllic landscapes of the German countryside -- knowing full well that, once they landed back in Moscow, they ran the risk of being separated for years.     Before take-off, Yulia posted a humorous video on Instagram, repeating a line from a popular 90s Russian crime drama \"Brother\": \"Gar\u00e7on, pour us some vodka, we are flying home.\" The video now became viral on TikTok among those calling for Navalny's release. He was detained shortly after arriving at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where their plane had been diverted at the last minute.  As police prepared to escort Navalny away, Navalnaya gave her husband a hug and a kiss and stepped into the cold outside the airport to address a crowd of journalists and supporters: \"[Alexey] is not afraid, I'm not afraid, and I urge you all not to be afraid either,\" she said before being driven away to chants of her name. Navalny's daring return to Russia means he now risks spending years behind bars. As a result, many Russia watchers speculate that she could assume leadership of Russia's opposition, comparing her to Belarus' Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who ran for president in her husband Sergei's place, after the popular video-blogger and pro-democracy activist was jailed. Putin presents a Russia-sized foreign-policy headache for BidenAlexander Lukashenko, who has ruled over Belarus since 1994, was declared the winner of the disputed election, and Tikhanovskaya was forced to flee the country. Nevertheless, she remains the face of mass protests against the strongman leader.   Some Russian tabloids have speculated that Navalnaya could also run for a seat in Russia's parliament, the Duma, next fall. Similar rumors abounded before the Russian presidential elections in 2018, when Navalny was barred from running due to a past conviction.  Another presidential candidate, socialite Ksenia Sobchak recalled in an interview that she had suggested Yulia could run on his platform, but said that Navalny dismissed it, saying that \"votes are not transferrable.\" Navalnaya has so far voiced no aspirations for political office. But pro-Kremlin outlets have already slammed her as a \"project' by Western \"curators\" intent on meddling in Russian politics -- an echo of similar accusations against Navalny. Her husband faces a court hearing next week that will determine their family's future for what may be years to come. Navalnaya remains defiant, thanking supporters -- who dubbed her \"the First Lady\" on Instagram -- for risking arrest last weekend to protest for his release.",

The designation is the first by the US State Department since 2016, when then Secretary of State John Kerry determined that the atrocities committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria amounted to genocide, and only among a handful of times a US administration has applied the term to an ongoing crisis.Genocide is defined by the United Nations as \"intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group,\" and although the US determination won't trigger any immediate penalties, it will put pressure on anyone who does business with China -- and that includes the 90 or so nations that are due to send athletes to the Winter Games in February next year. \"Right now there is a lot of pressure on any kind of major engagements with the Chinese government that involves lending (them) legitimacy,\" said Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.Read MoreThe prospect of US athletes competing in the capital of a country accused of carrying out an ongoing genocide, will at the very least send mixed messages about Washington's commitment to human rights. Beijing has long denied claims of genocide, claiming its policies in Xinjiang are part of a program of mass deradicalization and poverty alleviation. Last week a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Pompeo of spreading \"venomous\" lies, inviting people to visit Xinjiang to \"see with your own eyes.\"Politicians in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada and the US have publicly raised the prospect of not sending athletes to Beijing in 2022. While in March last year, 12 US senators led by Republican Rick Scott submitted a bipartisan resolution requesting that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) remove the 2022 Games from China and reopen the bidding process. But to date no government or national sports authority has officially announced it will be pulling out.CNN has reached out to the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) for comment. In a statement to CNN, the IOC said that it had received \"assurances\" from Chinese authorities that the principles of the Olympic Charter will be respected at the Beijing 2022 Games.\"Awarding the Olympic Games to a National Olympic Committee (NOC) does not mean that the IOC agrees with the political structure, social circumstances or human rights standards in its country,\" the statement said.Activists and experts said that US' accusations will undoubtedly fuel calls for at least a partial boycott of the Games. In September 2020, more than 160 human rights groups around the world wrote to the IOC to reverse its decision to hold the 2022 Games in Beijing.Mandie McKeown, executive director of the International Tibet Network, who coordinated the letter, said that if they were to put together another group letter now, the number of organizations would \"undoubtedly\" be higher.She said if the Games couldn't be canceled, then her organization was advocating for a diplomatic boycott of the event, which would allow teams to attend while world leaders stayed away. \"The push for diplomatic boycott is definitely growing and noises (from governments) are positive,\" McKeown said.Chinese President Xi Jinping talks with athletes and coaches of China's national figure skating and short track speed skating teams while visiting the Capital Gymnasium in Haidian District, Beijing, on January 18.Politicizing the GamesOver the years there have been many calls for Olympic boycotts, either over alleged human rights abuses or for political purposes.In 1936, shortly before the beginning of World War II, pressure was placed on countries to boycott the Summer Olympics in Berlin, which was presided over by then-Chancellor Adolf Hitler. In 1976, more than 20 African nations boycotted the Montreal Summer Games over the participation of New Zealand athletes, after the country's rugby team defied the United Nations to go on a controversial tour of apartheid South Africa.During the Cold War, the US and its allies boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow after which the Soviet Union then boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.But Susan Brownell, an Olympics expert and professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St Louis, said that from the Winter Olympics in Albertville in 1992 onwards there had been no national boycotts. \"A broad consensus opposing boycotts emerged among national governments worldwide because of the feeling that they accomplish nothing and only harm the athletes,\" she said.There was a push by human rights organizations and NGOs for a boycott of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics over the Chinese government's restrictions on civil liberties, especially in regards to Tibetan minority groups, but in the end the Olympics went ahead as planned. \"No-one with the power to withdraw from the Games was seriously considering it,\" Brownell said.But since then, allegations against Beijing in relation to mass detention camps in Xinjiang have mounted. Beijing claims it's offering Muslim minorities, including the Uyghurs, an education in Chinese language and values as part of its anti-terrorism program.\"Languages, traditional cultures and customs of all ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been well protected and inherited. All residents fully enjoy their rights, including the right to subsistence and development,\" said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on January 20.However, Uyghurs in exile say their families are being imprisoned for arbitrary offenses and subjected to forced labor and abuse. Even without formal boycotts, the 2022 event is likely to attract protests, though mass demonstrations won't be possible in a country that prides itself on maintaining order. McKeown, from the International Tibet Network, said her organization and other groups working with it would be undertaking a program of action, including protests around the world, in the lead up to the 2022 Beijing Games to draw attention to the Chinese government's human rights abuses.She said for now they were advocating for a political boycott, rather than a total boycott, for the sake of the athletes. \"Athletes have worked incredibly hard to get where they are. It's not necessarily their concern that the IOC made such a terrible mistake in giving the Games to Beijing,\" she said.Individual athletes could still boycott the 2022 Games, although this would mean compromising years of training and lucrative sponsorships. Under Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, any political protests by individual competitors at the Games are banned.'The power of sport'An Olympics can still be heavily political even if there's no boycotts, and the 2022 Beijing Games are likely to be no exception.In 2018, at the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, North and South Korea marched in the Opening Ceremony under a United Korea banner, a powerful symbol of unity between the two divided nations.But the 2018 Games came at the same time as rising tensions between the US and North Korea. At the Opening Ceremony, then-US Vice President Mike Pence appeared to act coldly towards North Korean representatives, including the sister of leader Kim Jong Un.Beijing sanctions outgoing US officials as Chinese state media bids 'good riddance' to TrumpA boycott by Western political leaders of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2022 Games is possible, said Olympic expert Brownell, but she added that given Winter Olympics rarely attracted the attention of the Summer Games, many leaders were unlikely to go in the first place.Brownell said that she believed the worst damage to the Olympics' reputation didn't come from an association with China or human rights issues. \"The damage seems to have come from the perception of excess cost to the taxpayer and corruption in the IOC,\" she said. Despite the genocide ruling by the US, no countries have publicly moved to downsize relations with the Chinese government. And signs point to stronger ties, not weaker. In late December, for example, the European Union struck a wide-reaching investment agreement with Beijing despite the concerns of human rights organizations.Human rights activists said it was too early to say whether or not a boycott of the 2022 Games, political or otherwise, was likely to go ahead.And that's assuming the Games even go ahead as planned. Events in Beijing are scheduled to begin on Friday, February 4, 2022 -- just over 12 months away. But as the postponement of last year's Summer Games in Tokyo has shown, the coronavirus pandemic has thrown doubt on countries' ability to host large sporting events.With numerous potential problems ahead, Wang, of Human Rights Watch, said the Chinese government needed to be given a chance to respond to international concerns over their actions in Xinjiang and the crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong.But Wang said that she found it hard to see that happening and without demonstrable changes in Beijing's behavior, there could be a \"change of perception among other governments.\"\"They are going to have to make a decision,\" Wang said. Human Rights Watch is currently not calling for any boycott of the 2022 Games.In response to a question about a potential boycott in 2022 on January 20, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that \"preparations are being smoothly carried out.\" \"We have confidence that it will be an extraordinary gathering,\" she said.In 2017, the IOC announced that it would add human rights, anti-corruption and sustainable development clauses to Olympic Host City contracts in the future. However, the new rules will only come into place after the 2022 Winter Olympics, beginning with the 2024 Summer Games. It is unclear how the clauses will be policed or what will happen if a host city breaks them.In its statement to CNN, the IOC said that it recognizes and upholds human rights but at the same time, couldn't change laws or the political system in a sovereign country. \"This must rightfully remain the legitimate role of governments and respective intergovernmental organizations,\" the statement said.The IOC said that the Olympic Games had a unique role in bringing the world together. \"In our fragile world, the power of sport to bring the whole world together, despite all the existing differences, gives us all hope for a better future,\" the statement said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly named Munich as the host city of the 1936 Olympic Games. The Games were held in Berlin.",

        "content": "(CNN)Talk about a busy evening. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 generated plenty of headlines on Tuesday in the Milan derby -- and then some.From scoring to getting into a spat with a former teammate and then being sent off, the Swedish superstar did it all in AC Milan's dramatic Coppa Italia defeat to cross-city rivals Inter Milan. Ibrahimovi\u0107's first-half strike put the Italian league leaders in front, further continuing his excellent form against Inter, his eighth goal in seven appearances against the Nerazzurri, who the Swede played for between 2006 and 2009.READ: Thomas Tuchel appointed Chelsea managerTensions rising between Zlatan and Lukaku in the Milan derby \ud83d\ude33 pic.twitter.com/mbPDw32yn3\u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) January 26, 2021\n\nHowever, the 39-year-old's turbulent evening was only just beginning. Read MoreAs the two sides were heading off the field for the halftime break and with tensions rising, Ibrahimovi\u0107 and his former Manchester United teammate Lukaku came head-to-head as tempers flared.They were seen on TV cameras -- and heard, due to an empty San Siro -- exchanging insults in English as Lukaku had to be restrained by his teammates as the Belgian international tried to confront the Swede for a second time. Both players, who were teammates in 2017 in Manchester, were booked for their involvement in the spat, something which came back to haunt Ibrahimovi\u0107.Ibrahimovi\u0107 (right) argues with Lukaku (left) during the Coppa Italia match.Inter manager Antonio Conte said after the match that these combustible moments are typical of heated derbies. \"Derbies are like this, it was a heartfelt match,\" Conte told Rai Sport. \"I haven't spoken with Romelu yet, but I was a player so I know that during a match things can get heated. Situations can flare up but it's only right that things then settle. \"I liked seeing Romelu so focused, he is growing in terms of his character. He plays an important role for us and if sometimes he gets angry, then we can only gain from it.\"Thirteen minutes after the half-time break, Ibrahimovi\u0107 was shown his second yellow card -- and a ticket to an early shower -- for a foul on former Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov. Ibrahimovi\u0107 is shown the red card by referee Paolo Valeri.And with a man advantage, Inter capitalized against their long-time rivals. Lukaku in fact was the man to bring the teams level, converting from the penalty spot after a foul from Rafael Leao on Nicolo Barella was eventually given by referee Paolo Valeri after consulting the pitch side monitor.Now in the ascendency, Inter continued to pile on the pressure, but found stand-in Milan goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu an immovable object. That was until, with extra time looming, Christian Eriksen curled in an exquisite free-kick in the dying moments of the game to snatch a dramatic victory and set up a semifinal clash against either Juventus or SPAL who play on Wednesday. It was Eriksen's first goal of the season -- the Dane has started just four Serie A games so far -- with rumors circulating that he could be on his way out of the club after only joining in January 2020.  However, Conte is adamant that Eriksen is going nowhere. \"As I've said for a month, this is our squad. With Christian, we're working hard on making him a tactical alternative to (Marcelo) Brozovi\u0107<' said the Inter manager. Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosEriksen scores from a free kick.\"He has quality and he's very intelligent from a footballing perspective. He is part of the project and I am pleased that he scored. I urged him to take the free-kick, he's a bit shy but I hope this goal helps him. \"We all want him to do well because he's a good lad, perhaps too good. We're keeping a close eye on him as he is part of the group. We'll all keep working hard right until the end, pleased that we're here together.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Sibling rivalry at a young age can often be a professional athlete's beginning in their sport. However, teenage twins competing as professional golfers on the European Tour is a whole new level. In the case of Rasmus Hojgaard, and his brother Nicolai, not many golfers have advanced to such a high level so quickly, let alone a set of twins. \"We can always push each other,\" Rasmus told CNN's Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue.\"We've done that since school and playing handball or football. It was always like, who can be the best? It has definitely helped us quite a lot in golf as well.\"Read MoreDanish players and twin brothers Nicolai, left, and Rasmus Hojgaard with the Eisenhower Trophy.While Rasmus has won more since they both made their professional debuts in 2019, their glittering amateur careers -- in which both brothers helped the Denmark team win the Eisenhower Trophy in 2018 -- has seen them enjoy alternate moments in the spotlight.\"It's something we've seen since we started playing golf at an early age,\" he remembers. \"One would have a very good year, and then the next one will be even better the next year, and then it was always up and down.\"Nicolai in 2018 had an unbelievable year as an amateur, winning everything he pretty much played. So I think a lot expected Nicolai to be the one to have a fast start as a professional. And I did too, because he looked so good in 2018.\"But this is the thing about golf. It changes all the time. So, yeah, I had early success, and Nicolai had as well early on.\"Rasmus Hojgaard celebrates after his winning putt in the final round of the Afrasia Bank Mauritius Open.His first win on the European Tour, at the AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open in December 2019, made Rasmus the third youngest winner in tour history, aged only 18 years and 271 days. People immediately sat up to take notice. \"I could definitely feel that I got a lot of more attention suddenly,\" he said. \"I think people started early out expecting me to do big things quite early and it was... I didn't know how to handle it back then. \"It was a lot of different things at one time. It was fun, but it was also very tough in some way.\"For Rasmus, focus and mindset have been key elements to success in the professional ranks. It was at that moment that the current coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a halt, and the teenager was given the chance to quietly step out of the public eye and return to behavior perhaps more typical of someone his age.\"I've always had a passion for video games, so I had some time to get better at that and spend some time there,\" Rasmus explains. \"I think at that time almost everyone was spending time with their friends doing video games, because we weren't allowed to be together and spend some time.\"We, obviously, had a lot of fun playing on computer or PlayStation or whatever it was. It was very comfortable because suddenly you are not thinking about any golf or anything related to golf. I think that was very helpful for me.\"READ: He needed surgery after slipping on straw. Now he's a top 10 golferAt the British Masters an injury to his foot led to another period on the sidelines for R.Hojgaard. An old head on young shouldersDespite feeling that he had \"lost a little bit of my touch\" following lockdown, another enforced absence actually led to the Dane winning the ISPS Handa UK Championship at The Belfry in August 2020.\"At the British Masters,\" Rasmus told CNN Sport, \"I injured my right foot and played on painkillers for the next two weeks after that. But I managed to play good golf. \"When I kind of secured my spot for the US open after the third event, I said to myself: \"I have to go back and get my foot checked.\" So I got back, got an MRI scan, ultrasound scan and all these different things, and got an injection in my right foot.\"So again, that was eight, nine days without golf. That's where the touch is gone again. That's what I thought.\"I obviously came back at the Belfry playing some good golf. It's weird sometimes. I think, when you don't expect too much of yourself that's when you play some of your best golf, and I think that's what happened for me there.\"Focus and mindset are consistent themes of Hojgaard's approach when he is on form, and in deliberately ignoring measures of his own success, he has noticed an improvement in his game.\"I've had some lessons during this year where I've started to look too much into the different rankings, and it hasn't done any good for me,\" he acknowledges. \"So I need to focus on the right things. When I do that, that's when I seem to play good golf.\"Rasmus Hojgaard tees off during his winning performance at The Belfry.Such a mature attitude belies his age, but it did not prevent Rasmus from feeling awed on the US Open, where he was making his major debut, when faced with established stars. And sharing a practice range with his hero Rory Mcllroy proved a daunting experience for the young Dane. \"I didn't quite know what to do in the practice,\" he remembers. \"I was so focused on some of the big guys and had nine holes with Rory there, where I didn't even focus on my own game. I was just looking at him playing.\"VISIT: CNN.come/sport for more news, features and videosLike the twins, Mcllroy was a golfer who turned professional as a teenager, and it is not only his sporting prowess that his younger competitors appreciate but also his admirable humility. \"I grew up watching Rory. He was my ... still is my big idol in golf,\" reflects Rasmus. \"When I started playing golf, it was Rory in the TV every week, and I really enjoy watching him play. I liked the way he plays, hits are long, just a phenomenal and ball striker. \"But, at the same time, he's just such a down-to-earth guy, which I think is what is really great. I think that's... It's kind of what I was raised a little bit too, is always be grateful for the help you've got all the way up. Because it's the same people you meet when you're playing well as when you're playing bad. \"So it's always try to stay as humble as possible. I feel like Rory is one of those guys. I had that experience with him at the US Open as well. He was such a nice person, played nine holes. That's a highlight so far.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)In March last year, the UK government said it was hopeful the country could cap its coronavirus deaths at 20,000. It was a bleak target to set, but one the nation came to begrudgingly accept.Ten months on, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a somber public briefing Tuesday, in which he announced the country could now count more than 100,000 people as its Covid-19 dead, in what he called a \"grim statistic.\" Of the worst-affected nations, the UK has earned the dishonor of having the highest number of confirmed deaths in the world, proportionate to population.A surge in case numbers\u00a0that began\u00a0in December has\u00a0pushed\u00a0hospitals\u00a0to the brink. ICU workers say they have been forced to \"dilute\" their care and describe mental health struggles under unprecedented pressure.\u00a0Schools are shut and have moved online, disrupting the lives of students and working parents alike. All but essential shops are closed. In England, socializing, even outdoors, is banned, except in pairs for exercise.\u00a0London's ICU nurses detail depression and disaster Read MoreThere are few differences from the spring, when Britons suffered a devastating first wave and were put under a draconian lockdown. They are now asking themselves how they got here. Yet again.When asked that very thing, Johnson has repeatedly pointed to a new and more contagious variant of the virus, now infamously known around the world as the \"UK variant.\"\u00a0Health Secretary Matt Hancock too has claimed the country's response was working until the new variant hit.But it's not that simple. Like in the first wave, the government has been slow to respond to rising case and death numbers with restrictions. It has failed to get an adequate contact-tracing and isolation system running. And\u00a0it has, again, been slow on border controls, only closing \"travel corridors\" with more than 60 countries or territories in mid-January amid record-breaking daily death tolls.Experts say\u00a0the government hasn't learned from its past mistakes and still lacks a coherent strategy.\u00a0Prof. Anne Johnson, president of the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences, said there was a clear correlation with the relaxation of restrictions\u00a0before Christmas\u00a0and\u00a0the recent spike in infections.\"The new variant is important and more transmissible, but that's not the only cause of the third wave. Let's be clear,\" she told CNN.\u00a0Boris Johnson had for weeks been telling the nation they could celebrate Christmas with friends and families, allowing a mixing of households if they just followed the rules during a November lockdown. He called the whole thing off at the 11th hour, at least in\u00a0England's worst-hit counties.\u00a0But it was too late. The damage had been done well before the holidays began, and medical staff knew they would be in for a tough January.\"Inevitably, if you come out of lockdown on the 2nd\u00a0of December, as we did, with people gagging to get to the shops and get out and about, and we've got three weeks before Christmas, that's going to be clearly a moment for seeing more transmission,\" Prof. Anne Johnson said.A quiet street in London during lockdown on January 15.In the aftermath, the Prime Minister argued the government could not have foreseen the new, more transmissible variant. But the idea that viruses mutate, sometimes in the shape of more aggressive forms, is widely understood.\u00a0It was even flagged as a potential threat in a July report by the Academy of Medical Sciences, for which Prof. Anne Johnson was a lead author. The government had commissioned the report for the precise purpose of preparing for the difficult winter it knew was coming.In July last year, the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had not read the report when asked in parliament. In January, six months later, he did not answer a question by the BBC's Andrew Marr in an interview on whether he had finally gotten around to reading it. His office did not answer a question from CNN on whether he had now read it. It's an example of what the Prime Minister's critics say is his aversion to detail.\u00a0The Johnson government has long emphasized learning to live with Covid-19, simply accepting a certain level of circulation in the community. Had he taken the winter report's warning seriously, however, he may have understood the additional threat of a new variant.The report, along with several others from medical experts, also raised concerns about the country's test, trace and isolate system. Testing has improved dramatically, but tracing and isolating hasn't. Anecdotal evidence is growing that an app designed to aid the process is largely inactive.\u00a0The Department of Health told CNN that the app had been downloaded more than 21 million times and was still a key tool in helping break chains of transmission. A student takes a swab for a Covid-19 test at the University of Hull in northern England on November 30, 2020.But compliance is a major issue. In an ongoing survey of people's behavior and feelings around Covid-19 in the UK by the University College London, 38% of respondents said they were not isolating after developing symptoms for the full recommended 10-day period. Some 13% said they were not isolating at all. And 75% of adults over the age of 60 who reported experiencing symptoms at least once said they had never bothered requesting a test.The study's lead author, Dr Daisy Fancour, said\u00a0in a statement\u00a0the number of respondents not isolating was \"deeply concerning.\"\u00a0The study also finds a correlation between isolation compliance and income level. This suggests that many people breaking rules on isolation are doing so because of financial pressures.\u00a0\"The increased adherence to self-isolation rules among those with a higher household income suggests that many of those not isolating are breaking guidelines due to financial concerns, and more support needs to be put in place to allow people to self-isolate without fear of losing out financially,\"\u00a0Fancour said.\u00a0'Too little, too late'After the hardship of the first wave, it's difficult to comprehend why the government hasn't adopted the models seen in countries\u00a0that have been more successful in their responses, particularly in terms of border controls.\u00a0UK Home Secretary Priti Patel admitted to a group of Conservative Party supporters that the government should have closed borders in March, according to a video published by the pro-Conservative website Guido Fawkes. She claimed that she had supported the idea at the time.Passengers queue at a check-in desk at Heathrow Airport in London on December 21.The UK may have finally hardened its border, but it's easy to see how more cases could slip through the net. Most of the country now requires people crossing its borders to self-isolate for 10 days, but it has no robust mechanism to ensure people are complying.\u00a0In Canada, arrivals isolate at home, but police check in with them. Rule-breakers face up to six months in jail. Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore use electronic wristbands to ensure people stay home during quarantine periods. They are controversial from a privacy perspective, but they broadly work.And in Australia, arrivals are forced to stay for two weeks in strict government-monitored \"quarantine hotels.\" Arrivals have to pay for their own quarantine, charged at a rate of around $3,000 ($2,3000) for one adult in most states. It's a measure Johnson's government is only now considering. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, chastized Johnson in a scathing speech earlier this month, saying his indecision was costing lives. England considers putting Covid patients in hotels, as study reveals deep trauma among ICU workers\"Every time there's a big decision to make, Boris Johnson gets there too late,\" he said. \"The government says it's trying to balance the health crisis with the economic crisis. Yet we ended 2020 with one of the worst death tolls in Europe and the deepest recession of any major economy. That's not bad luck. That wasn't inevitable. It's the consequence of the PM's repeated delay and incompetence.\"Enforcing the kind of border controls seen in Australia wouldn't be hard -- when you take out Northern Ireland, the UK is essentially an island around the size of the state of Kansas. The export of the UK variant to 60 countries demonstrates how porous the UK's border has been.Australia, a country of 25 million people, has reported just over 900 deaths. It has been able to keep the virus at bay with its quarantine hotels in conjunction with swift local lockdowns, granular data and transparency that has won the public's trust, according to a report by consulting firm McKinsey.The country is now working on its economy's recovery as the UK struggles just to keep its own open.\u00a0When asked by a reporter whether he could have done more to prevent deaths, Johnson said he took full responsibility for his government's response but made no admissions of any missteps.\"We did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life in this country as a result of the pandemic, and I'm deeply sorry for every life lost.\"The threat of vaccine complacencyJohnson also sought on Tuesday to focus on the UK's success with its vaccine program. The UK was the first country to begin vaccinating people with a fully vetted and authorized Covid-19 shot, and to date it has given at least 6.8 million people the first of two doses.\u00a0The prospect of success here could offer Johnson the political get-out-of-jail card he sorely needs.A member of the public is inoculated at a temporary vaccination center in Sheffield, northern England, on January 23.But for the vaccine rollout to be a success, Johnson's government will need to smooth out its distribution, which some medical service providers say has been haphazard to date, though it is early days.\"There are clearly issues around supply,\" said Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents providers of the government-funded National Health Service. But he is not aware of whether the problem is one of supply or of distribution.The Department of Health and Social Care declined to tell CNN how many vaccine doses the country had in stock, saying it was now part of the country's critical infrastructure, citing \"security reasons\" for withholding details on supplies. But it said that the country's \"vaccine supply and scheduled deliveries will fully support\" the country's program, including the immunization of four key groups by February 15. \"The UK has already vaccinated more people than any other country in Europe, and we are mobilizing the government, NHS and our armed forces as part of a massive national effort to lead us out of this crisis,\" it said. Covid-19 vaccines are given with organ music at UK's historic Salisbury Cathedral Supply concerns are compounded by the pressure to administer a large number of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fast. Rigid temperature requirements mean doses that are refrigerated need to be used in five days. With a box typically containing 1,000 doses, surgeries and vaccine centers have to administer 200 shots a day to ensure no doses in a box go to waste.\u00a0\u00a0Mortimer said the vaccine program was \"truly impressive\" in scale and had given worn-out NHS workers a huge boost in morale, but he emphasized the urgent need to improve distribution.\u00a0Like many health experts, he warns against the UK becoming too reliant on the vaccine as a silver bullet.\u00a0Improving other measures -- especially the test, trace and isolate system -- is crucial to bringing infection numbers down until there is a high level of immunity in the country, which may not be until the end of the year, Mortimer explained.\u00a0\"We need to know that as the vaccine is rolled out, and as it takes time for the vaccine to gain efficacy, that those elements of tracing and isolating are robust, and are robust for the longer term. It's probably too early to say we have full confidence in that, but it's really important the government gets that right,\" he said.\u00a0\"The sad reality of this last 10 months is that NHS organizations have seen this virus do real harm to their communities. We can see this in a really depressing death toll, but we can also see it in the longer-term impact the virus having on people's health.\"",

But when that dream materialized at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) earlier this month, the experience, he says, was belittling.A well-traveled sports fan, Kumar has attended Cricket World Cup games in India, Australia and Sri Lanka and has also supported Nigeria, the country where he grew up, at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa. \"Nowhere did I ever experience any form of racism in all my sporting experiences attending these events,\" Kumar tells CNN Sport. \"The Sydney Test day three is when I really got to see the ugly side.\" In the stands, Kumar says he heard chants of \"curry munchers\" directed at India's players and fans, while also being told to \"stop waving (his) fking flag\" and to \"shut the fk up and sit down.\"Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and features\"To me, it is hard to believe that the staff or security at the SCG were not able to hear this ... it's baffling, it's shocking that no one took action on day three (about) the crowd behavior,\" says Kumar.Krishna Kumar at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.On the fourth day of the Test, which Kumar did not attend, six people were ejected after allegations of racist abuse halted play. This came a day after Indian bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj complained of hearing racist slurs while fielding near the boundary rope. Cricket Australia (CA) confirmed on January 27 that members of the Indian team were subjected to racial abuse following an investigation, but said the spectators who were questioned and removed from the ground on the fourth day did not engage in racist behavior.\"CA's own investigation into the matter remains open, with CCTV footage, ticketing data and interviews with spectators still being analyzed in an attempt to locate those responsible,\" said Sean Carroll, CA's Head of Integrity and Security. \"Spectators who are found to have breached CA's anti-harassment code face lengthy bans, further sanctions and referral to NSW Police.\"CA's investigation concluded that the spectators filmed and/or photographed by media in the Brewongle Stand concourse at the conclusion of the 86th over on day four of the Test did not engage in racist behavior.\"JUST WATCHEDMichael Holding: 'People need to understand about the dehumanisation of the Black race'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMichael Holding: 'People need to understand about the dehumanisation of the Black race' 03:11In a statement sent to CNN on January 27, a NSW Police spokesperson said a number of men were spoken with following the incident on the fourth day of the Test. \"Police have continued inquiries, speaking with several people allegedly involved as well as a number of witnesses who were present in the area at the time,\" said the spokesperson. \"No evidence to support any prosecution for any offense has been located; as such the police investigation has been finalized. \"However, should anyone possess information which would support any such allegation, that should be brought to the attention of police.\"After the third day, Kumar says he wasn't surprised to discover the Indian team had reported hearing racial abuse\"When I reached home and I heard that the Indian management had complained about racial slurs and abuse at Siraj as well as Bumrah, I didn't bat an eyelid because it was going on the whole day,\" he says.'Proper frisking'Determined not to let his experience keep him away from the game, Kumar, whose wife and two sons are Australian, returned to the ground on the fifth day armed with four banners that read: \"Rivalry is good, racism is not,\" \"No racism mate,\" \"Brown inclusion matters #BIM\" and \"Cricket Australia -- more diversity please.\"Fans ejected from Sydney Test as cricket launches probe into alleged racist abuseHowever, as stadium security staff inspected the banners at the gate, Kumar was informed that one of them was too big to take in. He asked to speak to a supervisor about taking another banner in, at which point he says he was told by a member of staff that \"if you want to address this matter, go back to where you came from.\"Furthermore, Kumar alleges he overheard the same individual telling security staff to give him \"a proper frisking\" after he returned from putting the banners back in his car.\"A normal frisking of a bag takes 10-15 seconds. Mine went on for two-and-a-half minutes, unnecessarily,\" says Kumar, adding that his metal detector check \"went for a minute -- from head to toe.\"Once inside the ground, Kumar says he was subjected to what he felt was stricter security presence. \"There was no security in front of me (but then) they changed the formation ... I had about 10 to 15, 16 (sets of) eyes at me, which I thought was totally unnecessary ... the entire day I was profiled.\"Kumar says he was racially profiled by staff at the SCG. Kumar also says he has a 65-second video showing the same security guard who confronted him about the banners at the gate \"walking around the ground and picking on only Indian fans and pestering them.\"In a statement sent to CNN, Venues NSW, the owner, coordinator and promoter of the SCG, said: \"Venues NSW is aware of the matter and has met with the complainant. \"We are investigating the complainant's allegations, and we'll make no further comment until our investigation is complete.\" Kumar also said that he had met with officials at the SCG last week to assist with the investigation.'You can face racism with a chilled glass of beer'In response to the abuse he said he encountered on day three, Kumar chose to approach one of the individuals engaging in chants of \"curry munchers\" -- who had also shouted at him about his flag usage -- with a peace offering. \"I thought, I'm going to buy him a chilled glass of beer,\" says Kumar. \"I got up and I went down and I got two glasses of beer.\"Two or three overs later, he bought two beers, one for me and one for him. We took a picture together, and that was the end of the racial slur ... we were all cheering for good cricket.\"It's not necessary that you have to tackle racism with anger or frustration all the time. You can face racism with a chilled glass of beer and some friendship.\"India achieves stunning Test victory over Australia with record-breaking run chaseKumar adds that it has been an \"emotional rollercoaster\" since he decided to speak publicly about the racism he says he experienced at the SCG. He adds that he would \"definitely think twice\" before taking his sons to a game. \"There is so much hate right now,\" he says.\"And sometimes we may need to pause and think: 'Can you have some more love? Can we have some more tolerance? Can we have some more empathy?'\" In response to the Indian team's allegations of racial abuse during the Sydney Test, Carroll said on January 10: \"The abuse of cricketers by crowd members is not acceptable. \"We thank the Indian team for their vigilance in reporting (the) incident, which we are now in the process of investigating ... It is most regrettable that an otherwise excellent Test match contested in tremendous spirit by two friendly rivals has been tarnished by the actions of a small number of spectators.\" On the field, India's campaign in Australia ended happily. A record-breaking run chase at the Gabba -- Australia's first defeat at the Brisbane ground since 1988 -- saw the series draw to a thrilling conclusion with a 2-1 victory for the touring side.",

Already delayed by three weeks, the season's first grand slam starts on February 8, though 72 players have been confined to their hotel rooms amid a number of positive tests on their flights into Australia. Those players not in quarantine are allowed to practice for up to five hours a day.That's led to a handful of players expressing their frustration at the difference in preparation that competitors are experiencing ahead of the tournamentHowever, Australian Kyrgios, who has seemingly reinvented himself after a number of run-ins with tennis authorities in recent years, says conditions for these players are still \"pretty good.\" \"Health and safety always come first in my eyes,\" Kyrgios told CNN Sport's Patrick Snell. \"At the end of the day, it is only a tennis tournament that we're playing and I don't think it should override health protocols and putting other people at risk.Read More\"[The players] knew when they got here what the restrictions were going to be [...] so there is no real complaining in my opinion.

'As a country, we've come together'Whilst cases continue to rise across the world, Australia managed to keep on top of the virus after implementing a number of restrictions last year. Melbourne, the second-most populous city in Australia, was under a hard lockdown for 111 days with many unable to leave their homes for extended periods of time. Kyrgios does not want to see that hard work go to waste.Australian Open organizers have worked with local authorities to ensure a strict bubble around those participating in next month's event and have made no apology for the restrictions put in place. They have also scheduled a new warm-up tournament for players who have been unable to train during quarantine.\"I think, as a nation, Australia has dealt with the pandemic really, really well. As a country, we've come together and we've worked well,\" added Kyrgios, who missed last year's US Open amid Covid-19 fears.  \"In Melbourne, with obviously the bubble, they've done an incredible job there. The authorities aren't letting up and [are] making sure everyone is sticking by the rules. \"I actually feel quite safe.

A host of stars, including Djokovic himself, tested positive for Covid-19 after competing in the tournament, which attracted large crowds and had limited social distancing in place.Kyrgios was critical of the event at the time and says it's important he spoke out, especially when it comes to someone with the stature of Djokovic, who subsequently apologized for hosting the Adria Tour event last year.Australian Open organizers schedule new warm-up event to benefit quarantining players\"I think it's very important, especially one of the leaders of our sport. He's technically our LeBron James,\" said the 25-year-old Kyrgios, comparing Djokovic to the NBA great.\"He has to set an example for all tennis players out there and set an example for tennis,\" added Kyrgios. \"I think when he was doing some of the things that he was doing during the global pandemic, it just wasn't the right time. \"I know everyone makes mistakes. Even some of us go off track sometimes but I think we need to hold each other accountable. \"I'm not doing any of this stuff for media attention, these are the morals that I've grown up with. I was just trying to do my part.\"Djokovic, head of the Professional Tennis Players' Association, recently sent a list of proposals to Craig Tiley, the CEO of Tennis Australia, which would have loosened the restrictions on quarantining players ahead of the year's first grand slam. It was a move that provoked criticism, with Kyrgios calling the Serbian a \"tool\" on Twitter. Djokovic says his \"good\" intentions were \"misconstrued\" by the media.\"I use my position of privilege to be of service as much as I can where and when needed,\" Djokovic wrote. \"There were a few suggestions and ideas that I gathered from other players from our chat group and there was no harm intended to try and help.\"Rising star Paula Badosa announced that she has tested positive for Covid-19 last week -- the first known Australian Open player to contract the virus.On Monday, the Australian government suspended quarantine-free travel for New Zealanders arriving in Australia for a minimum of 72 hours, after a South African variant of Covid-19 was detected in a woman after 14 days of quarantine in New Zealand.",

The remains of numerous people were unearthed on the site of the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist.The team from the University of Cambridge examined bones from a parish graveyard for working people, a charitable hospital where the ill and destitute were laid to rest, and a friary for the wealthy, detailing every break and fracture to create a barometer of social inequality.X-ray analysis of the bones revealed varying levels of hardship -- accident, occupational injury or violence -- across the social spectrum. Of the three sites, remains excavated at the Hospital of St. John the Evangelist -- a 12th-century house for the needy -- contained the fewest fractures. Many residents had skeletal evidence of chronic illnesses like tuberculosis, and would have been unable to work.X-rays show butterfly fractures to both femurs of a man buried in the Augustinian friary.Read MoreSome 44% of working people had bone fractures, compared with 32% of those in the friary and 27% of those buried by the hospital. Meanwhile, bone fractures were more common in men (40%) than women (26%).\"By comparing the skeletal trauma of remains buried in various locations within a town like Cambridge, we can gauge the hazards of daily life experienced by different spheres of medieval society,\" said Jenna Dittmar, lead author of the study, published Monday in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology.Archaeologists discover Iron Age massacre, frozen in time\"We can see that ordinary working folk had a higher risk of injury compared to the friars and their benefactors or the more sheltered hospital inmates,\" Dittmar, a research associate at the University of Cambridge's McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said.\"These were people who spent their days working long hours doing heavy manual labour. In town, people worked in trades and crafts such as stonemasonry and blacksmithing, or as general labourers. Outside town, many spent dawn to dusk doing bone-crushing work in the fields or tending livestock,\" she added.Burial ground reveals Stone Age people wore clothing covered in elk teethThe team found that physical trauma was prevalent across the social spectrum -- but things were toughest for the poorest people, who bore the brunt of physical labor.Still, the most extreme injury was spotted on a friar, who had complete fractures halfway up both his femurs, while violence-related skeletal injuries were found in about 4% of the population.\"We can see this inequality recorded on the bones of medieval Cambridge residents. However, severe trauma was prevalent across the social spectrum. Life was toughest at the bottom -- but life was tough all over,\" Dittmar added.",

He survived but lost his governing majority in the Senate after his predecessor, Matteo Renzi, withdrew his small Italia Viva party from the ruling coalition, citing frustrations with the government's management of the pandemic and a recession. Conte handed his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, according to a presidential palace statement.The President will begin consultations with the leaders of the country's main political parties on Wednesday afternoon, the statement said. If Conte, who does not belong to a party, has enough support, Mattarella could ask him to form a new coalition.

Italy has been through several political crises since the end of World War II and has held many snap elections before sitting governments have finished their electoral terms. Conte is the country's 66th leader in 75 years. His coalition, which was formed in 2019, is led by the center-left Democratic Party (PD) and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). Despite vast political differences, the unusual alliance prevented snap elections which could have favored the far-right League Party.Conte has enjoyed high approval ratings after Italy imposed Europe's first lockdown last spring, in response to spiraling number of Covid-19 cases and deaths. He remains Italy's most popular politician with an approval rating above 50%, Reuters reports. CNN's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Rafael Nadal says he feels \"privileged\" to be playing in this year's Australian Open as he called on his fellow stars to have a \"wider perspective\" on the mandatory quarantine period ahead of the tournament.The Spaniard, like every competitor from overseas, is having to isolate with his support team for two weeks after arriving in Australia, with practice time limited to only a few hours a day. He's doing so in Adelaide, with a number of other high-profile stars including Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic. However, following a number of positive Covid-19 tests on chartered flights into Melbourne, Nadal's experience has been different from the 72 players not allowed to leave their hotel rooms for the duration of the isolation in the city which will host the first grand slam of the season.A number of competitors in Melbourne under strict quarantine have complained about their situation and lack of practice time ahead of the tournament. It has also raised questions among some as to whether those in Adelaide are getting preferential treatment. Whilst Nadal appreciates the situation is far from ideal, especially for those under tighter restrictions in Melbourne, he urged players to have a \"wider perspective.\" Read More\"I feel very sorry for all of them but when we came here, we knew that the measures were going to be strict because we knew that the country is doing great with the pandemic,\" Nadal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday\"It's normal to complain [...] but on the other hand you see how many are dying around the world. You see how many people are losing their father, their mum, without having the chance to say goodbye. \"It's a real thing, not a philosophical thing, that's real life. That's what's happening in my country. Close people to me are suffering this situation.\"Australia has recorded 28,777 Covid-19 cases to date, with 909 virus related deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University.Meanwhile, Spain has had 2,593,382 confirmed cases with 56,208 deaths.

'Privileged'Australia has managed to keep levels of the virus relatively low after implementing a number of strict lockdowns last year, allowing much of the general public to be living without harsh restrictions.Tennis Australia has been unapologetic about the strict bubble put in place around players and Nadal credits the organizers for making the event possible as he reminded players to appreciate the sacrifices the local community took last year. Melbourne was under a hard lockdown for 111 days with many unable to leave their homes for extended periods of time.\"It's a different situation than usual, it's much more sad for everyone,\" Nadal added. \"But at least we're here, we're going to have a chance to play here. The world is suffering in general, so we can't complain.\" \"I feel that we are privileged people today, having the chance to keep doing our jobs.\"READ: Australian Open tennis stars urged not to feed mice in hotel roomsNadal says his rivarly with Federer has helped him become a better player. On breaking all-time recordOrganizers have ensured all players will have the chance to play in warm-up tournaments ahead of the Australian Open, which could prove to be a momentous occasion for Nadal. The 34-year-old sits level with Roger Federer on 20 major titles, needing just one more to break the all-time record.Federer withdrew from this year's Australian Open last month -- the Swiss has not played in a tournament since reaching the semifinals at the 2020 edition, after getting arthroscopic surgery in his right knee.But Nadal says he's not obsessed about passing Federer nor by being the best.\"I did much more than what I ever dreamed in my tennis career,\" said Nadal. \"It would be amazing for me to win one more.\"Nick Kyrgios feels 'safe' ahead of the Australian Open as he credits the country for its Covid-19 response \"But I know that will not be the key for my happiness in the future. It's not extra pressure and it's not an obsession. \"I keep going, doing it my way. If it happens, fantastic, but if not, I'm more than happy about everything that happened to me.\"  Despite their ferocious rivalry on court, Nadal says he has nothing but respect for his close friend Federer and it appears the feeling is mutual. After watching Nadal beat Djokovic in last year's French Open final, the Swiss tweeted: \"It is a true honor for me to congratulate him on his 20th grand slam victory. It is especially amazing that he has now won Roland Garros an incredible 13 times, which is one of the greatest achievements in sport.\"Nadal, who has been a major part of the recent golden age of men's tennis, says competition with Federer, and later with Djokovic, has kept him motivated through the many years on tour. \"I think we always had a good relationship, a lot of respect. We did beautiful things together and important things for our sport,\" he said. \"We push each other to be better.\"To have somebody in front of you that's doing a lot of things better than you, it gives you a clear way about what you need to improve to achieve your goals.\" READ: Badosa becomes first Australian Open tennis player to reveal positive Covid-19 testJUST WATCHEDRafael Nadal: Story of a tennis legendReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRafael Nadal: Story of a tennis legend 02:08Life after tennisNadal, who married his long-term girlfriend Mery Perello in 2019, says he has no plans to retire soon but is not worried about life after his playing career is over.

He's also keen to continue using his platform for good, especially in a time with so much grief and division. Last year saw an emergence of high-profile athletes using their voices to call for societal change and Nadal is aware of his responsibility as one of the most famous tennis players in the world. \"For us, in my personal opinion, it's mandatory to be a positive example for society,\" he said.\"It's important to send the right messages to the world and especially to the young people.\"The Australian Open is due to begin on February 8 after being delayed for three weeks.",

She is then shown being escorted to a police van. She was released from detention later on Saturday, according to a tweet from Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.Navalny releases investigation into 'Putin palace'The demonstration in Moscow was one of dozens of opposition rallies held in defiance of the authorities across Russia on Saturday. According to OVD-Info, an independent site that monitors arrests, more than 2,100 people were detained during various protests in nearly 100 cities. Navalny himself is currently held in pre-trial custody and the protesters were demanding his release. He was detained at a Moscow airport late Sunday, just moments after arriving from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from Novichok poisoning he blamed on the Russian government. The Kremlin repeatedly denied any involvement.The demonstrations kicked off in Russia's far east city of Vladivostok and spread to the west as the day progressed. Navalny's supporters said Friday they were planning protest across 90 cities and videos and photos posted on social media showed crowds of people gathered in a number of cities across the country.Read MoreNavalny's wife said she was arrested, and posted a photo of herself in a police car on Instagram.One video showed a small protest in the city of Yakutsk, where temperatures dropped to -53 degrees Celsius (- 63 Fahrenheit) on Saturday.Moscow and St. Petersburg saw some of the biggest crowds. Thousands of people gathered at Pushkin square in central Moscow in the early afternoon, carrying banners and chanting \"Putin is a thief\" and \"One for all and all for one!\" Most wore face masks, because of the coronavirus epidemic. They were met by riot police, who were trying to push them away using batons. A loud message, asking people to leave, was playing on repeat. \"Dear citizens, this event is illegal. We do our best to ensure your safety. Be vigilant and, if possible, leave the illegal event.\" The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs said about 4,000 people gathered for a protest in Moscow. The statement did not make any reference to Navalny and was posted about 40 minutes before the rally was set to begin.Scores of protesters were arrested even before the protest officially started. By the end of the day, more than 500 had been detained in Moscow alone, according to OVD-Info.One of the protesters attending the Moscow rally, Kirill, said he was protesting because \"you can't win a fight without fighting.\" Speaking to CNN at the demonstration, the 20-year old said: \"I'm not proud of my country, I don't want my government to poison people and put them in prison. I want more freedom. I want proper elections and normal government so I'm trying to stand up for my freedom here.\"A number of people were detained during the protest in Moscow. Yulia Navalnaya joined the protest in Moscow, sharing a photo of herself at the rally on Instagram. A caption read \"So happy you are here. Thank you!\" Less than 30 minutes later, Navalnaya shared another photo of herself in what she says is a police car.Navalny's mother, Lyudmila Ivanovna Navalnaya, also attended the rally in Moscow.The demonstrations have not received an official government permit and the authorities have warned people not to attend them. Several allies of Navalny have been detained this week for inciting the protests, including his spokesperson Kira Yarmysh, Anti-Corruption Foundation investigator Georgy Alburov and opposition activist Lyubov Sobol.Supporters of Navalny take part in a rally in support of him in Yekaterinburg, Russia.The coordinator of Navalny's Moscow office, Oleg Stepanov, was detained on Saturday, according to a tweet from Navalny's Moscow team. The Russian Ministry of Foreign affairs has accused the United States of encouraging the protests after the US Embassy in Russia posted an alert on its website advising US citizens to avoid the demonstrations. Why Putin wants to keep Navalny locked upIn a tweet posted on Saturday, the ministry said that posting information about the rallies was \"in line with Washington's provocative policy of encouraging protests in countries whose governments are seen by US as undesirable.\"Under Russian law, an official appeal for approval of a protest has to be made to local authorities at least 10 days before the event. Navalny was only arrested less than a week ago, so the organizers had insufficient time to launch an appeal. Russian internet regulator said Thursday it was planning to fine major social networks, including Twitter, Facebook and TikTok, for \"spreading information prohibited by law and aimed at attracting minors to participate in unauthorized mass public events.\"Demonstrators clash with riot police during a rally in Vladivostok on January 23, 2021.The spokesperson for the US embassy in Moscow, Rebecca Ross, accused the Russian authorities of suppressing the right to peaceful political assembly and freedom of speech. \"This continues years of Russia tightening restrictions, repressive actions against civil society, independent media, political opposition,\" she said in a statement on Twitter. The European Union High Representative Josep Borrell condemned the \"widespread detentions, disproportionate use of force\" by Russian authorities in Saturday's protests and said he would discuss the \"next steps\" with EU foreign ministers on Monday.The UK Foreign Office said in a statement on Saturday it was \"deeply concerned\" by the detention of protesters. \"We urge the Russian government to respect and comply with its international commitments on human rights, and release citizens detained during peaceful demonstrations,\" the statement said.CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow and Martin Goillandeau and Zahid Mahmood in London contributed to this report.",

The real toll is likely much higherThe total number of people in the country who have died within 28 days of a positive test now stands at 95,981. Vallance said Friday that there was \"increasing evidence\" that the existing Covid-19 vaccines would work against the UK strain but sounded a note of caution about the variants detected in Brazil and South Africa.\"We are more concerned that they have certain features which means they might be less susceptible to vaccines,\" he said, though he added that researchers needed \"more clinical information\" about the variants.Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said Friday that there were \"definite signs of improvement\" in both the number of people infected with coronavirus in England and in hospital admission data.The number of new Covid-19 infections registered in the UK over the last 24 hours is also up on Thursday's figure. A total of 40,261 additional cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases recorded in the UK since the pandemic began to 3,583,907. Public Health England has continued to call for citizens to adhere to government guidance, warning once again on Friday that \"not everyone with coronavirus shows symptoms\" and urging for people to stay at home.The UK remains under a strict lockdown.",

The organizer faces a \u00a310,000 ($13,700) fine for breaking England's coronavirus lockdown, according to police.Officers responded to reports of a large gathering at a school in north London on Thursday evening, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement Friday. When they entered the facility in Stamford Hill, the statement said, they found hundreds of people packed together in breach of Covid-19 regulations.Wedding ceremonies are only allowed to take place with up to six people present, according to the English government guidelines, and wedding receptions are banned under the ongoing national lockdown.\"This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law, which is very clearly in place to save lives and protect the NHS,\" Detective Chief Superintendent Marcus Barnett said in the statement.

The school didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment, but the BBC reported the school said its facilities had been leased out.A spokesman for the school told the BBC: \"We had no knowledge that the wedding was taking place.\"He added: \"We are absolutely horrified about last night's event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\" Its former principal, Rabbi Avrohom Pinter, died in April last year after contracting coronavirus.London's ultra-Orthodox Jews find surprising new homeIn addition to fining the event's organizer, police issued \u00a3200 ($274) fines to five other attendees.\"I am deeply disappointed that events of this nature are still happening in Stamford Hill, despite the very grave pandemic situation we find ourselves in, and the number of lives that have already been lost in the Charedi community and across the borough,\" Glanville said in the statement. \"We will be meeting with the Rabbinate and our community partners over the coming days to see how we can prevent further incidents of this nature.\"Stamford Hill is home to a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, some of whose members have been criticized for flouting social distancing rules.Community leaders had expressed disappointment upon hearing earlier reports which suggested that 400 people were in attendance. The Metropolitan Police said on Friday afternoon that though \"initial calls suggested some 400 people had attended the wedding, it is now believed that approximately 150 people were in attendance.\"Rabbi Herschel Gluck, president of the Stamford Hill Shomrim civilian volunteer patrols, called for people to follow the rules.Why some ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities defy social distancing\"This is a time for unity, people should try to think of others and keep each other safe,\" he told CNN by phone on Friday.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said in a tweet that the wedding is \"a most shameful desecration of all that we hold dear.\"\"At a time when we are all making such great sacrifices, it amounts to a brazen abrogation of the responsibility to protect life & such illegal behaviour is abhorred by the overwhelming majority of the Jewish community,\" he added.The Board of Deputies of British Jews also said they \"unreservedly condemn this flagrant and disgraceful breach of Covid-19 regulations, which goes against Jewish teaching that preserving life is of the highest value.\"\"We are horrified by the news,\" they added.On Thursday, British Home Secretary Priti Patel announced \u00a3800 ($1,100) fines to deal with people who continue to flout coronavirus restrictions by attending events and gatherings.\"The science is clear: Such irresponsible behavior poses a significant threat to public health,\" Patel said during a Downing Street briefing.\"Not only to those in attendance but to our wonderful police officers who attend these events to shut them down,\" she added. \"As this latest measure demonstrates, we will not stand by while a small number of individuals put others at risk.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Liverpool lost its first Premier League home game in almost four years as relegation-threatened Burnley pulled off a stunning upset to end Jurgen Klopp's 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield.Ashley Barnes' penalty six minutes from time secured a famous win -- Burnley's first at Anfield in 46 years -- and piled yet more pressure on an out of sorts Liverpool side that has now failed to score a goal in the league for seven hours and 18 minutes.It's the first time in 21 years that Liverpool has failed to find the net in four consecutive Premier League games, with the Reds now in fourth place and six points adrift of league leader Manchester United.The pressure also appears to be getting to Klopp, who was visibly furious during an exchange with Burnley manager Sean Dyche in the tunnel at the end of the first half.\"The game was impossible to lose, but we did,\" Klopp told Sky Sports after the game. \"That's my fault because it's my job to make sure the boys have the right feelings, the right amount of confidence and make the right decisions.Read MoreLiverpool suffered its first home defeat since April 2017.\"That obviously didn't work out because we had the ball a lot, created some situations that were OK, but in the final moment our decision-making is not right at the moment, and that's the problem.\"It's always my fault, the things that don't work are my fault, the things that do work are down to the players. Credit to the players because it's what they make of it.\"Interestingly, Burnley was the only side to manage a single point at Anfield last season during Liverpool's title-winning romp. However, Dyche's side has struggled this season and has so far been mired in a relegation battle.But in Thursday's victory, Burnley was back to its gritty and defensive best, limiting Liverpool to not even a handful of chances over the course of the game. An early error from Ben Mee gifted Divock Origi with a glorious chance to give Liverpool the lead at the end of the first half, but the Belgian's shot struck the underside of the crossbar.There were few chances of note in the second half, with Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope confidently saving any effort that did squeeze through a resolute back line.In the end, it was a clumsy challenge from goalkeeper Alisson on Barnes that gifted the English forward with the chance to earn all three points from the penalty spot and inflict Liverpool's first home defeat since a loss to Crystal Palace in April 2017.Ashley Barnes' late penalty secured three crucial points for Burnley.The victory will have certainly eased those relegation fears, with Burnley climbing above Brighton into 16th and putting seven points between itself and the relegation zone.\"I think we did the basics very well,\" Dyche told Sky Sports after the match. \"The structure of the side, shape of the side, individual diligence. Players doing their jobs when they had to. We still needed a bit of luck; Nick Pope has made a good save to his left in the second half.\"You are never comfortable, but I have been in the game a long time and you can see the patterns of a game sometimes. The only worry was if a block landed to one of their players or something goes against you. It didn't feel like that type of a game against a top side.\"It was the will and desire from the defenders and the goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet and the work rate of the two forwards as well. You cannot just defend from the back four, you have to defend from the whole side, and I think everyone did that well.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Confronting new, more transmissible variants of the coronavirus and a winter spike in infections, a number of European countries are beginning to make medical-grade face masks mandatory in the hope that they can slow the spread of the disease.The French government has now mandated that citizens wear single-use surgical FFP1 masks, more protective FFP2 filtering facepiece respirators or fabric masks which meet the same \"Category 1\" specifications -- blocking more than 90% of particles -- in all public places. In layman's terms, homemade masks will no longer cut it.  It follows a decision by the German government on Tuesday requiring all people to wear either FFP1 or FFP2 masks while on public transport, in workplaces and in shops. The move came after the German state of Bavaria introduced an even more stringent measure: Enforcing surgical grade N95 respirators, which filter 95% of air particles, in stores and on public transport. Austria will introduce its own FFP2 mandate on public transport and in shops from January 25.German Chancellor Angela Merkel cited the spread of new coronavirus variants, which were first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, as the reason for stricter requirements. \"I urge people to take this seriously. Otherwise it is difficult to prevent a third wave,\" Merkel told journalists in Berlin on Thursday, adding that a video summit of European Union leaders would be focused squarely on ways to counter the spread of variants on the continent. Read MoreDuring the Thursday summit, EU leaders weighed tougher border restrictions to limit non-essential travel and agreed to a common framework for rapid testing, but mask-wearing was not discussed.The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) warned Thursday that new variants of the coronavirus could cause more hospitalizations and deaths across Europe, urging countries to start taking extra measures -- from physical distancing, to quarantining and contact tracing -- immediately. The ECDC currently recommends face masks in indoor and outdoor situations when physical distancing cannot be guaranteed, but does not specify what type of face covering should be used.London's ICU nurses detail 'diluted' care, depression and disaster during the UK's deadly second waveMeanwhile, in Britain, where a highly-contagious coronavirus mutation is driving a deadly third wave of the virus, medical-grade masks have not been mandated in public. Instead, face coverings are required on public transport, in shops and in other indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult.In the UK government's Covid guidance, scarves and bandanas are considered to be appropriate face coverings, despite evidence they do not effectively block respiratory droplets emitted by the wearer.Faced with more transmissible variants, some scientists say that the focus should be on limiting the amount of viral aerosol exposure as much as possible -- and recent studies suggest the best way to do that is through medical-grade masks, in addition to other public health measures.Unlike fabric and surgical masks, which protect other people from larger respiratory droplets emitted when speaking, coughing or sneezing -- in other words, outflowing air -- FFP masks protect the wearer by filtering both the outflow and inflow of air. They can also provide some level of protection against smaller droplets, or aerosols. When fitted correctly, FFP2 masks can filter at least 94% of particles.A sign mandating mask-wearing in the city of Fuerstenfeldbruck, southern Germany.A woman wearing an FFP2 face mask walks past a shuttered cafe in Berlin, Germany.And while the tight weave of surgical masks offer a high level of outflowing protection -- which is why they're used by medical professionals around patients -- cloth masks are more hit or miss. Their efficacy depends on the number of layers of fabric and the type of fabric used -- most don't have any sort of safety rating. Guidance on cloth masks, issued during the first wave of the pandemic when less was known about how Covid-19 could spread through aerosols and supplies of medical-grade masks were precarious, are now being reassessed. The new recommendations in Europe come after supplies of medical masks have increased, following initial fears there wouldn't be enough for frontline workers. But there are still questions over supply chain disruptions. Cloth masks are still considered to be better than wearing no mask at all, but France's health advisory council on Monday argued they may not offer sufficient protection against new variants.\"We are not questioning the masks used up to now ... but as we don't have any new weapons against the new strains, the only thing we can do is to improve the weapons we already have,\" Daniel Camus, a member of the council, told France's public broadcaster.There is some scientific evidence that medical-grade masks offer more protection and can help prevent the spread of the virus. People wearing face masks in Rennes, western France.A study published in the Lancet medical journal in June comparing transmission rates across 16 countries found that N95s and other respirator-type masks might give greater protection from viral transmission than surgical or multi-layered cotton masks.And another study released in August by Duke University, which compared the efficacy of 14 commonly available face coverings, found that the most effective was the fitted N95, followed by three-layer surgical masks. Neck fleeces, folded bandanas and knitted masks did not offer much protection, and in the case of the neck fleeces, also called gaiter masks, actually increased the transmission of respiratory droplets.Still, current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) states that medical or surgical masks should only be worn by healthcare workers, people with Covid-19 symptoms, those coming into contact with them, anyone aged 60 or over, as well as people with underlying medical conditions.The WHO recommends that the general population use fabric masks, ideally with three layers.But for European politicians scrambling to prevent a fresh surge of coronavirus cases from spiraling, the calculation is simple: If medical-grade masks will help stymie the spread of the virus, they should be enforced.\"We also want to make everyday life safer,\" Bavarian Prime Minister Markus S\u00f6der said last week, announcing the new mask rule.CNN's James Frater, Pierre Bairan, Claudia Otto and Inke Kappeler contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)We are all better after a decent night's sleep -- and insects are no different.But two new studies have found a commonly used pesticide is disrupting the sleep of bees and flies -- with big consequences for the important insects.In one study, researchers looked at the effect of pesticides on bumblebee behavior by giving the creatures nectar sugar laced with neonicotinoids -- one of the most commonly used pesticides -- and then tracking their movements in a foraging arena.The impact of the pesticide -- similar to the amount a bee would encounter in the wild -- was stark. \"It seems to disrupt the body clock in foraging bumblebees -- they forage much less, more of that foraging is happening at nighttime, and they are sleeping a lot more in the daytime. It's causing a mistiming of their normal behaviors,\" Kiah Tasman, teaching associate at the University of Bristol's School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, told CNN.Read MoreThis, she explained, could have serious implications: \"It's quite worrying because other studies and our studies show that the foraging motivation has decreased.\"2020 was the year of scary bugs, and 2021 will be even worseMany plants -- including the fruit and vegetables that we eat and feed to our livestock -- rely on pollinators, like bees, to reproduce. Almost 90% of wild plants and 75% of leading global crops depend on animal pollination, the World Wildlife Fund notes. Bees take on a big share of this workload: Pollinators, most often honey bees, are responsible for one in every three bites of food we take, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, and increase crop values in the US by more than $15 billion each year.But bees and other pollinators are under threat because of widespread pesticide use, habitat loss, the climate crisis and parasites, so much so that the odds of spotting the hardworking bumblebee in Europe and America are down by more than 30% since the last century.Tasman warned that bees are now \"quite sluggish and they're going out less often anyway.\"\"If the time where they are managing to go out and forage is at nighttime when flowers aren't available, that's going to hugely reduce how successful they are at collecting the food that the colony needs to grow and reproduce,\" Tasman, lead author of the studies, said.Pesticides damage the brains of baby bees, new research findsIt could also affect how well bees are able to care for their young, she said. Meanwhile, the same pesticides have already been found to damage the brains of baby bees. In a second study, published Thursday, the researchers focused their attention on flies -- again, exposing them to neonicotinoids, and then using infrared beams to monitor how this affected movement.  The results showed that the pesticide was working directly on the cells in the brain that run the body clock, which decide when sleep and activity happen in the day -- and confusing them.\"It looks like these pesticides freeze these cells in a daytime shape, so the body doesn't know if it's daytime or nighttime,\" Tasman said, adding that it is very likely that the same kind of mechanism happening in the flies is also happening in bees. Researchers say their studies can help us to further understand how these pesticides are affecting vulnerable insects.\"It also gives us hints on what we could investigate if we were to make more pest specific pesticides -- if we understand exactly how they are working in the insects, maybe we can make some that only work on pests,\" Tasman added.",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Even locked up in a detention center on the outskirts of Moscow, Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny continues to be a thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin's side.Late Tuesday, which marked the opposition leader's first day at the infamous Matrosskaya Tishina facility, his team dropped a colossal investigation into the President's wealth, offering Russians to take look into what they allege is \"Putin's palace\" on the Black Sea.Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) called the report their \"biggest investigation yet.\" It contains allegations of vast corruption schemes related to what they say is Putin's property estimated to be worth around $1.4 billion. CNN is not independently able to verify the FBK's claims. Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the Russian leader was linked to the estate on Tuesday.Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny to be held in custody for 30 days following his return to Russia \"They are repeating the old story. It was the year of 2017 or 2016, if I'm not mistaken, that the first time it was mentioned there should be the so-called palace of Putin in Gelendzhik. This is not true. There is no palace, he is not an owner of any palace,\" Peskov told CNN. Read More\"Those are all rumors and there were some disputes between the owners of those premises but they really have no connection with President Putin.\"The existence of the property was first reported over a decade ago when a businessman Sergey Kolesnikov published an open letter with various documents urging then-President Dmitry Medvedev to \"stop the corruption\" that funds the construction of the alleged palace.The 17,691-square-meter castle features 11 bedrooms according to plans obtained by FBK.But Navalny's new investigation, which he says he thought of while getting treated at the Berlin Charite clinic, purports to show the scale of the estate and expose dubious financial schemes behind the grand project. The report and an almost two-hour-long documentary film also offer a more comprehensive look inside the palace. FBK says a subcontractor involved in construction handed over detailed plans of the building along with itemized lists of purchased furniture and samples of floor patterns. The group then used these documents and photos obtained from construction workers to create 3D-models of the interiors.\"This is like a state within a state where one irremovable czar rules,\" Navalny says in the documentary. \"It is built in a way that no one can reach it by land, sea or air, thousands of people working there are banned from bringing even a simple cell phone with a camera... but we will take a look inside.\"According to the plans, the 17,691-square-meter castle features 11 bedrooms, several living rooms and dining halls, a private theater, a movie theater, a Las Vegas style casino, two spas and a hammam, a bakery, and a \"dirt room\" with an unknown purpose. The rooms, adorned with velvet and lush carpets, feature marble floors, columns, and intricate ceiling decorations made to resemble St. Petersburg royal palaces. The property on the Black Sea is estimated to be worth $1.4 billion, according to the FBK.A separate part of the report is dedicated to descriptions of staggeringly expensive furniture made to order by a luxury Italian brand, including a $56,000 table and a $27,000 sofa. Described on the FBK site as \"the most controversial room in Putin's palace,\" the plan also features a hookah lounge with what appears to be a dancer's pole. As the Navalny site sarcastically states: \"On the plan it is designated as a 'hookah room.' And all would be fine, but there is not a single window in that room, but for some reason there is a stage, a dressing room, spotlights, and something very similar to a pole drawn on the plan. We thought for a long time what it could be. Perhaps they make giant shawarmas there... Or it's a training ground for firefighters.\"Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation says the castle's costs have skyrocketed due to constant renovations, according to interviews with people who worked at the site. The house initially had critical issues with the ventilation system and humidity levels, which led to many rich interiors being destroyed due to mold, according to the FBK's probe.FBK says the property surrounding the palace itself is estimated to occupy 68 hectares but adds that the actual estate is likely about 100 times bigger, with a large adjacent plot of land that allegedly belongs to the Federal Security Service, or the FSB, as a buffer to the estate. According to the drone videos shot by FBK, the estate features a private hockey rink, personal church, amphitheater, and a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse. The territory is heavily guarded with multiple checkpoints leading up to it; the plot of land itself is listed as a no-fly zone, per FBK.According to drone videos shot by FBK, the estate features a private hockey rink, church, amphitheater, and a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse.The territory boasts sprawling vineyards where classical music is played around the clock, apparently to help the grapes mature, according to members of the vineyard association for the region who heard the music playing during a tour of the estate, the FBK says. Bathrooms at a processing facility in the vineyard are reportedly equipped with an $850 Italian toilet brush and a $1,250 toilet paper holder. Navalny claims that wine-making is Putin's \"very expensive hobby\" and the Russian President serves this wine to his friends: \"He drinks it with his friend from China, Xi Jinping, and, under the same chardonnay, discusses 'deeper integration' with [Belarusian President Alexander] Lukashenko,\" according to pictures of menus he says were served during official receptions.Navalny also claims to have uncovered a convoluted scheme to finance the property and other personal expenses of the President. The report claims that Putin, at the beginning of his presidency, struck a deal with Russian oligarchs and wealthy businessmen to \"donate\" some of their income to an investment firm. But 35% of those donations would then go to a special offshore Swiss bank account of a Belize-registered company, Navalny claims. Reuters previously reported on the financial web around the Black Sea property in 2014. Opinion: Why Putin wants to keep Navalny locked upNavalny, who was faced with the choice of fading into obscurity as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 or returning to Russia and being almost certainly jailed on arrival, chose the latter option. He was detained in a Moscow airport late Sunday moments after arriving from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from Novichok poisoning he blamed on the Russian government. The Kremlin repeatedly denied any involvement.The next morning Navalny faced an unexpected hearing where the judge ordered him to be placed in custody for 30 days. He now awaits trial to determine whether he violated the terms of his suspended sentence in a 2014 embezzlement case he says was politically motivated. Following the verdict on his detention, Navalny's team announced a nationwide demonstration this weekend, and the report is seen as a way to draw more Russians to the streets.The estate contains a 2,500-square-meter greenhouse according to drone videos shot by FBK.\"Most of all, I want that the same kind of anger that burns in me burns in the people who watch this video,\" Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh tweeted. \"Putin is robbing my country, imprisoning my friends, he is a murderer. And I want to fight back. Moscow, Pushkin Square... I'll be there. I hope to see you there too.\"In less than a day, the documentary has eclipsed 25 million views on YouTube and is looking to overtake the report into the wealth of Medvedev, and Navalny's investigations into his own poisoning.The documentary showing Medvedev's mansion, among other things, was viewed more than 37 million times and led to several mass protests across Russia. At the time the Kremlin called calls for protest illegal and Medvedev dismissed the report as \"nonsense.\" The demonstrations ended in mass detentions; in Moscow alone around 1,000 people were arrested.

        "content": "(CNN)Scientists have long wondered how butterflies fly -- compared with other flying animals, the creatures have unusually short, broad and large wings relative to their body size.Now, experts have found that the insects \"clap\" their wings together -- and their wings are perfectly evolved for better propulsion.Biologists from Sweden's Lund University set out to test a 50-year-old theory, that butterflies \"clap\" their wings together, pushing out the trapped air to create a jet and push the animal in the opposite direction. 'Critically endangered' monkey and armored slug among 503 new species named in 2020\"Butterflies look different from many other flying animals, compared to birds and bats. They have a very extreme wing shape -- very large, short but very broad wings compared to their little body,\" Per Henningsson, associate professor in biology at Lund University, told CNN. \"That is a bit of a puzzle, because that sort of wing is quite inefficient.\"       The biologists studied free-flying butterflies, and in their aerodynamic analysis, found the creatures' wings form a cupped shape during the upstroke and \"clap,\" thrusting the butterfly forward. Meanwhile, the downstroke helps with weight support.Read MoreThey also noticed that the butterfly wings were behaving in an unusual way -- instead of slamming together, as two flat surfaces, the wings bent to create a \"pocket shape,\" which would capture more air, and improve propulsion. \"When the wings go up during the upstroke, and they clap together at the end of the upstroke, we saw that they were not just two flat surfaces,\" Henningsson explained.A second monarch butterfly conservationist has been found dead in Mexico\"Instead they were bending, and due to their flexibility, (they were) forming a sort of pocket shape,\" he said, adding that the team thought that in doing so, butterflies captured more air between their wings, which improved the clap and boosted performance.The team tested their theory using a series of triangular robotic clappers, and found that flexible wings increased the  efficiency of the clap by 28% compared with rigid wingsExperts think the creatures may have evolved to favor this unusual wing shape in order to evade predators. \"This flexibility might be one of the reasons they have this unusual wing shape,\" Henningsson said. \"Butterflies take off very quickly -- they do this as a safety measure, to minimize risk of getting caught,\" he explained.The research was published Wednesday in the journal Interface.",

        "content": "Sydney  (CNN)The quarantine controversy over tennis' Australian Open has raised questions about whether large-scale international sporting events can take place in the middle of a pandemic and could offer a preview of the difficulties facing this summer's Tokyo Olympics.Players arriving in the Australian state of Victoria have been placed into a 14-day quarantine ahead of their grand slam matches. Most have been allotted five hours each day to go out and train in strict bio-secure bubbles, but 72 players have been unable to leave their hotel rooms and cannot practice, under strict quarantine rules after passengers on their flights tested positive for Covid-19.Some tennis stars have expressed anger and frustration at being kept cooped up ahead of the first grand slam of the tennis season. They include record eight-time Australian Open men's singles winner Novak Djokovic, who put forward a list of proposals that would loosen the restrictions on the quarantining stars, including moving players to houses with courts, better food, and reducing the number of days in isolation. In response, Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews said: \"People area free to provide lists of demands, but the answer is no.\"Athletes have also raised concerns over whether those who can go out and train would have an unfair advantage over their competitors who have to isolate.Read MoreCanadian player Vasek Pospisil was a passenger on one of the three flights into Melbourne that had a handful of positive Covid-19 tests from those on board, meaning he is barred from going out to train during quarantine.He told CNN that the level of risk of an entire group on a flight having to undergo strict quarantine wasn't properly communicated to the players ahead of time, a claim Tennis Australia refutes. \"All the players, we understood that if somebody tested positive that it would just be the group, like if somebody in your staff tested positive, then you would have to be quarantined; you wouldn't be able to practice. There wasn't any discussion about the whole plane going that way, so obviously it was a huge surprise to everybody,\" he said from his hotel room in Melbourne. But many Australians appear to have little sympathy for the athletes, many of whom have flown in from coronavirus hotspots to compete for a share of total prizes worth 71.5 million Australian dollars ($55.1 million).The Victoria state capital Melbourne, the second-most populous city in Australia, was under a hard lockdown for 111 days last year. Residents contended with a curfew, closures of businesses, bans on leaving their homes, online schooling and job losses. Some Melbourne residents expressed concerns about the impact on the community once the players have left post tournament. Many are worried restrictions could be reimposed if the virus -- particularly new, potentially more transmissible variants -- managed to get into the population because of the tournament. Serbia's Novak Djokovic stands on the balcony at his accommodation in Adelaide, Australia, on January 19, 2021. New cases linked to the tournamentOn Monday, Victoria reported four new Covid-19 cases, three of which are related to the Australian Open, according to the state government of Victoria. The number of people linked to the tournament that have  tested positive for the virus is now seven, after two cases were reclassified as \"shedding,\" rather than being actively infected. Among the new cases are two unnamed players and one non-playing participant. \"I think that the players are lacking perspective as they have been playing in countries where Covid is nuts,\" Melbourne resident and Grade 5 teacher Sarah Fuller told CNN. \"Melbourne, after being through so much does not want any more restrictions or hard lockdowns due to the virus getting out. So for me, it just demonstrates a lack of understanding of where they are in the world and that it's a privilege to be able to play the game they do as their job.\"Like many people across the world, Fuller and her husband Trevor have had to navigate the struggles of extra hours working from home and keeping her students engaged in online learning through the pandemic. With family in another state, and the death of a grandparent, Fuller said it has been \"exhausting.\"Fuller and her husband are avid tennis fans and usually buy tickets to the Australian Open. This year, the players, she said, are experiencing just a taste of the restrictions that herself and many others have lived under during the pandemic.Australian Open tennis stars get creative with practice while stuck in hotel quarantine\"Yes it's difficult, it's not ideal and not normal, but nothing is 'normal.' But it's about keeping the community safe and what we have been able to create is a relatively Covid-free Australia.\"Australia has managed to handle the pandemic better than many countries, in part thanks to quick action from the state governments. Greater Brisbane, for example, went into a three-day lockdown earlier this month after a case of the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom was discovered.According to the Victoria state government's website on Tuesday there are 34 active cases in the region, with four internationally acquired and in quarantine in the last 24 hours, with none acquired locally in that time period.Some have pointed to the unfairness of players being able to travel and train in Melbourne while residents in other states need to apply for a permit in order to cross the internal border to Victoria. Those people who have been to \"red zones\" over the past 14 days -- including Victoria residents -- cannot reenter the state. There are also calls to prioritize the more than 38,000 Australians who remain stuck overseas, unable to return in part due to limits on daily international arrivals. Seeing the number of players and officials chartering flights into the country is likely to fuel the anger and desperation of many Australians abroad who have been waiting for months to return, many with no jobs or housing and facing financial hardships.Path to Tokyo 2020 The controversy has exposed the difficulties of operating a large international tournament ensuring strict coronavirus rules are followed, while maintaining an even playing field for competitors. All eyes will be on the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, which despite being pushed back a year owing to the pandemic, has elected to keep the 2020 tag. The event will see athletes from all over the world descend on Japan this summer from July 23 to August 8, and the Paralympic Games from August 24 to September 5.Japan has signaled it is determined to go ahead with the Games. In a New Year's address to Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee staff, Chairman Yoshiro Mori said that preparations would proceed \"as planned.\"Covid-19 countermeasures include athletes being tested at least once every four days and traced throughout their stay and \"contact with athletes will be kept to a minimum,\" according to an interim report published on December 2. Japan expands state of emergency and bans entry of foreign nationals as coronavirus as infections climbDetails are scant but a scheme would allow athletes \"to engage in various activities including training and participating in competitions during the 14 day self-isolation period after arrival,\" the report said. But Olympic officials are facing difficult decisions due to rising Covid-19 cases in the country. A recent poll by Japanese public broadcaster NHK found that 77% of respondents felt the Games should be postponed again or completely canceled, with only 16% in favor of holding them this year.It comes as the capital Tokyo, along with major cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu, Tochigi and Fukuoka -- covering much of Japan's main island of Honshu -- have been placed under a coronavirus state of emergency. The total number of confirmed cases in Tokyo now stands at 86,674 and the city is suffering from a shortage of hospital beds for virus patients. The International Olympic Committee in December announced the opening and closing ceremonies will be pared-back in keeping with an \"overall simplification of the Games.\"Speaking to CNN last week, former top International Olympic Committee official Dick Pound said that it was unlikely the Games could be postponed again, and so any additional delay would likely mean their cancellation.\"The one-year postponement was a proposal by Japan, the Organizing Committee said 'look, we can hold this together for another year, but not further',\" he said. \"Postponing it for another year, for example, will come at a huge cost, which Japan may not be willing to incur. It will further complicate a crowded sports schedule ...you're going to have the World Cup and football going on, and at some point it's just there's just too much congestion in the overall system.\"A spokesperson for the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee said that they were \"aware of the situation\" at the Australian Open and were monitoring it, and other tournaments closely. \"Tournaments and games have been resumed in various competitions both in Japan and overseas, and the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee is learning a lot from these,\" the spokesperson said.

        "content": "(CNN)Although the freakish past 12 months has led to tragedy for many and huge disruption to the sporting calendar, golfer Tyrrell Hatton will look back on 2020 as a breakthrough year.He began it recovering from wrist surgery and sat 32nd in the world rankings, but by the end of the year he was in the top 10. \"2020 has been a very strange year and difficult for a lot of people,\" Hatton told CNN's Living Golf's Shane O'Donoghue. \"For me personally, 2020 on the golf course has been basically the best of my career so far. \"Tyrrell Hatton celebrates after winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill.After nearly a decade in the professional game -- the Englishman made his debut in August 2011 -- it was the need for surgery on a long-term injury and a subsequent spell on the sidelines that preceded his breakthrough period. Read More\"I fell over at the Masters in 2017,\" he remembers. \"I'd slipped on the pine straw. \"From that moment, it was an issue with my wrist, two and a half years in pain, several steroid injections to manage it. It got to the point where it's not sustainable to keep doing that. I had the operation and thankfully it helped. I've been pain free since.\"Initially Hatton was apprehensive after surgery, admitting he felt \"nervous about how I was going to recover.\"\"It was scary,\" he said. \"I think that's quite natural for anyone that has an operation. Thankfully it all worked out.\" READ: After 'life-changing' major win, Collin Morikawa says fame won't change himHatton looks to putt on the eighth green during the CJ Cup.'My time to win'Despite a layoff that was longer than he'd hoped for, the 29-year-old came flying back into action in 2020, securing a PGA Tour victory and becoming the first Englishman to win the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in March. In understated fashion, he reflects that this was \"obviously a very nice surprise.\"\"When you first start back, you're just hoping that you can play some decent golf and obviously you want to be in contention,\" he said. \"To be in contention that early back from surgery was great, and I was obviously really happy with how I managed myself. We had a great week and thankfully it was my time to win.\"Hatton tees off on the DP World Tour Championship.It was Hatton's time to win again in October at one of the European Tour's flagship events, the BMW Championship at Wentworth, where he finished four shots ahead of Victor Perez. The victory was an especially momentous occasion for Hatton, having attended the historic tournament as a child, and was crucial for his progression into the top 10 of the world rankings. \"I felt every bit of nerves that I'd expect to feel in years gone by when we've got the crowds,\" he said. \"It was definitely nice to have those feelings and to get over the line on Sunday when naturally you are a bit nervous coming down the back nine. It was a great win.\"To get inside the top 10; that was definitely a career goal. So to win Wentworth and break inside the top 10 in the world rankings in the same week was very special and a dream come true really.\"I always thought that Wentworth was ... if I could choose one event to win it would be that one. It made it a lot sweeter.\"Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videosIn the first round of the Masters at Augusta Hatton plays a shot out of a bunker. When his thoughts turn to 2021, Hatton explains that winning majors would be \"nice,\" making the Ryder Cup team is \"the main goal,\" and if the opportunity to play in the Olympics arose he \"would definitely go.\"However, with all those opportunities ahead, he is quick to point out: \"There are certainly no guarantees.\"\"You always have to just keep going and try your best.\"I will look back on this year with fond memories, but at the same time, I think we're all quite excited to see the back of 2020. Mixed emotions, but golfing terms, I'm happy.\"",

        "content": "London (CNN)Joe Biden was sworn in Wednesday as the 46th United States President, taking the reins of a country in crisis. But his task on the global stage will be daunting, too.  World leaders reacted to Biden's inauguration by offering congratulations, jockeying for position at the forefront of his foreign policy agenda, and in some cases pleading for the reversal of his predecessor's policies. Among most messages was a palpable sense of relief, as the international community embraced Biden's pledge to reenter a series of global pacts and organizations that President Donald Trump cut loose.Here's what leaders have said so far. EuropeRead More\"Once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday, leaving no uncertainty about her verdict on Trump's relationship with the bloc.\"This new dawn in America is the moment we've been waiting for so long. Europe is ready for a new start with our oldest and most trusted partner,\" she said in the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium.  Trump has trashed America's most important alliance. The rift with Europe could take decades to repairVon der Leyen said Biden's inauguration would \"be a message of healing for a deeply divided nation and it will be a message of hope for a world that is waiting for the US to be back in the circle of like-minded states.\"On Twitter, she added: \"The United States is back. And Europe stands ready. To reconnect with an old and trusted partner, to breathe new life into our cherished alliance.\"Biden has signaled a warmer partnership with Europe than Trump, who frequently criticized the EU on trade during his administration. His attacks on some European leaders led to frosty scenes at a number of summits. \"From our perspective, Trump saw Europe as an enemy,\" a senior European diplomat told CNN last week. \"The lasting impact of 'America First' is the US having fewer friends in Europe.\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel also offered her \"warmest congratulations,\" adding that she looks forward to a \"new chapter\" in Germany's relationship with the US, according to a tweet from her spokesman Steffen Seibert. And Germany's President expressed relief that Biden would be sworn in Wednesday, calling it \"a good day for democracy.\" \"In the United States, (democracy) held up against a lot of pressure,\" Frank Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. \"Despite internal hostility, America's institutions have proven strong -- election workers, governors, judiciary, and Congress. I am relieved that Joe Biden is sworn in as President today and coming into the White House. I know that this feeling is shared by many people in Germany.\"Steinmeier also warned against the populist brand of politics that Trump embraced. \"Despite all the joy we have about today, we must not forget that populism has seduced even the most powerful democracy in the world,\" he said. \"We must resolutely oppose polarization, protect and strengthen the public space of our democracies, and shape politics on the basis of reason and facts.\"French President Emmanuel Macron marked the day with a tweet welcoming the US back into the Paris climate agreement. \"We are together. We will be stronger to face the challenges of our time. Stronger to build our future. Stronger to protect our planet. Welcome back to the Paris Agreement,\" Macron said.Biden will sign a slate of executive actions in the Oval Office on Wednesday, including one to rejoin the Paris Agreement.ChinaHours before the inauguration, Beijing expressed hope that Biden would \"look at China rationally and objectively\" to repair \"serious damage\" in bilateral ties caused by the Trump presidency.\"In the past four years, the US administration has made fundamental mistakes in its strategic perception of China ... interfering in China's internal affairs, suppressing and smearing China, and causing serious damage to China-US relations,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a press briefing Wednesday.China asked Biden to repair \"serious damage\" done to the two nations' relationship.The Biden administration should, Hua said, \"look at China rationally and objectively, meet China halfway and, in the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, push China-US relations back to the right track of healthy and stable development as soon as possible.\"One of the main planks of Trump's foreign policy platform has been his trade war with China. The Trump administration's 11th-hour declaration that China is committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims will heighten tensions with Beijing, though Biden's nominee for Secretary of State said Tuesday that he agreed with the designation.  \"If the new US administration can adopt a more rational and responsible attitude in formulating its foreign policy, I think it will be warmly welcomed by everyone in the international community,\" she added.RussiaRussia said it hoped for a \"more constructive\" relationship between the US and Moscow as Biden took office.The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that it wanted to extend the landmark Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with the United States for a maximum stipulated five-year period.The US-Russia arms treaty is currently due to expire just 16 days after Inauguration day.\"We consider it possible to prolong it only in the form in which the Agreement was signed and without any preconditions. An extension for the maximum five-year term stipulated in the Agreement looks preferable,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement released just after Biden was sworn in.The statement added that Moscow hoped for a \"a more constructive approach in the dialogue with Russia and will take into account all the points mentioned above.\"It concluded: \"For our part, we are ready for such work on the principles of equality and mutual consideration of interests,\" the statement concluded.Biden has previously signaled that he intends to take a tough line against potential Russian aggression.Antony Blinken, Biden's pick to lead the State Department, said Tuesday that Biden intends to seek an extension of the New START Treaty, but suggested he has not made a decision on the length of the extension. Middle EastIran's President, Hassan Rouhani, called on Biden to return to the 2015 nuclear deal and lift US sanctions on Iran, overturning a key part of Trump's foreign policy program.\"The ball is in the US' court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact,\" Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting.Iran's Rouhani hopes Biden will return to Obama-era nuclear deal as he dubs Trump a 'tyrant'He also launched a scathing attack on the outgoing President. A \"tyrant's era came to an end and today is the final day of his ominous reign,\" Rouhani said of Trump's departure. \"Someone for whom all of his four years bore no fruit other than injustice and corruption and causing problems for his own people and the world.\"Biden has said he plans to return to the nuclear deal with Iran, which was signed when he was Barack Obama's Vice President. Biden's national security aides have suggested they would like further negotiations on Iran's ballistic missile capabilities, though Rouhani has said the missile program is non-negotiable.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif notably did not congratulate President Biden or Vice President Harris. Zarif did say that he hoped the pair could learn from what he described as the Trump administration's mistakes.\"Trump, Pompeo & Co. are relegated to the dustbin of history in disgrace,\" Zarif said on Twitter Wednesday, shortly after the inauguration ceremony. \"Perhaps new folks in DC have learned.\"Netanyahu and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in November.Elsewhere in the region  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Biden and Harris on what he called their \"historic inauguration,\" and reminded the new US leader he sees Iran as their number one challenge to confront.\"President Biden, you and I have had a warm personal friendship going back many decades. I look forward to working with you to further strengthen the US-Israel alliance, to continue expanding peace between Israel and the Arab world and to confront common challenges, chief among them the threat posed by Iran,\" Netanyahu said in a video statement.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas also congratulated the pair Wednesday and stressed his willingness to continue with the peace process.\"We look forward to working together for peace and stability in the region and the world,\" he said in a letter to Biden, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.In the letter, Wafa reports, Abbas \"affirmed his readiness for 'a comprehensive and just peace process that would achieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people in freedom and independence.'\"The Palestinian Authority broke political ties with the United States in December 2017 after then-President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, with President Abbas declaring the US could no longer be an honest broker in peace talks.Warmest congratulations to @POTUS @JoeBiden on his inauguration today. We highly value our strategic partnership and enduring friendship with the United States, and we look forward to working with you in pursuit of global peace and prosperity\u2014 \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 (@KingAbdullahII) January 20, 2021\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II also welcomed Biden to the world stage.\"Warmest congratulations to [Joe Biden] on his inauguration today. We highly value our strategic partnership and enduring friendship with the United States, and we look forward to working with you in pursuit of global peace and prosperity,\" the monarch said on Twitter.United KingdomBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was looking forward to a close relationship with Biden's administration.\"In our fight against Covid and across climate change, defence, security and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand in hand to achieve them,\" Johnson said in a statement Tuesday. Boris Johnson will hope to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Biden's administration.Johnson warmly welcomed Trump on his visits to the UK, with Trump once claiming that the Prime Minister was nicknamed \"Britain Trump.\" But the outgoing US leader was unpopular among Britons, and Johnson will be keen to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Biden.The new President could end up making two trips to the UK in 2021, with Johnson saying he looks forward to welcoming him to the G7 summit and to the hotly anticipated 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland. \"Only through international cooperation can we truly overcome the shared challenges which we face,\" Johnson said on Tuesday.Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was more blunt in her remarks in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday. Sturgeon wished Biden and Kamala Harris well, adding: \"I'm sure many of us across the chamber and across Scotland will be very happy to say cheerio to Donald Trump today.\"\"I think 'don't haste ye back' might be the perfect rejoinder to him,\" she added.Queen Elizabeth also sent a private congratulatory message ahead of the inauguration to Biden, a royal source said Wednesday.The letter's content was not disclosed, but the move does follow precedent. The monarch  typically congratulates fellow heads of state at their inauguration.CanadaShortly after Biden swearing-in, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau said he would work with the new US President \"to make our countries safer, more prosperous, and more resilient.\"\"Canada and the United States enjoy one of the most unique relationships in the world, built on a shared commitment to democratic values, common interests, and strong economic and security ties,\" he said. \"Our two countries are more than neighbours -- we are close friends, partners, and allies.\"Canada and the United States have worked side-by-side to tackle some of the greatest challenges we have faced in our history,\" Trudeau also said.Latin AmericaMexico's President, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, wished Biden well ahead of his inauguration on Wednesday. During his daily briefing, L\u00f3pez Obrador outlined three themes as key areas of the bilateral relationship with the US. \"Those three themes are very important: pandemic, economic recovery and migration,\" he said. L\u00f3pez Obrador also said Biden should take steps to settle the immigration status of Mexicans working in the US. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, widely considered a Trump ally, took to Twitter to congratulate the incoming US leader.\"I salute Joe Biden as the 46th President of the USA,\" Bolsonaro wrote. \"The relationship [between Brazil and the US] is long, solid and based on higher values such as the defense of democracy and individual liberties. I continue committed and ready to work towards the prosperity of our nations and the well-being of our citizens.\"Bolsonaro said he had written Biden a letter \"congratulating him for his inauguration and explaining my vision for an excellent future for the Brazil-US relationship.\"Ecuador's leader Lenin Moreno was particularly enthusiastic in his well wishes. \"It is a great day for the United States,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Democracy triumphs, respect for the will of the people prevails, and those principles are strengthened in all the nations of the region.\"The leaders of Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia also congratulated Biden and Harris. The VaticanThe Vatican published Pope Francis' message to President Joe Biden, the United States' second Catholic President, following his inauguration.\"On the occasion of your inauguration as the forty-sixth President of the United States of America, I extend cordial good wishes and the assurance of my prayers that Almighty God will grant you wisdom and strength in the exercise of your high office,\" the message says.\"Under your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding.Pope Francis prayed for Biden to help build \"a society marked by authentic justice and freedom.:\"At a time when the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses, I pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice,\" the Pope wrote.IndiaIn a series of tweets, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his \"warmest congratulations\" to US President Joe Biden. Modi said he looks forward to working with Biden and \"to strengthen (the) India-US strategic partnership.\" \"The India-US partnership is based on shared values,\" he wrote. \"We have a substantial and multifaceted bilateral agenda, growing economic engagement and vibrant people to people linkages. Committed to working with President @JoeBiden to take the India-US partnership to even greater heights.\"NATONATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called Biden's inauguration \"the start of a new chapter for the transatlantic Alliance.\"\"U.S. leadership remains essential as we work together to protect our democracies, our values and the rules-based international order,\" he said. \"NATO Allies need to stand together to address the security consequences of the rise of China, the threat of terrorism, including in Afghanistan and Iraq, and a more assertive Russia.\"CNN's Ramin Mostaghim, Eleanor Pickston, Luke McGee and Stephanie Halasz contributed.",

        "content": "(CNN)Last summer, when England's first peak of the coronavirus pandemic had subsided, Fazilah, an ICU nurse at a central London hospital, sat down to write her resignation letter. For months, she says, a wave of depression had enveloped her, but she had been too busy saving other people's lives to be able to identify it, or process it. Instead she \"shoved\" her feelings down into a \"dark part\" of her brain. The stress manifested physically: She had constant headaches, a short fuse, and couldn't eat, she said. Fazilah remembers laying on her bathroom floor for three nights -- each time after a grueling shift -- where she said she dry heaved until she fell asleep.\"I hadn't ate anything all night so what was going to come out? I fell asleep shortly after, only to be disturbed by those unacknowledged feelings in my dreams instead of when I was at work, because who had time to process anything in that soul-destroying place?\"Read MoreFazilah ultimately decided to stay at her job, but some of her colleagues did not, \"simply due to what they have seen.\"She's now working through another nightmare: As the UK suffers a devastating second wave of the virus, in the past week 1,182 people have died of Covid-19 in London alone. The world marks 2 million coronavirus deaths. The real toll is likely much higherInfection rates across the English capital -- the epicenter of the UK's current surge -- are around 1.5 times higher than in other parts of England according to the latest government data. And nationwide, the outlook is grim. The UK recorded the highest death rate in the world last week, according to Our World in Data, an online scientific publication based at the University of Oxford. The disease has infected more than 3.4 million people and killed more than 89,000 across the nation. In the first few months of the pandemic, intensive care unit nurses working for the UK's National Health Service (NHS) were stretched thin as they trained staff, converted wards into ICUs and, crucially, were forced to expand the \"safe\" NHS recommended nurse to patient ratio of 1:1 to 1:2, due to the sheer number of admissions.But as the UK battles this second wave, those NHS workers are being pushed closer to the brink, as they treat more Covid-19 patients in hospitals than at any point in the pandemic. A number of ICU workers CNN spoke to say they've been pushed to \"dilute\" the level of care due to the alarming surge of cases, saying that in many cases, they are treating far more than two patients at a time, and sometimes as many as eight.None of them has been authorized by their respective hospitals to speak to the media, and so all have asked for some parts of their identity to remain anonymous.Complex needs, complex carePatients who are admitted to ICUs have incredibly complex needs and are often in multiple organ failure. ICU patients require highly trained nurses to care for them -- specialists who are well-versed in treating their conditions through an array of technological interventions.\"When you have one nurse to one patient, you can give excellent care,\" said one veteran ICU worker, who asked to remain anonymous.They explained that because ICU patients are so sick and on ventilators, they require multiple drugs -- which have to be closely monitored and changed regularly --  to keep them asleep to keep their blood and heart pumping. Plus, they might also be on a dialysis machine, a \"demanding\" piece of equipment to filter a patient's blood.Nurses also need to closely monitor heart rates and blood pressure, they added, and if something starts to drop, they might have to change the mechanical ventilation filter.\"You can imagine if the nurse has to do that much for now four patients, then things are going to potentially get missed,\" they said, stressing that patients in ICU are now sicker then they were in the pre-pandemic.\"That nurse really needs to be with that one patient,\" they said.On Monday, there were a record 7,917 Covid-19 patients in London's hospitals, 1,220 of whom needed mechanical ventilation, according to government data. Ameera Sheikh, an ICU nurse and Unite union representative at a London hospital, told CNN that instead of one patient -- or even two -- she and her colleagues are now each looking after up to eight patients at a time.Ameera Sheikh, an ICU nurse at a London hospital said: \"Nurses are essentially running around in ICUs ... for 12-15 hours without a toilet break or a glass of water.\" It's a situation that not only compromises the level of care for the sick, but also adds to the stress and well-being of the health care workers providing it.\"Nurses aren't able to deliver the care we are used to and should be giving,\" said Sheikh, who has been working for the NHS for 11 years. \"Instead we are increasing the risk of errors occurring that can lead to patients deteriorating, life-threatening situations and death.\"Sheikh explained that medics without a critical care background had been redeployed to the ICU to help, but as they haven't been through specialized training, ICU nurses are also having to train and teach them on the job. A spokesperson for the NHS in London told CNN in a statement that: \"The NHS has well-established plans in place to cope with additional demand and maintain patient safety.\" The statement added that: \"Nursing staff ratios can be flexed to cope with pressure as appropriate and where it is safe to do so.\" UK entering 'worst point' of pandemic, top health official warns, as cases rise and bodies pile upOn Sunday, NHS chief executive Simon Stevens told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the nurse to patient ratio varied between hospitals from 1:1 to 1:2 to 1:3, and that staff are making \"dynamic adjustments in real time.\"He said that \"patients are being looked after,\" but that \"the key point has got to be, unless the coronavirus infection rate is under control, then here, just as in every other country in the world ... these services will remain under severe pressure.\"  While NHS England is one of the world's biggest employers, with 1.5 million people on staff, it was already facing a huge workforce shortage before the pandemic, with about 94,000 full-time roles unfilled -- many of them in nursing and midwifery. In October, the government said that there were nearly 14,000 more nurses working in the NHS than the previous year. The Chair of the British Association of Critical Care Nurses refuted that number, saying that that there was \"no evidence\" of those nurses in the NHS.The pressures of the second wave have only amplified those shortages, nurses say. Some have moved out of their homes to be closer to hospitals in order to work more shifts -- and to protect their families, Sheikh explained, adding that even on off days, it's almost impossible to switch off.\"Guilt suddenly rushes in because you aren't at work helping. Nurses are receiving WhatsApp messages multiple times a day to work flexible shifts on their time off,\" she said. \"That's how desperate ICUs are.\" Hospitals, staff 'under extreme pressure'The veteran ICU healthcare worker, who works at a different London hospital, told CNN that Covid-19 patients are coming in with critically low levels of oxygen every day.Patients are entering the emergency room terrified, she said, explaining that such low levels of oxygen can make you \"feel like you are being suffocated.\" Medics will first attempt to get oxygen levels up with an oxygen mask and by using non-invasive ventilation, but if that doesn't work then patients will need to be put into a medically-induced coma and onto a ventilator.That procedure is fairly routine for doctors, they explained; however, low oxygen levels can make it riskier and in some cases, lead to cardiac arrest.\"What is difficult about this [situation] is trying to manage it all at once,\" the nurse said. They said that this horrifying scenario is often unfolding for multiple patients at the same time, across hospital wards that are not set up for critical care, as the ICUs are already at full capacity.A patient arrives by ambulance to a London hospital on January 8. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned last week that the country's ICUs face a substantial risk of being overwhelmed if cases keep rising. There are currently more than 37,400 Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals. Last Tuesday, there were 4,534 new admissions -- the highest number of daily admissions so far in the pandemic.Stevens said that he wasn't going to \"sugar coat\" the facts, saying on Sunday that hospitals and staff are \"under extreme pressure.\"He said that in England a new person is admitted to hospital every 30 seconds. He said that the NHS had never been in such a precarious position in its 72-year history.  Last month, the Health Service Journal\u00a0reported that ICU units in London were already running at 114% occupancy, forcing them to stretch capacity, and that requests had been made by hospitals there to send critical care patients to hospitals in Yorkshire, more than 200 miles to the north. Stevens confirmed on Sunday that a \"small number\" of patients had been transferred from one region to another.A Best Western hotel in London is now taking in Covid-19 patients as hospitals run out of bedsMeanwhile, last week, a south London hotel became the first to take part in a government pilot program to relieve local hospitals by converting spare hotel rooms into recovery wards. Many of the healthcare professionals CNN spoke to for this article hold Johnson's Conservative government accountable for the mess. They say that delayed lockdowns and fumbled messaging around Christmas all contributed to the surge, and have added to public frustrations.On Monday, a government spokesperson told CNN: \"Our approach has always been guided by scientific and medical advice. As soon as we became aware that the new variant transmits more easily, we significantly reduced the Christmas relaxations and introduced stay-at-home restrictions where it was most prevalent.\"\"As the Prime Minister has said, we are seeing some early signs of progress, but we continue to monitor the data and keep restrictions under review.\"Conspiracy theorists who believe that the coronavirus is a hoax and anti-lockdown groups have capitalized on that discord and are making it worse. Sheikh said she was aware of videos purportedly showing empty hospital corridors and a hospital coffee shop making their way across social media. But patients aren't kept in coffee shops nor in hospital corridors, she said, adding that maintaining patients' dignity and privacy is at the forefront of all care.\"These people haven't seen the inside of an ICU and haven't had difficult conversations with families about withdrawing life [support] because we've done everything in our power to sustain it,\" Sheikh said of the conspiracy theorists.  At a press conference with the Prime Minister earlier this month, Stevens condemned the videos and the people who continue to wrongly claim that the pandemic is not real.\"If you sneak into a hospital -- in an empty corridor at nine o'clock at night -- and film that particular corridor, and then stick it up on social media and say, 'This proves the hospitals are empty, the whole thing is a hoax', you are not only responsible for potentially changing behavior that will kill people, but it is an insult to the nurse coming home from 12 hours in critical care, having worked her guts out under the most demanding and trying of circumstances,\" he said. \"There's nothing more demoralizing than having that kind of nonsense spouted when it's most obviously untrue.\"A 'constant carousel'While health care workers try to shrug off the people spreading misinformation, many nurses say it does affect morale. Plus, the surge in cases means that planned or elective surgeries are being postponed.Fazilah, the ICU nurse in central London told CNN that she wishes that people could see how much effort and patience it takes to navigate through a day in full PPE without \"wanting to shout at someone because you're so tired and frustrated, and your workload is tripled.\" \"The burden of having three patients is immense,\" she said, explaining that Covid-19 patients add an additional element of unpredictability, as they can shift from being stable to being in cardiac arrest \"out of nowhere.\"UK emergency Covid-19 field hospitals asked to be 'ready' to admit patients as crisis looms\"If one of my three patients suddenly deteriorates, I feel horrifically guilty ... thinking 'Why didn't I see that coming?' or 'What could I have done to prevent it?' -- when in reality I could have done nothing,\" Fazilah said, adding that \"It's extremely difficult\" to leave those shifts to rest. \"When you're back the next day ... all you're worrying about is their family and how would you feel if that was your loved one.\"Not being able to switch off can be frightening, Fazilah said, adding that when a patient dies, there is often little time to grieve before the next patient arrives in the ward.\"It's like you're on a constant carousel and you can't get off,\" she said.Last week, a King's College London study found that a large proportion of intensive care unit staff surveyed in the UK have reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or depression, and some feeling they would be better off dead.For some nurses, having to help families say goodbye to their relatives remotely, since they unable to do so in person, has contributed to that trauma. Fazilah described the \"horrific\" experience of having to hold up a tablet to a dying patient's ear so their family members could speak to them. \"The impact of that and imagining that it could be you saying bye to your parents or loved ones, is so much more damaging than people realize,\" she said. \"And it stays with you.\"",

During the course of the investigation, agents also searched 16 homes and businesses as well as almost 200 containers sent to Spain from Brazil and Paraguay, said the statement.All 12 have been charged, with six being held in custody and six being released under specific conditions.

        "content": "(CNN)Russia's leading Kremlin critic, Alexey Navalny, was detained by police in the outskirts of Moscow on Sunday, moments after his return to the country and five months after he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok.Live footage from Russian broadcaster TV Rain showed him talking with dark-uniformed and masked officers at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, then kissing his wife Yulia before walking away with them.The couple were returning from a five-month stay in Germany, where he had been recovering from the Novichok poisoning. They landed at Sheremetyevo just after 8 p.m. local time (12 p.m. ET), according to flight data information. \"This is the best day in the past five months,\" Navalny told journalists at the airport just before his arrest. \"Everyone is asking me if I'm scared. I am not afraid,\" he said. \"I feel completely fine walking towards the border control. I know that I will leave and go home because I'm right and all the criminal cases against me are fabricated.\"Read MoreNavalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list last month for violating terms of probation related to a years-old fraud case, which he dismisses as politically motivated. A statement on Sunday from the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) confirmed Navalny had been detained, and said he would remain in custody until a court hearing later this month, according to TASS. He is being held at a police station in the city of Khimki, just north of Central Moscow, and has not been allowed access to his lawyer, according to Navalny's spokesperson Kira Yarmysh and regional coordinator Leonid Volkov.Passengers and journalists take photos of Alexey Navalny as he takes his seat on the flight Sunday.Navalny has been a perennial thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin's side, raising concerns for his safety in the country.A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny's August poisoning, piecing together how an elite unit at the agency followed Navalny's team throughout a trip to Siberia, when Navalny fell ill from exposure to military-grade Novichok.The investigation also found that this unit, which included chemical weapons experts, had followed Navalny on more than 30 trips to and from Moscow since 2017. Russia denies involvement in Navalny's poisoning. Putin himself said in December that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they \"would have finished\" the job. Nevertheless, several Western officials and Navalny himself have openly blamed the Kremlin.Flight diverted to SheremetyevoRussian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, right, and his wife, Yulia Navalnya, on a Pobeda airlines plane heading to Moscow before take-off from Berlin on Sunday.Navalny's flight from Berlin on Russian carrier Pobeda was originally scheduled to land at Vnukovo airport, where a crowd of hundreds of supporters and journalists waited to greet him. Videos by independent media outlets Novaya Gazet and Media Zona showed police arresting several allies waiting at Vnukovo amid temperatures of around -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees F), including politician and lawyer Lyubov Sobol and Ruslan Shaveddinov, who works for Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation. The flight was diverted at the last minute to Sheremetyevo. According to the Vnukovo press office, the flight was redirected due to an \"emergency situation\" in which two runways were blocked by equipment that had been stuck in the snow, Russian media group RBC reported.  But Navalny blamed the change of destination on the Russian government, apologizing to his fellow passengers upon landing. \"I would like to apologize to the passengers on this flight. As I understand, hundreds of people suffered because Vnukovo was closed, thousands of people apparently got stuck simply because the road to Vnukovo had been blocked, here traffic was restricted.\"He added: \"They are jeopardizing the air safety of a wonderful big city. Why? Just so Putin could say: \"Who needs him?!\"After he was taken into custody, his wife Yulia Navalny told reporters, \"They are so afraid of [Navalny], they paralyzed all flights in Moscow tonight, so many people were let down over a man who simply flew back to his homeland.\"\"The most important thing is what Alexey said today,\" she added. \"He is not afraid, I am not afraid, and I urge you all not to be afraid either.\" Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is seen in a Pobeda plane after it landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on January 17, 2021.European leaders and diplomats reacted quickly to news of Navalny's detention, with European Parliament President David Sassoli and European Council President Charles Michel among the many calling for Russian authorities to release him.\"The detainment of Alexey Navalny upon arrival in Moscow is unacceptable. I call on Russian authorities to immediately release him,\" tweeted Michel.Navalny's arrest \"is an offence to the international community, to Europe that helped save his life. We ask the Russian authorities for his immediate release,\" tweeted Sassoli. \"We are ready to invite him to the European Parliament.\"The Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted that it was \"deeply concerned\" about Navalny's detention, adding: \"A vibrant civil society and political opposition are cornerstones of all democratic societies. Austria calls for his immediate release and a full & independent investigation into the attack on his life.\"Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called for Navalny's immediate release in a tweet, saying that \"Politicisation of the judiciary is unacceptable.\"In the US, members of both the incoming and outgoing presidential administrations voiced support for Navalny. \"The Kremlin's attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,\" tweeted Jake Sullivan, National Security Adviser for the incoming Biden administration.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also issued a statement condemning the detention. \"We note with grave concern that his detention is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny and other opposition figures and independent voices who are critical of Russian authorities,\" he said. What's next for Navalny?Navalny and his Anti-Corruption Foundation have been the subjects of a number of legal cases, which he and allies believe are politically motivated. In 2014, Navalny was found guilty of fraud after he and his brother Oleg were accused of embezzling 30 million rubles ($540,000) from a Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. While Navalny was given a suspended sentence, his brother was jailed. On December 28, FSIN accused Navalny of violating the terms of his probation by failing to show up for scheduled inspections while in Germany and requested that a court replace his suspended sentence with a real prison term.Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, said the claim was unreasonable. \"The Penitentiary Service --knowing full well that Navalny is being treated in Germany -- is trying to jump on the last train (Alexey's probation period ends on December 30!) and demands that he reports for inspection tomorrow!\" she tweeted.A hearing has been scheduled for January 29. If the FSIN request is granted, Navalny will likely be jailed for 3.5 years, according to the court's press service as reported by RAPSI. CNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned If Navalny is not convicted later in January, he will still face an investigation for a newer fraud case, in which he and his Anti-Corruption Foundation have been accused of misusing donations from supporters. In a video address posted on his Instagram last month, Navalny called the new criminal cases brought up against him in Russia \"demonstratively fabricated\" and an attempt to prevent him from coming back to Russia.  Alexey Navalny in hospital in Berlin, Germany, on September 15, 2020.\"The situation with Navalny looks like two trains running towards each other at full speed, bound to collide,\" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \"There will be many victims.\"Attacks on Navalny's allies have indeed continued. Pavel Zelensky, a cameraman with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, was arrested Friday and will be detained until the end of February. His lawyer has not commented on the case. According to Agora, a Russian human rights organization, Zelensky was accused of extremism for tweets from September, in which he blamed the government for journalist Irina Slavina's self-immolation. Before taking her own life, Slavina blamed pressure from Russian law enforcement for her decision to take her own life.CNN's Claudia Otto and Fred Pleitgen contributed to this report.",

Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria Commissioner Emma Cassar said on Sunday that there had been a \"small few\" people -- including a player -- within the Australian Open quarantine hotels who were \"testing our procedures.\"Nine people linked to the Australian Open have now tested positive for Covid-19, including one unnamed tennis player, according to Victoria State Premier Daniel Andrews.Andrews said at a press conference on Monday that those infected are \"all safely tucked away in quarantine.\"Among those who have been diagnosed with the virus are a coach, a member of the traveling broadcast team and crew who were working on board the flights which brought the tennis players to Melbourne.Read MoreOn Sunday, Australian Open organizers announced that another 25 players had been placed in quarantine hotels after a passenger on a Doha-Melbourne flight that arrived on Saturday had returned a positive Covid-19 test.\"The passenger is not a member of the playing contingent and had tested negative before the flight,\" said the Australian Open in a statement. \"There were 58 passengers on the flight, including 25 players.\"All 72 players affected are required to quarantine for two weeks and will not be able to leave their hotel rooms for the 14-day period and until they are medically cleared. They are not eligible to practice.\"A player who opened his door to try to have a conversation with his training mate down the hallway,\" added Cassar. \"The other was another gentleman who shouted some Uber Eats to some other people on the floor and was praising himself for his great efforts and opened his door to do so.\"It is really low-level but really dangerous acts which we just can't tolerate,\" said Cassar. One of the two people mentioned was a player, and they have been warned, according to the Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria Commissioner.World No. 71 Sorana Cirstea said she understood the need to quarantine, but that being unable to train and practice would affect her ability to compete effectively at the Australian Open.\"People complaining we are entitled,\" tweeted Cirstea. \"I have no issues to stay 14 days in the room watching netflix. Believe me this is a dream come true, holiday even. \"What we cant do is COMPETE after we have stayed 14 days on a couch. This is the issue, not the quarantine rule.\"\"I would need at least 3 weeks after in order to be in decent form again and compete at a high level! said Cirstea in another tweet.Speaking in response to player concerns on Monday, Victoria Premier Andrews said that tennis players were briefed on the rules before they came to Australia.\"That was the condition on which they came. So there's no special treatment here ... because the virus doesn't treat you specially so neither do we,\" he said.Andrews said that players are free to provide lists of demands for special treatment in quarantine but the answer would be no.JUST WATCHEDPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennis 05:30READ: Tennys Sandgren tests positive for Covid-19 then boards plane to Australian Open'Wrong surface'Belinda Bencic echoed Cirstea's observation that competitive balance at the Australian Open, which is the first grand slam of the tennis season, could be affected with quarantined players at a significant disadvantage.\"We are not complaining to be in Quarantine,\" tweeted Belinda Bencic. \"We are complaining because of unequal practice/playing conditions before quite important tournaments.In another tweet the world No. 12 said: \"Wrong surface but that doesn't matter for us.\" The tweet was accompanied by a video of Bencic, with racket in hand, gently hitting a tennis ball against the window of her hotel room.However, one leading former tennis star gave short shrift to any players complaining about quarantine.\"I have opinions on these tennis players complaining about the quarantine situation here in OZ & for the @AustralianOpen & theyre NOT going to want to hear it from me. \"Its got something to do with a minimum of $100,000, free flights, food & lots more, want to talk @ me kids?\" tweeted Rennae Stubbs, who has won six grand slam doubles title.

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was ordered to remain in custody for 30 days during a surprise hearing in Russia on Monday, less than 24 hours after he returned to the country and five months after he was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok.The opposition leader flew back to Moscow from Germany on Sunday, and was immediately detained by masked officers. He was held overnight a police station in the city of Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow. Navalny was placed on the country's federal wanted list last month for violating terms of probation related to a 2014 conviction for fraud, which he dismisses as politically motivated.Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) has requested that a court replace his suspended sentence with a prison term. If the request is granted, Navalny will likely be jailed for 3.5 years.On Monday morning, Navalny faced an unexpected hearing scrambled together in a makeshift court inside the police station that was slammed by his supporters as a \"circus.\"Navalny waits for a court hearing in the police station on Monday.Members of the media and supporters of Navalny gather near the police station in Khimki on Monday.Read MoreThe activist's lawyers said they were handed a notice about the proceedings just minutes before it was scheduled to start, and didn't have a chance to review any documents or talk to Navalny. Navalny himself was escorted out of a cell moments later under the impression he would finally be able to meet his defense team, but found himself in the court hearing. In his first appearance since he was detained by border inspectors at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport last night, Navalny slammed the proceedings as \"lawlessness at its highest point\" and a \"mockery of justice.\"  His spokesperson Kira Yarmysh noted that the only people who appeared to have known in advance about the hearing were a state TV crew and reporters from a pro-Kremlin tabloid, leading Navalny to request that \"real journalists\" are allowed inside. About 200 journalists and supporters gathered outside the police station where the hearing took place, according to the Mediazona news outlet. In a video posted to his YouTube account following the court decision to keep him in custody, Navalny urged his followers to \"not be silent\" and take to the streets. \"What are these crooks sitting in their bunkers are most afraid of? You know this very well. [They are scared of] people taking the streets. That is the political factor you can't ignore; that's the most important factor, the essence of politics. So come to the streets, not for me but yourself and your future,\" Navalny said. \"I urge you not to be silent, to resist, to take to the streets. No one but ourselves will protect us, and there are so many of us that if we want to achieve something, we will achieve it.\"The head of Navalny's regional headquarters, Leonid Volkov, announced a nationwide demonstration to demand his release on Saturday.Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny dupes spy into revealing how he was poisonedNavalny has been a perennial thorn in Russian President Vladimir Putin's side, raising concerns for his safety in the country.A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny's August poisoning, piecing together how an elite unit at the agency followed Navalny's team throughout a trip to Siberia, when Navalny fell ill from exposure to military-grade Novichok.The investigation also found that this unit, which included chemical weapons experts, had followed Navalny on more than 30 trips to and from Moscow since 2017. Russia denies involvement in Navalny's poisoning. Putin himself said in December that if Russian security services had wanted to kill Navalny, they \"would have finished\" the job.Nevertheless, several Western officials and Navalny himself have openly blamed the Kremlin. Governments around the world criticized Navalny's arrest on Sunday and called for him to be released. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the \"United States strongly condemns Russia's decision to arrest Aleksey\" in a statement Sunday. \"We note with grave concern that his detention is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny and other opposition figures and independent voices who are critical of Russian authorities.\"UK Foreign Minister Dominic Raab called Navalny's arrest \"appalling\" and said the opposition leader had been \"the victim of a despicable crime\" in a tweet Monday. \"Rather than persecuting Mr. Navalny Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil.\"CNN-Bellingcat investigation identifies Russian specialists who trailed Putin's nemesis Alexey Navalny before he was poisoned Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov deflected the criticism, saying the the West was attempting to \"divert attention\" from its own problems.\"We saw yesterday how [the West] seized on the news about Navalny's return to the Russian Federation. You can clearly feel the joy with which the carbon-copy comments are incoming,\" said Lavrov during his annual press conference Monday. \"With joy, because it seems to allow Western politicians to think that they will be able to divert attention from the deepest crisis in which the liberal model of development finds itself.\"Russian officials usually attempt to keep up appearances of an impartial judicial system, but the optics and swiftness in processing Navalny's case Monday shocked his supporters.\"What is happening with Navalny is worse than a circus. What remote hearing? On what grounds [is] some Khimki cop is trying to keep a person in custody? This is pure hell. Will they shoot him in the end?\" Vladimir Voronin, a lawyer with the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said in a tweet.Symbolically, a portrait of Genrikh Yagoda, the head of the Soviet Union's NKVD secret service during the prime years of Joseph Stalin's 1930s purges, loomed over Navalny in the hearing room on Monday, according to footage posted online.Mary Ilyushina reported and wrote from Moscow; Jack Guy contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Greek Olympic gold medalist Sofia Bekatorou's very public detailing of her alleged sexual assault in 1998 by a high-ranking Hellenic Sailing Federation (HSF) official has sparked an outcry in the Mediterranean country over the way her revelations were initially dealt with. Bekatorou did not name the person she is accusing. On Saturday, Aristides Adamopoulos -- the vice Chairman of the HSF Board -- resigned, according to the Greek sailing body.\"It is expected that complaints against me made by a public figure, of great recognition and wide social impact, will gather public interest, create feelings of compassion for the complainant and disgust for the alleged 'perpetrator,'\" said Adamopoulos in a statement as he called for due process.Later on Saturday, in a statement posted on the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) website, Adamopoulos said Bekatorou's accusation was \"false and defamatory.\"\"Nevertheless, I fully understand that due to the extensive negative publicity of the matter, it is very likely there will be damage to the status of the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which must always remain high for the good of Greek sport,\" said Adamopoulos.Read More\"For this reason alone and fully aware of my responsibility towards the HOC, I declare that from today and until the full clarification of this case by the authorities I will abstain from meetings of the HOC bodies which I am a member and I will generally abstain from the exercise of my duties from any position I hold.\"CNN does not usually identify people who say they were sexually assaulted, but Bekatorou came forward publicly with her allegations.Bekatorou said the alleged assault took place in 1998 during preparations for the Sydney Olympics, that were held two years later.One of Greece's best-known female athletes, Bekatorou won a sailing gold medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and then bronze four years later at the Beijing Games.Now 43, Bekatorou said a male official performed a \"lewd act\" after inviting her to his hotel room to discuss preparations ahead of the Sydney Olympics. The athlete said the act was not consensual. She made the allegation earlier this week at an online event organized by the Ministry of Culture and Sports about the protection of children in sport.Bekatorou said she wanted to talk about her traumatic experience in the hope that young athletes would not be afraid to speak out.\"I said no, I repeated that I didn't want to go on and he used fake sweet talk and said it is nothing and trying to be funny,\" said Bekatorou.\"He said he would stop if I didn't want it but he didn't, no matter what I said to him. Crying and feeling ashamed I left the room when he finished and removed himself from me.\"Initially in response to the allegation, the HSF said it had never previously received a formal or informal complaint from Bekatorou. It also urged the athlete to reveal specific details, while referring to the alleged sexual violence as an \"unpleasant incident,\" causing public outcry in Greece with athletes, politicians, and senior public figures describing it as a disgrace.However on Saturday, the HSF made a sudden about-face, releasing an additional statement.\"In order to preserve the prestige of the Federation, the honor and reputation of all athletes, coaches and actors in the sport and to facilitate the investigation for which the final decision is made by Justice, we immediately requested and received the resignation of vice Chairman of the Board Aristides Adamopoulos,\" said the HSF.Since Bekatorou came forward to recount her experience, an increasing number of prominent athletes have issued statements of support. Some have also come out with their experiences of sexual harassment. They include a former sailing champion, Marina Psychogyiou, who in a Facebook post alleges sexual harassment from an HSF official in the early 1990s, and retired high jumper Niki Bakogianni, a silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympics, who posted a message recounting an incident of sexual harassment from an official of her sports federation that allegedly took place over two decades ago.Their voices are joined by those of ordinary Greeks who are coming out on social media with personal accounts of traumatic experiences of sexual harassment.  Bekatorou carried her country's flag during the Opening Ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games at Maracana Stadium on August 5, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Athens prosecutorAdamopoulos said he was being subjected to trial by the media.\"It is the minimal conquest of any democratic state governed by the rule of law and the corresponding obligation of institutions and the media not to target individuals, distribute their photographs, or to have already convicted the so called \"perpetrator\" before he is given the opportunity to speak and give his view on facts made public by a third party,\" said Adamopoulos in a statement.Meanwhile, another two senior HSF board members have submitted their resignations in support of Bekatorou.Greece's entire political spectrum has rallied behind Bekatorou. And after saying he had talked with Bekatorou, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also praised her courage to speak out.\"Sofia bravely broke the chain of fear and silence, showing the way for the stigma of guilt to pass from the victim to the perpetrator. This way she became an Olympiad of responsibility, on behalf of us all,\" Mitsotakis said in a statement posted on Facebook.In an act of support high in symbolism, Greece's President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the country's first female president, has invited Bekatorou to the country's presidential mansion on Monday.The Hellenic Olympic Committee did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. IOC member and HOC head Spyros Kapralos has also said he would support Bekatorou with \"all his might'\" and called on other athletes to speak up.\"We need to have a safe, ethical, decent and pure sports environment,\" said Kapralos in a statement on Saturday.Meanwhile Greek media reported on Saturday that the Athens prosecutor will order a preliminary investigation on Monday, with Bekatorou expected to testify on Wednesday morning.Additional reporting by John Sinnott and Chris Liakos.",

The result means the Bucs, whose sole Super Bowl title came 18 years ago, face the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game -- Brady's ninth championship game in 10 seasons. Meanwhile, current champions the Kansas City Chiefs will face the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Championship game.The Chiefs lost quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a concussion in the third quarter against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday but managed to grind out a 22-17 win. Read MoreBrady celebrates against the Saints.Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresBrees' uncertain futureWhile the Saints led in the early exchanges at Mercedes-Benz Superdome, it was the Bucs' defense that forced crucial turnovers and proved decisive. Brady's two touchdown passes were finished by Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette before his own score in the fourth quarter settled the game. \"For us going into this week, we had to play a great game, and our defense stepped up and played huge,\" said Brady. \"Like I said, the offensive line was incredible. It was just a hard-fought game, a very physical game. \"We'll need to get our rest ... and be ready to go for practice on Wednesday.\"For Brees, this could have been the final game of his career with uncertainty over the 42-year-old's future swirling. Brees walks off the field after defeat by Tampa Bay. When asked about his quarterback's future, Saints coach Sean Payton said it's \"probably for another press conference.\" He added: \"Obviously, he's been tremendous for this team, this city, I could go on and on. But let's wait and answer that at the right time.\"READ: Eying successive Super Bowl titles, Kansas City Chiefs prepare to 'heal' ahead of playoffsREAD: 'If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL,' says NFL cheerleader'Not going to flinch'In Sunday's other game, the Chiefs had to call upon backup quarterback Chad Henne to guide the team to victory over the Browns. Mahomes, last season's Super Bowl MVP, had opened the scoring as he ran in a one-yard touchdown before finding Travis Kelce for the game's second touchdown. But he was forced off the field midway through the third quarter due to concussion protocol and in the second half the Browns started to close the gap in the scoreline. Mahomes looks on from the sidelines during the second quarter of the Chiefs' win. \"Somewhere you've got to be able to reach deep in tough times and pull that out,\" said Chiefs head coach Andy Reid of the way his team reacted after losing Mahomes and held on for the win.\"And if the coaches are flinching, if the players -- your leaders -- are flinching, it's not going to happen.\"And our locker room is not going to flinch. They're tough that way.\"The Chiefs now face the Bills on January 24 for a spot in Super Bowl LV.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's a question that has been asked for 50 years -- again and again.\"Why do these people continue to make a mockery of our culture?\" The question in 1970 was posed by Dennis Banks in reference to the use of Native American heritage being used for names and mascots for American sports teams. Banks was a Native American activist and a longtime leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM).Banks devoted much of his life and attention to campaigning for the team formerly known as the Washington Redskins to change its name.He died in 2017, aged 80, with the team's name still intact.The Washington Football Team changed its name after 50 years of protests.Read MoreThe year 2020 put the issue of race front and center of political and societal debate.The killing of George Floyd also forced many sport teams that utilize Native American heritage to review that association -- be it their name or logo.Washington has changed its logo and is now known as the Washington Football Team. Additionally, the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL, the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves in the MLB, and the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL have all looked inwards and made changes.Changes also came in Canada. In July, the Edmonton Eskimos football team announced that the team would retire the \"Eskimos\" name. The Inuit -- Indigenous People of the Canadian Arctic -- often take offense at the term \"Eskimo.\" \"While many fans are deeply committed to keeping the name, others are increasingly uncomfortable with the moniker,\" said the club in an official statement. The club said it had engaged with Inuit communities in recent years to discuss the name and felt now the time was right to change it.The team has retained its recognizable \"EE\" logo, but is yet to choose a new name. For the moment, the club is called the Edmonton Football Team or the EE Football Team. While originally a placeholder name, Washington president Jason Wright said the \"Football Team\" name may remain the team's long-term name.But across the rest of the world, notably in Latin America, there's arguably been less willingness to engage with the idea of what these associations potentially mean for Indigenous communities.In Latin America, it isn't just the sporting world turning its back on Indigenous communities. According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.For Native Americans, the use -- and abuse -- of their images, likenesses and culture in sports is a contemporary form of the marginalization they have historically experienced.The director of First Peoples Worldwide Carla Fredericks told CNN that a lot of the offense caused is due to false representation and outright racism.\"Of course, in the US, Native Americans have endured a really brutal history of colonization, marginalization, and so on,\" she says.\"And one of the kind of end results about that is that Americans really don't have a good grip on who contemporary Native American people are and so the only representative of us is the representation that we see in sport -- for many people. \"And obviously that's troubling because that's a caricatured representation and not an accurate representation of living, breathing cultures.\" The use of indigenous culture in sport is, therefore, an act that reminds Native Americans of their historic oppression at the hands of colonizers.There is also evidence to suggest that caricaturing Indigenous culture in sports causes depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse and even suicide among Native American youth.According to a study prepared for the UN, poverty rates, morbidity rates and infant mortality rates are all higher among Indigenous people in Latin American than the non-Indigenous.Fredericks adds that \"the notion of consent and stakeholder engagement\" -- or lack thereof -- is central to the issue too.She says consent is key when considering the acceptability of the use of Indigenous Peoples' culture, pointing to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"I think the right approach at this point in time is really to seek counsel from those communities and ask them, you know, 'Where do you stand on this? Is this something that you appreciate? Is it something that is harmful to you?'\"The issue has long been the focal point of media and activist attention in the US, particularly over professional sports franchises. But it is not a uniquely American issue, and it is not a social phenomenon that affects just Native Americans. It is a global problem, and one that affects Indigenous people around the world. The story beyond North AmericaThe Exeter Chiefs rugby union team in the UK, the KAA Gent soccer team in Belgium and the Kaizer Chiefs soccer team in South Africa all use a Native American man in headdress as their logos.While teams in the US are reviewing and removing similar logos and names, these teams have each chosen to keep their logo. This is in spite of public pressure in some cases.The logos of soccer teams Kaizer Chiefs in South Africa, KAA Gent in Belgium and rugby team Exeter Chiefs in the UK all have a Native American wearing a headdress.A recent petition, launched by an Exeter fan named Ash Green, asked the Exeter Chiefs to change its \"harmful use of Indigenous Peoples' imagery and branding.\" It initially gained 3,700 signatures and the club announced its board would meet to discuss a rebranding. However, that meeting resulted in only the retirement of the team's mascot, \"Big Chief.\" The club released a statement saying that the logo would remain, and that the board took the view that it was \"in fact highly respectful.\"As for the \"Chiefs\" name, the club said that the name \"dated back into the early 1900s and had a long history with people in the Devon area,\" the English county in which Exeter lies.The Exeter Chiefs for Change, a group campaigning for the club to change its name and remove references to Native American culture, released a statement labeling the decision as \"incredibly disappointing,\" and that the club had \"thrown away an opportunity to show itself as an inclusive club.\" \"We accept that the intention of the club for the branding was originally positive and not derogatory,\" they continued. \"But now they know it is not perceived in that way, they are making a conscious decision to be intentionally offensive by continuing to use it.\"The group concluded its statement saying that they were \"horrified\" and that \"the decision will not age well.\"In their statement, the Chiefs said the club will be making no further comment on the matter.Exeter Chiefs rugby team has retired its mascot \"Big Chief\" but will not remove the \"Chiefs\" part of its name. KAA Gent has an extensive section on its website that speaks to the historic oppression and present-day struggle of Native Americans. It also explains the history of the club's logo, and that the cultural context was \"a positive one.\" It says that the club represents \"respect, courage and honor. Values that they attributed to the Native Americans rather than to their White oppressor.\"Despite acknowledging the potential offense that its logo may cause, the club explains that it chooses to retain the logo as it \"draws attention throughout Europe to the social situation facing the Native American population today.\"KAA Gent acknowledge potential offense the team's logo can cause, but said it would remain the club's logo.In addition, the club says through its foundation, it is \"willing to investigate, along with representatives of the Native American population, if and how KAA Gent can organize a social partnership with an initiative in the United States that aims to bring about an improvement in the standard of living experienced by Native Americans, using football as a powerful instrument.\"CNN was told by the club that it reached out to \"some [Native American] organizations/representatives\" via Facebook in 2018 but received no rejection or acceptance of an \"exchange of views.\"The club says if a Native American organization did reach out, representatives \"would listen respectfully and try to establish such a partnership for the future.\"CNN contacted Kaizer Chiefs but did not receive a response at the time of publication.The Latin American storyIn Latin America, there is a case to be made that not only do the clubs not engage with Indigenous communities, but actively ignore scrutiny of practices. Only two of the five Latin American clubs contacted for this story responded to CNN.Guarani people are indigenous to South America, and live in Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia.The Guarani people represent the largest indigenous group in Brazil with a population of 51,000.They are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world. In 2013, it was found that Guarani people suffer a murder rate four times higher than the national homicide rate in Brazil, according to the Brazilian non-governmental organization CIMI.Most of their land was taken from them during the twentieth century, and they have an unequaled suicide rate in South America.Guarani people in Brazil are one of the most vulnerable Indigenous groups in the world.In the world of soccer, there are numerous Brazilian teams named after the Guarani people.Second division side Guarani FC last played in the top division in 2010 and won the Serie A title in 1978.In Paraguay, the fourth most successful team is Club Guarani. These two sides represent the best known \"Guarani\" soccer clubs and it is unclear whether the clubs ever obtained the consent of the Guarani people. CNN reached out to both clubs to seek comment but didn't receive a response from either.Guarani FC is based in Campinas, and is named in homage to the opera Il Guarany by Campinas-born composer Carlos Gomes. While the name is born out of an opera, it still marks an appropriation of an Indigenous peoples' identity.Fans of Guarani sometimes use an ethnic slur for an Indigenous Brazilian when referring to the club.Guarani FC have been promoted back to the Brazilian Serie A after one season in Serie B. The club came second to Neymar's Santos in the 2012 Campeonato Paulista.There are numerous other examples across the continent where Indigenous culture is used by clubs without affiliation to Indigenous groups.Chapecoense made global headlines after a 2016 plane crash killed the vast majority of players and staff at the club.The club's stadium was formerly known as Estadio Indio Conda. Brazilian football historian and podcaster Matias Pinto says that in Latin America, Indio is often a word regularly utilized as a racial slur that connotes indigenous people. \"In Brazil and other parts of Latin America, it depends how you say it. But when you chant 'Indio' it's derogatory,\" he says.He also adds that the club has no link to native people.\"Conda is an Indigenous leader from the past, so they honor this native hero in the West of Santa Catarina. But the Chapecoense fans are not native. They are mostly European descendants from the 19th century.\"The club's mascot is an indigenous person -- in reality, a person wearing Chapecoense kit alongside a mask of an indigenous person. One can also download a cartoon image of the mascot from the club's website, which is entitled \"Indio.\"Chapecoense was contacted by CNN but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Chapecoense's mascot is an indigenous person.\"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"It isn't just appropriation that can cause problems for Indigenous People, as Fredericks says: \"Unfortunately, because of the nature of sport, not only home team fans might behave in a way that's very disparaging and appropriative. But the opposing team fans might engage in behavior that's very insulting towards people.\"The Xavante are an Indigenous People in Brazil numbering approximately 22,000, according to Povos Indigenas no Brasil. Fans of the football club Gremio Esportivo Brasil, also known as Brasil de Pelotas -- which is based in the south of Brazil -- have been nicknamed Xavantes since 1946. According to an official statement made to CNN by the club, the nickname came about following a 1946 match against its main rivals Esporte Clube Pelotas. Down 3-1 at half time, Brasil de Pelotas came back in the second half to win 5-3. After the final whistle, fans of Brasil de Pelotas destroyed the fence separating the field from the stands and broke onto the field to celebrate.Following the game and the subsequent field invasion, an Esporte Clube Pelotas official gave a statement to the press, saying: \"They were barbarians, they looked like the Xavantes.\"Fans of Brasi de Pelotas, who wear red and black, are known as Xavantes after an official of a rival used it as a slur against them in 1946.The name was soon adopted by Brasil de Pelotas fans with pride and the club says that \"despite the pejorative\" meaning behind the name, it sees the name as \"an honor.\"\"It relates to the bravery of the indigenous tribe with the team. In our history, we have as main characteristics the guts, the fight for every ball and not to give up any play.\"The fans and the club adhered to the nickname and the likeable figure of the Indian, and today we are known in the country as Xavante, the red-black gaucho. And we won't change it.\"Sao Paolo-based Pinto says that it goes further than that: \"It started with a slur but nowadays Brasil de Pelotas fans are very proud [to be] Xavantes,\" as fans perceive themselves similarly to the Xavante people: warlike, brave and tough.\"Pelotas is a city that is facing an exodus,\" he says. \"People are moving to other parts of Brazil. So they have a lot of supporters' clubs around Brazil and they always merge the name of the state/city with Xavantes.\"Pinto says that racist slurs against Indigenous People are most common in intercontinental football matches in South America.\"In the continental competitions it happens too. Here in Sao Paulo, we do not have a lot of Indigenous, in Buenos Aires and Montevideo too. In Sao Paulo we are more Black or White, not Indigenous. \"So when a club from Bolivia or Peru or Ecuador [visits], countries in the middle [of the continent] are closer to indigenous traces, the supporters from Brazilian clubs, Argentinian clubs, Uruguayan clubs reference these people as 'Indios.'\"Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit the legal protections of Indigenous People.While racism against Indigenous People through sport continues across the continent, in Brazil Pinto offers that, \"they have more urgent issues [with which] to struggle.\"He speaks with reference to president Jair Bolsonaro and the policies towards Indigenous People during his presidency.\"It was a promise that [Bolsonaro] made in his campaign,\" Pinto says. \"He will not concede any land to the communities, that he will explore the surface for miners, and the environmental minister is very close to the farmers and miners. So the Indigenous, since the first day of this government, are very scared about these promises.\"During the Covid-19 pandemic, Bolsonaro has actively sought to limit protections of Indigenous People as well as devastating indigenous lands while the world is distracted. CNN contacted the Brazilian government but did not receive a response at the time of publication.Positive steps in Latin AmericaChile's most successful club Colo-Colo was founded by a White Chilean footballer but is named after Colocolo, a Mapuche tribal leader during the Arauco War fought against the Spanish colonizers.The club's badge also features the likeness of Colocolo.Colo-Colo's badge depicts its namesake, the Mapuche tribal leader Colocolo. Unlike many other clubs, Colo-Colo has actively engaged with the Indigenous community on which its name is based.In a statement, the club told CNN it believes there are \"essential differences\" from other teams around the globe which \"have a negative or derogatory charge.\"According to Pinto, the club was founded by \"rebels and workers\", so it acts as a symbol of an oppressed people fighting against oppressive powers.The club told CNN that the \"Mapuche identity is present and diluted in the Chilean population in a patent and documented way\" and as such the club has taken steps to recognize that.Colo-Colo flies the Mapuche flag alongside the Chilean flag at its stadium, and signage around the ground is written in both Spanish and Mapuche.The club said it was making efforts \"to seek an understanding and solution of the demands of the Mapuche people,\" along with \"performing ceremonies such as the the Mapuche June Solstice celebration in the stadium together with partners, fans, Mapuche communities and club authorities.\"Tribe members march for indigenous territorial rights on November 11, 2015 in Angra dos Reis, Brazil. Members of the Pataxo and Guarani tribes in Rio de Janeiro state joined the march. Pinto is less optimistic that real change will happen soon. Speaking of indigenous communities in his local Rio state, he said: \"They are very threatened by the Rio state ... they [Indigenous People] march and make demos but the majority of society doesn't give a sh*t.\"There is still a long way to go in Latin America for Indigenous People, let alone their representation in sports.",

        "content": "(CNN)The 2020-2021 Premier League season is a proving a bumper campaign for penalties.We're not even at the half-way point yet but already there have been 69 spot-kicks awarded. Compare that to the 2019-2020 season when 92 penalties in total were given.Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has credited former manager Jose Mourinho for making his team more \"savvy\" when it comes to winning penalties suggesting, as many thought, that winning a spot-kick may be more complicated than you might first think.Speaking to the Football Writers' Association (FWA) on Thursday, Rashford said a conversation with Mourinho, who managed United between 2016-2018, changed the way he approached his behavior in the box.\"As a forward line, we want to go and score goals, when you are making runs in behind or dribbling with the ball and if you see a challenge coming, you don't want to get tackled because you are looking at an opportunity to score a goal,\" Rashford told the FWA.Read More\"There is no way you are going to let somebody take the ball off you, so for me it is just a case of us wanting to score goals and the teams wanting to defend goals and penalties can happen.\"\"I remember when Jose [Mourinho] was manager, there were five or six times where I should have had a penalty and Jose ended up saying to me: 'If you are not savvy about the way you do it, then you are not going to be given it.'\"After that, we started to get a few penalties. It was something that in terms of development you have to learn that and understand it.\"READ: Jurgen Klopp takes a swipe at Manchester United after a frustrating defeatMarcus Rashford says he has learned to be \"savvy\" to win penalties. 'I don't think you can blame players'Players from every team in the league have long been accused of diving or of going down too easily on occasion.To some, it's a blatant disregard for the credibility of the game whilst others see it as mastering a necessary dark art.Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey says he doesn't blame players who go down after contact in the box, admitting officials don't tend to give fouls when players stay on their feet.\"I don't think you can blame players for going down under contact because they are asking the question of the referee. They're just doing their job,\" Halsey told CNN Sport.\"Perhaps referees have been to blame partly because when there has been a clear penalty and the player hasn't gone down, the referee hasn't given it.\"When you're going at pace into the box and there is slight contact, you will lose balance and you will go down [...] it's not easy for referees.\"Rashford's comments come amid an increasingly heated debate over penalties being awarded in the Premier League, perhaps fueled by a potential title race not many had predicted at the start of the season: United versus fierce rivals Liverpool. The two teams meet on Sunday when first meets second in the table.The spat started after Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp questioned United's penalty record earlier this month, saying it had \"more penalties in two years than I had in five-and-a-half years.\"Solskjaer initially brushed off Klopp's comments, saying he doesn't spend his time counting how many penalties Liverpool gets, but did suggest that such comments might influence decisions in the future.United has been awarded 32 penalties since the start of the 2018/19 season compared to Liverpool's 17. The Old Trafford club also set a new Premier League record after it was awarded 14 penalties last season. After United beat Leicester City in the previous campaign -- courtesy of a Rashford penalty -- Solskjaer reflected on his team's knack of winning spot-kicks: \"I think it's the type of players we've got. They've got quick feet, good skills and most of [the penalties] haven't even been debatable.\"Bruno Fernandes converts a penalty for Manchester United this season. 'Nonsense' However, Manchester United (six) has only been awarded one more penalty than Liverpool in the league this season, while both teams have scored the same amount (five).It's true to say a number of these penalties have been controversial, even with VAR's help.Halsey says the introduction of multiple replays has actually made the referee's job harder, by slowing down the incident too much and showing countless different angles.\"If you slow it [footage] down and watch it enough times, you can make an argument for any decision,\" he says.But Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for 14 years, says any suggestion that United is treated more favorably than other teams is \"nonsense.\"He also says the concept of managers getting into the referee's head is overplayed.\"All the managers do it [compain about decisions.] It's just part of the course of managers playing mind games with the opposition and maybe with referees,\" he said.\"When I was doing these games, I never watched the press conferences, you just go and referee what's in front of you.\"You sometimes had managers waiting for you at halftime, having a right go at you and trying to get into your head but you've got to be mentally tough and that's why you're refereeing at the top level.\"READ: Messi scores twice to help resurgent Barcelona move to third in La LigaLiverpool's boss Jurgen Klopp has been angered by United's penalty record. 'We want something they have'Such discourse has laid the foundations for Sunday's tantalizing fixture as United travel to face Liverpool at Anfield.Solskjaer's side is currently three points ahead of the reigning champion which has struggled for form in recent weeks.Another win over its rivals could see the Old Trafford side stake a real claim for this season's title -- an achievement which might well surprise even the strongest of United's supporters.\"Being where we are in the league just gives us more confidence and it's a sign of where we are at,\" said Solskjaer in his pre-match press conference.\"The game against the champions, who have an amazing record at Anfield, is a great test for us.\"Can we go there and cause an upset? We are the challengers and they have earned the right to be champions. We want something they have.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)For decades, cheerleaders have been synonymous with the NFL.  Providing a touch of glamor, dance teams across the US entertain thousands of fans every week, representing their franchise in the local community.  But behind some of the smiles and perfectly choreographed routines lies a world of painstaking work and alleged unequal pay. A new documentary, \"A Woman's Work: The NFL's Cheerleader Problem,\" exposes the underbelly of a seemingly glamorous pursuit and follows the lives of two women who \u200bsay they decided enough was enough.   Former cheerleader Lacy Thibodeaux-Fields was the first to speak out, filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the Raiderettes against the then Oakland Raiders in 2014, alleging wage theft and illegal employment practices. Read MoreIt led to several other cheerleaders following suit, including Maria Pinzone -- a lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills and the NFL in 2014. The Raiders settled for $1.25 million in September 2014, paying cheerleaders from 2010 - 2014 what they were owed back in wages. Individual payments ranged from $2,000 to $30,000, depending on the number of seasons the women danced on the team\u200b, according to Sharon R. Vinick, attorney at Levy Vinick Burrell Hyams, who represented the women in the case. Thibodeaux-Fields also received an additional $10,000 for acting as the lead plaintiff. In 2014, after the lawsuit was filed, the Raiders \u200breportedly more than doubled the cheerleaders' pay for mandatory events, amounting to about $9 an hour -- minimum wage at the time. CNN Sport reached out to the Las Vegas Raiders, previously the Oakland Raiders, for comment but has yet to receive a reply.  READ: Remembering the forgotten Black heroes of baseballMaria Pinzone filed a lawsuit against the Buffalo Bills in 2014. Meanwhile, Pinzone's case against the Bills is still ongoing, almost seven years after she filed the lawsuit. The film, directed by Yu Gu and which is free to stream on the PBS Video App\u200b, follows both Pinzone and Thibodeaux-Fields as they navigate their legal battles and cope with the fallout of their decision to stand up to \u200btheir teams. Gu \u200bhad no idea the project would last so long when she started it in 2014, but says it's been a window into the immense inequality of the NFL and wider society. \"It's really a microcosm into what all women are facing right now in the workplace, battling these stereotypes and these hypocritical standards that we're faced with,\" Gu, who was born in China and grew up in Canada, told CNN Sport.  \"It's definitely looking at something bigger through this very specific lens and even though the main participants, the protagonists, they're women, I think this inequality affects men. \"It's that mixture of hypermasculinity and toxic masculinity that is the source of this misogyny but it's also something that affects all genders.\" Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told 'little girls don't belong.' She didn't listen.From an early age, Thibodeaux-Fields had dreams of cheerleading for one of football's biggest teams and, after years of hard work, she fulfilled her ambition by joining the Raiderettes cheer team for the then Oakland Raiders.Thibodeaux-Fields had previously danced in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors. She looks back fondly on those two seasons and says she was treated very well. \u200bHowever, on joining the Raiderettes, \u200bshe says, things were different. She told CNN Sport she wasn't paid minimum wage for the countless hours she was putting in. There would be multiple community appearances and practice sessions, she said, that were unpaid. Equipment, uniforms and treatments, required to live up to the expected image of a cheerleader, all came out of her own pocket, she told CNN Sport.Raiderettes made just $1,250 per season and pay would come at the very end of the year, Vinick told CNN Sport. Thibodeaux-Fields, who works as a dance teacher, calculated it to be less than the then minimum wage\u200b, given the number of hours she worked. With a young family to support and with her husband questioning the contract she signed, she took advice from a legal expert and, in 2014, filed a lawsuit against the Oakland Raiders alleging wage theft.  \"There are lots of jobs that people would do for free, but they shouldn't have to just because it's their passion or their dream,\" Thibodeaux-Fields told CNN Sport.  \"Yes, there are some girls that would probably dance for free, but they're not going to be the caliber of [dancer] that I am. They're not going to have the experience or the drive.\"That's why I'm here. You pay me for what I'm worth. That's the point I'm making.\" Vinick told CNN Sport that she was initially shocked when she first read the cheerleaders' contract because \"it had more illegal provisions than any contract that I've read in almost 30 years of practicing law.\" Although she was satisfied with the eventual settlement from a legal standpoint -- securing minimum wages for the Raiderettes -- Vinick says she was left disappointed by the overall outcome.\"It didn't end up with cheerleaders really being paid their worth. It just ended up with them being paid minimum wage if they continued,\" she added.  \"Instead of arguing about whether these women should be paid minimum wages, we should talk about paying these women their fair worth for what they contribute to the game day experience.\" READ: Frappart becomes first woman to referee in men's Champions LeagueThibodeaux-Fields is now working as a dance teacher. Like Thibodeaux-Fields, Pinzone told CNN Sport she \"worked her butt off\" to be selected for the Buffalo Bills' Jills.  She had previously failed twice in her bid to make the team but, on her third attempt, she \u200bsaid she was \"over the moon\" to be chosen. However, things quickly turned sour.  Pinzone says she was expected to spend $650 on her team outfit and a further $500 on treatments to be ready for the team calendar shoot. She would then participate in hours of unpaid appearances, she said, some of which were mandatory, and sponsor events, representing both the NFL and the Bills.  At the time, Pinzone did not want to speak out in case she was kicked off the team and said the subject of money was always too taboo to approach.  \"I felt like I was being taken advantage of,\" she told CNN Sport. \"I felt like I was going to these appearances and [...] supporting everything around that, and on the back end of it, somebody else was getting paid for it.\" 'We should be less afraid to be afraid,' says Emily Harrington after historic El Capitan climbAfter one season, she decided not to go back but still had friends in the team going through similar experiences.  In 2014, Pinzone and five other women also decided to file a lawsuit against her team \u200bover the way they were paid, a case which later included the NFL (which was named on the contract they signed).\u200bThe central legal question in the dispute was if the cheerleaders were properly categorized as independent contractors, who aren't subject to certain regulations like minimum wage, or should have been considered employees.Pinzone and the Jills won a summary judgment affirming their employee status but the case has still not been resolved. Pinzone says the trial has most recently been delayed after one of the defendants filed for bankruptcy, and the Covid-19 pandemic is also complicating proceedings. Stejon Productions, the company managing the Jills, stopped the operation in \u200bthe wake of the lawsuit, and the Bills have been without a cheerleading team ever since. CNN has reached out to the Buffalo Bills and the NFL for comment but has yet to receive a response. CNN has also reached out to the lawyers representing the owner of Stejon Productions for comment but is yet to receive a reply. READ: US Soccer reaches deal with women's national team in fight for equal working conditionsJUST WATCHEDMaking history as the NFL's first male cheerleadersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaking history as the NFL's first male cheerleaders 03:10Gu says the fact that Pinzone's case is still ongoing shows the lack of understanding and the need to speak more about gender pay parity. \"It's a little bit disheartening to think they could just say we will pay these women instead of spending so much money on actually battling this case,\" she said. \"[The sport] really needs to look at changing the way they're dealing with the cheerleaders, the way that they're treating them. \"Of course, there's a resistance to change. There's a resistance to honest accountability of the wrongdoing and you see that across so many different industries.  \"That's why I feel like this film is not only just relevant to cheerleading, you see a lack of accountability across the board.\" The documentary shows the backlash the women received for speaking out, both from within cheerleading and the wider NFL community. \u200bThey say some current and former cheerleaders ostracized those who backed the lawsuits.Despite the countless days in court and disruption it caused their lives, both women \u200bsay they are proud to have spoken out and encourage others to come forward. However, in hindsight, Thibodeaux-Fields would think twice about ever joining the NFL.  \"If I would have seen this documentary before I decided to invest all my time and energy into these auditions, I wouldn't have done it,\" she told CNN Sport, admitting she misses the feeling of performing on that stage. \"I would have taken my talent elsewhere. If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL and I'd probably encourage other girls not to either.\" For Pinzone, the experience shows the lengths big business will go to save money but hopes the documentary will encourage women from all walks of life to fight for change. \"At the end of the day, I think it's about money. I mean, these businesses, they just are so greedy. \"They want more and more and more, and they don't care who they put down in the process. I feel like it's just so crazy. It really is.\"I think [the documentary] is a stepping stone and the more people that come forward about their situation, I think will help everyone in the long run.\"As of September 2020, 10 of the 26 NFL teams with cheerleading squads have been sued for wage theft, unsafe work conditions, sexual harassment and discrimination, according to the documentary.",

        "content": "(CNN)There's a distance of just over two miles between the Lincoln Memorial and the US Capitol. It was in 1963, on the Lincoln Memorial's steps, that The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. told the 250,000 people gathered there: \"I have a dream that one day [...] the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight [...] and all flesh shall see it together.\" Fast forward over a half a century and events at the US Capitol suggest America is still struggling to realize King's dream as outgoing Sen. Kelly Loeffler discovered to her cost.Loeffler is the co-owner of a women's basketball team in the WNBA, The Atlanta Dream, named with a nod to King Jr., the nation's most iconic and revered civil rights activist and his hometown. But in one of 2020's surprise endings, Loeffler's own political dreams were sensationally scuppered by the players of her own sports team, a group of her employees who rose up against her to secure, as MLK would have put it, \"the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" It's one of the most extraordinary stories of what has been a seismic election season; the triumph of a group of athletes who set out with the intention of doing the right thing, but who, in the end, might also have helped change the course of history. Read MoreElizabeth Williams says she never considered herself to be political; the British-born American basketball player was one of the top picks in the 2015 draft and she's played for the Atlanta Dream since 2016. But for the 27-year-old Williams and her teammates, everything changed in the summer of 2020. \"After the brutal killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor,\" Williams told CNN. \"We saw a large shift in the fight for social justice and the Black Lives Matter movement. We wanted to feel like our voices were going to be heard.\" Professional athletes understand all too well the risks associated with making a stand. Colin Kaepernick was frozen out of the NFL after taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016, while in the following year, catcher Bruce Maxwell received numerous death threats for doing the same thing ahead of a Major League Baseball game. But few players, if any, have ever stood in direct opposition to the personal interests and ambitions of their employer. The outgoing Sen. Kelly Loeffler is co-owner of The Atlanta Dream.READ: Megan Rapinoe condemns US Capitol rioters as 'White supremacy mob' The WNBA is well known for its support of social justice causes. Collectively, the players chose to dedicate last season to the memory of Breonna Taylor -- a Black woman who was shot and killed by police in her Kentucky apartment -- and they established their own social justice council.\"We made sure to support the 'Say Her Name' movement. You know, have Black Lives Matter on the court,\" Williams said. But then what she describes as \"a unique situation\" almost stopped them in their tracks.   The co-owner of their team, Loeffler, \"openly denounced Black Lives Matter in a letter to our league's commissioner, essentially denouncing Black Lives Matter and the movement and saying that we need to keep politics out of sports.\"  Loeffler described BLM as a \"very divisive organization\" which promotes \"violence and destruction across the country.\"The players knew what Loeffler was doing. As one of Georgia's two Republican senators, she was campaigning ahead of the 2020 election and trying to head off the challenge of another Republican, Doug Collins.That meant tacking to the extreme right of the political spectrum, pledging loyalty to US President Donald Trump and throwing out red meat to the party's base. CNN has reached out to Loeffler's team for comment but is yet to receive a response.   Following the decision not to charge any of the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor's death, NBA star LeBron James tweeted, \"The most DISRESPECTED person on earth is THE BLACK WOMAN!\"   Asked about her own experience of being a Black woman in America, Williams told CNN that \"in addition to sometimes feeling a bit of fear, we often feel unheard. And specifically, as female athletes, we often feel that even more. So, we always find ways to try to speak up for people who often aren't heard.\" In response to the stance of their team owner, Williams said the players were frustrated, disappointed and confused. \"There were definitely a lot of emotions,\" she explained.  The league told CNN that the demographic composition of the WNBA is 80% persons of color, some of whom, Williams said, have \"lost family members to gun violence, have felt a lot of this in a very personal way.\" Some were furious. Before the decision not to charge officers involved in Taylor's shooting was made, the players' union, the WNBPA, tweeted \"E-N-O-U-G-H! O-U-T!\" over Loeffler's opposition to the WNBA's support for the BLM message while Dream guard Renee Montgomery posted that she was \"pretty sad to see that my team ownership is not supportive of the movement & all that it stands for. I was already sitting out this season & this is an example of why.\" Montgomery was on a sabbatical to focus on social justice reform. Elizabeth Williams posted this photo to Instagram, posing with fellow WNBA stars. READ: 'If I would have known then what I know now, I would have never stepped foot in the NFL'There were calls for Loeffler to stand down and a team statement on July 10, signed by all the players, read: \"We are the women of the Atlanta Dream. We are women who support a movement. We are strong and we are fearless. We offer a voice to the voiceless. Our team is united in the Movement for Black Lives. It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity. Black Lives Matter.\" Throughout the course of the interview with Williams, it became apparent that she hadn't once mentioned Loeffler by name. \"People in politics talked about the power of saying someone's name,\" she said. \"And so you can also do the opposite by not saying someone's name.\" The name they chose to say instead was Reverend Raphael Warnock, a Democratic challenger to Loeffler who was a long shot in the senate race, polling in single digits among registered voters in July, according to Monmouth University Poll. But at the start of August, without saying another word to criticize their owner Loeffler, Dream players began publicly supporting her political rival.   \"We wanted to react in a way that was still so classy and still promoted what we want to promote,\" said Williams. It was a plan of action that had the support of players across the league and soon many of them were wearing t-shirts bearing the simple message \"Vote Warnock.\"   Posing in the t-shirt that same day, Williams tweeted, \"We are WNBA players, but like the late, great John Lewis said, we are also ordinary people with extraordinary vision.\"  Suddenly, Warnock's campaign was receiving national attention, players were endorsing him in media interviews and donations were rolling in from well beyond the Georgia borders. Warnock's campaign reportedly said that within just two days of the players getting involved, $200,000 was pledged and the volume of individual donors soared.  The surge of support enabled him to invest in more campaign advertisements and helped increase his campaign's momentum.  Speaking about the players' support, Warnock told USA Today: \"I think it was helpful. It was one of the many turning points in the campaign. It gave people a chance to look a little closer and say, 'Who is this Warnock guy and what is he about?'\"  From meager polling numbers of 9% in July, Warnock had climbed to 21% in September, according to the Monmouth University Poll, and two months later, he finished first in the election with 32.9%.READ: LeBron talks to his children about the double standard of the US Capitol riotsWilliams says she often feels \"unheard\" as a Black woman. Because state rules dictated that the winner would have needed to clear 50%, Warnock then lined up in a head-to-head runoff against Loeffler, who finished second in the November race with 25.9% of the vote. On January 5, in a one-on-one election, Warnock became Georgia's first-ever Black US senator and also the first Black Democratic US senator from a southern state.  By this point, though, his victory was even more significant. A quirk of fate meant that the two runoff elections in Georgia could hand the Democrats control of the Senate for the first time in six years. Warnock's win, paired with Jon Ossoff's success in the other race, has made President-elect Joe Biden's task of governing considerably easier than it might otherwise have been. Just as Warnock's election was historically significant, so, too, was Ossoff's; he's the first Jewish person that Georgia has sent to the Senate.  As news of Warnock's triumph became clear, text group chats among Atlanta players and their counterparts across the league began lighting up. Williams says she found it hard to sleep. \"Wow, we really did this! We helped flip the Senate,\" she recalled. \"A lot of the messages were just being thankful for being a part of this group of really, really impactful and incredible women.   \"You feel all the emotions; the pride, the joy and then the optimism. A lot of what we've seen politically has been surrounded in division and hate, and I think in this moment in particular, it was a moment to be hopeful.\" 'A blow to the heart,' says LeBron James after officers involved in shooting of Jacob Blake will not face chargesThe joy was short-lived, though. Within hours of Warnock's victory being confirmed, an angry mob had stormed the Capitol in Washington DC. An insurrection inspired by President Trump, left five people dead -- including a Capitol policeman. A despicable \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt was seen in the Capitol and the divisive Confederate flag (a relic of the Civil War and a modern-day symbol of racism) was paraded there for the first time in the history of the United States.  Williams, who's now playing basketball in Turkey, says she was disappointed and frustrated, though not necessarily surprised, and felt helpless and embarrassed by the scenes playing out on TV.   \"Often in the history of America, we're in this juxtaposition of something really good happening and something bad. You know, like the fact that the [Georgia Senate runoff] election was the same day that we got the news that the officer that shot Jacob Blake wouldn't be charged.\"  Despite all the progress that has been made, Williams says that \"we do always have to be aware and have to be accountable for a grave history of White supremacy and fear.\"  Williams says the experience of the last year has changed her mindset forever. \"Yeah, I guess I'm a little more political now,\" she reflected. \"I think I always paid attention to these things, but I always felt like, 'Well, you know, somebody else will do it.' But I've grown into stepping out and trying to be a leader in these moments.\"  As MLK himself said: \"A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.\"",

Local GPs invited patients in the over-80s priority group to visit the cathedral and have their first vaccine doses. More than 3.23 million people had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in the UK by Saturday, according to the PA Media news agency.Former RAF Flight Sergeant and Lancaster tail gunner Louis Godwin, 95, was among the first people to receive a dose at the more than 800-year-old cathedral, according to the NHS Salisbury official Twitter account.

Britain's 'major crisis' is good and bad news for travelers\"It has been absolutely marvelous to come into this wonderful building and have this jab,\" Godwin said in an interview with the PA Media news agency. \"I've had many jabs in my time, especially in the RAF. After the war, I was sent to Egypt and I had a couple of jabs which knocked me over for a week.Read More\"This one, the doctor said to me 'Well that's done' and I thought he hadn't started. So it's no trouble at all and no pain,\" he added.Godwin said World War II was \"entirely different\" to the pandemic \"because this has divided people.\" \"You see each other virtually but I've got a very big family, I've got 12 great-grandchildren now from four months to 23 years. I don't see them and they're all growing up,\" he explained.The cathedral's organist John Challenger said in a tweet he \"would be playing Handel's Largo and much more great organ music\" as the cathedral became a vaccination center.\"This is the place where day by day prayer is offered for the healing of the city, for the healing of the nation. To be able to come here today to receive these lifesaving vaccinations, I'm just overjoyed that we can play our part in this,\" Very Rev Nicholas Papadopulos, Dean of Salisbury, told CNN affiliate ITV news.  There have been more than 3.3 million cases of Covid-19 recorded in the UK, and the country has the highest death toll in Europe, with more than 87,000 dead, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.",

        "content": "(CNN)Preparations for the Australian Open hit a major stumbling block on Saturday after 47 players were told they couldn't train or practice after some passengers on two charter planes arriving in Melbourne returned positive Covid-19 test results.Twenty-four players on a charter flight from the US to Melbourne are required to quarantine for two weeks after a member of the flight crew and a passenger -- not a player -- tested positive. Both had tested negative within 72 hours of boarding the flight, which carried a total of 79 people.Another 23 players are also in quarantine following the arrival in Melbourne of a charter flight carrying 64 people from Abu Dhabi. One person -- again not a player -- tested positive after the flight, despite presenting documentation of a negative Covid-19 test prior to takeoff.All 47 players affected will not be able to leave their hotel rooms for the 14-day period and until they are medically cleared. They will not be eligible to practice.Australian Open organizers released two statements on Saturday detailing how the players would be affected.Read More\"All passengers from the flight are already in quarantine hotels and the positive case, who is not a player and had tested negative before the flight, has been transferred to a health hotel,\" said the second statement in reference to the Abu Dhabi-Melbourne flight.The passengers who tested positive for the virus on the US flight were also transferred to a health hotel.\"Our thoughts are with the two people who tested positive on the flight and we wish them well for their recovery,\" said Australian Open Tournament Director Craig Tiley in the organizers' first statement.JUST WATCHEDPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPatrick Mouratoglou on Serena Williams, the men's game and the future of tennis 05:30READ: Tennys Sandgren tests positive for Covid-19 then boards plane to Australian Open'Rigorous testing schedule'In a tweet that was subsequently deleted, French player Alize Cornet, who is in Melbourne but was not on either plane, described the situation as \"insane.\"\"Soon, half of the players from the AO will actually have to isolate,\" she tweeted. \"Weeks and weeks of practice and hard work going to waste for one person positive to Covid in a 3/4 empty plane.

He later died in hospital.Hundreds of protestors gathered in Liedts square in central Brussels. Video from the scene showed scuffles as demonstrators threw stones and projectiles while police deployed a water cannon.Some demonstrators carried Black Lives Matter signs and shouted, \"We want the truth.\"Belgian King Philippe's car was \"briefly stuck\" nearby, the palace told CNN, and the vehicle was hit by a few projectiles thrown at police officers surrounding the monarch's convoy.

        "content": "(CNN)A British man who accidentally threw a hard drive loaded with bitcoin into the trash has offered the local authority where he lives more than $70 million if it allows him to excavate a landfill site. IT worker James Howells got rid of the drive, which held a digital store of 7,500 bitcoins, between June and August in 2013. He had originally mined the virtual currency four years earlier when it was of little value. But when the cryptocurrency shot up in value and he went in search of it, he discovered that he had mistakenly thrown the hard drive out with the trash. Bitcoin prices roar back towards $40,000Now, with his lost bitcoin having soared even further, Howells has approached Newport City Council in Wales to ask for permission to dig a specific section of the landfill site where he believes the hard drive ended up. In return, he has offered to pay the council a quarter of the current value of the hoard, which he says could be distributed to local residents. Read MoreThe digital currency was created in 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins are essentially computer files that are stored in a \"digital wallet\" on your device. They can then be used as payment, with every transaction being recorded in a public list known as blockchain. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high in recent days and is now trading around $37,000.Bitcoin rally may be the 'mother of all bubbles' says BofAHowells first discovered that the hard drive was missing when his bitcoin was worth around $9 million. Based on the current rates, he estimates it would be worth around $273 million.  He told CNN: \"I offered to donate 25% or \u00a352.5 million ($71.7 million) to the city of Newport in order to distribute to all local residents who live in Newport should I find and recover the bitcoins.\"\"This would work out to approx \u00a3175 ($239) per person for the entire city (316k population). Unfortunately they refused the offer and won't even have a face to face discussion with me on the matter.\"After discovering the mistake, Howells went to the garbage dump to see where the hard drive might have ended up. He told CNN at the time: \"As soon as I saw the site, I thought you've got no chance. The area covered is huge.\"How Bitcoin is making waves in the luxury market However, he now believes he knows how to retrieve it.  \"The plan would be to dig a specific area of the landfill based on a grid reference system and recover the hard drive whilst adhering to all safety and environmental standards,\" he told CNN Friday. \"The drive would then be presented to data recovery specialists who can rebuild the drive from scratch with new parts and attempt to recover the tiny piece of data that I need in order to access the bitcoins.\"\"The value of the hard drive is over \u00a3200m (around $273 million) and I'm happy to share a portion of that with the people of Newport should I be given the opportunity to search for it. Approximately 50% would be for investors who put up the capital to fund the project, and I would be left with the remaining 25%,\" he added.Cryptocurrency tycoon died leaving $145m in limbo. Now lawyers seek exhumation to check it's really him A spokeswoman for Newport City Council told CNN that the local government authority had been \"contacted a number of times since 2013 about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins.\"In a statement sent to CNN, the spokeswoman said the council had not refused the offer -- but rather, was not permitted to excavate the site. She said: \"The council has told Mr Howells on a number of occasions that excavation is not possible under our licencing permit and excavation itself would have a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.\"The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds -- without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order.\"",
