        "content": "(CNN)An official from the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has told CNN the war in Ethiopia is far from over and that Eritrean troops are part of the conflict. Speaking exclusively to CNN for the first time since the fall of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region, Getachew Reda said the bulk of the region still remains in the hands of the TPLF. \"We withdrew from Mekelle because we did not want to give them the pretext to bombard the city back to the stone age, to indiscriminately bombard and destroy the town,\" Reda, Ethiopia's former Communications Minister and a member of the TPLF executive council, told CNN by phone from inside the Tigray region.Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) took control of the city on Saturday, according to a tweet from Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. It was under fierce bombardment earlier on Saturday, a humanitarian source on the ground and eyewitnesses who have fled Mekelle, told CNN.     \"Abiy's forces focused on capturing the towns but the bulk of the people are in the rural areas -- the largest parts of the region -- and that is where we are,\" said Reda. \"As we speak there are military engagements in the larger part of the region; we are defending our positions, there have been a series of offensives and we are taking defensive positions, it won't be long before we reverse and launch a counter offensive.\"Read MoreReda told CNN he feared that the conflict was descending into ethnic cleansing, warning that Abiy is \"pitting Amhara against Tigray.\" In a file photo from June 2016, Getachew Reda, Ethiopia's former communications minister and a member of the TPLF executive council, speaks during a press conference in Addis Ababa.In response to the TPLF's claims of ethnic killings and Eritrean military involvement, a spokeswoman for the federal government's state of emergency task force said it was a \"continued attempt\" by the TPLF to \"internationalize the situation and gain international support for impunity.\" \"The rule of law operation militarily has ceased. There will no doubt be sporadic and dwindling attempts by the group on the run and those that have not been disarmed yet,\" she added. At least 600 civilians were killed in northern Ethiopia massacre, rights commission says  CNN tried unsuccessfully to reach the Eritrean government for comment. Abiy recently told Ethiopia's parliament that not a single civilian had been lost in the war in Tigray. He said the war was over and it was time to rebuild the region.Rights groups say hundreds have died, but CNN cannot independently verify those numbers because of a communications blackout in the region. Internet, mobile phones and landlines are down.  Reda contradicted Abiy's assertion that the war was over and said the TPLF have launched multiple strikes against neighboring Eritrea because he claimed \"90% of the forces operating in Tigray are from Eritrea.\"He called on the international community to intervene in the Ethiopia conflict.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he spoke with Abiy on Monday, reiterating the need for de-escalation. I spoke with Ethiopian Prime Minister @AbiyAhmedAli today and urged a complete end to the fighting in Tigray, a start to dialogue, and free, safe, unhindered humanitarian access. It is essential to resolve the ongoing conflict and keep Ethiopia on the path to democracy.\u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) November 30, 2020\n\nThe conflict, which began in early November, threatens to undo years of progress in Africa's second most populous country and the restive Horn of Africa region. More than 47,000 Ethiopian refugees have now crossed into Sudan, said Babar Baloch, the global spokesman for UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency. Some of these refugees described to CNN being beaten and tortured by Eritrean soldiers. The UN's humanitarian coordination office said on Friday it was doing its utmost to secure aid access to Ethiopia's Tigray region, after a deal was struck to reach displaced civilians.\"There are still operational issues of a logistical nature, some of them are of a security nature, that are being worked out, so that we can proceed with the missions,\" said Jens Laerke, the spokesman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), adding that \"everyone, of course, (is) working full speed to make that happen.\"Tigray refugees who fled the conflict in northern Ethiopia ride a bus to a temporary shelter near the Sudan-Ethiopia border on Tuesday, December 1.Humanitarian organizations are struggling to provide services amid the tsunami of refugees. \"We are underfunded, conditions are bad,\" the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, told CNN's Becky Anderson on Friday. \"It's much worse inside Tigray, where we haven't had access in a month.\" He said witness testimony did not match Abiy's claims that civilians have not been harmed. Refugees have also told CNN of incidences of harrowing violence connected to the conflict.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was supposed to be the key piece of evidence. But when it came, the Lagos State government's security camera footage of the Lekki toll gate shooting did not capture everything.The footage from the security camera overlooking the toll gate in Lagos, Nigeria was played during Saturday's session of an eight-person judicial panel set up to investigate police brutality and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- the primary focus of thousands-strong protests in the city that lasted for almost two weeks in October.The panel is also charged by the Lagos State government with probing the shooting of protesters at the Lekki toll gate on the evening of October 20 and into the early hours of October 21.CNN obtained a copy of the CCTV footage ahead of the panel's sitting on Saturday and matched it up to verified footage published as part of an investigation last week into the events at the toll gate.Read and watch CNN's full investigationThe footage corroborates the timings CNN reported for the gunshots fired by the army. It also shows soldiers approaching protesters and firing shots.Read MoreWhat is perhaps most notable is what's missing. At 6:47 p.m., the moment when CNN has video of the army appearing to fire directly at protesters, the surveillance camera pans away from the area. The Lekki Concession Company (LCC), the firm that operates the toll gate in a public-private partnership, says its staff were sent home before an evening curfew, imposed by the State's Governor, came into effect.The surveillance camera pans left and tilts up before reframing and struggling for focus. It is unclear if the camera pans away deliberately or whether the pan away is a poor choice by the CCTV operator.The LCC had previously testified at the panel on November 3 that the recording stopped at around 8 p.m. because it was tampered with.The surveillance footage once again raises questions about the investigation into what happened at the Lekki toll gate protest -- and why surveillance video from the evening does not provide a more complete picture.In the aftermath of CNN's investigation, the United States and the United Kingdom have called on Nigeria to ensure that its investigation is free and fair.Read and watch the full investigationOn Monday, the UK parliament debated a petition seeking to sanction the Nigerian government and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) over alleged human rights abuses.The foreign office also released a statement saying: \"The Foreign Secretary has been clear that the Nigerian government must urgently investigate reports of brutality at the hands of the security forces and hold those responsible to account.\"It is important that the police in Nigeria respect human rights. We have been working with Nigeria to support reforms to ensure this happens.\"The police said it would not comment until after the judicial inquiry. However, in a tweet in early November, it denied shooting at protesters.\"...our police officers never resorted to use of unlawful force or shooting at the protesters as alleged in the report.\"Since the shooting, which brought an end to the protest movement in Africa's most populous country, the army has made many shifting statements about how it engaged with the peaceful demonstrators.     The army has repeatedly said the soldiers deployed to the toll gate fired into the air and not at protesters directly.  The army did not respond to multiple requests from CNN for comment. On Twitter, it repeatedly stamped news accounts of the shooting as \"Fake News.\"However, social media footage -- submitted by the army's own counsel to the panel on Saturday -- featured an eyewitness saying, \"they are shooting at protesters.\" It appeared to be the same video that CNN geo-located which was shot from the nearby Oriental Hotel in Lekki on October 20.On Saturday, army spokesman Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo also contradicted previous testimony to the judicial panel by saying that the army was equipped on the night with live rounds.\"For the protection of the force, we carried live bullets in case they were attacked. But the soldiers who formed the firing team, who fired as you could see in the video [...] carried magazines charged with blank ammunition.\"Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo attends a judicial panel  investigating the shooting of protesters in Lagos, Nigeria, on November 14, 2020.CNN's investigation had revealed the use of live ammunition at the toll gate, based on analysis carried out by ballistics experts and conversations with military sources.The army has insisted that only blanks were used.Adesina Ogunlana, a lawyer who is representing some of the \"#EndSARS\" protesters at the judicial panel, told CNN another protester died recently after falling into a coma from injuries sustained on October 20.\"I saw one of them that was shot at and taken to Reddington (Hospital),\" Ogunlana said. \"About ... three Sundays ago, I was there and there was this person shot in the head. He's dead now.\" \"What blanks lodge in somebody's brain and stay there and send him to a coma, killing him?\"CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death of this person.On Saturday, Brigadier Taiwo once again rejected any responsibility by the army for deaths of protesters, saying that one of the deaths was from \"blunt force trauma to the head on Admiralty Way ... 3 kilometers away from the Lekki toll gate. And the second person at Yaba.\"\"It had nothing whatsoever to do with the Lekki toll gate,\" he said.In response to CNN's investigation, the Nigerian government said the news organization should be sanctioned and alleged that doctored videos were used, describing the reporting as \"fake news\" and \"misinformation.\"Nigeria threatens CNN with sanctions but provides no evidence Lekki toll gate investigation is inaccurateCNN stands by its investigation, a company spokesperson said.\"Our reporting was carefully and meticulously researched, and we stand by it,\" the spokesperson said via email.In a letter addressed to CNN on November 23, Nigeria's Ministry of Information demanded an internal investigation into CNN's reporting, as a \"form of remediation\" and to \"determine whether it met the basic standards of journalism.\" The Minister added in the letter that the \"Federal Government reserves the right to take any action within its laws to prevent CNN from aggravating the #EndSARS crisis.\" CNN's November 19 report included photos and videos of gunshots, the wounded, and victims. The videos, acquired from multiple eyewitnesses and protesters, were verified in interviews, and by using timestamps and other data from the media files.Read and watch the full investigationOgunlana, the lawyer representing some of the protesters, said the evidence the army continues to submit to the judicial panel is undermining its defense.\"There's a proverb among my people,\" Ogunlana said. \"They say the wasp is in denial, the big black ant known for his terrible sting is in denial, but here is the face of the farmer, so badly swollen.\"",

        "content": "Abs, Yemen \u2014 The doctors and nurses at the malnutrition ward in Abs Hospital are used to scrambling --\u00a0there is rarely enough time in the day to see the number of emaciated children that come in. But things have never been quite this bad.In the past few months, the power has dropped out daily and high fuel prices mean they can't always keep their generators going. When that happens, their monitors and ventilators switch off. Children who could have been saved, die.\u00a0\"Those who aren't killed by the airstrikes or this war? They will die from shortages in medical supplies,\" Dr.\u00a0Ali\u00a0Al Ashwal\u00a0tells CNN at the hospital in Hajjah, northwest of the capital, Sanaa.In March, the Trump administration\u00a0and the US' key regional allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, slashed their funding to the\u00a0United Nations' appeal for Yemen.\u00a0The funding cuts mean reduced health care services for Yemeni civilians, with some forced to close.\u00a0They have also forced aid agencies to stretch food assistance thin.JUST WATCHEDWorld's worst humanitarian crisis deepens after US aid cutsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWorld's worst humanitarian crisis deepens after US aid cuts 06:27This\u00a0state of affairs is evident at\u00a0Abs Hospital. In the first half of the year, it received nearly 700 patients suffering from malnutrition. In August, the case load was double the average monthly total, according to hospital staff.\u00a0Read More\"Our clinic usually takes between 100 and 150 cases in a month, and in one month we have received approximately double the amount. While at the same time, medical supplies have decreased,\"\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Al Ashwal\u00a0said.\"The hardest part is when we lose a child when there could have been a chance for them to survive --\u00a0if the situation was different.\"\u00a0In 2019, the US contributed almost $1 billion to the UN appeal, but this year, it has donated less than half that so far, giving $411 million, UN data shows.Those cuts have\u00a0largely impacted\u00a0areas in the north controlled by the Iran-backed Ansarullah -- known as Houthi rebels -- whom the US and\u00a0several other donor nations\u00a0accuse of interfering in humanitarian operations.       Despite the US' sizeable cut in funding, it is still the biggest donor\u00a0to the UN's Yemen appeal.A spokesperson for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) told CNN that the country would resume all operations in the Houthi-controlled north \"when we are confident that our partners can deliver aid without undue Houthi interference and account for US assistance.\"The spokesperson pointed to unmet commitments from \"other donors\" as the reason for the funding shortfall among UN agencies in Yemen, saying \"the United States encourages all donors, including those in the Gulf region, to contribute additional funding, to fulfill their 2020 pledges in a timely manner, and for all assistance to be provided according to humanitarian principles.\"Support pledged\u00a0to the UN\u00a0by Saudi Arabia for Yemen more than halved this year. In 2019, it delivered more than $1 billion, and this year it has pledged $500 million.\u00a0The UN says that just $23 million of that money has come through its appeal.A spokesperson for Saudi Arabia's King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center told CNN the country had been ready to hand over the rest of the money in July but was now waiting to finalize agreements with the agencies \"to ensure that the pledged amount is not diverted to other purposes outside of fulfilling the humanitarian needs.\" Like the US, it cited concerns of appropriation of aid by the Houthi rebels.\"We expect that these agreements will be signed soon, and that the total remaining pledged amount will then be released immediately to the UN agencies and other international organizations,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0     In the UAE's case, it hasn't given anything to the UN appeal for Yemen this year so far, UN data shows. Last year it donated $420 million. A spokesperson for the UAE's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not confirm nor deny it had given nothing to the\u00a0appeal this year.\u00a0The spokesperson also mentioned concerns about Houthi rebels obstructing and diverting aid. \"As such, the UAE regularly evaluates the efficacy of its aid programs in Yemen and adjusts its approach accordingly. The UAE's commitment to the Yemeni people is\u00a0unwavering -- the UAE will continue to be one of the largest donors to Yemen for as long as support is required,\" they said.All three countries have donated tens of millions of dollars and other aid to Yemen through other channels outside of the appeal.The UN's humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told CNN on Monday that while the Houthis' obstruction is an issue, the funding crisis is having a far greater impact on the lives of Yemenis.\"What's bringing people to the brink of starvation is the fact that we have no money. And I do think it's particularly reprehensible for countries which were contributing last year, said they were contributing again this year and then not pay, because the effect of that is to give people the hope that maybe the help is coming and then when you don't pay, you dash their hopes,\" he told CNN's Becky Anderson on Connect the World.     The US, Saudi Arabia and UAE\u00a0are key actors in the Yemen conflict, and in 2018 and 2019 they were the biggest donors to the UN response in Yemen. On Tuesday, the 75th UN General Assembly opens with several sessions on Yemen scheduled to take place. Multiple sources from UN humanitarian response teams told CNN they hoped countries would pledge more funds at the assembly to fill the deficit left by the three countries' cuts this year.The Houthis have\u00a0placed\u00a0harsh restrictions on UN agencies trying to access parts of the country it controls in the north. Tensions have been high since the World Food Program, along with the US and its allies, accused the Houthis of stealing food aid from other parts of Yemen.The\u00a0Houthi rebels overthrew the internationally recognized government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2015. A Saudi-led coalition, in which the UAE is a key partner, has waged a campaign against the Houthis for the past five years, destroying much of the Houthi-controlled areas with the US' backing. Previous CNN investigations have shown that the US government profited from the war, by\u00a0selling\u00a0Saudi Arabia and the UAE American-made bombs and armaments.A land, sea and air blockade was instated by Saudi vessels at the very start of the war to halt any support that they said could be sent to the Houthis by Iran. That has pushed up the price of staples and fuel, making it difficult for essential services, including ambulances, to keep running.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Document shows a system collapsingIn Yemen,\u00a080% of the population is dependent on aid. UN figures show that agencies have received\u00a0only 30%\u00a0of the roughly $3.4 billion they need to keep the country afloat. It's the worst situation there since the war began -- and is a huge slide from last year, when the humanitarian response was 87% funded.     Yemenis like Mushiraya Farah are feeling the impact.\u00a0On the outskirts of Abs, Farah\u00a0pushes her young son, Asim, along the street in a wheelchair. He is so malnourished, he can no longer walk. He was seen by doctors at a nearby hospital which has since been bombed and destroyed. With fuel too expensive and a lack of ambulances, Farah has nowhere to take him for treatment. Money has been scarce since Asim's father died in a road accident.\"Asim used to go out and study, like other little boys. It was a surprise when he started falling while walking. The doctors carried out tests and told me there's nothing wrong with him,\" she said, showing CNN her home, a small wooden frame with rags for a roof. The rags have started to tear and offer no protection from the elements.       After Asim became unable to walk, the doctors told Farah that malnutrition had stunted his development.She used to receive food aid, but not any longer. She does odd jobs and buys just enough food to keep herself and her son alive. All she has, she says, is prayer.\u00a0\"I pray for health. I pray for dignity. That's what I pray for -- health and dignity,\" she says.\u00a0\"It is in God's hands.\"\u00a0As a result of funding cuts, the\u00a0United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u00a0(UNOCHA)\u00a0-- which coordinates the international response in the country --\u00a0told CNN that UN agencies have already been forced to either close or reduce more than 75% if its programs this year alone, affecting more than 8 million people. Among the most significant are cuts to the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. In July, the Trump administration formally withdrew the US from the WHO.\u00a0The withdrawal goes into effect in July 2021.     In a confidential internal UN briefing document obtained by CNN, the full, devastating impact of that drawback is revealed in a rainbow of colors marking where aid programs have been closed and which are at imminent threat of shutdown if more funding isn't received. There is a lot of red, indicating what programs have already been closed or reduced, and very little green, where programs are well-funded.UN agencies confirmed to CNN the details of the document and almost all said they have had their funding seriously impacted.Among the agencies most affected is the World Food Program, which is only 44% funded. The WFP estimates that more than 66% of people in Yemen are considered \"food insecure,\" and that more than 14 million of them could die if their food assistance stops.     WFP usually delivers food supplies -- like flour, pulses, sugar and salt -- to\u00a013\u00a0million people a month in the country. Now\u00a08.5\u00a0million of those people received rations only every other month, essentially limiting their supply to half. If more funding isn't received, the other\u00a04.5\u00a0million will be in the same boat. Two-thirds of these supplies go to Houthi-controlled areas, most of which are more densely populated than other parts of the country.\u00a0\"Being forced to essentially halve the amount of food we distribute is\u00a0very worrying.\u00a0Yemen is at risk of sliding into famine if there are prolonged disruptions to food supply,\" the WFP's Yemen spokeswoman Annabel Symington told CNN.\u00a0UNICEF has warned that more than 2 million children under the age of five are suffering from malnutrition, and that with reduced funding for specialist medical units, 260,000 of these children could be forced to go without essential nutritional treatment.'We've stopped counting the dead'Getting a grasp on the big picture in Houthi-controlled Yemen is difficult. CNN spent weeks reaching out to the Health Ministry in Sanaa, local councils, aid organizations and doctors on the ground in northern Yemen for recent figures to show how many deaths here may have been caused by food shortages, or malnutrition. No one had any data on death numbers.UN sources told CNN they have similarly been struggling to conduct assessment surveys in the north. A UN map showing the current level of food insecurity around the country doesn't include these Houthi-controlled areas in the north.\u00a0And with an apparent excess in deaths, assumed to be from undetected Covid-19 cases, it's been difficult to even keep count of the dead. No one really knows if the deceased succumbed to coronavirus, malnutrition, or both.In the southwestern city of Taiz, a local gravedigger tells CNN that he and his fellow diggers are struggling to keep up with burials. They stopped counting the dead some time ago.\u00a0\"When coronavirus arrived in Yemen, it came around the end of the month of Ramadan ... since then, we've kept on digging and digging. We can't keep up,\" Tamim Yousef says as he digs under the sweltering summer heat.\u00a0\"You feel the worst pain with the children, when you have to bury a child. You feel sorrow, sadness. My thoughts go out to the parents.\"       It's a sentiment shared at Abs Hospital, where Dr. Al\u00a0Ashwal\u00a0laments that they have no way of knowing how many children might be dying at home, unable to reach treatment.Medical staff all over the country are wondering how much longer they can hold on for.\u00a0In northern Yemen's Aslam, one of the hardest-hit districts, a specialist malnutrition unit has had all its funding suspended. It usually receives the majority of its financial support from the World Health Organization, but the UN says it doesn't have enough money to keep programs like this going.Qais Ahmed, a nurse at the clinic, says the patients still come and the staff just can't turn them away. He says the biggest challenge is the power outages and general lack of resources.\"We have no monitors, and the oxygen equipment when the power stops...\" he pauses, finding it hard to go on. \"Sometimes, if it stops, children can suffocate. This is the worst part and there is nothing you can do to save them.\"Journalists from Tell Your Tale Productions reported from various locations in Yemen and Yousef Mawry reported from Dearborn, Michigan. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Angela Dewan, Nada Bashir and Barbara Arvanitidis reported from London, Sarah Sirgany and Nada Altaher reported from Abu Dhabi, and Jennifer Hansler reported from Washington, DC.",

        "content": "(CNN)John spent his 16th birthday the same way he's spent every day during the UK's Covid-19 lockdown \u2014 alone in a cell for 23 hours, with no visits, no internet and few phone calls. He is one of hundreds of children locked up in UK prisons, the forgotten casualties of Covid-19.\"It gives you a lot of time to think and my thoughts aren't always positive,\" John tells his lawyer, Jude Lanchin, on the rare occasion that she gets access to the prison video link service. \"I struggle to sleep,\" he adds.In the UK, teens and children aged 18 and younger are held in what the government refers to as secure children's homes, secure training centers and young offender institutions. The lawyers we spoke to universally refer to such institutions as prisons.A CNN crew was allowed to observe Lanchin's call with her client and has changed his name due to UK reporting restrictions for ongoing criminal cases involving children.A CNN crew observed lawyer Jude Lanchin's call with her teenage client in north London on June 26.\"I get thirty minutes out a day and then apart from that I'm just in my cell, just thinking,\" John says. \"There's a lot of time to think, and it messes with your head a little bit.\"Read MoreThe restrictions have been imposed by the UK government as part of the Covid-19 lockdown. Visits have been temporarily suspended and time outside of prison cells has been severely reduced, as part of broader measures to enforce social distancing in prisons due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?According to multiple lawyers and experts CNN has spoken to, these restrictions have left children like John in solitary confinement. The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, known as the Mandela rules, define solitary confinement as 22 hours a day or more without meaningful human contact.  A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice's prison and probation service told CNN: \"The decision to impose restrictions on daily life was taken on the basis of expert public health advice and has helped save lives, but we know this is difficult for children and that's why mental health support and education continued throughout.\" \"Video calls have also been increased, children have been given extra phone credit to keep in touch with their families and we have maximized in-room activities. We are now working to safely relax restrictions and reintroduce visits in the coming weeks.\"Impact on children's mental healthJude Lanchin has grown increasingly concerned about her client's welfare. \"There's many times when I have phoned him and he has just sounded very, very low,\" she recalls. John, who was ordered to be detained while awaiting trial due the severity of the alleged offense, has been waiting for a trial that has been indefinitely postponed due to Covid-19. Still innocent until proven guilty, he has no idea how much longer he will have to wait. Lanchin has requested the court grant him bail due to the severity of the conditions, but so far has been unsuccessful. John is Black, and Lanchin believes institutionalized racism has affected his case. Rather than being treated as a child facing solitary confinement, Lanchin believes the courts have treated him as an adult who may pose a threat to society. \"They're not seen as children. They're not seen as young people,\" she explains. CNN asked the Ministry of Justice when the recommendations outlined in the Lammy Review to address racism in the criminal justice system would be implemented but did not receive a response to this question.From the front lines, Black nurses battle twin pandemics of racism and coronavirusCampaigners are worried that the prolonged solitary confinement could have a long-lasting impact on children's mental health. Lanchin says that John requested mental health support when he first entered prison, but only received it several months later. \"Many of the young people coming in are from Black and minority ethnic background and by definition [...] they will be amongst the poorest in our country,\" shadow justice secretary David Lammy told CNN. \"Many of them will have experienced trauma in different aspects of their life. And many of them will have been pimped or abused by adults who have put them in this criminal setting.\"Minorities overrepresented in prisons Government data on English and Welsh prisons reflects an overrepresentation of people of color and other ethnic minorities being locked up. They make up 27% of the overall prison population, according to government data from March 2020. And in the youth prison population, Blacks and other ethnic minorities make up more than half of the inmates, custody data from May 2020 shows. But the 2011 census shows Blacks, Asians and other ethnic minorities represent just 14% of the general population. While the overall number of children in custody has fallen significantly in the past ten years, this decline has been less among the minority ethnic population, Tim Bateman, deputy chair of the National Association for Youth Justice, explains. \"The level of representation depends on the background -- it's more pronounced among African and Caribbean children and mixed heritage,\" he said. \"It's an absolutely shocking pattern.\"     The disproportionate number of Black children and children from other ethnic minorities in custody and their worsening conditions during the Covid-19 lockdown are part of an ongoing debate on racial inequality in the country.Following Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the UK over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities with a comment piece in the Daily Telegraph.But Lammy, who penned a government-commissioned report in 2017 into the treatment of Black, Asian and other ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system, dismissed the plan as a meaningless gesture, written on the back of a cigarette packet.  Lammy Review recommendationsIn an interview with CNN, Lammy said he was \"appalled\" at the systemic use of prolonged solitary confinement for young people in prisons, where Black and other minority children are disproportionately represented.\"It's deeply, deeply shocking and concerning to find out that young people in our own country are being treated in this horrendous way,\" he said. \"Coronavirus is a challenge for the system, but it is not a call for democratic countries like our own to abandon norms we have fought hard for in this country. It's very, very disappointing and worrying that we're treating young people in this way.\"In his report, the Labour MP made 35 specific recommendations to improve the justice and criminal system for minorities, including so-called \"deferred prosecution,\" which allows offenders who have had no more than one conviction, and who present a low risk to the public, to voluntarily agree to a rehabilitation program before entering a plea, as an alternative to prosecution.'The greatest trick racism ever pulled was convincing England it doesn't exist'The government responded to Lammy in February 2020, saying it had made progress on some of the comments included in the review, including recommending the \"deferred prosecution\" model and a commitment to publishing more and better data on race and ethnicity.However, Lammy told CNN the government had been \"very slow to implement my recommendations.\" \"Our youth justice system has not been reformed since the early days of Tony Blair in which we made a commitment to reduce the number of young people in the youth justice system and in prison. And we managed to do that,\" he said. \"But what we did not reduce are the amount of Black and Minority Ethnic young people in the system. That has grown and grown and grown.\"CNN asked the Ministry of Justice when the recommendations outlined in the Lammy Review to address racism in the criminal justice system would be implemented but did not receive a response to this question.'Inhumane' conditionsJohn, the 16-year-old living in prison during lockdown, says the months of solitary confinement have caused his mental health to suffer. \"Before I say I'm very stable in that sense but now [...] I can be fine one second then the next ... I would say it's deteriorating ... honestly because I realize it's myself, that's what's kind of the worrying part, like, I'm seeing myself. I can be fine one second and then I'll think of something and then my whole mood just changes.\"  According to multiple lawyers CNN has spoken to, John is not alone in feeling this way. Laura Janes is the legal director of the Howard League for Penal Reform, a charity that works with children in prison and has published a report that raises concerns about the \"severe\" regime children are being placed under due to Covid-19. Tens of thousands of Britons have died from coronavirus. But Boris Johnson is stoking a culture war.Janes has been receiving near daily calls from children in custody and has noticed a dramatic worsening in their conditions.\"Lots of them are awake all night and sleeping in the day, it's very common thing that happens when you're locked in a small space without any stimuli for a long time,\" Janes tells CNN.She believes the conditions are inhumane. \"As a parent, if you were to lock your child in a bedroom or in a laundry room for 20 hours a day, I'm sure social services would absolutely justified in looking into that and taking serious action,\" she says.The legal system in the UK is divided up by region so these conditions only apply to prisons in England and Wales. CNN contacted the Scottish prison service and learned that children continued to spend most of their time out of their cells during lockdown, due to the small number of inmates. Richard Stewart, a press officer for the Northern Ireland's department of justice told CNN \"an adjusted regime has been put in place which actively promotes social distancing,\" and restricts movement with no mixing between children in other units. He added that there is no solitary confinement of children there. Legal counsel restrictions Lawyers tell CNN that Covid-19 restrictions have also prevented children from accessing their legal counsel. For those with ongoing cases, this is especially troubling. Mel Stooks is a solicitor representing several children in English prisons. Despite the UK government saying it would install telephones in all cells, Stooks has several clients who claim not to have one. She tells CNN that the communication barriers are threatening children's basic right to legal advice.\"I have not been able to have a single phone call with my client since he was remanded ... five weeks ago.\" Stooks tells CNN. The Ministry of Justice said it would be providing extra telephones for inmates during Covid-19 in 55 jails but stopped short of saying the phones would be available for all inmates.John's conversation with his lawyer, Lanchin, is the first video call they have had. As the conversation ends, John becomes quiet, a hint of sadness creeping into his voice as he politely responds to Lanchin's questions.  Lanchin reassures him: \"I'll be in touch next week anyway, on Monday, I'll give you a call. Alright?\"\"Alright.\" John replies quietly. \"Take care, very, very nice to see you, finally,\" Lanchin continues. John responds: \"Nice meeting [...] you finally as well.\"  The time is up and the call ends. John must return to his cell to spend further hours alone. Lanchin stares at her laptop in shock as John disappears from the screen. \"Blimey, he looks about 12. My god, he's so young,\" she says.",

        "content": "London (CNN) \u2014 Racism in Britain may attract less global attention than in the United States, but it is no less present -- and Black Britons say it is past time for the country to face up to its colonial history and act to stamp out racial inequalities.The police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis sparked global protests over police brutality and racial inequality despite an ongoing pandemic which has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities in the UK and US. In Britain, where public trust in institutions has been eroded by examples of systemic racism over decades, thousands have turned out to join Black Lives Matter protests despite pleas from the government for people to stay home.And an exclusive CNN/Savanta ComRes poll reveals a divided nation, where Black people are twice as likely as White people to say they have not been treated with respect by police. Black people are also about twice as likely as White people to say UK police are institutionally racist -- among White people, just over a quarter believe it.Exposing further division, nearly two in three Black people say the UK has not done enough to address historical racial injustice, twice the proportion of White people who say that.Read MoreThe CNN poll has been released as the UK marks Windrush Day, introduced in 2018 to celebrate the arrival on June 22, 1948 of the Empire Windrush. The ship carried the first large group of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean to Britain -- at the invitation of the government -- to rebuild the country after World War II.But the Windrush generation and their children say they continue to suffer as a result of policies pursued by Conservative governments. Some lost their jobs, while others were evicted from their homes or faced deportation after decades living in Britain legally. Glenda Caesar, who traveled with her parents from Dominica to Britain as a baby in 1961, says she suddenly lost her job as an administrator with the National Health Service in 2009 as she was unable to provide the necessary documentation. She fell into debt, unable to pay her bills without a wage, and nearly lost her home, she said. Glenda Caesar.A decade on, now aged 58, she has been unable to find another job despite being given British citizenship shortly after her plight was highlighted in the media. Her son, who was born in Britain in 1988, was also given citizenship. \"I was fighting for myself and for my son at the time -- that was the thing that hurt me the most,\" she told CNN. \"Why should I have to fight for his right to be in this country when he was born here?\"Caesar, who spoke at protests this month in the east London neighborhood of Hackney where she lives and the Essex town of Southend, has, however, been heartened by the number, diversity and youth of the demonstrators she's seen.\"I think it's good for the world because now people are understanding what us, as a community, what we've been saying for a very long time. Where we haven't had the justice that we've always been searching for but now everybody has come together,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's good for the world because now people are understanding what us, as a community, what we've been saying for a very long time.\"\n Glenda Caesar\nShe thinks others are now ready to stand up for what they believe in. \"If we see a young Black man being surrounded by police and they are arresting him, people are now stepping forward and asking what's going on,\" she said. \"If we turn our backs it could be another George Floyd and I think we've had enough. I feel safe -- semi-safe -- with my grandchildren growing up because at least I feel people will be looking after them.\"But she is less positive about the outcome for her and others caught up in the Windrush scandal, saying \"we are still waiting\" to be properly compensated despite the government apologizing for its actions.She was offered a payout of a little over \u00a322,000 ($27,200) in December under the government's Windrush Compensation Scheme but -- despite her continued difficult financial circumstances -- turned it down as she felt it was insultingly low.\"So far 12,000 people have been given documentation to confirm their status, more compensation payments are being made every week and in the case of Ms. Caesar we are working with her representatives to review and resolve her claim,\" a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \"The Home Secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs.\"CNN's poll found that 55% of Black people do not trust the government not to repeat something like the Windrush scandal again, while a majority say the Conservative Party is institutionally racist. CNN has sought comment from the Conservative Party and the government on the poll results.     Policing has long been the sharpest focal point for concerns over racial injustice in the UK. The government-mandated Macpherson inquiry in 1999, into the botched investigation of the murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racist attack by White youths in 1993, found that London's Metropolitan Police was \"institutionally racist.\" The current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, insisted in 2019 that the \"toxic\" label no longer applied to the force.But despite changes sparked by the Lawrence case and landmark Macpherson inquiry, Black people and other ethnic minorities in Britain are still disproportionately represented when it comes to police checks (known as stop and search), imprisonment, and deaths in custody. \u200bAccording to UK government figures, \u200bbetween April 2018 and March 2019, \u200bWhite people were subjected to stop and search at a rate of 4 per 1,000, compared to \u200bBlack people who were stopped and searched at a rate of 38 per 1,000.Black Britons say their own experiences, and those of others in their communities, highlight disparities in treatment and fuel distrust.Five Black British friends gained global fame after a picture of one of them carrying an injured White man to safety from the middle of the crush of a violent London protest went viral. Clashes broke out as far-right groups targeted Black Lives Matter demonstrations. The White man was later confirmed to be a former police officer. Patrick Hutchinson, the Black man who carried him from the scene, said he helped the injured demonstrator because he did not want the main message of the protests to be overshadowed by one moment of violence.In an interview some days later, he told CNN he believed the police to be institutionally racist. \"There may be individuals within the system who are trying to do a good job but as a collective they are racist,\" he said.Patrick Hutchinson at the protest. Left to right: Chris Otokito, Lee Russell, Patrick Hutchinson, Jamaine Facey and Pierre Noah. Pierre Noah, another of the five friends, said the situation with regards to policing in Britain was \"a mess\" and that everyone, from the top down to the grassroots, needed to be educated on the issue.\"Do we feel protected by police? Not at all. I don't think the police are quite sure how to approach our community,\" he said. \"They haven't been educated enough how to deal with us in the community.\"\"From when I was young to the kids now, honestly, from my heart, every day I pray for them. It's gone backwards. It's worse and it shouldn't be the case.\"\n\n\"It's gone backwards. It's worse and it shouldn't be the case.\"\n Pierre Noah\nAsked what he thought the police see when they look at him, Hutchinson replied: \"Color, race. Color -- first thing they notice and that should be the last thing they notice.\"In response to the protests, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a review of racial inequality in Britain. But critics say he could instead implement the recommendations made in numerous past reports going back decades.Opposition Labour Party politician David Lammy, who published a comprehensive review of racial inequality in the criminal justice system in 2017, told Johnson he \"needs to stop the dither and the delay,\" tweeting, \"Young and old, black and white, rich and poor, the country is crying out for action.\" Nurse and entrepreneur Neomi Bennett, from London, was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to nursing in 2018 and met with the Prime Minister in January this year. But she too says she has been impacted by her encounters with Britain's justice system.The Guardian newspaper detailed Thursday how police officers approached Bennett one night in April 2019 in southwest London as she was in her car, saying her front windows were tinted too dark. She says she was too intimidated and scared to get out of the vehicle as repeatedly instructed. After several minutes of increasingly heated exchanges, she was pulled from the car and ended up under arrest and in a police cell overnight.Neomi Bennett. Bennett, 47, was found guilty in September of resisting and obstructing the police, but her conviction was overturned last month after she lodged an appeal which was not contested. She now intends to pursue a civil claim against the Metropolitan Police for wrongful arrest, among other charges.\"I think that the police approached me because they saw a couple of Black people sitting in a car. I believe I was racially profiled,\" she told CNN.A Metropolitan Police statement said the force had received a number of complaints relating to this incident, one of which remained under assessment.\"A complaint regarding discriminatory behavior, incivility, neglect of duty and use of force found no case to answer for. The complainant appealed this decision via the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and they decided the appeal was not upheld. Due to the current complaint, we cannot go into any more detail at this time.\"Bennett said seeing what happened to George Floyd had pushed her to go public despite the acute embarrassment she says she feels about her own experience.\"When I watched that, I was in tears, I was beside myself, because it was so reminiscent of that time in the cell, the power that the authorities have got,\" she said. \"As a Black woman in this country, if you say 'it's a race thing' or if you say 'it's because I'm Black' you are instantly shut down and told you have a chip on your shoulder. When this happened, it was too clear.\"\n\n\"It seems like for a Black person in the UK, life is constant fighting. There are so many barriers, if you want to achieve anything you have to fight.\"\nNeomi Bennett\nHer grandparents were part of the Windrush generation, arriving in Britain from Jamaica in the 1960s to give their family greater opportunities. \"I am so grateful for that and I've never taken my Britishness for granted,\" she said. \"I'm proud to be British, but to be constantly faced with these microaggressions and then spend the night in a cell, it was like 'I cannot keep it to myself anymore.'\"Bennett also worries for her two sons, one 24 and the other 29, both of whom have recently been stopped by police, she said.The nurse, who suffered racial abuse while growing up in London, hopes the protests will mark a pivotal moment. \"It just feels like the racism has reached a tipping point in regards to the injustices that we are seeing play out before us in front of our eyes,\" she said.\"It seems like for a Black person in the UK, life is constant fighting. There are so many barriers, if you want to achieve anything you have to fight.\"So what does Britain need to do to change? CNN's poll has shown how sharply the nation is divided along race lines, whether it comes to policing, representation or history.Protesters' demands for statues commemorating people who profited from the slave trade to be toppled have highlighted a wider issue: that too little is done to educate many Britons about their nation's colonial past.CNN's polling found Black people are twice as likely to support the removal of those statues as White people.\"I don't believe we should have slave owners looking over us because that's why we are in this position right now. Why would we idolize slave owners?\" Caesar said.\"We need to start putting Black history on the curriculum so children who are growing up don't need to ask us awkward questions. They already know about the Tudors and so on -- they need to know about our history as well.\" She believes more training for police on the subject would improve relations too. File photo of Menelik Shabazz with Sheryl Lee Ralph and Joy Coker. Many believe there also needs to be greater representation of minorities in the cultural environment shaping people's everyday lives.Black people are more than twice as likely as White people to say there is too little representation of Black people in film and television, according to CNN's poll, with two-thirds of Black people saying that and a quarter of White people.Filmmaker Menelik Shabazz, who was born in Barbados and moved to Britain at the age of five, said the current moment could give new energy to those calling for greater representation but cautioned that previous initiatives over the four decades he has spent in the industry had resulted in little change.My Black Life MattersWe're not saying our Black lives matter more than you.We're saying our Black lives matter too.Part of me wants to plead, beg to be respected -- say my life matters because I'm a nurse or an artist, a taxpayer, family man -- as though these are things to be bartered with, justified.But no, my life matters because I am human. I breathe, I get scared sometimes, I make mistakes. I appreciate the sunsets, I smile at the kids hiding behind their parent's legs, I wake late. I love endlessly.My Black life matters because I live.And if we aren't heard with a knee, or with a raised fist, how else can we resist?I think the greatest trick racism ever pulled, was convincing England it doesn't exist.-- Piers Harrison-Reid, June 2020Shabazz, whose 1981 debut \"Burning an Illusion\" was only the second feature film by a Black director produced in the UK, encountered so many obstacles in finding funding for other film and TV projects that for years he turned his focus elsewhere, including establishing Black Filmmaker Magazine. He believes there is too little diversity in senior ranks, which helps perpetuate racial stereotypes, such as portraying young Black men in relation to crime.Shabazz spoke to CNN from Harare, Zimbabwe, where the 66-year-old now plans to spend more time than in England. \"It's a signature of my tiredness at having to keep fighting, having these battles and having to get these things done, and when your vision and your world isn't seen as important or significant,\" he said of the move.\"The way in which the media presents Black people informs the wider society, and it then plays out in day-to-day situations with Black men in particular -- women too, of course, but Black men are at the front end in so many ways. You have to look at what is in the media, what is the education narrative that's in schools, in terms of colonial empire. It's a sense that our story has no value, so we can then be manipulated and ignored -- and the Windrush scandal is another example of that scenario.\"Piers Harrison-Reid, a nurse and performance poet based in the east of England, wrote a poem for CNN to mark this moment.\"And if we aren't heard with a knee, or with a raised fist, how else can we resist?\"I think the greatest trick racism ever pulled, was convincing England it doesn't exist.\"CNN's Gabrielle Smith, Tara John, Alex Platt and Mark Baron contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Bogota, Colombia (CNN)New videos obtained by CNN provide chilling insight into a mystery drone attack against Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro last year\u2014the world's first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone, purchased online and armed by hand with military grade explosives.One man has come forward as an organizer of the attack, saying it was perpetrated by a group of Venezuelan Army defectors and others. In an exclusive interview with CNN, he recounted how they prepared for the attack, and provided cell phone videos of their drones, explosives, and practice flights in the rural farmlands of Colombia. \"We have tried every peaceful and democratic way to bring an end to this tyranny that dresses itself as democracy,\" he told CNN on condition of anonymity, referring to the Maduro regime. \"We have friends who are in custody, tortured. This was a hard decision.\"He also acknowledged that the attack could have killed innocent civilians alongside their target. \"That was the risk we had to take,\" he said. \"We cared about that as the Venezuelan people are always the ones feeling the consequences.\"Security forces check a nearby building after an explosion was heard during Maduro's speech.The self-declared interim president of Venezuela, its opposition leader Juan Guaido, told CNN he disapproved of the attack.Read More\"Such options are not good,\" he said. He added that he suspected the attack was staged. \"I think this was something internal, done by the government. It ends up making them look like victims.\"US National Security advisor John Bolton said the morning after the attack that it might have been faked to provide the Maduro government with a \"pretext,\" perhaps for a crackdown. Yet since then, US officials briefed on the intelligence tell CNN they believe it was a genuine attack gone wrong. Chaos in CaracasIn August 2018, chaos descended in the middle of Caracas.As Maduro addressed a military parade on Avenida Bolivar, one of the capital's main thoroughfares, the sound of an explosion suddenly scattered civilians and soldiers alike. State news cameras and social media at the event captured fragmented images of mass confusion\u2014smoke rising above the city, a formation of soldiers scattering, bodyguards leaping to shield the president.Maduro survives apparent drone assassination attempt Only later would the story be pieced together: Two small drones flying over the event had exploded. Neither was close enough to do lethal damage, though seven members of the Venezuelan National Guard were injured. An unharmed Maduro would later say that he thought the explosions were fireworks.In the aftermath, dozens of people were arrested as Venezuelan officials launched an investigation to work out who had orchestrated the apparent attack. Some were tortured, activists say, while others on the government's list of suspects remain at large. Maduro also blamed far-right activists and the Colombian government, which denied any responsibility.The attack organizer told CNN that Colombia was not involved. He said that the drone attack was orchestrated by a group including defectors from the Venezuelan military, with the aim to assassinate Maduro.The attacker claimed that he met with several US officials three times after the attack. \"After, they set up three meetings which I imagine was to collect information to study the case, but it didn't go past that,\" he said. Still from video provided by the attacker.\"They wanted to get information and then we asked for things in return. They took notes on this, and we asked if they would be able to help. Then they simply left with their notes, and they never appeared again.\"A US State Department spokesman declined to comment on the alleged meetings, but said: \"Our policy is to support a peaceful transition in Venezuela.\" CNN has not found proof that the meetings happened.The plan was foiled by guards who caused the drones to explode prematurely, the attacker says. The cell phone signal blockers that protect the president suddenly came back on, causing the blasts.The Venezuelan government's account of the attack, provided by the interior minister, confirms parts of their story, including the drones' flight paths.Still from video provided by the attacker, showing one of his group's drones.The attack was prepared on a rented farm in rural Colombia. Weeks before Maduro's speech, the Venezuelan defectors had ordered commercially available drones online from the United States, and customized them to detonate a homemade bomb through the remote control app. In the videos the defector provided to CNN, you can hear men complaining that the drones' screws are too tiny. It's hard to read the Chinese lettering on the boxes, one says.Videos also show the group practicing the tricky bit: flying the drones high enough to avoid detection, and then swooping down at a steep angle to strike their target. They practice in different scenarios: amid green hills over a swimming pool, launched out of a car window, under cover of night. One drone would be later blown up in a test.Later, they dismantle the machines to be smuggled across the border into Venezuela. Once back in their homeland, they would slowly rebuild the two drones destined for the president.",

        "content": "(CNN)Finding jurors to sit in the trial for the three men charged in Ahmaud Arbery's killing is proving difficult in the Glynn County, Georgia, courtroom where jury selection began this week.Hundreds of people have been summoned, and from the 60 people who have been questioned since last Monday, many said they have already formed strong opinions about the case, know the defendants or are scared to sit. They point to potential consequences specific verdicts may have on the community. One prospective juror said that while she doesn't know much about the case itself, she has seen Facebook headlines and \"I run with Ahmaud\" bumper stickers across town. She expressed concern about how polarizing the case has been among the community.Ahmaud Arbery's father says he is praying for the 'right jury' as selection continues\"I think it would be naive to think there couldn't be real world repercussions,\" the woman said, adding she wouldn't let fear stop her from trying to weigh the case fairly. Those picked will be tasked with deciding whether Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and their neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan Jr., are guilty of malice and felony murder. The defendants, who have pleaded not guilty, also face charges of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit a felony.Read MoreArbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was out for a jog in Brunswick, Georgia, was shot and killed on February 23, 2020. The McMichaels said they were conducting a citizen's arrest on Arbery, who they suspected of burglary, and that Travis McMichael shot him with a shotgun in self-defense.Bryan, who recorded the video, allegedly hit Arbery with his truck after he joined the McMichaels in chasing Arbery. After the shooting, the three men were allowed to leave the scene and weren't arrested until the video of the incident was made public more than two months later, sparking outrage and nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice. \"Nobody deserves to be gunned down depending on the situation,\" one prospective juror said during questioning, adding he has watched the video in the case and is nervous. \"My opinion is Ahmaud was murdered.\"Asked whether he would consider evidence presented in court, the man said he would if it was \"legitimate evidence\" and added he would try his best to be fair and impartial. \"But, I mean, based on the video, Ahmaud was unarmed and the other two were not. It's kind of hard to show it's self-defense there,\" he told prosecutors. JUST WATCHED'I have concerns': Mother of Ahmaud Arbery as jury selection begins in murder trialReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'I have concerns': Mother of Ahmaud Arbery as jury selection begins in murder trial 02:28Attorneys for Gregory McMichael made it known Monday they want to ask more questions of potential jurors because of what attorney Laura Hogue calls \"an unfair system that has been accompanied by movements.\" She specifically mentioned the Justice for Ahmaud mantra, often shouted by demonstrators, which she says encourages a guilty verdict.The additional questions would include whether the amount of time that elapsed between the date of the incident and the arrests of Gregory and Travis McMichael and William Bryan had any effect on the way the juror may think about the case and whether the potential juror would want someone with the juror's views and life experience on the jury.The defense also wants to hypothetically ask if the jury was headed to a not guilty verdict, would they be concerned that verdict would impact their standing in the community, a motion Judge Timothy Walmsley already rejected.Additionally, defense attorneys want to ask potential jurors in detail about the citizen's arrest law. The Georgia law has significantly changed since Arbery's killing and is expected to be a key part of the defense's case. Prosecutors seemed surprised by the motion and said they were not prepared to respond. Walmsley also seemed surprised and said he would continue under the current questioning plan until he has a chance to fully look into the motion.A process longer than usualThursday's roughly 12-hour day concluded the first week of jury selection after attorneys completed three 20-person panels. So far, 23 prospective jurors have been accepted by both the state and defense attorneys for continued consideration.Twelve jury members and four alternates will be selected for the trial. Jury selection continues this week.\"It could get into next week,\" Walmsley, who had earlier appeared to grow frustrated at the slow pace of the review, told qualified potential jurors Thursday. \"Possibly into the week after.\"Compared to cases that have not received similar media attention, the time it's taking to select jurors is \"extremely long,\" said CNN legal analyst Page Pate.Murder trial for the killing of Ahmaud Arbery begins with jury selection in Georgia\"For a case that's this high profile, I would say it's on the longer side,\" Pate said. \"The surprise being that ... they could only find 23 (people) who were impartial enough just to make it to step number two. That's unusual. That's extremely unusual.\"Jason Sheffield, an attorney for Travis McMichael, told CNN the defense has not asked for a change of venue because they believe they will be able to find fair and impartial jurors, \"despite the global coverage of this case.\"\"To ask for a change of venue, we have to find enough evidence that our jury pool is so tainted that we cannot find a fair and impartial jury,\" he told CNN on Friday. \"The way we get there is by questioning each and every individual juror, listening to their thoughts and opinions about the case, what they think they know and what they would be willing to consider and whether they would be able to keep an open mind.\"So far, Sheffield said, defense attorneys have been \"pleased with the number of jurors that can do this.\"\"We will continue to monitor the situation and we will make our daily assessments of whether or not it will be proper to move to change the venue,\" Sheffield said.CNN has reached out to prosecutors for comment. Pate said he's not surprised so many of the potential jurors had heard about the case -- not only because of the media coverage but because of how small the community is.\"What does surprise me is the number of people who already have a fixed opinion that they're all (the defendants) guilty,\" Pate said. A demonstrator holds a sign at the Glynn County Courthouse as jury selection begins in the trial of Arbery's shooting death on October 18, 2021 in Brunswick, Georgia.Many knew Arbery or the defendants In the small community rattled by the shooting, many who are now being questioned as potential jurors in the trial say they know at least one person in the case. Kevin Gough, an attorney for Bryan, called the Brunswick community -- Satilla Shores, where the shooting took place, is a suburb of that city -- a \"fishbowl\" where everyone knows each other. One prospective juror said Bryan looked familiar. Another said he knew a neighbor of the McMichaels who was among the first people to arrive on the scene after the shooting. Another person said a family member was among the first responders who was dispatched to the shooting. A timeline of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and the case against 3 men accused of his murderOne man, who said he met Travis McMichael at a hunting club and has known Bryan for roughly two decades, said that even though he's not a close friend of either of the two men, knowing them made it difficult for him to serve as an impartial juror. \"Just knowing somebody, yes, it would,\" the man said.Others are familiar with Arbery's family, with Sheffield noting on the third day of jury selection that a potential juror appeared to give a thumbs up and a nod to the Arbery family on their way out of the courtroom. At least two dozen potential jurors also indicated to attorneys they had negative feelings against the three men charged in the case. One woman, when asked why she indicated she has negative feelings against Greg McMichael, replied, \"I don't really know the person, but I have to admit, someone taking someone else's life to me is a serious offense.\"JUST WATCHEDAhmaud Arbery was out jogging when he was shot and killedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAhmaud Arbery was out jogging when he was shot and killed 02:20Others are scared to sitOther jurors who have gone through the selection process expressed concerns about possible repercussions if they were chosen to serve on the panel set to deliver the verdict in the case. One potential juror who was questioned said he believed it would be \"difficult to change my mind\" about whether the three men were guilty (of Arbery's death). He said he fears there will be only one verdict that's accepted in today's climate, and if that verdict is not returned, some may threaten violence \"again.\"\"The jury is in a tough spot once they're convened,\" the man said. Fear of violent protests and outside agitators has been a recurring theme for Glynn County residents ever since the video of Arbery's shooting surfaced. While the community has seen many protests since then, they have all remained peaceful. While others did not specifically mention concerns over impacts to the community, they said they did not want to serve on the jury, with several telling attorneys they were nervous and some getting emotional during questioning. One potential juror said, \"I don't feel comfortable. I don't like crowds and people and pressure.\"Correction: This story has been updated to correct the description of charges against the defendants.",

I love my Black people!\" said Marcus Arbery, Sr. this week as he neared the steps of the Glynn County Superior Court in Brunswick, Georgia, during jury selection proceedings in the trial against the three men charged in the killing of his 25-year-old son Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia in February 2020. Arbery Sr. was speaking directly to a group of supporters who traveled to Brunswick from across the country to support the family.  \"We love you too!\" replied the small crowd surrounding him, some of them spontaneously embracing Arbery Sr.The supporters are part of the Washington, DC, based group Transformative Justice Coalition, which says it \"seeks to be a catalyst for transformative institutional changes that bring about justice & equality in the US & abroad.\" Ahmaud Arbery's father says he is praying for the 'right jury' as selection continuesThe group, led by lawyers Barbara Arnwine and Darryl Jones, planned for a \"week of action\" organizing daily activities in support of the Arbery family to coincide with the start of jury selection. TJC bused in 70 people from cities like Chicago, St. Louis, Milwaukee, New York, Philadelphia, Birmingham and Atlanta.  Read MoreAmong the things on their schedule was a visit, in coordination with local law enforcement, to the Satilla Shores neighborhood in Brunswick, where Arbery was killed.\"This young man ran this route all the time,\" said Arnwine, standing on the same road Arbery ran. \"They didn't know his name but they knew a Black man was running through the neighborhood.\"The subdivision in the outskirts of Brunswick is just less than two miles from Arbery's former home.  Back in front of the courthouse, coalition members showed up every morning, proudly standing by a banner bearing the image of the late Congressman John Lewis.  Loretta Elder traveled from Chicago to support the Arbery family as part of Transformative Justice Coaltion's week of action. \"We are fired up! Can't take it no more!\" they chanted walking around the grounds of the courthouse.  \"Ahmaud Arbery could've been anybody's child,\" said Lynn Whitfield, director of election protection at TJC. Whitfield, who coordinates the on-the-ground efforts, was outside the courthouse every day since Monday.  She says TJC has pledged to support the Arbery family until a verdict is reached, with the organization's two co-founders accompanying Arbery Sr. to court every day.  Among those making the week-long commitment was Peggy Neely Harris, 65, from Ferguson, Missouri.  Murder trial for the killing of Ahmaud Arbery begins with jury selection in Georgia\"We came all the way from several different states,\" said Neely Harris. \"We wanted to make sure we boarded the bus to come here and support Ahmaud Arbery and his family, and see what we can do to make a smooth transition into justice. We believe it will be done.\" She proudly wore a pin with Rep. Lewis' image with the words \"make good trouble\" printed in blue. \"He left a legacy that we can't do anything but support,\" said Neely Harris.  Inside the courthouse, several defense attorneys complained to the judge about the banners, signs and demonstrators in support of the Arbery family on court grounds. An attorney for Travis McMichael, one of the three defendants, said he was concerned the signs and demonstrations were \"an unconscious attempt to influence any jurors.\"Chatham Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley responded saying the courthouse grounds are public space. He then asked the objecting defense attorneys to draft a legal motion \"walking me through the First Amendment rights you seek to infringe upon and how you intend to do this.\"Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled the first name of Lynn Whitfield, director of election protection at the Transformative Justice Coalition.CNN's Martin Savidge contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Three White men accused of chasing down and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man out for a jog, are set to stand trial for murder in Georgia this week in a case thick with issues of racism, self-defense and cellphone video.Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William \"Roddie\" Bryan Jr. are charged with malice and felony murder and have pleaded not guilty. They also face charges of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment.Jury selection in their state trial began Monday in a Glynn County courtroom, where the three defendants sat next to their own counsel.According to the Glynn County Clerk of Superior and Magistrate Court, 600 potential jurors have been summoned to appear in an offsite location Monday, and the jurors will be placed in panels of 20 once they make their way to the Glynn County Superior Court. Another 400 potential jurors have been summoned to appear next Monday.By the end of the selection process, 12 jurors and four alternates will be chosen to serve.Read MoreArbery was fatally shot February 23, 2020, while out jogging in Brunswick in an incident partly captured on video. The McMichaels said they were conducting a citizen's arrest on Arbery, who they suspected of burglary, and that Travis McMichael shot him with a shotgun in self-defense. Bryan, who recorded the video, allegedly hit Arbery with his truck after he joined the McMichaels in chasing Arbery.A timeline of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery and the case against 3 men accused of his murderAfter the shooting, the three men were allowed to leave the scene and weren't arrested until after video of the incident was made public in early May.The video and the delay in making the arrests, along with the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor last year, helped spark nationwide Black Lives Matter protests that challenged how the legal system treats Black people.Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, spoke to CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday after jury selection began and said she \"never thought the day would come,\" noting it \"took over 600 days to get to this day.\"She added: \"This is the same community that stood outside today as I entered the courtroom and rallied for Ahmaud, so I do feel confident we will have success in this.\"The McMichaels and Bryan have also been indicted on federal hate crime and attempted kidnapping charges. They have pleaded not guilty to those charges as well.With its focus on video evidence, the case bears some resemblance to the trial of ex-Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murder in Floyd's death. In addition, the issues of vigilantism and self-defense offer similarities to the trial of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman who was acquitted in 2013 of killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.How we got hereDemonstrators protest the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery at the Glynn County Courthouse on May 8, 2020 in Brunswick, Georgia.Arbery was shot dead in a confrontation with Travis and Gregory McMichael in the neighborhood of Satilla Shores, outside the city of Brunswick in Georgia's lowcountry.Arbery was on a jog -- something he was known to do, according to those who knew him -- when the McMichaels grabbed their guns and pursued Arbery. Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and investigator in the local district attorney's office, later told police Arbery and his son had struggled over his son's shotgun, and that Travis McMichael shot Arbery after the latter attacked him, according to the initial police report.Bryan had joined the pursuit and recorded the shooting on his cellphone.Gregory McMichael told police he and his son had pursued Arbery because they suspected he was responsible for a string of recent purported burglaries in the neighborhood. A Glynn County Police spokesperson later said there had only been one burglary -- a gun stolen from an unlocked vehicle in front of the McMichaels' home -- reported in more than seven weeks prior to the shooting.Ahmaud Arbery's tragic final run grips an anxious AmericaAdditionally, McMichael said he saw Arbery inside a home under construction. Arbery was seen entering the home in surveillance video at the site, but the owner of the home told CNN he did not see Arbery commit any crime other than \"trespassing\" the day of the shooting.For months, the case lay dormant, and two prosecutors recused themselves due to conflicts of interest.But in May, video taken by Bryan of the fatal interaction was made public, and the McMichaels were arrested days later. The three were all jointly indicted by a grand jury in June 2020.At a preliminary hearing last June, Georgia Bureau of Investigation Assistant Special Agent in Charge Richard Dial testified Bryan told investigators he heard Travis McMichael use a racial epithet after shooting Arbery. McMichael had also used racial slurs numerous times on social media and on messaging services, Dial said.Attorneys for the three defendants have said they acted in self-defense. But Dial testified the opposite was true.\"I believe Mr. Arbery was being pursued, and he ran till he couldn't run anymore, and it was turn his back to a man with a shotgun or fight with his bare hands against the man with the shotgun. He chose to fight,\" he said. \"I believe Mr. Arbery's decision was to just try to get away, and when he felt like he could not escape, he chose to fight.\"The district attorney at the time, Jackie Johnson, was voted out of office amid the backlash. In September, she was indicted on charges of violating her oath as a public officer and obstructing a police officer for allegedly interfering with the arrest of Travis McMichael. Johnson has denied wrongdoing.CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Amir Vera contributed to this report.",

The case will be prosecuted by the state Attorney General's office.

A family spokesperson had previously blamed the shooting on an unidentified man in a blue truck. But Murdaugh admitted to authorities on Monday that he had conspired with a man -- identified by police as Curtis Edward Smith, a former client of Murdaugh -- to kill him as part of the scheme, according to an affidavit to support charges against Smith.Murdaugh decided to end his own life but believed his life insurance policy had a suicide exclusion, his other attorney Dick Harpootlian told NBC's \"Today Show,\" and that the scheme \"was an attempt on his part to do something to protect\" his eldest and only living child.Murdaugh appeared in court Thursday, where Hampton County Magistrate Judge Tonja Alexander set a $20,000 personal recognizance bond. Murdaugh was required to surrender his passport to SLED and sign a waiver of extradition. Harpootlian said in court that Murdaugh would be returning to an out-of-state rehabilitation center where he's being treated for an opioid addiction that Harpootlian says contributed to his financial issues.Murdaugh entered court handcuffed, wearing a beige prison jumpsuit and a mask, his glasses perched on top of his head. At one point Murdaugh appeared to wipe tears from beneath his glasses while Harpootlian described the killings of his wife Margaret and son Paul and the toll their deaths had on him. \"He has fallen from grace,\" Harpootlian said. \"But before any of that falling happened, his wife and son were brutally murdered, and that has had an extraordinary effect on him. So we'd ask you to allow him to go and help heal himself.\" If Murdaugh leaves the facility without permission, the judge said, his bond will be revoked and a bench warrant will be issued for his arrest. South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh, seen in this booking photo, was arrested Thursday after turning himself in on charges related to a failed insurance fraud scheme.Former client charged in suicide schemeSmith, 61, was charged Wednesday with assisted suicide, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, pointing and presenting a firearm, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, according to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.On Thursday, Hampton County Magistrate Judge Alexander set bond for Smith at $55,000. Asked if he was interested in a public defender, Smith replied, \"I'm probably going to look at one, yes,\" adding he would likely apply for one early next week. Alexander ordered Smith to appear for roll call on October 25 at the Hampton County courthouse. Smith must obtain an attorney within 15 days or his bond will be revoked, Alexander said, and he must keep the court notified of any changes of address.Curtis Edward Smith, 61, allegedly shot Alex Murdaugh in the head as part of a conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, according to an affidavit.Smith had a separate bond hearing Wednesday in Colleton County and received a $5,000 cash surety bond for a meth charge and a personal recognizance bond for a marijuana charge. He was transferred to Hampton County custody Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.After he was shot September 4, Murdaugh called 911 to report he had been shot on a road in Hampton County, according to SLED, and he was taken to a hospital in Savannah, Georgia.Authorities initially described Murdaugh's injury as a \"superficial gunshot wound to the head,\" though Murdaugh's attorneys said his skull was fractured in the shooting.\u200bMurdaugh allegedly provided Smith with a firearm and directed Smith to shoot him in the head. Smith admitted Tuesday to being present at the shooting and to disposing of the firearm afterward, the affidavit states. Murdaugh had represented Smith as his attorney on at least two occasions dating back to 2010, according to court records from the Colleton County 14th Judicial Circuit. He first represented Smith in a personal injury lawsuit that Smith brought against a land management company. Murdaugh is also listed as Smith's attorney for a 2013 traffic infraction, the court documents show.Alex Murdaugh walks into his bond hearing on Thursday, September 16, 2021, in Varnville, South Carolina.Authorities now investigating multiple deathsMurdaugh's arrest Thursday is the latest development in what's become a sprawling, high-profile crime saga unfolding in the southern region of the Palmetto State, where the Murdaugh family has been a powerful legal dynasty for decades. Over 87 consecutive years, three generations of Murdaughs served as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, an office that controls the prosecutions in Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties.Tragedy first struck in early June, when Alex Murdaugh's wife and son, Margaret and 22-year-old Paul, were shot dead outside the family's home in Islandton, about an hour north of Hilton Head Island, according to SLED. Colleton County Sheriff's deputies determined both victims had suffered multiple gunshot wounds.At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh was facing charges of boating under the influence (BUI), causing great bodily harm and causing death in connection to a 2019 boat crash that claimed the life of 19-year-old Mallory Beach, court records show. Paul had pleaded not guilty and court records show the charges were dropped after his death.About two weeks after the killings, SLED announced that, based on information gathered in the course of the investigation, it was reopening an investigation into the death of Stephen Smith, a 19-year-old whose body was found on a Hampton County road in 2015.South Carolina law enforcement opens criminal investigation into 2018 death of Murdaugh family's housekeeper  Then, on Wednesday, SLED said it was opening a criminal probe into the death of the Murdaugh's housekeeper in February 2018. Gloria Satterfield, who spent more than two decades working for the family, died in what was described as a \"trip and fall accident\" at the Murdaugh home, according to the attorney representing her estate, Eric Bland.The investigation was opened, SLED said, at the request of the Hampton County coroner, who highlighted inconsistencies with Satterfield's stated manner of death, as well as information gathered during SLED's other ongoing investigations involving Alex Murdaugh.\"The decedent's death was not reported to the Coroner at the time, nor was an autopsy performed,\" the coroner's request to SLED said. \"On the death certificate the manner of death was ruled 'Natural,' which is inconsistent with injuries sustained in a trip and fall accident.\"Murdaugh's shooting September 4 came a day after he resigned from his law firm following allegations he had misappropriated funds. Two days later, he released a statement saying he was entering rehab and that his law license had been suspended.

        "content": "(CNN)The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division on Wednesday announced it was opening a criminal investigation into the February 2018 death of Gloria Satterfield, a housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, and the handling of her estate. Satterfield died in 2018 in what was described as a \"trip and fall accident\" at the Murdaugh home, according to attorney Eric Bland, who is representing her estate.Satterfield spent more than two decades as a housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, which is now the focus of a mystery unfolding in South Carolina: First, Margaret Murdaugh and her son Paul were shot and killed in June. Now Alex Murdaugh, a prominent lawyer and the family's patriarch, has been accused by authorities of arranging for a former client to kill him earlier this month so his surviving son could collect a life insurance payout of about $10 million.Alex Murdaugh, who is expected to turn himself in Thursday, is the subject of multiple investigations in South CarolinaSLED said it is opening an investigation based upon a request from the Hampton County coroner that highlights inconsistencies in the ruling of Satterfield's manner of death, as well as information gathered during SLED's other ongoing investigations involving Alex Murdaugh.\"The decedent's death was not reported to the Coroner at the time, nor was an autopsy performed. On the death certificate the manner of death was ruled 'Natural,' which is inconsistent with injuries sustained in a trip and fall accident,\" the coroner's request to SLED said. Read MoreAfter Satterfield's death, a $500,000 wrongful death claim was filed against Alex Murdaugh on behalf of Satterfield's estate, Bland said. According to him, the estate has not yet received any of the $500,000 owed as the result of a civil settlement in 2018. Gloria Satterfield, a housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, is seen in this undated photo from an attorney for Satterfield's estate.CNN has reached out to attorneys representing Alex Murdaugh for comment.Bland filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of Satterfield's estate against Alex Murdaugh, among others.Bland told CNN's Chris Cuomo Wednesday that following Satterfield's death her family trusted Murdaugh to help them bring a lawsuit against himself on behalf of the estate.\"Certainly there were questions by my clients because after she unfortunately fell, she was airlifted to a hospital and she had a traumatic brain injury, she never was able to communicate with them for the next three weeks until she died,\" Bland told Cuomo. \"So, it was Alex Murdaugh who told the story of that she had tripped and fell down the stairs over his dogs.\"As authorities investigate the Murdaugh family killings, here's a look at who's who\"They trusted him,\" Bland said, describing Satterfield as part of the family's fabric after 25 years. \"He hand-walked them to his best friend and college roommate to bring a lawsuit against himself on behalf of the estate.\"According to Bland, a number of claims were made which all contributed to a settlement, but none of those settlements ever ended up in court, except one for around $500,000 from Lloyds of London insurance. \"There's no court orders approving any of these settlements. And it's required under the law, if you have a wrongful death or survival case, a judge has to approve the settlements. None of that exists in the court record, and our clients never found out that these cases had settled these claims, until it was printed in the paper by investigative reporters,\" Bland said.\"It's our job to get them answers, and get them their money back,\" Bland added.CNN's Dakin Andone contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Rosebud, South Dakota (CNN)Rose Long Face was 18 years old when she was taken to the first government-run boarding school for Indigenous children in the United States. Within two years, she died and never returned home.More than 140 years have passed since the Lakota girl and at least eight other children and young adults with ties to the Rosebud Sioux Tribe who attended the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. It was part of a campaign to assimilate Native children into White American culture.For six years, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, also known as Sicangu Lakota, negotiated the return of the remains of 11 children and young adults who have been buried there for generations. Next week, the remains of nine of those children will arrive in South Dakota, just as officials in the US and Canada confront the countries' grim history of Indigenous boarding schools.Remains of Native American children to be exhumed at site of former boarding school\"It was a government model... basically, eradicate the Indian in you and replace it with a White man way of thinking,\" said Rodney Bordeaux, president of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. \"'Take the Indian on and save the child' was kind of the talk back then.\"\"What they forgot is the real resiliency of who we are, how we came about, how we survived and how we're continuing to survive,\" he added.Read MoreThe Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the first off-reservation boarding school for Native American children, and was built on the abandoned Carlisle Barracks, according to the National Museum of the American Indian and the US Army War College. The college now occupies the site.The exhumation, announced last month, is the US Army's fourth disinterment project at Carlisle Barracks, after the Army moved human remains to the post's cemetery from the school's in 1927.The deceased are among more than 10,000 students, spanning about 50 tribes, who were brought from across the US to the school until it closed in 1918.The nine children and young adults are part of the more than 180 students buried on the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery in named and unnamed burials, according to the Office of Army Cemeteries.Four boys posing for a photo on the grounds of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879. Alvan Kills Seven Horses (One That Kills Seven Horses), second from left, was buried there and his remains are among those that will be repatriated to the Rosebud Sioux reservation next week.The students were between the ages of 12 and 18 when they arrived at the school, said Russell Eagle Bear, a council member in the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. Their names, according to the Office of Army Cemeteries, are: Dennis Strikes First (Blue Tomahawk); Rose Long Face (Little Hawk); Lucy Take The Tail (Pretty Eagle); Warren Painter (Bear Paints Dirt); Ernest Knocks Off (White Thunder); Maud Little Girl (Swift Bear); Alvan, aka Roaster, Kills Seven Horses, One That Kills Seven Horses; Friend Hollow Horn Bear; and Dora Her Pipe (Brave Bull).While some remains have been returned to their families and tribes in recent years, the remains of more than 100 people are still buried on the former school grounds, the OAC said. It's unclear which tribes the rest of the children came from \"due to poor record- keeping by the Indian Bureau during the operation of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School,\" the OAC said in a statement.A group of teens fought for the repatriationMalorie Arrow was a teenager when she and a few other members of the tribe's youth council made a stop on the grounds of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School after a 2015 trip to a conference in Washington, DC. \"It wasn't until we got to the grave sites that... till we got to the parking lot of the grave sites that we all started crying...like we all started crying, we all felt the energy there,\" said 22-year-old Arrow. That visit sparked a movement within the tribe, led by youth members on that trip who began asking their elders why they couldn't just bring the children home, said Akichita Cikala Hoksila Eagle Bear, 23, another member of the youth council. \"We got tired of waiting for someone to be our advocate so we had to become our own advocate. We saw a change that we needed so we became the change,\" said Asia Ista Gi Win Black Bull, 21, a youth council member.\"One little spark of the youth group, visiting Carlisle sparked a whole (Lakota) nation down here,\" she added.Rachel Janis, Asia Ista Gi Win Black Bull, Malorie Arrow and Akichita Cikala Hoksila Eagle Bear (left to right) are some of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe's youth council members who encouraged tribal leaders to negotiate the repatriation of children buried at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School.Next week, a delegation of relatives, tribal leaders and members of the youth council will travel with the remains as they made their journey to the reservation. Tribal members will then hold a ceremony near the Missouri River, which is the place where officials believe the children took a steamboat and began their trip to Pennsylvania, said Eagle Bear, the historic preservation officer said.\"That's the last time they saw their parents and relatives, not knowing where they were going or what was happening to them,\" he said.After relatives and tribe members pay their respects and pray for the children during a wake, the remains of seven of them will be buried at the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Veterans Cemetery and two in their family's land, according to Eagle Bear.Four male students posed on the grounds of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879. The remains of Dennis Strikes First (Blue Tomahawk), second from left, will be repatriated to the Rosebud Sioux reservation next week.US officials will investigate more boarding schools The children's homecoming is an opportunity for their descendants to heal but also a realization of how many more children are left to be found, Indigenous rights advocates and tribal members say. Last month, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced the launch of an initiative to investigate the Native American boarding schools that forced assimilation in the 19th and 20th centuries.Interior Department will investigate Indigenous boarding schools and identify burial sitesThe Department of Interior will review its past oversight of the school program, assess how it has impacted generations of families and identify boarding school facilities and burial sites across the country, Haaland said.The initiative was announced weeks after the discovery of unmarked graves on the grounds of former residential schools in Canada, renewing attention to the systemic abuse of Indigenous communities on both sides of the border.While the unmarked graves discovered in recent weeks were in Canada, Christine Diindiisi McCleave, chief executive of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, says similar discoveries could also take place in the US.\"If you look at the numbers here from the United States, we had twice as many schools. You can basically just estimate that our numbers will be double what they found in Canada,\" McCleave said.Because the coalition has been working for more than a decade in collecting records for the more than 300 boarding schools across the country, McCleave says federal authorities are taking on a challenging task.For McCleave, the recent discoveries of unmarked graves have brought up pain and trauma for many Indigenous communities, reminding them of their families' grief and how they lost their language and culture over the years.As the Sicangu Lakota prepare for the children's homecoming, they know there's much more to be done. \"This is the very start of the fire,\" Black Bull says. There are many children that remain unaccounted for and many former boarding schools that should be investigated, she said.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly characterized Russel Eagle Bear's role in the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.

        "content": "(CNN)Small town America had big dreams in the shape of the Keystone XL Pipeline. After a decade of stop-and-go progress, the project spearheaded by Canadian energy giant TC Energy seemed tangible for residents of central South Dakota.  Along I-90, small towns lie dormant waiting for warmer weather and a return of tourism to kick into high gear. Visitors headed for Mount Rushmore provide an economic lifeline for these small communities. And the pipeline had begun to emerge as another revenue stream that would keep towns afloat year round.  \"When TransCanada came along, we were, from a business standpoint, very excited. Because it's growth, it's opportunities,\" said Jeff Birkeland, a lifelong Murdo, South Dakota, resident and CEO of West Central Electric Cooperative.Birkeland laments the missed opportunities the pipeline could have brought to the region. He had invested over a decade of his professional life on the project. Read MoreThose dreams died on January 20, when President Joe Biden signed an executive order that revoked the building permit for the 1,200-mile project that would have passed though Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska.  From Keystone XL to Paris Agreement, Joe Biden signals a shift away from fossil fuels\"That was one of the things he ran on,\" Birkeland said. \"So I can't say it was a big shock. But when you finally hear it, it's a reality check for you. Thirteen years of my career have been spent on Trans Canada. It's tough.\" In the last 30 years, West Central Electric has gained 99 new households in its five-county service area. Economic life in Murdo, with a population of 444, had become stagnant.  Building two substations providing power to two pumping stations along the pipeline would have been an irrefutable growth opportunity, bringing in close to a $1 million monthly, according to Birkeland. That growth would have trickled down to their 3,700 co-op members across the region in the form of a $325 annual credit, effectively reducing their power bills. For now, both substations lie nearly completed and abandoned.  Birkeland also calculates the Murdo schools, with less than 200 students, missed out on tens of thousands of tax dollars that could have trickled down. It all changed overnightWithin hours of President Biden's executive order halting the pipeline, dozens of workers and their families left the small towns in central South Dakota and got on the road looking for a way to provide for their families, according to Tricia Burns, a rancher and owner of Ignite Wellness Center in Philip, South Dakota.\"There was a real sense of urgency and a real sense of fear and anxiety,\" Burns said. \"They need to get a move on and try and find something before all the jobs were taken. Most of them packed up and headed out. Some of them even left their stuff behind and said, 'when we figure out where their next move is, we'll come back and get the stuff.'\"  That was nearly two months ago, but Burns remembers it vividly. She lost nearly half of her members within hours, losing out on almost $3,000 dollars a month. Two contracts with security companies evaporated, she said.One of two energy substations near Murdo, South Dakota, meant to power oil pumps down the Keystone XL Pipeline. Both sit nearly completed and unused.Burns had also grown close to the workers and their families that had migrated into their community to help build the pipeline. One of her gym employees was among those who were forced to leave.\"Everything had been signed, sealed, delivered. The game rules were set. Everybody was playing fair,\" Burns said. \"This was going to be their home for four years, their daughter was going to get to graduate from high school here. And that was all taken away in an instant.\" Philip, South Dakota, located 15 miles north of the main east-west interstate, has a population of 779. Their main street is comprised of nearly a dozen small business, all kept alive by mutual support throughout the community. Brittany Smith, Philips' city manager, describes her hometown as \"resilient.\" But the halting of the pipeline has affected them, nonetheless.  \"We don't see a lot of growth. But we do see some,\" Smith said. \"And so this looked like an opportunity for the locals to benefit as well as the city and the county to benefit.\" TC Energy had awarded nearly $60,000 in grants to Philip while the project was ongoing. The money helped pay for a new pumper truck for the volunteer fire department. The grant also helped support youth sports and pay for a new sidewalk near the school.Thousands of pipes lie in a yard just north of Philip, South Dakota.\"Philip is just a small community. But we are just one little bit of the whole entire project. What happens when another big project like this comes through and there's all this money invested into this and all these jobs that people are basically promised and then the President can just sign an executive order and shut it all down?\" Smith said.  Bart Ramsey, a Philip rancher, told CNN that the project seemed like a long shot nearly a decade ago. But in the last five years it had made significant strides. Ranchers, he said,  were approached about putting easements in place in exchange for a monetary compensation. The easements would have allowed TC Energy to run the pipeline through owned land. \"It's hard for us rural people to fathom something that big happening and as many dollars as it was,\" Ramsey said. Ramsey supported the project but remained cautiously optimistic as time went by and the progress was slow. For him, the pipeline meant energy independence for the country. \"At some point, we may not need fossil fuels, we can get by without it. We're not there. All the planes, trains and automobiles that run almost all use fossil fuels. And if this was going to help keep that cost down for production of products and travel and everything else, that's a lot of dollars in the United States that would have been saved,\" Ramsey said. Just one mile north of Philip, a TC Energy work camp lies empty. Another 30 miles north, a massive pipe yard is visible from a main highway with hundreds of pipes in display.  TC Energy declined to comment on the fate of the existing infrastructure already in place for the long-awaited pipeline.  \"My fear is that they've invested all of these money and resources into what is already in place. And then they'll have to come tear it out,\" Smith said.",

        "content": "(CNN)It's been almost seven months since Ahmaud Arbery was gunned down while jogging in a residential community on the outskirts of Brunswick, Georgia.The criminal investigation into his death stalled for nearly 10 weeks, but in June a Glynn County grand jury indicted three white men on malice and felony murder charges. They have pleaded not guilty.JUST WATCHEDNew information revealed in Ahmaud Arbery caseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew information revealed in Ahmaud Arbery case 02:59The arrests and charges came after disturbing video of the shooting of Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, emerged in May.The video garnered widespread public attention, and protesters gathered outside the courthouse after a preliminary hearing in the case could be heard chanting, \"All lives matter when black lives matter,\" according to CNN affiliate WJXT.Since the shooting, a registered trademark, a foundation, a GoFundMe account and a Facebook page memorializing Arbery have been created. But some of those who created them now find themselves at odds with the dead man's mother.Read More\"Money cannot replace what I have lost and the fight for justice does not come without cost. I was not begging for money and I was prepared to fight for my son either way. I have always worked for what I wanted,\" said Wanda Cooper-Jones. 'I Run With Maud'In the weeks before the arrests of Arbery's accused killers, the Facebook page, \"I Run With Maud,\" emerged as a resource for thousands of people around the world calling for justice for Arbery. The page, managed by Arbery's childhood friend Akeem Baker, kept followers engaged, prompting them to keep up demands for action.It also inspired many to dedicate 2.23-mile fundraising runs to Arbery, the distance memorializing the February 23 date of his death. Social media had become a valuable tool in rallying support at a time when mass gatherings were being discouraged or banned as the coronavirus pandemic progressed.Ahmaud Arbery's tragic final run grips an anxious AmericaBut Cooper-Jones said in a lengthy Facebook post earlier this month that while she had initially agreed to the social media page as a memorial -- and appreciated its original intentions -- she now sees it as \"more like a business opportunity for its staff rather than getting justice for my son.\"Cooper-Jones' post goes on to say that she made multiple requests to be granted access to the page as an administrator, but they were denied. CNN has made repeated requests for comment from the current administrators of the page, but has not received a response.The Facebook page, originally named \"I Run With Maud,\" was rebranded recently. It now operates under the title \"The 2:23 Foundation.\" It is also registered as a nonprofit organization in Georgia under the name of Jason Vaughn, a former high school football coach of Arbery. A statement announcing the rebranding explained the reasoning behind the move. \"What we didn't know about was the layers of injustice that encompassed more than just our hometown, but extended to the state legislature. What began as a local movement has now become something that can impact the lives of many young men and women of color across our state,\" the statement quoted football coach Vaughn as saying.Those who manage it say the rebranding wasn't a result of a rift with Cooper-Jones. \"The rebrand was done to formalize the work we had been doing as a group,\" said John C. Richards, Jr., a co-founder of the foundation and Vaughn's brother in an email to CNN. Cooper-Jones said Vaughn did not have a close relationship with her son. Neither did three other members of the original committee engaged in advancing justice for Arbery. \"(They) have known for months I did not want my child's death to be exploited or used for monetary gain for anyone. I was disrespected and ignored,\" said Cooper-Jones in her post. Marcus Arbery Sr., Ahmaud Arbery's father, was unaware a foundation had been created stemming from the rebranding of the Facebook page. Vaughn did not reply to CNN's request for comment.Trademark applicationOn May 9, two days after two of the three men were arrested in Arbery's killing, family and friends had gathered in Brunswick to celebrate what would've been Ahmaud Arbery's 26th birthday weekend. The same day, a trademark application for \"I Run With Maud\" was filed listing a Little Rock, Arkansas, address. United States Patent and Trademark Office records show Akeem Baker, Arbery's childhood friend, and John C. Richards, Vaughn's brother, as the applicants.Runners around the world dedicated 2.23 miles to shooting victim Ahmaud Arbery\"We had an arrest (and within) 48 hours these guys are applying for a trademark,\" said Cooper-Jones.In a Facebook post, the foundation says that it protectively registered the trademark to keep others from applying for it.Repeated attempts to contact Akeem Baker for comment were unsuccessful. Richards declined to speak over the phone and cited a statement previously posted on the foundation's page.\"Since one of our team members uttered the phrase, we trademarked the name with the intention of preserving it for Ahmaud Arbery's mother AND father, who are heirs to his estate. We have been asked to turn that trademark over to Wanda Cooper-Jones and we cannot do that in good conscience, given that Marcus Arbery (Ahmaud Arbery's father) is not listed as a beneficiary for the GoFundMe funds ... Currently, two of our team members are on the registration for the trademark and our intention is to still provide Mr. Arbery with something that we feel would honor the legacy of his son,\" the statement said.Cooper-Jones told CNN that she has no issue with Marcus Arbery Sr. being listed in the trademark. When reached over the phone, Arbery Sr. said Baker had recently told him he would be transferring the trademark but no details were discussed. The trademark application has been conditionally approved as of this week citing Baker and Richards as the owners. Cooper-Jones and her attorney S. Lee Merritt say they are planning on disputing the registration. They have the next four weeks to do so, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office protocols.\"We shouldn't be trying to add more grief, stress to a mom who recently lost her son. And it's a shame that these people from her community are making her go through these hoops,\" said Merritt.GoFundMe campaignAs Arbery's death became national news, Baker created a GoFundMe campaign aimed at raising $100,000 and named Cooper-Jones as the sole beneficiary.\"All donations are going towards the fight for making sure justice is served and to ensure that Ahmaud's mother has the resources they will need,\" reads the campaign's description dated May 3.Cooper-Jones told CNN that the campaign was created after Baker asked her permission several times and she eventually gave her approval.Georgia governor signs hate crime bill spurred by outrage over Ahmaud Arbery's killingWith more than 61,000 people having donated close to $2 million, the campaign remains active. Cooper-Jones, who has since returned to work, told CNN she had a life insurance policy for Ahmaud -- and maintains that her goal has always been to get justice for her son, not to use his death to raise money.Other GoFundMe campaigns have come under scrutiny in the past due to fraud allegations. The crowdfunding site investigates allegations of criminal activity including fraud, identity theft and the posting of misleading statements about a campaign, including those involving campaigns that have surpassed their fundraising goal. It does not investigate campaigns that have led to familial disputes or use of names without permission from the family.A spokesperson for GoFundMe told CNN that beneficiaries could deactivate a campaign either by requesting the organizer do so or by contacting GoFundMe. Cooper-Jones told CNN she was unaware that the campaign was still active. She says she is grateful for the donations made in her son's honor. For now, Cooper-Jones says she is waiting to hear the date of a trial she hopes will bring her son's accused killers to justice.\"My goal was to have every hand that was involved in the murder of my baby boy to go to jail. Everybody who played a part in it. That's my goal. I want justice for my baby. My baby's laying out there in the cemetery that I go visit once a week,\" she said.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the circumstances under which GoFundMe investigates fundraising campaigns. GoFundMe investigates any mention of misuse, including those involving campaigns that have surpassed their fundraising goal.",

Brian Kemp recently announced plans to repeal the Civil War-era citizen's arrest law; the southern Georgia prosecutor who failed to make an arrest after Arbery's death was voted out of office in November; an Atlanta area district attorney is now prosecuting the case; and Kemp signed a hate crime bill last year spurred by outrage over Arbery's death.James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, said these actions are critical to addressing what he says is the racist violence behind Arbery's death.  \"This one-year anniversary is very bittersweet because what was able to be done in the aftermath was we pushed the envelope on policy that continued to allow these acts of vigilante and racial and extrajudicial violence,\" Woodall said. \"We were able to identify exactly what we wanted.\" It's what I can't see in the Ahmaud Arbery shooting video that also terrifies meWoodall said the Georgia NAACP advocated for the state to repeal the citizen's arrest law after Waycross District Attorney George Barnhill -- the second prosecutor to oversee the probe last year -- cited the statute to justify his decision not to charge the McMichaels with Arbery's death.  The state law allows private citizens to arrest someone if they have immediate knowledge or reasonable suspicion that the person has committed a crime. The McMichaels told police they believed Arbery was a suspect in recent burglaries in the neighborhood and followed him. Kemp has introduced a plan to replace the law with a bill that removes legal loopholes that could be used to justify vigilante violence.  The new law makes specific allowances for business owners or employees who can detain someone committing a theft in their establishment, private security officers, and police officers who can make arrests outside of their jurisdictions in certain instances. \"Ahmaud was a victim of a vigilante style of violence that has no place in Georgia,\" Kemp said last week. \"Some tried to justify the actions of his killers by claiming they had the protection of an antiquated law that is ripe for abuse.\"Kemp also signed a hate crime bill last June after Georgia drew criticism for being one of four states that didn't have a law against hate crimes. The law allows judges imposing sentences to increase punishment against those who target victims based on perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability.Justice delayed Cooper-Jones and civil rights activists say they won't get justice in Arbery's death until the McMichaels and Bryan are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.But there is currently no trial date because of Covid-19 restrictions in Georgia, said Cobb County District Attorney Flynn D. Broady Jr. who is prosecuting the case. The state turned the case over to Cobb County last May after three southern Georgia prosecutors failed to make arrests in the killing of Arbery.  Among them was former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson, who had jurisdiction over the case but recused herself because Gregory McMichael was a retired investigator from her office. Johnson lost her bid for re-election in November. Broady, who unseated the county's former district attorney Joyette M. Holmes in November, said he expects the trial to begin some time this year and that the McMichaels and Bryan will be tried together. \"Justice will come,\" Broady told CNN. \"And I believe as soon as Covid is under control, we will see justice in this case.\"Bryan's attorney Kevin Gough said in a statement that his client is \"presumed innocent\" and that his office is pursuing another bond hearing for Bryan after being denied bond seven months ago. The attorneys said they also have a pending motion to dismiss the charges against Bryan. \"Our condolences go out to the family of Ahmaud Arbery on the anniversary of his tragic death,\" the statement said. \"It is certainly a day that Mr. Bryan will never forget.\" The law firm Peters, Rubin, Sheffield, & Hodges P.A., which is representing Travis McMichael, released a statement saying \"the sadness and tragedy surrounding Mr. Arbery's death will never be forgotten.\"\"We join the community in giving our condolences and prayers for Mr. Arbery's family and friends for their loss,\" the statement said. Laura D. Hogue, an attorney for Gregory McMichael, declined to comment on the case saying \"the commemoration of this date belongs to the Arbery family.\"The need for accountability Social justice advocates say despite the policy and leadership changes in Georgia, Arbery's death reflects a structural and societal issue with racist violence in the US. Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, said the justice system is unequal and has historically allowed White people to get away with killing Black people.The protests and community engagement that followed Arbery's death brought attention to this inequity and held law enforcement officials accountable for their lack of action, he said. Demonstrators gather at the Glynn County courthouse during a June court appearance by Gregory and Travis McMichael, two suspects in the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery.Now, Robinson said the nation needs more policies that ensure accountability for every case involving racist violence and more investment in Black communities. \"When the killer is White and the victim is Black in communities around the country, justice isn't served,\" Robinson said. \"There is nothing new about what happened to Ahmaud Arbery.\"Cooper-Jones said she knows her son was targeted because he was a Black man. However, she feels encouraged by the outpouring of support from people from all over and the policy changes that have resulted from Arbery's death.   She plans to honor him at a candlelight vigil on Tuesday evening at New Springfield Baptist Church in Waynesboro, GA. \"I was a mother, Ahmaud was my baby boy,\" Cooper-Jones said. \"He just wasn't a jogger, he was my son.\"CNN's Amir Vera contributed to this report.",

The predominantly Black city quickly became a hot spot early in the pandemic.How two funerals helped turn one small Georgia city into a hotspot for coronavirus As demand for the coronavirus vaccine continues to outweigh supply, the city has adopted a new approach to get the most vulnerable vaccinated.Harris, a city recreation supervisor and lifelong resident, canvasses poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods to create awareness of local vaccine resources.Read MoreOn a recent sunny afternoon, Harris along with a few other volunteers trek around for miles throughout South Albany knocking on hundreds of doors passing out flyers informing residents of a nearby weekend vaccination pop-up site.  Along the way, familiar faces light up at the sight of Harris crisscrossing the neighborhood. \"There's always someone trying to help somebody, showing the positive way of going by something,\" says Jeremiah Heart, a neighbor of Harris'.He is just a year shy of turning 65, leaving him out of the vaccine eligibility for now. He is nonetheless certain of wanting the vaccine. \"I've never been hesitant at all about it, always wanting something to keep me going,\" Heart says.  However, those convictions are not shared by all in the community.\"My daughter don't want me to take it, and I'm a little scared, but I'm going to see. I don't want it to make me sick,\" said Willie Heath after Harris dropped off a flyer at his door.  Harris remains undeterred, relying on her faith, warmth, and trustworthiness to get her neighbors vaccinated.\"I'm tired of losing grandparents, grandmamas, granddaddys and some of our small children, too,\" Linda Harris told CNN.\"We're being hit the hardest with this, and we're trying to talk to them [at risk communities] so they can come out and get the vaccine. So we can at least prevent some of them from dying. It's a choice, if they choose to take the vaccine or not. But we just doing our job encouraging them and talking to them. It's a choice.\"A grassroots effort to build trustHarris is at the helm leading efforts on the ground, but it is Dr. Derek Heard leading the charge a few miles down at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital. The grassroots campaign is a joint effort between Phoebe Putney Health Systems, the only hospital system in southwest Georgia, and the City of Albany.  Heard, also an Albany native, started seeing the racial disparities in the vaccination numbers. Phoebe Putney Health Systems data show that White people are being vaccinated at more than twice the rate of Black residents.  \"We knew that there were multiple reasons for that disparity, whether it was social determinants of health, having access to our vaccination center, Heard said.He also knew that him and colleagues had to do something to fix the mistrust some people in the African American community had toward the medical establishment. Doctor in small Georgia city says coronavirus spread through community before hospital staff found out what it wasA few days later, the walkup pop-up site opened to some anticipation with only a dozen appointments made beforehand. The biggest challenge was not in getting the word out but rather in dispelling suspicions in the African American community.  \"It's just fear, the fear of [the] unknown, just not knowing and then afraid to ask,\" said Alberta Charlot, a Licensed Practical Nurse at Phoebe Putney.Charlot had been on site as the elderly and their caregivers slowly trickled in. She had gotten her first shot just a few days prior after deciding it was the best thing to do for herself and her family.  An elderly woman stopped by with her grandson after driving by and seeing the pop-up vaccination site. She called her three sisters to come and get the shot. All three of them declined including one on dialysis.  The final tally for the day was less than 50 vaccines in arms.  \"This work is not easy. We're in a mostly African American community that has some very valid reasons for maybe not trusting healthcare, not trusting science. So, it's days like this that hopefully build just a little bit of trust,\" Scott Steiner, President and CEO at Phoebe Putney Health System told CNN.\"People see maybe their neighbor getting it somebody that they respect, and it makes them feel more comfortable.\"",

GoFundMe pages for the two educators confirmed the deaths.Johnson was a teacher at Kemp Elementary School and suffered from pre-existing conditions. Lindsey was a paraprofessional at Sedalia Park Elementary. A third educator in the county, Patrick Key, died on Christmas Day from Covid-19. An art scholarship has since been established in his honor. Dana Johnson.\"Teachers are willing to take a bullet for our kids. We shouldn't have to be willing to, in the middle of a pandemic, die from a disease because we want to be teachers,\" Jackson said.Read MoreIn a statement to CNN, the Cobb County School District said Johnson and Lindsey were valuable members of their team and expressed condolences to their families. \"Every member of our school community has been impacted by the ongoing battle against COVID-19,\" said the school district in the statement. \"We continue to ask our staff, students, and families to follow public health guidance -- wear masks and social distance -- so we can stay as healthy as possible.\"Teachers push for all-virtual classesGeorgia has struggled with the pandemic, including Cobb County.The county of about 760,000 people has recorded 57,000 cases and 672 Covid-related deaths, the Cobb County Covid dashboard said.According to the Cobb County Schools website, there are 388 active Covid cases in the school district as of Friday. The district serves about 107,000 students.So many students and staff have had to quarantine recently that the school district canceled all in-person classes the week of January 18.In-person and virtual classes are expected to resume on Monday, January 25.  In an announcement on Friday, the district said it is committed to offering face-to-face and remote learning options for all families.\"The separation period will allow our staff and students to return on January 25 after a time of quarantine, better prepared to teach and learn in face-to-face and remote classrooms to honor the instructional delivery models our families have chosen,\" said the school district. Teachers protest schools being open for in-person learning. But some teachers and parents want all-virtual classes.A group of them stood outside the school district offices last Thursday during a board meeting to protest. And more than 6,500 people have signed an online petition for all-virtual classes.Jackson told CNN she has been speaking out at every board meeting trying to present the school board with different teaching alternatives. One of those options includes keeping at-risk educators teaching from home. \"It's just wrong to keep risking people's lives,\" said Jackson.Cynthia Lindsey. A Cobb County elementary school teacher, Justin Julian, told CNN the teachers of Cobb County have been emotionally impacted by the deaths of their coworkers, especially those who are worried about the virus. \"It's a lot to take on our shoulders and it's exhausting trying to fight this fight all the time,\" he said. Julian said teachers want the option of working from home.\"A lot of the teachers want virtual, they want a virtual environment. They think that that's the safest for not only for them, but the community and to lessen the community spread,\" Julian said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Florida's county-by-county plan to vaccinate its elderly population has created a mass scramble for a limited number of doses, leading to hourslong lines at vaccination sites and overwhelmed county hotlines and websites.In southwest Florida, the Lee County Department of Health encouraged anyone 65 and older and high-risk frontline health care workers to come to one of seven vaccination sites. Each site had just 300 vaccine doses, and \"no appointment is necessary,\" the county said.The first-come, first-serve plan led to huge lines forming overnight Tuesday as people camped out on lawn chairs and waited for hours.People wait in line in the early morning hours of Wednesday, December 30, 2020 at Lakes Park Regional Library in Fort Myers, Florida to recieve the COVID-19 vaccine.Some of those at Lakes Park Regional Library started lining up overnight.Bruce Scott told CNN he arrived at a Ft. Myers vaccination site at 1:30 a.m. and waited in a line for about 8 or 9 hours to get vaccinated.\"Although I'm grateful to get the vaccine, I feel that there's got to be a better way to distribute this,\" he said afterward. \"For people that really need it, elderly that might be disabled in some way, they can't endure this process, so there's got to be a better way to manage this.\"Read MoreSeniors and first responders wait in line to receive a Covid-19 vaccine at the Lakes Regional Library on December 30, 2020, in Fort Myers, Florida.The long wait is a preview of what looks to be a tumultuous vaccine rollout and reflects the public's pent-up demand for vaccines as well as the logistical difficulty in administering them in an orderly way.The issue is partly a consequence of the lack of consistent federal guidance in administering vaccines, as President Donald Trump deferred that decision-making to the states. In turn, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis broke with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to focus first on vaccinating the elderly rather than essential workers, and he has encouraged each county health department to make its own decisions on administering the vaccines.Florida is one of the few states that has begun vaccinating people beyond the first wave of health care workers and long-term care facilities. The state has administered over 150,000 vaccines so far, more than all but Texas, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Counties see huge vaccine demandOther Florida counties have tried to set up vaccination appointments for those who sign up online or through a hotline.In Orange County, the department of health set up an online portal to make vaccination appointments, and 30,000 appointments were scheduled in the last 24 hours. The county then said it reached capacity and closed its online portal on Wednesday.Fran Lundell, 70, and her husband, Andy, 73, were among those who successfully signed up, and they were vaccinated after waiting in their cars at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando on Tuesday.When can YOU get the vaccine? It depends on your health, occupation and where you liveThey said they went to the county website to schedule an appointment as soon as it was announced. Fran got an appointment quickly, but it took Andy four or five attempts to get a slot.\"We think we're lucky,\" Fran Lundell said. \"We thought maybe March or April we might get it, but this is fantastic to get it, certainly.\"Jim Seltzer, who was also vaccinated Wednesday, praised the job the county did.\"I thought it was very well organized. I thought they did an excellent job,\" he said. \"I mean, it was a long wait, but you know, I expected that.\"In Palm Beach County, the department of health directed people 65 and older to call an appointment hotline to get their vaccine. But the hotline can only handle 150 calls at a time and was being overwhelmed, the county said.\"We are working on expanding our infrastructure to handle the high demand we are experiencing,\" the site said.And in South Florida, Broward Health said all of its appointments are booked until February.Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach says they have proactively reached out to the seniors in their community to sign up for the vaccine. They have enabled more appointment phone lines in an effort to prevent seniors for easily accessing the vaccine. \"And so the faster that we're able to deploy vaccine to the 65 plus year old population, I believe that life will return to normal. And I also believe that younger people will be more receptive to receiving the vaccine as well,\" said President and CEO of Mount Sinai Miami Beach Steve Sonenreich. Focus on elderly over essential workersFlorida is also one of a few states that has bucked the CDC's recommendations on the order of who should get the vaccine first, prioritizing the elderly over essential workers.A CDC advisory committee recommended that states first vaccinate frontline health care workers and people in long-term care facilities, and Florida has followed that.The CDC committee then recommended that states vaccinate people older than 75 and \"frontline essential workers\" such as first responders in a \"Phase 1b.\" Afterward, in a \"Phase 1c,\" states should vaccinate adults ages 65-75, people ages 16-64 with high-risk medical conditions, and \"other essential workers,\" the committee recommended.As year-end approaches, vaccine rollout remains woefully behind scheduleHowever, DeSantis said the state is prioritizing everyone over age 65, with young essential workers later.\"Our vaccines are going to be targeted for our elderly population,\" he said in a news conference last week at UF Health in The Villages, the central Florida community for people older than 55. \"As we get into the general community, the vaccines are going to be targeted where the risk is the greatest, and that is in our elderly population. We are not going to put young healthy workers ahead of our elderly vulnerable population.\"The CDC committee's recommendations represented a compromise between two strains of thought: preventing Covid-19 spread and preventing Covid-19 deaths. People ages 18-64 make up 75% of all coronavirus infections, while people older than 65 make up 81% of all coronavirus deaths, according to CDC data.DeSantis, who has repeatedly downplayed the severity of Covid-19 for young people, said he did not agree with the CDC recommendations to vaccinate essential workers.\"If you're a 22-year-old working in food services, let's say at a supermarket, you would have preference over a 74-year-old grandmother,\" he said. \"I don't think that that is the direction that we want to go.\" CNN's Rosa Flores, Sara Weisfeldt and Denise Royal contributed to this report.",

Despite being in the front lines of war, he would face his deadliest challenge at home.  In the years since leaving the military, he and his wife, Nicole, welcomed their first child, Adalyn, and moved to Lexington, Kentucky, from Texas. He found a job as a service specialist at a local car dealership, making him the sole breadwinner. The Keenes were expecting their second child, a boy, in December.  Instead, the baby was born prematurely on October 26. But Michael, 39, would never know. Struggling with Covid-19 symptoms, he died two days later, in the same hospital where his son was receiving emergency care.  The joy and sorrow of those traumatic days tested Nicole Keene's faith. \"I don't know why He answered my prayers for Wesson and not for Michael,\" she told CNN. \"It makes me very angry. But I keep praying because He gave me a miracle.\" Temperature hit 104.5 Read MoreMichael Keene served in both Iraq and Afghanistan.Early in October, Nicole said that Michael started complaining of having a scratchy throat. Since she was pregnant, they got tested for Covid-19 at the first available appointment two days later. They knew the results within the hour. Nicole tested negative while Michael tested positive.Over the next few days, Michael's condition deteriorated. Nicole, a respiratory therapist, would guide her husband through daily breathing exercises at home.   It wouldn't be long before the couple decided Michael should seek medical attention.  \"He got sick pretty quick. It was his fever that concerned me the most, with how high his fever was. It was 104.5,\" Nicole said. Letters to Santa reveal the toll the pandemic is taking on kidsMichael was admitted to University of Kentucky Albert B. Chandler Hospital in Lexington. \"They started him right away on oxygen, and they moved him into the ICU fairly quickly after that. I got a call the next morning, saying that they wanted to intubate him already. And I just, I was terrified. And just knew that [when] you get on the ventilator and it's really hard to get off with Covid,\" Nicole said. The couple decided to try alternate methods before having to eventually intubate Michael, starting with a non-invasive type of ventilator. \"They put him on the BiPAP [machine], his anxiety was very high, very high. I mean he has PTSD. And he just really struggled.\"On October 26, Nicole got a call from her husband's doctor sharing good news for the first time: Michael's breathing tube would be removed. \"I thought the worst was over,\" she recalled.  That same day, hours after a routine pregnancy exam, Nicole found herself in the hospital due to complications. She was 34 weeks pregnant and became upset after not feeling the baby move.  \"I just remember the panic. I just remember the doctor coming in and looking at me and saying, 'We're going have to take your baby right now.' And I just could not understand that.\" Father, son in the same hospital Jeffery Michael Keene plays with daughter Adalyn.Michael Wesson was born unresponsive, and after 15 minutes of resuscitation he came to life. When Nicole woke up, she was told the baby was being transferred to a hospital with more specialized care. Both father and son would find themselves in the same facility fighting for their lives.   At the doctor's advice, Michael never knew his new baby was nearby.  \"They had advised me to not tell my husband, because he was very on the edge of being re-intubated because his anxiety was really high. He was still struggling to breathe.\"  Two days later, while recovering in the hospital, Nicole got a visit from her husband's doctor. He told her Michael was on the road to recovery \"and that he'd probably be able to leave the hospital in about two weeks [and] go to rehab facility.\" The good news did not last long. Hours later, the doctor told her Michael had taken a turn for the worse and the medical staff had been trying to stabilize him for 45 minutes. She raced to her husband's side fully covered in PPE just in time to hold his hand while he took his last breath.  \"I just felt everything, all of our dreams, everything just like came out of me. I could just see our whole life just slipping away.\"Nicole Keene with her son and daughter.Her baby would spend five weeks in the intensive care unit before coming home with an oxygen tank. Doctors have told Nicole he has a brain injury but only time will tell the extent of the injury. Nicole spends her days sorting out her financial future when she's not busy caring for her two children. She is unsure if she'll be able to return to work as a respiratory therapist given the medical needs of Wesson. She also wrestles with the trauma of seeing would-be patients and families going through the same loss, if she were to return to her work. For now, Nicole is getting by with the support of her community, through a GoFundMe page, and Social Security assistance because of her husband's death. She continues to educate herself about other benefits her children might have access to through his military pension.  Jeffery Michael Keene was laid to rest in Fort Jackson National Cemetery in South Carolina, near where his parents live. Nicole may move to the area to be close to her late husband and to raise their children with the support of her in-laws. \"There's a lot of guilt, like just living every day,\" Nicole said. \"Even that I'm here and he's not and the kids...just without their dad, growing up without him. He was an amazing man, amazing father.\"",

But for the Gentleman from West Virginia, I suspect it is almost heaven.  Sen. Joe Manchin, widely viewed as the most conservative Democrat in the now 50-50 US Senate, has announced he will support the budget resolution on Covid-19 relief being introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders. In so doing, Manchin has laid down a marker: he is with his party at the beginning of this process, but if the Democrats cannot bring some Republicans along by the end, they may not be able to count on him in the final vote.Manchin's insistence on moderation and bipartisanship is deeply felt, and Washington DC had better get used to it. They are going to see a lot of it in the next two years.  10 GOPers are throwing Biden a lifeline. He should take itSome label Manchin's approach as centrism, and it is in a sense. But what really is the center? It is not merely splitting the difference between the extremes. Rather, it is the pragmatic place from which a divided nation can find a consensus for action -- and action in the Joe Biden era means some movement in a progressive direction.  And so, on the matter of reconciliation, Manchin is aligned with a Democratic Socialist from Vermont -- for now. But alliances may shift over time, as Manchin strives to hold the Senate in the moderate mainstream.Read MoreIn 1949, as the globe was transitioning from World War to Cold War, a young historian named Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote a book called \"The Vital Center.\" It made the case that government-regulated market capitalism was the sweet spot between fascism on the right and communism on the left.  The phrase caught on, as did the concept. President John F. Kennedy, to whom Schlesinger was close, took the label and ran with it. Kennedy used it to describe the office of the presidency itself, which he called \"the vital center of action in our whole scheme of government.\" And when I worked for former President Bill Clinton, he was fond of applying the phrase to domestic politics: the vital center, to him, was a third way between the fringes of the two political parties.The reason America's two sides can't agreeWhile there is some truth to the left-right paradigm, it seems to me the real divide in American politics is between the reality-based world and the conspiracy-addled fabulists. No discussion of the political center is honest or accurate without recognizing that the two parties' fringes are not equidistant from the center. For example, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, who has trafficked in conspiracy theories and bigotry, cannot be portrayed as merely the GOP's version of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive New York Democrat, who argues in favor of a higher minimum wage and health care access for all. You may disagree with Ocasio-Cortez's agenda, but she operates in the world of facts -- not fiction.A confession: I know and like Manchin. I have since the days he was an up-and-comer in the Mountain State and helped the 1992 Bill Clinton-Al Gore ticket win a landslide in his state, carrying 42 of its 55 counties. His commitment to helping everyday Americans facing real problems in the real world led him to take a leadership position in crafting a temporary Covid-19 relief bill in the closing days of the Donald Trump presidency (for which I praised him then.) Georgia runoffs crown new power brokers in WashingtonLike all politicians, I agree with him on some issues, and disagree on others. But what I like about him is his rock-ribbed commitment to the reality-based world.  With the narrowest possible majority in the Senate, it is simply not realistic to expect to see Biden sign radical, revolutionary bills into law. Nor is it realistic (nor decent) to ignore the pain of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, and the families of hundreds of thousands who have lost their lives due to the pandemic.  And so Manchin is in the hot seat. So hot that, last week, Vice President Kamala Harris beamed into West Virginia television station WSAZ. She never mentioned Manchin by name, but she did say, \"The President and I feel very strongly that these are the moments when we are facing a crisis of unbelievable proportion (and) that the American people deserve their leaders to step up and stand up for them.\"Manchin expressed annoyance that Harris had come into his state (albeit via satellite) without telling him first. And soon the White House was back to playing good cop, with press secretary Jen Psaki soothingly assuring us, \"Not only is he (Manchin) a key partner to the President and to the White House on this package, but on his agenda and we will remain in close touch with him.\" Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookInterestingly, the Harris interview may have had a more beneficial impact on an unintended target: West Virginia's Democrat-turned-Republican Gov. Jim Justice. On Monday, Justice told CNN's Poppy Harlow that fiscal responsibility is less important than immediate action in this crisis. \"If we actually throw away some money right now, so what?\" Justice said. \"We have really got to move and get people taken care of and get people back on balance and I want to work with the Biden administration just like I worked with the Trump administration and I want us to move forward.\"This leaves Manchin in the unusual position of potentially wanting to spend less than his pro-Trump governor, while simultaneously being nudged to spend more by the Democratic White House. One Manchin aide told me he is unfazed: \"For Senator Manchin, it is less about carving out a lane in the middle and more about identifying what's best for West Virginia and the country.\" Manchin has spent decades in the whitewater of West Virginia politics. He will likely support the highest level of spending that can pass with some modicum of Republican support. Rather than labeling that as centrism, it more accurate to call it realism.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)To do anything 279 times takes discipline, commitment, focus. Try just tapping your finger on the table 279 times. Really. I'll wait.Took longer than you thought, didn't it? And I bet it got a bit tedious. Now imagine that, instead of something as mindless as tapping your finger, you gave a speech.  On the floor of the United States Senate. On the existential but oft-ignored threat of climate change.  Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, stood at his desk on the Senate floor, asked to be recognized, and delivered a speech about the threat of climate change and the urgent need to take action 279 times. It is difficult to be urgent about something for years. I recall a military leader once telling me, \"You can't keep an Army on their tiptoes forever.\"  This town powered America for decades. What do we owe them?But Whitehouse has been on his tiptoes on climate for years. Nine years, to be specific. Once a week, every week since 2012, when the Senate refused to take up a House-passed climate bill, Whitehouse has delivered what he calls his \"Wake Up\" speeches, often accompanied by a blown-up photo of the Earth with the words \"Time to Wake Up.\" A 2020 study cited by the Boston Globe shows that his \"Time to Wake Up\" speeches constitute a staggering 32% of all speeches by all Democratic senators since 2012. He is the Cal Ripken of climate change. Lacing up his verbal spikes each day, chipping away at immortality.Read MoreIt is noteworthy that Whitehouse has chosen to end his \"Wake Up\" speeches at the dawn of the Biden administration. He even concluded his final speech with a mic drop. (Although, since the microphone was a lightweight clip-on, it lacked the full, dramatic effect. Whitehouse is a senator, after all, not Eminem.) The aggressive approach of President Joe Biden gave Whitehouse the impetus to end his streak, but what, I wondered, motivated him to begin this Ahabian quest in the first place? \"Despondency,\" he told me. In 2012, Whitehouse felt like the Obama administration abandoned House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's climate legislation. \"My frustration boiled over, and I decided I would speak every damned week come hell or high water. It was not clear what I'd gotten myself in for, nine years and 279 speeches later.\"President Biden marked his first week in office with a veritable tsunami of executive orders on climate. He ordered his administration to put climate policy at the heart of national security, to pause leases for oil and gas drilling on federal land; he directed the federal government to purchase electric vehicles, and to reserve nearly a third of federal water and land for conservation. True to form, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell jumped on his high horse faster than a jockey on Derby Day. He called the Biden executive orders \"a piecemeal Green New Deal.\" For McConnell to complain that he prefers legislation to executive orders is a new height of hypocrisy. Executive action is urgently required because, as Whitehouse has said, McConnell has blocked the Senate from even taking up the House-passed climate bill for nine years. It's as if the house was on fire, McConnell locked up the fire hydrant, then complained when Biden tossed a few buckets of water on the house. If McConnell doesn't like executive action, he should abandon his commitment to legislative inaction.Of course, the Biden executive orders are a beginning, not an end. Legislative solutions are essential. Still, after all of those speeches over all those years, Whitehouse told me that he considers this week to be the real start of the fight to save the planet. Rather than merely focus on his Senate colleagues, Whitehouse says he will pursue an outside-in strategy: first, turn up the heat on the fossil fuel lobby. \"Attack the rotten, collapsing climate denial operation of the fossil fuel industry; embarrass them, make it hurt, make them sweat; expose, expose, expose.\" Then, court the rest of Corporate America, many of whom are already aware that a planet on fire is bad for business. \"Challenge them to get out of the locker room and onto the field. Many want to, but they need a prod and catalyst.\"For years, Whitehouse has been the prod. To be sure, he cares about a lot of issues.  A former federal prosecutor and state attorney general, he is a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a perch from which he presses judicial nominees on everything from ethics to the destructive influence of dark money to criminal justice reform. He wrote the first major bipartisan law to combat the opioid epidemic: the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Like most Democrats, he cares deeply about expanding health care and rebuilding infrastructure.Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookBut again and again he returns to climate. I asked him why. \"Coastal states like mine,\" he says, \"stand to be clobbered\" by rising sea levels caused by climate change. Indeed, Rhode Island is not called the \"Ocean State\" for nothing. It has 384 miles of coastline, and according to one study, almost 8% of all the properties in the entire state are at risk from rising sea levels.   With the new Biden administration putting climate change front and center; with Whitehouse's old colleague John Kerry serving as climate czar; with Democrats now in control of the Senate and House (albeit narrowly), Whitehouse is optimistic, but not irrationally exuberant. \"All the present signs suggest optimism is justified,\" he said. \"But if I have to bring the chart back out I will!\"You can rely on that. In an era when many feel they have accomplished something with a Tweet, or a \"Like,\" Whitehouse is a throwback: his constancy and commitment remind me of those relentless voices from our history, calling America to abolish slavery, to recognize the full equality of women, to finally acknowledge our LGBTQ+ sisters and brothers. None of those fights were won overnight. And Whitehouse knows his long struggle to save our fevered planet has only just begun. So, I just want to salute the man who, day in and day out, raised his voice to save the planet.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. (CNN)It doesn't happen very often, the firing of a president. In the last 100 years, the only elected presidents to be voted out were Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and, now, Donald Trump.  Trump has announced he will not attend the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. Not a surprise. The outgoing president isn't exactly known for his class, grace or humility in accepting loss. Given Trump's role in inciting a crowd to attack the Capitol in a bid to stop Biden's victory from being certified, if he chose to attend, it would certainly make for an awkward occasion. But even for a president who is not a sore loser, surrendering power to the man who defeated you is tough. Hoover refused to speak to former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the chilly ride from the White House to the inaugural stand at the Capitol in 1933. And though Carter was more gracious, he later confessed he found former President Ronald Reagan's small talk about his Hollywood days \"remarkably pointless,\" especially since his 1981 Inauguration Day was also the day the American hostages in Iran were freed.  A history lesson on presidents who snub their successors' inaugurationsFormer President George H.W. Bush, on the other hand, was dignity personified. The campaign was spirited. Republicans accused former President Bill Clinton of somehow being politically compromised because of a student trip he took to the Soviet Union in 1969. Bush himself, in a campaign speech, called Clinton a \"bozo,\" a comment he said later he hadn't thought was all that offensive. And, as a strategist for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, I can tell you we launched our fair share of attacks as well, taunting Bush for pledging \"read my lips, no new taxes\" and mocking Bush's seeming inaction in the face of a recession. Tame stuff compared to today, to be sure. But the potential for a deep and lasting rupture was real, and both men made a special point to unite the country.Read MoreThis is where Bush's amazing grace came in. He was a wounded politician, but more than that he was a patriot. \"Among the many memories from my first inauguration that I'll cherish for the rest of my life,\" Clinton recalled to me, \"is the extraordinary graciousness that President and Mrs. Bush showed to Hillary, Chelsea and me on what had to have been an incredibly difficult day for them.\" The outgoing president and incoming President-elect meet for coffee at the White House before the swearing-in, and one can imagine that the coffee comes with a quite a bit of tension -- especially when you must depart the White House for the last time in the company of the guy who kicked you out. But the Bushes cut through it, Clinton told me. \"They treated us with genuine kindness, and expressed a real hope that our country would be successful over the next four years, and that our family would be happy in the White House.\"The best way to hold a Covid-era inaugurationFormer first lady Barbara Bush, herself a fierce competitor, shifted into loving grandmother mode. \"I'll never forget Mrs. Bush praising Chelsea, who was 12 at the time,\" Clinton told me, \"for the way she handled herself so maturely through the crucible of the campaign. Chelsea replied, 'Thank you, Mrs. Bush, I tried.' And Mrs. Bush said, in her direct, classic way, 'Oh, we all try. But not everyone can do it.'\"I asked Clinton about the car ride from the White House to the Capitol. He declined to reveal specifics -- some secrets are, apparently, kept in the Presidents' Club -- but he told me, \"As we spent the final moments together before the peaceful transition of power, the theme that came out again and again was gratitude -- for the remarkable democracy in which we live, and for the chance to serve its people so well and so long.\"The choreography of an inauguration is precise. The Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court is called forward. The President-elect recites the oath, right hand raised, left hand on the Bible.  As the words, \"So help me God,\" leave his lips, the Army fires a 21-gun salute, a bracing signal that he now commands the most powerful military in human history.  Bill Clinton, standing between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton, takes the oath of office of President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1993.All went according to the script on that frigid January day in 1993.  After the oath, Clinton hugged his wife and daughter, and waved to the crowd. Then, in his first act as President, he strode across the platform and shook his predecessor's hand. The two former foes had a brief but warm public greeting. A deeply empathetic man, Clinton was profoundly attuned to the pain his predecessor felt, having been rejected himself in his first bid for reelection as governor of Arkansas in 1980 -- and did his best to acknowledge the difficulty of the moment. And just as Clinton's first act as President was a tribute to Bush, his first few words as President included this praise for the man he had defeated: \"On behalf of our Nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America. And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism, and communism.\"  On that day, the presidency was in transition. But so, notably, was Clinton's relationship with Bush. Clinton never knew his father, who died in a car accident before he was born. Over the years, he and Bush formed a bond that was nearly familial. Bush himself suggested that perhaps he, two decades Clinton's senior, had been the father Clinton never had.  Get our free weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookAfter Clinton's term, the two teamed up for disaster relief efforts, and Clinton made regular pilgrimages to the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where the elder former president would impress the younger by slicing through the ocean at high speeds on his beloved boat. President George W. Bush has said his family's relationship with Clinton is so close that he is \"a brother with a different mother.\"  For his part, Clinton clearly misses George H.W. and Barbara Bush. Thinking back on the warmth they showed him on that chilly January day, he said, \"President and Mrs. Bush were wonderful people and true patriots.  I'll always be grateful for their friendship and example -- and especially how warmly they treated us that day.\"Don't expect Trump to be teaming up with any of his predecessors to help the victims of a far-away tsunami, or even to join him for a round of golf. His absence from Biden's inauguration calls to mind one of the maxims George H.W. Bush loved to quote: \"Ninety percent of life is just showing up.\"",

But with tens of thousands of Russian troops amassing on Ukraine's border with Belarus just a few miles away, the ghost town is now playing host to security forces training for war. Ukraine is using Chernobyl to prepare for another potential cataclysm.Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently denied that the Kremlin is planning an incursion into Ukraine. Russia's deployments in Belarus are ostensibly linked to joint exercises due to begin on Thursday. However, satellite photographs show Russian camps being established close to the border with Ukraine, hundreds of miles from where the exercises are taking place.   If Russia were to invade Ukraine, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is a possible conduit to Kyiv. American and NATO officials say President Putin is steadily increasing his military presence in Belarus from 5,000 troops in January to an estimated 30,000 sometime this month.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday that the deployment into Belarus is Russia's biggest since the Cold War, and many of those forces are just a two-hour drive from Kyiv.

Now, in training for war, Ukraine has brought the world's media along to see.Alexandra Stupak, an officer with the Ukrainian Border Guard. \"We are ready to protect our Ukraine,\" she says. \"But we dont want [a] conflict situation.\"Denys Monastyrsky, Ukraine's internal affairs minister, told journalists that security forces were using the Chernobyl exercises to demonstrate how far they have come in urban combat tactics since Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists seized a swathe of eastern Ukraine nearly eight years ago.\"All these scenarios are taken and summarized from the cases that have occurred since 2014,\" Monastyrsky said.The spectacle, however, is also an attempt by Kyiv to match the glitzy propaganda effort coming out of Moscow.On the diplomatic front, Russia has repeatedly accused NATO of being the party responsible for the crisis, arguing the alliance's eastward expansion poses an existential threat. Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, is pumping out propaganda videos worthy of a Hollywood production, with tank columns driving at maximum speed across the frozen steppe and ground-attack fighters swooping into bases in southern Belarus.The exact nature of Russia's threat to Ukraine remains unclear and a point of contention.Ukrainian officials have spent much of the past few weeks playing down the US estimation that a Russian invasion could be \"imminent,\" concerned that the dire language was causing panic and destabilizing the economy.\"We have the same facts, but the different perception, or a different estimation,\" Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told CNN after watching the exercises in Chernobyl.Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov in Pripyat, Ukraine, during national guard training exercises.The White House is no longer calling a potential invasion \"imminent\" due to concerns, they say, that the term suggests Putin has already made a decision to invade Ukraine.Nonetheless, Ukraine admits that Russia's military buildup in Belarus is worrying.'Only a fool would start a war'War is far from the minds of many Ukrainians who live near the border where Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia meet.\"They've been saying 'a war is coming' for five years now,\" said one man who asked not to be named.\"Only a fool would start a war,\" he said. \"There won't be any winners.\"\"Only a fool would start a war,\" a Ukrainian resident tells CNN as he takes a deep drag of his hand-rolled cigarette.The Three Sisters Cafe is seen near the Ukrainian border with Russia and Belarus.At the Three Sisters Cafe, named for the three former Soviet republics, 64-year-old Masha pours espresso in paper cups for the weary drivers who wander in.Truck after truck is waiting to cross into Russia.

        "images": [],
        "content": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)The danger was visible all around them, long before a group of Christian Aid Ministries missionaries and children were abducted from the road in Haiti.In one 2019 blog post, an unnamed member of the Ohio-based group described a harrowing escape from a group of men near the Port-au-Prince airport. A man dressed in black shouting for money stopped the truck, the author wrote. \"In a matter of seconds, there were two, of them, then three, and more and more. Countless big arms were coming in both front windows. Someone pulled a knife but there were so many other arms in the way that he couldn't do anything more than small scratch.\"We tried to keep going, but they were jumping on the back of the truck, piled on the hood, and hanging all over the truck,\" they wrote, adding that there was a smell of alcohol in the air. The driver \"veered the truck and tried again to speed up, but we hit a large rock that was unseen with all the bodies on the hood. The men tried to cut the truck tires, but failed.\"I don't even know how we eventually got out of there, but we escaped without shots being fired after us.  I guess some were content enough with the loot they managed to get, and backed off to fight among themselves over it,\" they wrote.Read MoreA goat stands in the courtyard of the Maison La Providence de Dieu orphanage it Ganthier, in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti on Sunday, where a gang abducted 17 missionaries the day prior.More warning signs were to come. In 2020, the group's home base in Titanyen, a village north of Port-au-Prince, received threats from a local gang, according to another post on the same blog.\"Gangs fighting each other breaks the calm nights with rapid gun fire. The CAM base in Haiti has been targeted by the local gang. Demanding money and food they vandalize CAM vehicles and threaten with severity,\" it read.That same year, the group's annual report said that it had been forced to pull American staff out of Haiti for nine months because of political unrest, before returning them. On Saturday, things took a turn for the worse. Seventeen Christian Aid Ministries members -- a group ranging in age from 8 months to 48 years -- were kidnapped by the 400 Mawozo gang after visiting an orphanage in Croix-des-Bouquets, a northeast suburb of the capital Port-au-Prince. Members of one family, who were with a young child when they were taken hostage, had just arrived in Haiti earlier this month. They have been held captive for four days now. The missionaries' captors have demanded $1 million per hostage, totaling $17 million -- and so far are sticking to their demands. \"The kidnappers have been warned about harming the hostages and what may be the consequences for them [if that were to happen]. But they are not swayed by those warnings,\" Haitian Justice Minister Liszt Quitel said.The 400 Mawozo, which numbers up to 150 members according to a Haitian security source, is notorious for group kidnappings and largely controls Croix-des-Bouquets. In the same area in April, five priests and two nuns, including two French citizens, were previously abducted and later freed on ransom. The 81-year-old nun, Sister Agnes Bordeau, told CNN that armed men took control of their bus and drove it to a forest. There the group spent the first five days of their captivity, sleeping on pieces of cardboard with only a sheet to protect them from the chill of the night air. Their meals, she says, consisted of some rice and a little meat that the missionaries shared with the guards. \"A certain trust developed between us,\" said Bordeau.\"They told us about their lives. They were young men who had just come out of prison and who could find no work other than taking up arms and becoming guards for hostages. They didn't even know the gang leaders for whom they were working. They were sort of hostages as well,\" she said.The group was later moved between small and squalid shelters. They were released after 20 days. Bordeau wouldn't comment on whether a ransom had been paid by the French state or not, just that a $1 million ransom had been demanded by her captors.She now lives in a convent near La Rochelle on France's Atlantic west coast, and says of the latest kidnapping that she feels \"a of sadness for the Haitian people, who want nothing more than to be able to get out of all this and who can't.\"Global attention to a Haitian epidemicHundreds of kidnappings have been reported in Haiti since the start of the year, but this latest incident involving US and Canadian missionaries has catapulted the country's security crisis into the global spotlight. Gangs control over 60% of the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area, Pierre Esperance, executive director of Haiti's National Human Rights Defense Network said in July, effectively leaving more than 200,000 city residents cut off from basic services and transportation in areas run by gangs abandoned by police presence. And in a city of nearly a million residents, nearly everyone seems to have their own grim story to tell, with stories of abduction and attacks as rife as the poverty and political instability that propels it. Chrisner and Merline, a married couple from Port-au-Prince, were kidnapped in January -- seized as they exited their local church. As they sat in their kidnappers' car, with hoods on their head, they could only think about one thing: You either come back home or you don't return at all. Fear stalks Haitians as their murdered president is buried and gangs terrorize the capitalFor five sleepless days, the couple waited in a small room where they were given water and food just once a day. \"We were just in the room waiting for the time they will have to decide what they will do with us,\" they said. They were freed after their church raised enough money to pay the ransom -- 600,000 Haitian gourdes, or around $6,300 -- an insurmountable amount for most Haitians.Since January, at least 645 kidnappings have taken place, only rarely involving foreigners. Out of this year's total, 42 kidnappings were of foreigners, and 4 were foreign residents, according to the Port-au-Prince nonprofit Center for Analysis and Research for Human Rights (CARDH). Data from the global risk consultancy Control Risks found that reported kidnapping cases increased by 550% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. Port-au-Prince resident Jean Gardy Jean told CNN the coverage that the kidnappings of the American missionaries this week speaks volumes about the way in which the world values Haitian lives.\"Kidnappings here have been happening for so long, why did no one talk about it then? Why is the world making such a big deal about foreigners? It's because they're more important,\" he said.'Gangs have become more influential actors'Haiti's deteriorating economic outlook, punctuated by the assassination of president Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July has turbocharged the country's security crisis. More than 15,000 people fled their homes in the capital this summer, due to gang violence and rampant arson. Life in Port-au-Prince is marred by skyrocketing inflation, frequent blackouts, and shortages of food and fuel, largely due to gang activity choking off key delivery routes.\"Gangs have become more influential actors, which puts pressure on the interim government,\" Alan Zamayoa, Control Risks' analyst for the Americas said, noting that in recent months, humanitarian aid was able to circulate through Martissant, a gang-ridden neighborhood in the capital, as a result of a gang truce. On Sunday, the hold of gang activity was laid bare, as Prime Minister Ariel Henry was forced to backtrack on plans to lay a wreath for the Haitian Revolution leader Jean-Jacques Dessalines -- a national holiday commemorating his death -- during a memorial in Pont Rouge, an area controlled by a coalition of gangs known as the G9.Zamayoa says that many factors are at play.  While \"security forces are overwhelmed and understaffed,\" he said that in recent years criminals have also \"gained access to deadlier weapons, such as semi-automatic rifles, which are much more powerful than the police's equipment.\"The assassination of Haiti's president is the latest challenge for CNN Heroes serving their nationZamayoa explained that in addition to those factors, \"collusion with police agents and politicians, as well as impunity, are extremely high.\" This all contributes to the gangs' ability to \"wield territorial control\" over areas of the capital, Nicola White, Control Risk's Director, added. \"They can hold multiple victims at the same time because they are not under sustained, credible pressure to conclude cases quickly or discreetly,\" White said, adding that these factors \"have enabled the significant rise in kidnapping.\"But Haitians have had enough. Just before the missionaries' abduction, a Haitian transportation union called for an indefinite strike, which began on Monday, in protest of the rise in kidnappings -- among other issues.Reporting contributed by CNN's Caitlin Hu.",

        "content": "Story highlightsJoe Arpaio is an 85-year-old former Maricopa County sheriff President Donald Trump hinted he'd pardon Arpaio in a Tuesday speech (CNN)He flouted the Constitution. He disobeyed court orders. And then he bragged about it. To understand the building outrage, particularly among civil rights groups, over the possibility that President Donald Trump would pardon former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, one need only return to the July criminal contempt decision against him.White House has paperwork ready for Joe Arpaio pardonIt followed a decade-long case against the sheriff for racial-profiling practices in Arizona, during which Arpaio was ordered to stop targeting Latinos for traffic stops and detention.\"Not only did (Arpaio) abdicate responsibility, he announced to the world and to his subordinates that he was going to continue business as usual no matter who said otherwise,\" wrote US District Judge Susan Bolton in the July 31 order finding Arpaio guilty of criminal contempt.The 85-year-old sheriff who lost his run for a seventh term in 2016 is scheduled to be sentenced October 5. Trump has strongly suggested he would pardon Arpaio before then, and CNN has learned that the White House was preparing the necessary paperwork and talking points to distribute to allies.Read More\"Do the people in this room like Sheriff Joe?\" Trump asked the crowd at a Phoenix rally Tuesday night. To applause, Trump said, \"So was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job? ... I'll make a prediction: I think he's going to be just fine.\"Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio takes the stage to introduce Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump at a political rally at the Phoenix Convention Center on July 11, 2015 in Phoenix, Arizona.Yet it is plain that Arpaio was not convicted for doing his job. He was convicted for willfully disobeying the law after a court ordered him to stop singling out drivers based on ethnicity and detaining them without charges. Arpaio, who first took office in 1993, rose to national prominence for his crackdown on illegal immigration, earning the nickname \"America's toughest sheriff\" along the way. He cultivated that reputation, and as Bolton's order makes clear, he was not going to let anyone tell him what to do.Bolton's decision arose from a finding of civil contempt by US District Court Judge G. Murray Snow in the racial-profiling case of Melendres v. Arpaio, first filed in 2007. Beginning in 2011, Snow ordered Arpaio to stop detaining people based simply on a belief that they were in the country illegally, rather than suspicion that a crime has been committed.Arpaio refused to comply, even though Maricopa County lawyers warned him about the magnitude of Snow's order and advised him not to pick up people unless grounds existed for state charges.Unspoken aim of Trump's ire: his own aides' adviceAfter the first order in 2011, Arpaio told various television reporters that he would \"never give in to control by the federal government,\" that he would not \"back down\" and \"if they don't like what I'm doing get the laws changed in Washington.\"Bolton said that Arpaio and others in his department continued to round up people and try to turn them over to federal officials. In 2013, as the racial profiling lawsuit was being resolved, Snow issued a permanent injunction preventing the sheriff's office from \"detaining, holding, or arresting Latino occupants of vehicles in Maricopa County based on a reasonable belief, without more, that such persons were in country without authorization.\"The order made clear that the sheriff lacked the authority to try to pursue immigration violations, and that Arpaio and his deputies would be violating the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures if they held people who were not suspected of committing state crimes.Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio delivers a speech on the fourth day of the Republican National Convention on July 21, 2016 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.Arpaio argued that he had authority to try to work with federal agencies to find immigration violations. Without agreeing with the premise, Bolton wrote that even if that were true, once Snow issued his first order in 2011 -- blocking the sheriff from picking up people for whom no criminal charges existed -- Arpaio was on notice that his practices violated Fourth Amendment rights and he had to stop the practice.None of the warnings mattered to him, Bolton concluded, noting that Arpaio \"stated on numerous occasions that he would continue to keep doing what he had been doing.\"One of the possible Trump administration \"talking points\" for an Arpaio pardon, CNN has learned, is that he served the country for 50 years, from his days in the military to his time as Maricopa County sheriff and should not be sentenced for \"enforcing the law\" and \"working to keep people safe.\"Such a pardon, contends Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, would excuse \"racist and illegal policing.\"Gupta, a former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division in the Obama administration, said in a statement, \"If President Trump uses his power to pardon a discredited law enforcement official who persistently engaged in racial profiling of the Latino community, it will not be a dog whistle to the so-called 'alt right' and white supremacists, but a bullhorn.\"JUST WATCHEDArpaio successor: 'Community was not happy'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHArpaio successor: 'Community was not happy' 01:30",

In the documents released Monday, evidence is laid out in attention-getting detail, with tantalizing quotes (\"Great work,\" a campaign supervisor tells Papadopoulos). The documents point up the fact that the Trump campaign was aware early in 2016 of offers of \"thousands\" of potentially damaging emails about Democrat Hillary Clinton. There is an implicit warning to potential additional defendants about trying to hide evidence and a \"we've got more\" suggestion throughout. The Papadopoulos statement opened with the observation that it does not \"constitute all the facts known\" and then referred to conversations he had with multiple high-ranking (unnamed at this point) campaign officials. Mueller investigation has 'nothing to do with the President,' White House saysThe timing of the rollout may also have thrown the White House. Manafort was pictured walking into FBI offices in Washington as he and Gates were indicted. The President barely had had time to assert on Twitter that the indictment of Manafort and Gates was unrelated to his campaign when the Papadopoulos news went public.The guilty plea details how the 30-year-old former campaign foreign policy adviser lied to federal investigators about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government. Papadopoulos falsely described the facts surrounding interactions with a foreign contact regarding possible \"dirt\" on Clinton, Republican Trump's opponent in the race for the White House.JUST WATCHEDA timeline into the Russia investigationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA timeline into the Russia investigation 03:57Mueller's methodical processMueller, a former FBI director first appointed by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001 and continued under Democratic President Barack Obama, was named the Russia special counsel on May 17.\u00a0Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from Russia-related matters, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the appointment after Trump fired then-FBI director James Comey, who previously oversaw the Russia investigation. \u00a0Pretending problem doesn't exist doesn't solve problem, American President learnsAs laid out by Rosenstein, Mueller is investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly\" from the investigation and any attempts to interfere with it, such as perjury, obstruction of justice and the destruction of evidence.\u00a0The indictment of Manafort and Gates shows that Mueller is going back more than a decade to potential wrongdoing unrelated to the election but connected to Russia. The 31-page, 12-count indictment relates to their political consulting on behalf of Russian-backed officials in Ukraine. It asserts conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, and failure to register as an agent of a foreign principal, among other charges.\u00a0The indictment alleges lavish spending from the offshore accounts, including to pay for mortgages, children's tuition and home decorating. It also documents some of the evidence retrieved from Manafort's Virginia home when federal agents made a pre-dawn raid.\u00a0Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\u00a0Papadopoulos, on the other hand, entered a guilty plea after federal officials caught him lying about his interactions with a \"foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails concerning\" Clinton.\u00a0Neither Hill intel committee has interviewed PapadopoulosThe plea statement lists Papadopoulos' initial falsehoods and his efforts to cover his tracks once the FBI questioned him. He shut down his Facebook account the day after an interview. It had contained information about his communications with Russian nationals. He also stopped using his usual cell phone number and got a new one.\u00a0It turned out Papadopoulos had multiple email exchanges in an effort to arrange a meeting between Trump campaign operatives and Russians. \"It's history making if it happens,\" Papadopoulos wrote enthusiastically in one email.\u00a0The 13-page plea document unsealed on Monday highlights Papadopoulos' connection to the Trump campaign, noting at one point that the campaign told The Washington Post in March 2016 that Papadopoulos was one of five named foreign policy advisers.\u00a0A month later, he met with a contact identified as \"the professor\" for breakfast at a London hotel. The professor had just returned from Moscow, where he apparently met with high-level Russian officals and learned that they had \"dirt\" on Clinton. Papadopoulos initially tried to claim that the interactions with \"the professor\" occurred before he was on the Trump campaign.JUST WATCHEDFormer Trump adviser cooperates with MuellerReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Trump adviser cooperates with Mueller 02:22No leaksIn a town where everything leaks, Mueller was also able to keep Papadopoulos' cooperation and plea deal under wraps.\u00a0Papadopoulos was arrested on July 27 at Dulles International Airport. Mueller noted that Papadopoulos then met with the government \"on numerous occasions.\" He was arraigned and pleaded guilty in federal court October 5, a fact only unsealed Monday.\u00a0The secrecy is a testament to the control Mueller has retained over the unfolding story -- and a warning to anyone who thinks he or she is safe.\u00a0The extent of what Papadopoulos revealed may become evident in upcoming weeks, and Mueller's team argued as part of a motion to seal his case that his \"arrest and the accompanying criminal charges may alert other subjects to the direction and status of the investigation.\"\u00a0The document released Monday already reveals many possible lines of inquiry. Responding to an email related to Russian efforts to meet with Trump himself, a campaign official says, \"Let[']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send a signal.\"\u00a0That ambiguous statement about not sending \"a signal\" is revealed in a footnote; it feels more like a cliffhanger.",

One source familiar with the three meetings -- including the meeting with Jackson, who has long been considered the frontrunner -- said the President has yet to make up his mind. Two other sources confirmed the meetings with Kruger and Childs.Biden's final decision is expected by the end of this month.RELATED: How presidential interviews can make or break a Supreme Court nominationThe top three contenders are Jackson, who sits on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; Kruger, who sits on the California Supreme Court; and Childs, who sits on the US District Court for the District of South Carolina.Read MoreAndrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, declined to comment on interviews Biden has conducted but said the President continues to evaluate candidates to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer.How the Supreme Court confirmation process works\"The President has not yet chosen a nominee,\" Bates said. \"He continues to evaluate eminently qualified individuals in the mold of Justice Breyer who have the strongest records, intellect, character, and dedication to the rule of law that anyone could ask for -- and all of whom would be deserving of bipartisan support. He looks forward to announcing a nominee this month.\"White House officials have also reached out in the last couple of days to liberal groups to let them know that the President was sticking to his end of the month timeline and urging them to support top tier candidates against attacks from critics, according to a person who was contacted.Cedric Richmond, senior adviser to the President, told members of the organization Win With Black Woman on a Sunday night video conference call that the White House was \"close\" to finalizing the pick, according to a source who participated in the call. The group has been supportive of the administration, particularly Black women like Vice President Kamala Harris and Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general for civil rights.Richmond urged the dozens of women on the call, details of which were first reported by The Washington Post, to \"keep protecting\" the process and eventual nominee against attacks that some fear aim to delegitimize the President's pick because of her race and gender.Richmond said the White House would continue to pass around talking points, as it has since Biden said he would choose a Black women weeks ago, and would look to keep the circle tight, using only close allies to help spread the news once a decision was made and an announcement imminent.That evolving crisis with Russia and Ukraine has not derailed the President's plans to make a decision ahead of his March 1 State of the Union address, as of yet.White House officials began reaching out to potential Supreme Court candidates to gather more information about their records earlier this month.

        "content": "(CNN)As a 35-year-old assistant US solicitor general, Leondra Kruger stood before the US Supreme Court in October 2011 with a religious liberty case that was an outright loser. The justices immediately pounced on her claim, made on behalf of the Obama administration, that First Amendment protections for religion did not apply to a church school's dismissal of a teacher who held ministerial duties. Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia called the position \"extraordinary.\" Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said it was \"amazing.\"Biden set to pick his Supreme Court nominee's 'sherpa' as the courting of McConnell and other senators beginsBut as Kruger, now a possible nominee for a Supreme Court seat herself, parried difficult questions, her voice never rose, her cadence never broke. Her arguments were methodical, if aggravating to the justices, as she defended an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lawsuit on behalf of a teacher with narcolepsy who contended her dismissal violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The government lost 9-0 as the court sided with the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and ruled that the long-established \"ministerial exception\" prevented the lawsuit. Supporters now promoting Kruger as a successor to retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer highlight her poise under pressure, her legal acumen and her experience on the top court of the country's most populous state. Kruger, 45, has been a California Supreme Court justice since January 2015, appointed by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. The Pasadena native became only the second Black woman named to the state high court and, at age 38, reportedly the youngest California justice in more than a century. She was also the first one to have a baby while serving.  Read MorePresident Joe Biden faces a highly credentialed slate of \"short listers\" for the Breyer seat. If he selects Kruger, she will become the first justice elevated from a state court since 1981, when President Ronald Reagan chose Arizona state court Judge Sandra Day O'Connor as the first female justice in US history.  Biden would also be tapping a lawyer with significant federal experience, in the prestigious US Solicitor General's Office from 2007 to 2013 and then nearly two years in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. As an advocate before the US Supreme Court, she argued 12 cases, more than any other Black woman. Through her meteoric rise, she has been known for extensive, leave-nothing-to-chance preparation and an analytical, modest approach. Here's a little math lesson for Ted Cruz on the Supreme Court But Kruger is not without disadvantages in the politically charged Supreme Court selection process, where just about every short lister has superior credentials and legions of well-connected backers. Last year Kruger rejected a Biden administration pitch to leave the bench and return to Washington to serve as US solicitor general, the federal government's top lawyer before the Supreme Court. (The solicitor general post requires Senate confirmation but has a limited tenure, unlike life tenure for presidential appointees to the US Supreme Court.)As part of their multiple requests, administration officials asked Washington lawyer Donald Verrilli, himself a former US solicitor general and Kruger friend, to intercede. When contacted by CNN, Verrilli declined to reveal conversations on the subject but said, \"Leondra decided not to pursue the solicitor general position because she loves being a judge and she knows being a judge is what she's meant to do in life. She didn't want to give that up. That is a rare thing. She knows herself.\" Kruger has two children, a 9-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, and other friends said family considerations added to her reluctance to move for the solicitor general post. (Kruger has declined interview requests, and the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.)  Depending on the pressures Biden might feel from advocates on the left, Kruger also may be hurt by her reputation as a liberal jurist with moderate tendencies. She lacks experience in the trenches with criminal defendants, as has US Appellate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who worked as a federal public defender. Supporters of Kruger describe her as a meticulous jurist in the mode of the late former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, for whom she served as a law clerk in 2003-04. Before that clerkship, she had worked as a law clerk to US Appellate Judge David Tatel, of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Tatel told CNN he recalled their interview in his chambers some 20 years ago. \"We were just five minutes into the conversation when I knew I would offer her the job,\" Tatel said. \"She had an unusually mature and sophisticated view of the law and the role of the courts.\"  Southern California nativeKruger grew up in the Pasadena area, the child of two pediatricians. Her mother immigrated from Jamaica as a teenager and then obtained a medical degree from Howard University. She is still a practicing pediatrician. Her late father, of Polish descent, worked in public health administration. Kruger attended Polytechnic School in Pasadena, where she was an academic standout and became a National Merit Scholarship winner and Presidential Scholar. In June 1993, she attended a White House ceremony with about 100 other high school seniors on the South Lawn. After President Bill Clinton spoke, he worked his way enthusiastically through the crowd of students, shaking hands. The Pasadena Star-News reported that Kruger was able to shake the President's hand. She also apparently was struck by how many of the high-achieving students she met were similarly headed to Harvard: \"I feel like I know my whole freshman class already.\" At Harvard, Kruger wrote for The Crimson newspaper, and at Yale Law School she rose to editor in chief of the Yale Law Journal. She was plainly ambitious but always described as low-key, perhaps a reflection of her West Coast upbringing. \"She's very California in the sense that she is incandescently smart but much more understated,\" said American University law professor Amanda Cohen Leiter, who was a law clerk with Kruger in Stevens' chambers. \"She's a person first, intellect second -- not to take away from the intellect at all.\" Another friend and former colleague described Kruger as partial to Sue Grafton murder mysteries and the tamer reality TV shows. She has a surprisingly loud, riotous laugh that breaks her otherwise quiet manner. Kruger is married to a fellow lawyer, Brian Hauck, whom she met when they were both young associates at the law firm of Jenner & Block in Washington. Hauck also worked in the Department of Justice. He returned to the firm in 2015 and is based in its San Francisco office. Biden said he will put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Here's who he may pick to replace BreyerWhen asked on her 2014 California court application to describe her hobbies, Kruger suggested they had all but evaporated since the birth of her first child but said she enjoyed reading contemporary fiction, spending time outdoors and attending the occasional yoga class. \"I also enjoy learning foreign languages, although I have become mediocre (at best) at a very small handful of languages and fully proficient in none of them.\" When Kruger delivered her second child in 2016, a little over a year after donning the black robe, she made headlines in California as the first justice ever to have a baby while serving. California record Brown's selection of Kruger reflected the wide net he was casting for young and diverse legal luminaries. He had earlier appointed Goodwin Liu and Mariano-Florentino Cu\u00e9llar, both of whom were law professors with vast experience and Yale law degrees. When Kruger was selected, some California news reports speculated that she would be criticized for her arguments in the Hosanna-Tabor religion case. Obama administration lawyers had been trying to craft a position that would allow certain church employee claims of discrimination while respecting religious liberty. But by discounting any \"ministerial exception\" before the Supreme Court, they plainly erred. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the opinion emphasizing the First Amendment's \"special solicitude\" for the rights of religious entities.\"The Court cannot accept the remarkable view that the (First Amendment's) Religion Clauses have nothing to say about a religious organization's freedom to select its own ministers,\" Roberts wrote, referring to the administration's position.For Kruger, however, any controversy evaporated, and she was approved. Brown's choice required confirmation by a special three-member commission, which in 2014 included then-state Attorney General Kamala Harris, now vice president. As part of her California court questionnaire, Kruger observed: \"In my capacity as a lawyer for the federal government, I have worked on a number of issues that have been the subject of public debate and I have expressed views on behalf of the federal government with which others may reasonably disagree.\" To a question about the most important attributes of an appellate jurist, she was similarly anodyne, saying judges should approach cases with \"an open mind,\" \"analytical rigor and precision,\" and handle disputes \"modestly and with restraint.\" The California Supreme Court has a heavy load of criminal cases. Kruger wrote an opinion last year for a unanimous court that gave a death row inmate the right to review a prosecutor's notes for the inmate's claim of racial discrimination during jury selection. \"... (A) litigant has the right to challenge an opponent's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges,\" Kruger wrote, referring to objections to proposed jurors. \"But as both the United States Supreme Court and this court have repeatedly made clear, the harm of the practice is not limited to individual litigants. Discrimination in jury selection also does grievous injury to the jurors and to 'the very integrity of the courts' charged with ensuring equal justice for all comers in a diverse society.\" Kruger noted that prosecutors wanted to shield the notes as part of their traditionally protected \"work product,\" and said the state supreme court need not resolve broad issues of work-product protection. Rather, she wrote, the prosecutor in this case opened the door to use of the notes through information he offered to justify the juror challenges.  She also wrote a unanimous opinion that gave defendants in misdemeanor appeals a state constitutional right to lawyers.  DNA testing law opinionBut in 2018, in a case that some critics have raised to question her liberal credentials, she authored an opinion upholding a state law requiring suspects who are arrested to provide cheek swabs for DNA testing.

She also said the court was \"mindful of the heightened privacy interests in the sensitive information that can be extracted from a person's DNA. ... But our cases have also recognized that safeguards against the wrongful use or disclosure of sensitive information may minimize the privacy intrusion when the government accesses personal information, including sensitive medical information.\" Liu was among the dissenters in the 4-3 case, writing of the state's DNA collection practice, \"This is not a scheme carefully calibrated to identify felony offenders. Instead, it can be fairly described as a biological dragnet.\" Liu continued, \"I have no doubt that law enforcement is aided by the collection and retention of massive numbers of DNA profiles, whether those profiles are used to confirm a person's identity, to facilitate access to criminal history or other information about a person, or to help solve unsolved crimes. But if those interests are enough to justify the collection and retention of DNA from persons who are arrested but not convicted, not charged, or not even found to be lawfully detained so long as they do not seek expungement, then it is not that far a step for the state to collect and retain DNA from law-abiding people in general, including anyone who 'applies for a driver's license' or 'attends a public school.' \" A well-timed visit to DCOverall, Kruger's state court record suggests an approach more in sync with the liberal Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan than with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, today's most compelling, dissenting voice on the 6-3 conservative-liberal bench. On January 26, the day that word of Breyer's impending retirement hit the news, Kruger was flying to Washington for a previously scheduled moot court competition. By the time she arrived at George Washington University Law School, there was considerable attention on her as a short lister. She participated in the student moot court exercise on Thursday, forming a panel with Tatel and Judge Ryan Nelson, from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals. They questioned student teams who argued over a fictional state law that restricted access to hormonal drugs and prohibited surgeries on minors for gender transition. The law was challenged by the parents of children who wanted to begin transition surgical procedures. The mock \"Supreme Court\" was not resolving the issue presented but rather determining which team offered the strongest arguments and oral advocacy. The students representing the parents won. Afterward, each of the judges offered gentle criticism for the students' performances. Kruger praised both sides for their preparation and focused arguments. George Washington University law professor Alan Morrison, who had recruited the judges months ago, said later that Supreme Court speculation was in the air. \"But she carried on,\" Morrison said. \"She asked the questions she was going to ask. Pictures were taken. ... It was as if nothing had happened.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Before the Biden administration engages in any fight with the Senate over the President's choice for the Supreme Court, there will likely be a brawl within. President Joe Biden's allies are already jockeying for attention to their preferences, as seen in House Majority Whip James Clyburn's forceful support for South Carolina-based US trial Judge Michelle Childs. Much of the lobbying will be subtler, through back channels and efforts to shape the way that leading contenders are portrayed, in the news media and by those in position to influence Biden. Breyer's role on the Supreme Court and the hole he's leaving  The President's advisers are bound to differ to some extent regarding his selection of a historic first Black female justice, and Biden himself may be torn. RELATED: Breyer's role on the Supreme Court and the hole he's leavingRead MoreIt took President Bill Clinton three months to settle on Ruth Bader Ginsburg for his choice in 1993. President George W. Bush in 2005 brushed aside the preference of Vice President Dick Cheney when he chose John Roberts. And in 2009, President Barack Obama navigated the competing interests of his advisers before he selected Sonia Sotomayor, the country's first Latina justice. For a successor to retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, the front-runner appears to be Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 51, a former trial judge whom Biden appointed last year to the Washington-based US appellate court that has long operated as a launchpad to the high court. Jackson once served as a law clerk to Breyer. But the President is exploring a slate of other highly credentialed candidates, including Childs, 55, whom he recently nominated to the same prominent DC Circuit appellate court, and California state Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, 45. White House chief of staff Ron Klain will be at the center of the selection process and perhaps subject to as much pressure from competing constituencies as Biden. Klain possesses unparalleled experience with the politics of Supreme Court nominations. He served in the Clinton and Obama administrations and helped screen candidates for the high court. Klain also was a chief legal counsel to Biden when the then-senator chaired the Judiciary Committee. Biden said he will put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Here's who he may pick to replace Breyer Klain knows the pressures that will confront Biden and the potential influencers, whether members of Congress, close aides or family. Klain, who may have his own preference, would also understand that this could be the President's only shot at an appointment to America's highest court. The selection of a first Black female justice, as Biden pledged Thursday, will make history. But the individual chosen for a lifetime seat may also represent the President's most enduring legacy. Bill Clinton's back and forth  To see past instances of political titans influencing the White House selection process, one could look simply to Clinton's choice of Breyer in 1994 to fill the seat of retiring Justice Harry Blackmun.  Then-Sen. Ted Kennedy, the powerful Massachusetts Democrat, heavily promoted Breyer, a US appellate judge at the time, for the high court. Breyer had served as a counsel to Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1970s.In 1993, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York backed the Brooklyn-born Ginsburg, touting her, as others had, as \"the Thurgood Marshall of women's rights\" for her strategic advocacy on women's legal equality.Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court William Rehnquist (R) administers the oath of office to newly-appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (L) as U.S. President Bill Clinton looks on 10 August 1993. Clinton had initially searched for a national figure who transcended the law, in the mold of former California Gov. Earl Warren, who served as chief justice from 1953 to 1969. Clinton turned first to former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, but Cuomo declined, shunning the cloistered world of the court. Clinton considered Breyer for that 1993 vacancy arising from the retirement of Justice Byron White, but failed to be persuaded during a reportedly awkward luncheon interview. (Breyer was recovering from a serious bicycle accident at the time. Still on pain medication, he had been hit by a car near his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and suffered broken ribs and a punctured lung.) Ginsburg, then a judge on the springboard DC Circuit, had a place on the Clinton's shortlist, but the president had rebuffed those asking him to interview her. As improbable as it seems today, given her \"Notorious RBG\" liberal reputation, some women's rights advocates quietly opposed Ginsburg's nomination. Her record on the DC Circuit was not consistently liberal, and she had expressed skepticism for the legal rationale of Roe v. Wade, even as she strongly supported access to abortion. \"The women are against her,\" Clinton told Moynihan, according to Moynihan's account in his personal correspondence at his archive at the Library of Congress. Moynihan said he countered, \"That is your problem, Mr. President. You have too many friends. You cannot govern without enemies.\" White had told Clinton of his impending retirement in mid-March, and by early June Clinton still had not found a nominee who suited him. Attorney General Janet Reno made another pitch for Ginsburg, and Clinton agreed to meet with her. The reserved but persuasive jurist immediately impressed the president, and he publicly announced her nomination the next day.George W. Bush's political strugglesMore than a decade later, Bush faced competing advice as he weighed his shortlist for an associate justice seat, after Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement on July 1, 2005.  Bush wrote in his memoir that he had discussed the choices -- narrowed to Roberts, then on the DC Circuit, and fellow US appellate Judges Michael Luttig, on a Richmond, Virginia-based bench, and Samuel Alito, on a Philadelphia-based court -- with top advisers Cheney, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, White House counsel Harriet Miers, chief of staff Andy Card and deputy chief of staff Karl Rove.\"They liked Roberts, but he was not at the top of all lists,\" Bush wrote in his book, \"Decision Points.\" \"Dick and Al backed Luttig, who they felt was the most dedicated conservative jurist. Harriet supported Alito because he had the most established judicial record. Andy and Karl shared my inclination toward Roberts.\" Bush then turned to a former top aide: Brett Kavanaugh, whom he had appointed to the DC Circuit.  Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers listens as President George W. Bush speaks in the Oval Office of the White House October 3, 2005 in Washington.  \"Brett told me that Luttig, Alito, and Roberts would all be solid justices. The tiebreaker question, he suggested, was which man would be the most effective leader on the Court -- the most capable of convincing his colleagues through persuasion and strategic thinking.\" Bush settled on Roberts for the O'Connor spot in July of 2005 but then switched him to the chief justice vacancy that arose that September when William Rehnquist died.

For the lingering O'Connor opening, Bush initially chose his White House counsel Miers, a close friend who had had a successful legal practice in their home state of Texas. (First lady Laura Bush had voiced support for a female nominee.) But Miers had scant constitutional law experience. Conservative heavyweights objected. Robert Bork, a former DC Circuit appellate judge who had been rejected by the Senate for the Supreme Court in 1987, called the Miers nomination \"a disaster on every level.\"Miers withdrew after weeks of controversy, and Bush choose Alito -- an early favorite of Miers -- for the O'Connor seat.  Obama eraObama's first opportunity to fill a vacancy arose in 2009, when Justice David Souter retired. Sotomayor, who had been a trial judge and 11-year veteran of the New York-based US appellate court, landed high on the shortlist and was poised to become the first Latina on the Supreme Court.  An array of inside supporters and outside advocates were variously backing Sotomayor and two other finalists, then-US Solicitor General Elena Kagan and US appellate Judge Diane Wood, based in Chicago. First lady Michelle Obama was encouraging Sotomayor's nomination.

After he made the choice and publicly revealed his history-making selection, he crossed paths with Klain, who at the time was then-Vice President Biden's chief of staff. As Klain later recounted, he saw relief and satisfaction on Obama's face. Said Obama, \"I feel really good about this.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)During his nearly three-decade tenure, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has authored a number of important opinions. His style is straightforward, without rhetorical flourish and marked by a tendency toward numbered points.   A former law professor, he readily delves into the intricacies of federal statutes. But he also has demonstrated a pragmatism and tried to show in his opinions an understanding of how the words of the court would impact the lives of individual Americans.   Here are some of Breyer's most notable writings to date:  Abortion  Stenberg v. Carhart. A 2000 case testing a Nebraska prohibition on an abortion procedure labeled \"partial birth\" and medically known as dilation and evacuation (D&E). Read MoreBreyer wrote for the majority in what would become the first of a series of abortion opinions he authored over the next two decades. Before assessing the Nebraska law in light of cases that forbid government from placing an \"undue burden\" on women seeking abortion, Breyer addressed the dueling public interests.  Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer plans to retire\"We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.\"   \"Taking account of these virtually irreconcilable points of view, aware that constitutional law must govern a society whose different members sincerely hold directly opposing views, and considering the matter in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental individual liberty, this Court, in the course of a generation, has determined and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection to the woman's right to choose. ...\"  \"The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute, making criminal the performance of a 'partial birth abortion,' violates the Federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey (1992), and Roe v. Wade (1973). We conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons. First, the law lacks any exception 'for the preservation of the . . . health of the mother.' Second, it 'imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability' to choose a D&E abortion, thereby unduly burdening the right to choose abortion itself.\"  One word sums up Breyer's judicial philosophyTwenty years later, in June Medical Services v. Russo, Breyer authored the judgment of the majority striking down a Louisiana law that required physicians who perform abortions in clinics to obtain \"admitting privileges\" at a local hospital. (Such credentialing can be difficult for clinic physicians to obtain, and lower court judges have found that they do not ensure greater health benefits for women.)  Breyer's opinion, however, was penned only for a plurality of the court, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the fifth vote to strike down the Louisiana regulation but wrote separately to explain that his rationale differed from Breyer's. Much of Breyer's decision was tied to his 2016 decision for a majority (with Justice Anthony Kennedy still on the court) in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt that invalidated a similar Texas law.  Breyer began with the legal standard derived from past Supreme Court cases highlighting a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy and that government may not unduly burden that right. A key precedent is the 1992 Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey.   \"In Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (2016), we held that '[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right' and are therefore 'constitutionally invalid.' We explained that this standard requires courts independently to review the legislative findings upon which an abortion-related statute rests and to weigh the law's 'asserted benefits against the burdens' it imposes on abortion access. The Texas statute at issue in Whole Woman's Health required abortion providers to hold 'active admitting privileges at a hospital' within 30 miles of the place where they perform abortions. ...\" Ruth Bader Ginsburg's books are on the auction block: A bidder's guide\"In this case, we consider the constitutionality of a Louisiana statute, Act 620, that is almost word-for-word identical to Texas' admitting-privileges law. As in Whole Woman's Health, the District Court found that the statute offers no significant health benefit. It found that conditions on admitting privileges common to hospitals throughout the State have made and will continue to make it impossible for abortion providers to obtain conforming privileges for reasons that have nothing to do with the State's asserted interests in promoting women's health and safety. And it found that this inability places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion. ...\"  \"Since Casey, we have repeatedly reiterated that the plaintiff 's burden in a challenge to an abortion regulation is to show that the regulation's 'purpose or effect' is to 'plac[e] a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.'\"  School Desegregation  Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1. Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion for four liberals when the conservative majority invalidated school integration plans in Seattle and Louisville in 2007. He particularly took issue with Roberts' statement, as Roberts rejected the integration plans, that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"  \"... I do not claim to know how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems of increasing de facto segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation's children and how best to administer America's schools to achieve that aim. The Court should leave them to their work. And it is for them to decide, to quote the plurality's slogan, whether the best 'way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.' ...\"  The Gorsuch-Sotomayor kerfuffle shows how the Supreme Court will close ranks amid controversy\"Consequently, the Court's decision today slows down and sets back the work of local school boards to bring about racially diverse schools. ... Finally, what of the hope and promise of Brown? For much of this Nation's history, the races remained divided. It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court's finest hour, Brown v. Board of Education challenged this history and helped to change it. For Brown held out a promise. It was a promise embodied in three Amendments designed to make citizens of slaves. ...\" \"The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise of Brown. To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. The plurality's position, I fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret. I must dissent.\"  Ten Commandments  Van Orden v. Perry. In 2005, Breyer wrote the decisive opinion that allowed a four-decade old Ten Commandments display at the Texas Capitol to remain but forbade framed displays of the Ten Commandments on the walls of McCreary County, Kentucky, courthouses. He opened by referring to the First Amendment guarantee that government \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  \"The First Amendment's Religion Clauses ... seek to 'assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all.' They seek to avoid that divisiveness based upon religion that promotes social conflict, sapping the strength of government and religion alike. They seek to maintain that 'separation of church and state' that has long been critical to the 'peaceful dominion that religion exercises in [this] country,' where the 'spirit of religion' and the 'spirit of freedom' are productively 'united' ...\"   Supreme Court to consider landmark challenge to Harvard and UNC affirmative action policies\"As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion. ... Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage. ... This case also differs from McCreary County, where the short (and stormy) history of the courthouse Commandments' displays demonstrates the substantially religious objectives of those who mounted them, and the effect of this readily apparent objective upon those who view them. That history there indicates a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an effort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously inspired document. And, in today's world, in a Nation of so many different religious and comparable nonreligious fundamental beliefs, a more contemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing monument has not. ...\"  \"... [W]here the Establishment Clause is at issue, we must 'distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.'\"  Death penalty Glossip v. Gross. In 2015, Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, dissented from a decision that rejected Death Row defendants' challenge to a drug used in executions and used his opinion to broadly question the constitutionality of capital punishment.  \"[R]ather than try to patch up the death penalty's legal wounds one at a time, I would ask for full briefing on a more basic question: whether the death penalty violates the Constitution. The relevant legal standard is the standard set forth in the Eighth Amendment. The Constitution there forbids the 'inflict[ion]' of 'cruel and unusual punishments.' Nearly 40 years ago, this Court upheld the death penalty under statutes that, in the Court's view, contained safeguards sufficient to ensure that the penalty would be applied reliably and not arbitrarily. The circumstances and the evidence of the death penalty's application have changed radically since then. Given those changes, I believe that it is now time to reopen the question.\" \"In 1976, the Court thought that the constitutional infirmities in the death penalty could be healed; the Court in effect delegated significant responsibility to the States to develop procedures that would protect against those constitutional problems. Almost 40 years of studies, surveys, and experience strongly indicate, however, that this effort has failed. Today's administration of the death penalty involves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1) serious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and (3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death penalty's penological purpose. Perhaps as a result, (4) most places within the United States have abandoned its use. ...\"   \"For it is those changes, taken together with my own 20 years of experience on this Court, that lead me to believe that the death penalty, in and of itself, now likely constitutes a legally prohibited \"cruel and unusual punishmen[t].\"   Immigrant detention Jennings v. Rodriguez. In 2018, Breyer dissented as the majority ruled that immigrants, including asylum seekers, held in detention, even for long periods, do not have a right to periodic bail hearings, joined by Ginsburg and Sotomayor; Breyer read portions of his dissenting statement from the bench, a step that justices take when they believe the majority took a seriously wrong turn in the law and want to call public attention to it.  \"The Government has held all the members of the groups before us in confinement for many months, sometimes for years, while it looks into or contests their claims. But ultimately many members of these groups win their claims and the Government allows them to enter or to remain in the United States.\"  \"... The relevant constitutional language, purposes, history, traditions, context, and case law, taken together, make it likely that, where confinement of the noncitizens before us is prolonged (presumptively longer than six months), bail proceedings are constitutionally required. ...\"  \"The bail questions before us are technical but at heart they are simple. We need only recall the words of the Declaration of Independence, in particular its insistence that all men and women have 'certain unalienable Rights,' and that among them is the right to 'Liberty.' We need merely remember that the Constitution's Due Process Clause protects each person's liberty from arbitrary deprivation. And we need just keep in mind the fact that, since Blackstone's time and long before, liberty has included the right of a confined person to seek release on bail. It is neither technical nor unusually difficult to read the words of these statutes as consistent with this basic right. I would find it far more difficult, indeed, I would find it alarming, to believe that Congress wrote these statutory words in order to put thousands of individuals at risk of lengthy confinement all within the United States but all without hope of bail.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The Supreme Court's response to recent controversy over the justices' masking practices reveals its studied lack of transparency and that, regardless of tensions among the nine, they will close ranks, particularly against the press. The justices' moves this week also sealed, rather than avoided, a place in the politicized mask wars amid the highly contagious Omicron variant. The justices obscured questions related to Neil Gorsuch (who refuses to wear a mask) and Sonia Sotomayor (now participating in court hearings remotely). And the excruciatingly limited responses could not help but draw attention to the court's more significant pattern of holding back basic information on some cases and internal practices. CNN Poll: As Supreme Court ruling on Roe looms, most Americans oppose overturning itIn the past two days, the court issued two orders from the emergency, or \"shadow\" docket, one related to former President Donald Trump's efforts to prevent release of documents to the US House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, rampage at the Capitol and the other involving a Texas abortion ban the court has let take effect, in conflict with the 1973 Roe v. Wade. In neither case was the vote count of the full nine made public. Read MoreThe mask controversy only reinforced the message that any public disclosures will be on the justices' terms. Justices Gorsuch and Sotomayor sidestepped direct questions in their joint statement, and Chief Justice John Roberts issued a single sentence (\"I did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench.\"), accompanied by word that he would have no further comment.  The court -- and public -- might have been better served if some direct explanation had been offered to journalists asking questions at the outset on January 7, when Gorsuch first ascended the bench as the lone justice without a mask and Sotomayor, who has diabetes and has taken special precautions throughout the pandemic, began participating in arguments from her chambers. Gorsuch and Sotomayor normally sit next to each other on the elevated bench. Whatever Gorsuch's reason for shunning a mask -- perhaps personal, perhaps to make a statement -- he was not sharing it.Gorsuch has not responded to repeated CNN requests for an explanation, including on Friday. Gorsuch, like his colleagues, is fully vaccinated and has received a booster shot against Covid-19. Court officials made the booster information public on January 4, after weeks of declining to answer reporters' questions and only after the Associated Press published a story regarding the justices' reluctance to say whether they had received a third dose.Two rare statementsThe justices broke their silence on Wednesday, a day after National Public Radio's Nina Totenberg said that \"according to court sources, Sotomayor did not feel safe in close proximity to people who were unmasked. Roberts, understanding that, in some form asked the other justices to mask up.\"  Sotomayor and Gorsuch issued a statement on Wednesday that said, \"Reporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends.\" Totenberg had not reported that Sotomayor asked Gorsuch to wear a mask. She said Roberts did. A few hours after the Sotomayor-Gorsuch release on Wednesday, Roberts put out the statement that he had not asked Gorsuch or any justice to wear a mask. NPR is standing by its report that Roberts \"in some form asked the other justices to mask up.\" Perhaps Roberts signaled in some way that he wanted his colleagues to wear masks. Perhaps he did not. The larger point is that the justices could have explained the situation publicly. The tangled accounts occur against the broader canvas of stealthy votes, after-hours actions, and a general reluctance to clarify information for the public. On September 1, when the justices first let a Texas abortion ban take effect, despite the 1973 decision that declared a constitutional right to abortion, the action occurred in a midnight order. Sotomayor and Gorsuch say they are 'warm colleagues and friends' amid masking dustupOn Thursday, when the justices for the fourth time rejected a request by abortion clinics to intervene, this time to head off protracted state proceedings, the court acted in a one-sentence order. The three liberal justices publicly dissented, decrying, in Sotomayor's words, that \"for the fourth time, this Court declines to protect pregnant Texans from egregious violations of their constitutional rights.\" In prior court actions on the Texas ban at roughly six weeks of pregnancy, Roberts had also dissented. It was not clear whether he was with the majority or dissent on Thursday. Wednesday night, when the justices issued an order rejecting Trump's effort to keep documents from the US House of Representatives January 6 committee, they similarly provided no recorded vote.  Only one justice, Clarence Thomas, publicly dissented, so the vote may have been 8-1.  Yet because it is known that some justices choose to dissent only behind closed doors, only the nine know for certain what happened.",

Fearing the spread of a potentially more contagious coronavirus variant, France was among dozens of countries which closed their borders with the UK over the weekend. The French closure was the most significant as it also restricted the entry of freight. On Tuesday, nearly 3,000 trucks remained stranded in England and British supermarkets warned of shortages of some goods just days before Christmas. Read MoreAccording to a statement from the UK Department of Transport, admittance into France will only be granted \"to those travelling for urgent reasons -- including hauliers -- French citizens, and British citizens with French residency.\"This new protocol will be reviewed on December 31, but could remain in place until January 6th. All freight truck drivers will be required to take an antigen test that can detect the new strain of Covid-19 and provide results in under an hour, according to the statement. France will also conduct sample testing on incoming freight to the UK, it adds.The French communique had said that people entering France could also take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test instead of the antigen test. However, the turnaround time for PCR tests in the UK can range from one to three days, according to the latest data from the UK Department of Health. Truck drivers at Manston airfield get tested for Covid-19 on Dec 22.Vital crossingThe crossing between the English port of Dover and the French city of Calais is a major European trade artery, and the port of Dover handles around 17% of the UK's goods imports.As of Tuesday morning, about 873 vehicles were waiting at a disused airport site, with approximately 650 vehicles on the M20 motorway, the UK's Department for Transport said.While drivers from Europe are not prohibited from entering the UK, fears were rising that hauliers would resist doing so for fear of not being able to return home, leading to food shortages.UK Transport Secretary Grant Schapps urged freight truck drivers not to travel to Kent County, where Dover is located, until further notice, while a mass testing program for HGV drivers gets underway.\"We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at ports,\" he said, according to the Transport Department statement.The period leading up to Christmas is traditionally a busy time for trade, as fresh produce from Europe is imported for the festive period. On top of this, the UK is stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.Truck drivers at Manston airfield get tested for Covid-19 on Dec 22.On Monday, Sainsbury's, one of the UK's leading supermarket chains, said If nothing changes, there will be shortages of lettuce, some salad leaves, cauliflowers, broccoli and citrus fruit.Meanwhile, the British government says it is providing food, drink and toilets for British truck drivers currently stuck in gridlock in the area surrounding the Eurotunnel.UK experts are 'highly confident' that a new coronavirus variant is more contagious. Here's what that meansA Romanian driver named Adrian, who is stuck at Dover, told CNN, \"A lot of people are making their holidays here in the cars ... they cannot go home. It's not good. We are lucky because we are here in Dover, but a lot of people are stuck on the roads. They can't go to the toilet or have a shower.\"\"We do not get respect at all,\" he said, adding that if freight trucks remain stopped, \"nobody's going to eat.\"Luke McGee and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.",

Above all, the atmosphere here is very, very sad.In the countryside, people typically greet each other with \"les bises,\" the tradition of kissing each other on the cheek. Now they stand awkwardly two meters apart and talk loudly. The coronavirus outbreak is making people nervous and anxious and ready for any human, if touchless, contact.There are the physical tragedies of the illness and its deaths, but there are the psychological ones too. For France, these are awful times. This is a supremely social country, but now social distancing is the rule of the day. So many French obsessions are related to getting together and spending time with each other... the quest for shorter work weeks, early retirement, more vacation time, all stem in part from a desire to increase time spent with friends and family.Neighbors Alain de Gourdon and his family out for a walk while social distancing.

The head of the French equivalent of the parent-teacher association was on the radio observing that forced confinement has led to a dramatic upturn in violence in the home.Read MoreNormally life in France is endlessly amusing. Distractions are everywhere. There is always something to do. But the coronavirus brought that to a halt, at least temporarily. Now life here risks becoming what the French consider intolerable -- boring.Cashiers separated from customers by plastic.Part of the culture too is working in teams. \"L'esprit d'equipe\" is what the French call it. Sharing ideas and challenges together, working on solutions together. \"It's us against the problem.\" That spirit of cooperating exists still... but these days only via video conference.Even so, when confronted with crisis or calamity or obvious need, French sociability may help them to get through this. They are good at forming a consensus. Just in the past few days, a public opinion poll indicated that 93% believe the tough lockdown measures are necessary, 54% approve of the way the government is handling things. And, remarkably in a country where the national sport is criticizing the political leaders of the day, confidence in President Emmanuel Macron's leadership has jumped up 13 points -- 51% of the French public have confidence in what he is doing.Nicholas Christakis, a Yale-based medical sociologist, observed on CNN recently that evolution has created social nature in humans. The same social nature that has hastened the spread of the disease. But, he adds, that evolution has also given mankind the ability to work together and that in the end is what may help to solve the problem.But where exactly is the end? I went around the little village where I am hunkered down to ask some of the elders if they saw any parallels between the current situation and what happened here during World War II when we had a German platoon installed in the local chateau. Surprisingly, they saw few.Hunkering down in a little French villageThe Germans had allowed them to go out and about and move from town to town. The only time people really were confined to their homes -- more often their cellars -- was when the bombings started before and continued after D-Day.These days the orders are: stay at home and stay away from your neighbors, no matter what.There were shortages of essential goods during the war. During this crisis, there really hasn't been anything in short supply, at least once everyone filled their closets with a nine-month supply of toilet paper.But there is at least one thing in common with the present situation and the war years -- the uncertainty about how all this is going to end. Out here in rural France, the 15-day confinement period is generally scoffed at. The lockdown could go on far longer than most everyone believes. Just like during World War II, there is no real idea about what the world will look like afterward.Macron wrote about another similarity to the war years in a weekend op-ed in the Journal de Dimanche. \"We're not at the end of this epidemic,\" he told his countrymen, \"this will be a test of the solidity of our democracy.\"",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Nobody likes to hear that an old friend is \"brain dead,\" so perhaps it's not surprising that France's allies seem to be going through the seven stages of grief over Emmanuel Macron's pronouncement in the Economist last month that NATO is languishing. There was first shock and denial. Speaking alongside NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on November 7, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she disagreed with the French President's description of the 70-year-old alliance.\"I don't think such a sweeping judgment is appropriate,\" she said.Now in many quarters, leaders are stuck in the anger and bargaining stage. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that Macron should \"check your own brain death\" before throwing stones at NATO.Macron is no doubt hoping that a NATO summit and upcoming meetings on Ukraine will quickly move his critics on to the stages of acceptance and hope.Read MoreMacron wanted to provoke and he succeeded, although perhaps not initially in the way he might have hoped. France's relations with Germany have taken a hit.Emmanuel Macron meets Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2017, after becoming president. \"In Germany when you say NATO is brain dead that breaks a taboo,\" says Thierry de Montbrial, president of the French Institute of International Relations, a Paris-based think tank, in a reference to Germany's instinctive dependence on NATO to be at the center of its foreign policy.\"From the point of view of military cooperation, NATO functions well, but there is no political vision and no strategic vision,\" de Montbrial continued, in what has become a common criticism of NATO's lack of clear mission since the Cold War ended. \"The armies are always at the service of politics and not the reverse, and that's the way you have to interpret the vision of Macron.\" Macron's message might have been ill received in Berlin, but in Ukraine and other former Soviet states, alarm bells rang even louder over the French President's argument that the real threat to Western Europe these days does not come from Moscow in the east, but from terrorists to the south.It is a notion with which de Montbrial agrees. \"We are in a totally different world, the shadow of the Soviet Union is no longer a risk of the same nature...the principal risk is not an invasion into Baltic countries by Russia, it's terrorism, it's the danger we have on our southern flank for which NATO has no response.\"NATO is showing its age as the alliance turns 70While Macron's provocation was pointedly directed at NATO, it reflected a broader sense of urgency in the hallways of his presidential palace over more diverse geopolitical changes on the horizon. With the world rapidly dividing into two superpower blocks -- American and Chinese -- Macron does not want Europe to be forced into choosing one or the other.  As the President himself laid out in a rhetorical question to the French diplomatic corps last August, \"Do we decide to become junior allies of one party or the other, or a bit of one and a bit of the other, or do we decide to be part of the game and exert our influence?\"In that same speech -- less noticed than the \"brain death of NATO\" comment but, in many ways, more inflammatory -- Macron restated what has become obvious to Europeans: that while the US is still an ally, it is no longer a reliable one.  He pointed out the ways in which Europeans -- perhaps thinking of his German neighbors here -- have fallen into a post-Cold War lethargy, fearing the same enemies and depending on the same old friends without considering changing circumstances, like, for example, the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which directly impacts European security.   Trump's not the only spoiler at this year's NATO summit\"We are in a Europe where we left the arms issue under the control of treaties that predated the end of the Cold War between the United States and Russia. Is that a Europe that thinks about its destiny and builds?\" Macron said.Macron has been urging his advisers to take another look at relations with Russia. \"He is not looking eastward as an alternative,\" observed Francois Heisbourg, a special adviser for the Foundation for Strategic Research, told CNN, \"But the Macron advisers are saying they want to revisit the relations with Russia. Note they are saying 'revisit' and not 'reset,' there is a difference.\"  Heisbourg believes Macron is not na\u00efve about Moscow and he says the French will wait for a summit they are hosting on December 9 to decide what future there might be in closer relations to Vladimir Putin. At that meeting, leaders of France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine will once again get together in the so-called \"Normandy format\" to try to bring an end Russia's war with the Ukraine.Ukrainian officials discussing ways to improve standing with TrumpAt that point much attention will be paid to whether Putin brings anything real to the table.With his broadside on NATO, openness toward Russia and other geopolitical questions, Macron is proving himself every bit as much of a disruptor as his American counterpart. And at the same time he seems to be constantly looking for other ways in which Paris can find common cause with Washington, even if it is often for vastly different reasons.    US President Donald Trump seems to always have domestic politics and American isolationism in mind. For the 41-year-old French President, this is a chance to call attention to what he believes is the tunnel vision of fellow NATO leaders who lack his vision. His condescension has not gone unnoticed by his neighbors, who angrily point out that for all of Macron's rhetoric he has presented very few concrete practical suggestions for how to move forward on NATO or anything else.  But then again maybe that never was the point of his brashness. As Heisbourg points out: \"Macron was an intellectual before he was a politician or president, and there is nothing he loves more than a good debate.\"",

        "content": "Bourgtheroulde, France (CNN)I'm sure you've heard the old bromide attributed to Charles de Gaulle, who wondered how it was possible to govern a country like France, with its 246 different kinds of cheese. These days, Emmanuel Macron is discovering the complexity de Gaulle was talking about as he confronts the myriad demands of his constituents in an effort to mollify the \"gilets jaunes,\" or \"yellow vest\" movement. He's calling it Le Grand D\u00e9bat -- the Great Debate. A chance over the next two months for everyone in France to get their gripes off their chests. Macron vowed to fight the populists. Now he's being engulfed by themShortly before Macron's visit to Normandy to launch Le Grand D\u00e9bat, I received a lecture on \"individualism\" from a yellow-vested protester at a roundabout known colorfully as the Rond-Point des Vaches -- the Roundabout of Cows. (A side note: in France, \"la vache!\" is a mild curse, as well as a metaphor for obedient taxpayers who are constantly being pushed around and milked). \"No one is in charge here,\" protester Olivier Bruneau, a 42-year-old factory worker, told me. \"But everyone has a reason for joining in the movement.\" Welcome to Normandy.Read MoreThe Rond-Point des Vaches has been occupied continuously from the very beginning of the Yellow Vest movement by \"individualists\" huddled around burning piles of wooden transport pallets. Each has a slightly different set of reasons for being here.  As Denis Lacorne, senior research fellow at the prestigious Sciences Po, told me, \"The Yellow Vest protests create a kind of artificial, but real, solidarity among protesters. They're isolated in their rural settings and suddenly they meet people like them, make friends and have a good time.\"A car driver shows his yellow vest to cheer protesters as French President Emmanuel Macron visits Normandy on Tuesday.Why here? I asked Bruneau. Well, he patiently explained, it is a place of maximum visibility for trucks passing from the coast through Normandy to other parts of France and Europe -- traffic that the protesters can easily block from time to time, creating impressive traffic jams.  And as the protesters wreak havoc, they also spread the movement by explaining to one driver after another how aggrieved they are ... and encouraging them to put their own yellow safety vests in the windows of their cabs in solidarity. This is one protest that is wonderfully easy to join -- take out the safety vest everyone is obliged to have in their vehicle and the movement spreads.What's more, who could be against a movement in which the chief complaint is the decline in buying power? Is there anyone in France who could be in favor of that?  And few would disagree that the far-off Paris government seems indifferent to the financial plight of those in the countryside. The response from the top has been slow -- and, some say, condescending. \"Let them eat cake\" had its origins here, after all. France's Emmanuel Macron calls for respect and unity in New Year's speechPresident Macron chose Bourgtheroulde, a small town of 3,800 inhabitants, just down the road from Le Rond-Point des Vaches to kick off his Great Debate. It was the start of two months of talking over the concerns of the little guy; the President hoping, perhaps, to head off further protests by either addressing or appearing to address these concerns. Two months to search for a national consensus. And in spite -- or, perhaps, because -- of that individualism Bruneau talked about, the French are masters at building consensus. You see it everywhere, from the town hall to the workplace. If you want things to move along smoothly, you don't just issue orders from the top down but patiently find agreement and commonality from the bottom up.    This was the reason for the trip to Normandy, the reason the President met with the local mayors, who are more in touch with those on the ground and in the streets. For centuries before anyone ever conceived of Le Grand D\u00e9bat, mayors in France have maintained \"complaint books\" in their town halls so average citizens could come in and write down what's bugging them.  Mayors have collected thousands of different grievances since the Yellow Vest movement began and many brought them along to share with Macron. The President came to listen -- perhaps because he knows that, in France, when you give everybody a chance to express themselves, it is much more difficult for them to later turn around and disown the collective decisions. They become part of a consensus built by the President rather than one constructed by the yellow vests.  The only problem for Macron is that in France these days there are at least as many complaints as there are cheeses.",

        "content": "(CNN)On a quiet Sunday morning, an ear-splitting roar reverberated across the English village of Eggborough as four giant concrete cooling towers imploded and crashed to the ground, transformed to clouds of debris in a matter of seconds. Just moments after their demolition, it became hard to imagine the structures were ever there, so out of place they were, jutting 90 meters into the sky among the green fields surrounding the River Aire. The Eggborough power station is just one of 14 coal plants the United Kingdom has laid to rest over the past decade. In 2012, 40% of the UK's power came from coal. By 2020, it was below 2%. Last year, the country went for 67 days without using any coal for power at all. Climate leaders at the COP26 talks in Glasgow, Scotland, will on Thursday intensify their efforts to put an end date on the use of coal, the biggest single contributor to the climate crisis. At the G20 meeting in Rome over the weekend, leaders failed to specify how they would phase out coal. It will be a tough ask to convince developing countries to go further than the rich world.  Read MoreThe picture is fairly rosy in western Europe and even the United States, where it seems the fossil fuel is indeed on its last legs, save for some pockets of resistance. Belgium, Austria and Sweden are among a growing number of European countries that no longer use coal to generate electricity. In the US, which technically has no coal phaseout plan, coal has wound down dramatically in favor of natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide. A slow but steady increase in wind power is also helping put coal out of business.  \nGlobally, proposed coal plants are rapidly being canceled. A report by climate think tank E3G found a 76% reduction in proposed coal power since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.But the trend is distributed unevenly. Coal plants are still on rise throughout much of Asia, and while power generation from coal technically peaked in 2013, it has basically plateaued since then. The current global energy crisis, triggered by a quicker-than-expected economic rebound amid the pandemic, has even given it a bump. Coal prices last month were at an all-time high. For every Belgium, Austria and Sweden there is a China, India, and Indonesia, where coal is still king. Consigning coal to history is a requirement to rein in rapid climate change, but it may not happen as quickly as Western climate leaders may like. \n\nYet Alok Sharma, the British lawmaker chairing COP26, is hopeful it can still happen.  The G20 did agree to stop financing international coal projects by the end of the year, he pointed out. China made a similar commitment in September, which removed the biggest source of international coal financing on the planet.\"This has effectively ended public finance for overseas coal projects,\" Sharma told CNN. \"To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, all countries need to raise their ambition and act urgently to consign coal to history.\" There has been some movement. The UK government on Thursday announced that 23 new countries -- including big coal users like Poland and Vietnam -- and dozens of organizations had committed to stop building new coal projects and to phase out the fossil fuel by the 2030s for developed nations, and 2040s for the developing world.Despite all this progress, a true global transition from coal will only happen when China decides.China consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined\n\n\n\nA coal power plant in Jiayuguan, Gansu province, China. Credit: Getty Images\nIt was in China that the world saw the first large-scale coal mine as we know them, some 3,000 years ago, and China is likely to be the country that seals coal's fate. China now consumes more coal than the rest of the world combined. That's to keep the lights on for its 1.4 billion people, but also to make huge amounts of goods for export, and heavy-industry items -- steel, cement, chemicals -- used all around the world. While China has pledged to stop financing coal projects abroad, it is still building coal plants and opening mines at a fast pace. China has more than 1,200 major coal plants in operation, and has plans to build some 150 more, according to the Global Energy Monitor (GEM), which tracks fossil fuel infrastructure and financing around the world. In 2019 alone, China opened 102 mines, GEM data shows. \"The scale of what China has been building over the past two decades is extraordinary. It's now half of the world's coal power,\" GEM's program director for coal, Christine Shearer, told CNN.   \"There's been a lot of progress in halting the increase in coal plant proposals and in stabilizing coal power demand globally, but it just needs to happen much, much faster, if we want to keep climate goals alive.\" Stay informed on the climateWhat is COP26?These countries aren't doing enoughWhat does 'net zero' mean?Carbon-sucking fans are a big riskThis invisible gas could seal our fateThe link between extreme weather and climate changeUS vs. China: Who emits more?Scientists say the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade and reach net zero by mid-century to have any chance of containing global warming to a level that will avert catastrophe. \"To reach net-zero by 2050, you really need a zero-carbon power sector a decade earlier,\" Shearer said. \"So the world shouldn't be using coal at all past 2040.\" China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said in Glasgow on Tuesday that his country's goal was to strictly control coal consumption between now and 2025, and gradually reduce it until some point before 2030. Beijing also said recently that fossil fuels would make up just 20% of its energy mix by 2060, when it plans to be carbon neutral. Global climate leaders, including Sharma and US climate envoy John Kerry, have pressed China to move even faster and with more ambition. China says it's doing its fair share, and as a developing nation shouldn't be expected to have the same targets as the developed world. \"Developed countries in the past 200 years, in the process of industrialization, have been emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and they have an unshirkable historical responsibility for global climate change,\" China's foreign ministry told CNN in a statement. \"China has always done what it says on responding to climate change. We will fully implement our commitments and will work hard to do better within our capabilities.\" \n\nA global energy crunch with China at its center hasn't helped matters. Just a year ago, Beijing officials were asking provincial leaders to produce less coal, in part to help China meet its climate targets. But last month it ordered more than 70 mines in the province of Inner Mongolia to add 1 billion tons of coal to its output. Just a few weeks ago, it told every mine operator in the country to produce as much coal as they possibly can. Looking at the activity in Inner Mongolia, it's hard to imagine China meeting even its current pledges. More than 300 coal plants and 100 mines are dotted all along this province, which stretches 1,500 miles all the way up to Russia, on shifting landscapes of grassland steppes, desert, forests and wetlands. But the province also has huge renewables potential, some of which it is exploring.   In the sand dunes of the province's Kubuqi desert lies a giant solar farm the size of nearly 200 football fields, its panels carefully arranged so that if you peer at it from an airplane, they form the image of a galloping horse. Slowly, a re-greening project here is bringing plants, grass and agriculture back to this desert, once teeming with life that was lost from overuse of the land. The solar farm in Inner Mongolia's Kubuqi Desert.Li Danqing, a climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace in Beijing, said that coal-mining provinces in China were no different to those in any other country that has struggled to wean off coal -- it has a lot to do with jobs. Some of the plants built in Inner Mongolia aren't even necessary to meet demand, she said. \"There's huge pressure to secure people's livelihoods in these coal-mining provinces. So this is one thing that still needs to be solved -- how to find new industries for them,\" Li told CNN.   \"Renewables is a very good option because Inner Mongolia not only has very abundant coal reserves, but also its wind and solar resources are very abundant. So Inner Mongolia could really be a role model for these coal-mining provinces to lead to a more low-carbon economy.\" At the COP26 conference, Sharma had hoped that the developing and emerging world, including big-coal users like China, India and Indonesia, would end their use of the fossil fuel by 2040. While an end date on coal in Asia is not in sight, there is some movement. \n\n\nA coal mine in Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, in 2019.\nAfter an announcement that the US, UK and EU would help South Africa fund its coal transition, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said her country was looking for a similar deal. Indonesia is the seventh biggest coal user in the world and relies on it heavily for power. It is also the world's biggest exporter of coal by volume.  The expectation is that developed countries, which have already industrialized and contributed the most to the climate crisis, would go first, by 2030. But they're not all there yet. Australia approves new mines \n\n\n\nAn open-pit coal mine in the middle of Australia's Hunter Region.\nAustralia's delegation went to the COP26 talks in Glasgow with the weakest climate plans of all the G20's developed nations. It has no clear end date on coal and its government has said it plans to keep mining and exporting the fossil fuel well beyond 2030. The country makes more money than any other nation from exporting coal from its roughly 100 mines, and it has the highest proportion of coal in its energy mix of all the developed G20 nations, at 54%, according to climate and energy think tank Ember.  As long as countries like China demand huge volumes of coal, Australia's government has made clear it will keep supplying them. Australia makes around $50 billion annually in coal exports and the industry directly employs around 50,000 Australians, government data shows. The country approved three new mines recently in the space of a month. The real perk for the Australian government is that all the coal it exports isn't counted in the country's official greenhouse gas emissions levels. UN rules say that a country's emissions are based on the fossil fuels they burn, not the ones they dig up and sell offshore. \"Our coal is the world's best. People want it. Countries need it. Self-interest will come first every time,\" says Joel Fitzgibbon, who has represented Australia's Hunter Region in the federal parliament since 1996. Fitzgibbon is a member of the Australian opposition Labor Party, but he, too, believes that coal has a decades-long future in the country and can even continue to be mined and used without compromising a promise by Australia to reach net zero 2050 -- where the country would not emit any more greenhouse gas than it removes. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher at the Australian Climate Council, which is independent of the government, dismissed Fitzgibbon's reckoning: \"It's at odds with the advice of every serious authority on the topic, including the historically-conservative International Energy Agency (IEA), which stated in its Net Zero 2050 pathway in May this year that achieving net zero requires that no new coal, oil or gas projects of any kind are developed anywhere in the world from now,\" Baxter told CNN. Some 12,000 people in Fitzgibbon's electorate are directly employed by the coal industry, earning average salaries north of 100,000 Australian dollars ($75,000) a year. \"I think the benefits of the industry far outweigh any negative effects it has on the local community,\" Fitzgibbon said. The lush Australian Hunter Valley feels like one of the last places on Earth that should have a coal mine. This part of the country is known for its world-famous wines, and attracts tourists from all around the world. On weekends, it is teeming with Sydney residents, who make the two-hour drive north to escape the city and enjoy the region's vineyards, restaurants and farms selling organic produce. \n\n\n\nThe Hunter Valley is known for its world-famous wines.\nThe Hunter, as Australians call the region, is also on a front line of the climate crisis. It was devastated by the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-2020, an event that scientists have linked to climate change. But the way Fitzgibbon sees it, Australia is doing the world a climate favor by exporting coal. \"If we were to stop sending thermal coal to Asia tomorrow it would be replaced by something less efficient and would add to, not subtract from, global emissions,\" he said.   There may be some truth to that. Different types of coal can emit different amounts of carbon dioxide.  But climate scientists say the world needs to end its use altogether, and there's little point in arguing which type of coal is \"cleaner\" than another.   The idea that the coal industry's benefits outweigh the drawbacks in this region is also debatable. Parts of Bulga are being swallowed up by its coal mine and it has been transformed to something of a sleepy town. Yancoal, the Chinese company that now owns the Mount Thorley-Warkworth mine there, has bought up the properties its operations have encroached on, even the local caf\u00e9.  \"We were driven out by coal,\" said former Bulga resident Robert McLaughlin. He is at least thankful that he could sell his home to Yancoal in 2019, and pack up and move to another town.  \"We were torn when we left,\" he said. \"We felt like we were abandoning our friends.\" In a statement sent to CNN, Yancoal said its operations had full government approval and it had honored its obligations to those it bought land from. \"This does not constitute harm to the community,\" the company said, adding that it had bought the local service station and local tavern, and leased them out to preserve the village amenities. But not everyone has been able to move. On the outskirts of the tiny Hunter town of Bulga, trees that separate resident John Krey's home from the mine remain charred almost two years after the Black Summer fires. John Krey has been campaigning against coal mine expansion in the Hunter  Region for years. This year alone he has received nearly 100 text messages from the state of New South Wales' Environmental Protection Agency, alerting him that PM10 levels -- which are linked to asthma, lung disease and cancer -- have reached unsafe levels. Yancoal acknowledges that dust, air quality, noise and lighting from mines are key concerns in Bulga, but it said it was taking measures necessary to reduce pollution, and that air quality-related complaints were dropping. Krey has spent years campaigning against the expansion of open-cut mines in the Hunter Valley, but he now feels like it's a lost cause.  \"We've got enough coal here to satisfy whatever the demand is, and yet we're giving approval to open more mines,\" Krey says from his veranda, overlooking the grey of Mount Thorley. \"I think the world will push Australia into doing the right thing,\" he said, referring to the COP26 climate summit. \"But it's too late for us here.\" The final frontiers\n\n\n\nEnergy company Verbund is experimenting with green hydrogen on the site of Austria's last coal mine to close.\nData from the IEA shows that coal is still the most widely used source for electricity, and by a huge margin. In 2019, the last year before the pandemic hit the world, around 63% of worldwide electricity generation came from coal, gas and oil. Coal accounted for nearly 10 million gigawatt hours of energy -- about 160% more than energy derived from the next biggest source, natural gas (another fossil fuel), which generated just over 6 million GWh. Hydropower came next (around 4 million GWh). Wind was 1 million GWh and solar just 680,000 GWh. \"I don't like to be pessimistic but it's important to be factual. And coal consumption is at least close to an all-time high,\" Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Alvarez, a senior energy analyst at the IEA, told CNN. \"I want to be optimistic, but we will have to see how the technology evolves -- we are gaining on efficiencies, reducing the cost of every useful technology.\" He added that investment in renewables was increasing and capacity was growing, but they need to move much faster to meet a timeline of phasing out coal by 2040 globally. \"We can't phase out coal if we can't replace it, otherwise we're talking about a lack of energy, and that's poverty,\" Alvarez said. \"So leaders need to look to clean energy, to accelerate investment and help the developing world make a green transition.\" Beyond electricity, however, there are some heavy-industry sectors where coal is at the moment near impossible to replace. Steelmaking and cement production, for example, are made from burning coking coal, which has a very high carbon content, and can't yet be replaced with energy like solar and wind. The emissions from steelmaking and cement production in China alone are higher than the European Union's total CO2 emissions, IEA data shows. Green hydrogen -- which is made by electrolyzing water using renewable energy -- may be an alternative, but it is still not widely available at scale. A deal on green steel at Glasgow recognizes its potential and aims to kick-start rapid global investment into the energy source and machines needed to produce it.  In Austria, near the city of Graz, energy company Verbund is experimenting with green hydrogen at its natural gas power plant. The Mellach plant is a symbol of Austria's rapid energy transition and what is possible -- the plant sits on the site of what was the country's last coal-fired power plant, which shut its doors last year. The gas plant's main role is to stabilize the national grid, but Verbund hopes its plant can increase its share of the renewable source in its energy mix. Austria aims to run fully on renewables, for electricity at least, by 2030. \n\n\n\nThe Hydrogen Center Austria -- HyCentA -- is partnering with Verbund to research green hydrogen at the Graz University of Technology.\nThe idea is that on windy or sunny days, excess renewable electricity can be harnessed here to produce green hydrogen gas, which can then be stored or transported for later use. When it's cloudy or when the turbines aren't spinning so well, hydrogen can be converted back into electricity using a clean chemical reaction. \"Climate change is reality, so we have to make a massive move towards renewables,\" said Michael Strugl, chief executive of Verbund. \"We do not have all the answers,\" Strugl said. \"We have to do research, we have to put strong efforts on innovation as well. But what we know is that we need this net-zero strategy in order to save the planet.\" CNN's Martha Zhou and Natalie Thomas contributed to this report.",

A former US government employee, Wakil is not his real name; he spoke to CNN on the condition that his identify would not be revealed.He has been stranded in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif along with hundreds of other Afghans. All have worked closely with US federal agencies and the US military over the past decade and more. Most, like Wakil, either hold Special Immigrant Visas or were in the process of obtaining them when the Taliban overran Kabul. Wakil said his family -- he has three young daughters -- was on a list compiled by the US State Department to be flown out of Kabul last month.  But as they were trying to get into the airport, a suicide bomber struck, killing more than 170 people.   Immediately after the bombing at Kabul airport on August 26, he said, he and his family -- and dozens of others -- were bussed north to Mazar-i-Sharif. \"I received a message from my former supervisor to go to Mazar-i-Sharif and that we would be taken to Doha [Qatar] from there,\" he said.  Read MoreNow Wakil feels forgotten and in danger. \"I am requesting from the U.S. Government that they should not leave us behind,\" he told CNN in Mazar-i-Sharif. \"We provided services for 15 or 16 years. I was on really bad missions. My friends were killed... They should not forget us.\" Taliban patrol Mazar-i-Sharif airport.Two decades of loyaltyWakil says he first started working for the Americans in the fall of 2001, when he was with a security company that deployed him to the mountains around Tora Bora -- the last hold-out of al Qaeda. He was there four months, he told CNN. Subsequently, he says, he worked for the US Treasury's mission in Afghanistan, helping with its logistics, and more recently for the Embassy's visa department. He told CNN that many of his Afghan colleagues have already been killed and he fears for his life every day. \"They know me, that I'm working with the US Government especially with the US Embassy,\" he told CNN.  \"Definitely I will be killed by them. I don't want to stay here because I'm in a very big risk.\" For now, he and the dozens like him are camping in difficult conditions at hotels in Mazar-i-Sharif  Many are sleeping on floors. \"The conditions are terrible,\" he said -- adding that his wife and youngest daughter had become sick. On Friday, a chartered flight was finally allowed to leave Mazar-i-Sharif's airport carrying hundreds of people -- Americans, legal US residents and Afghans, according to US-based advocacy group Allied Airlift 21. The advocacy group said about 400 evacuees were aboard the Kam Air flight, which arrived in Doha on Friday, and that some of the passengers will eventually be resettled in the United States. Wakil was not one of the lucky ones on board. Earlier, he told CNN that he still hoped the US will come to his rescue. \"They didn't betray us yet.\" As the father of three girls -- aged 11, 7 and 2 -- he also wants to escape Afghanistan for the sake of their futures. \"The Taliban [is] not allowing them to go to school so for this reason I have to go, I have to leave. I don't care about my [own] future.\" Taliban patrol the streets of Mazar-i-Sharif.A Taliban flag flies outside of the Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif.A heartbreaking priceOn September 7, US Secretary of State  Antony Blinken told a news conference in Qatar: \"There are groups of people who are grouped together, some of whom have the appropriate travel documents -- an American passport, a green card, a visa -- and others do not.\" But several US senators have been fiercely critical of the State Department's handling of the situation. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, tweeted on September 6: \"My staff and I have worked night and day to secure the safe passage of two planes waiting in Mazar-i-Sharif to take American citizens, at-risk Afghan allies, and their families to safety.\" \"I have been deeply frustrated, even furious, at our government's delay and inaction,\" Blumenthal said.Wakil says that while he himself clings to hope, his family feel they've been abandoned. \"I hope and I dream but for the family for my wife it's difficult for them. I cannot convince them that we will be living in the United States. They are asking me, no they left you. They left you behind.\" But even if he escapes Mazar-i-Sharif with his wife and three young daughters, he must still pay a heartbreaking price for being a friend to America. His mother cannot come with them, as she is sick and still in Kabul. \"She's alone there. I don't have anyone to support her. Everyone just... I am crying...\"",

Fred Craddock Sr. had whittled down to 73 pounds. Radiation treatments had burned him to pieces. He couldn't eat or speak.  When he saw his son, he picked up a Kleenex box and scribbled on it a line from Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"In this harsh world, draw your breath in pain to tell my story.\"  \"What is your story, Daddy?\"Read More His father's eyes welled with tears. He wrote:  \"I was wrong.\"'A preacher like no other' Craddock never became a televangelist, built a megachurch or preached to an adoring crowd in a packed stadium. He is a diminutive, bespectacled man whose voice is so soft that he once compared it to \"wind whistling through a splinter on the post.\"  Yet he is a pulpit giant, a man who, one preaching scholar says, tilted the preaching world \"on its axis\" after creating a revolutionary method that led to him being selected as one of the 12 best preachers in the English-speaking world. \"He is a preacher like no other\" is how the Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor, who also made the top 12 list, describes him. Craddock preached his last official sermon in October. He is 83 and struggling with Parkinson's disease. When he greets a visitor, he moves gingerly to his seat. He is 5-foot-5 with a plump belly and an impish smile. He lives in Blue Ridge, Georgia, a small town in the Appalachian Mountains that looks like a rustic postcard, with its small white-steeple churches and autumn forests bristling with burgundy and gold. Friends worry about Craddock's health, but he seems to treat his illness as an annoyance. \"I should have something by 83,\" he says with a quick smile when the conversation turns to Parkinson's.  His arms shake when he talks at length, but everything else is there: his phenomenal recall of names, details, places. Though he has gathered all manner of awards during 50 years of preaching, he never received praise for his calling from the one man he wanted to hear it from most: his father. \"I struggled with his silence,\" Craddock says. \"I wanted him to say he was proud of me.\"  A father like no other Fred Craddock Sr. had plenty to say about other subjects. He stood 5-foot-7, weighed 150 pounds and even in his 50s could do one-arm chin-ups. He liked to dance, race his horse at county fairs.  Most of all, he loved to tell stories.Fred Craddock in grade school, where he struggled to hide his poverty from classmates. His son and namesake, Fred Jr., was one of his most devoted fans. Father and son developed a storytelling ritual. At the end of the day, the elder Craddock would return to his home in the small town of Humboldt, Tennessee, roll a Bull Durham cigarette by the fireplace and say to no one in particular, \"Boy, I never hope to see what I saw today.\"   Craddock, his three brothers and his sister flocked around their father.  \"What'd you see today?\" \"Oh, you kids still up? No, you go to bed. You don't want to have nightmares.\"  His children protested. Back and forth they'd go before Craddock Sr. finally said,  \"Well, sit down, but don't blame me if you have nightmares.\"   Craddock Sr. thrilled his children with adventure stories about Chief Loud Thunder, Civil War battles and, on occasion, stories from the Bible. The elder Craddock taught his son some of his first lessons in theology.  Each student in Craddock's first-grade class was required to answer morning roll call with a Bible verse. Craddock didn't know any, until his father taught him one. One morning, he stood up \"like a bantam rooster\" and repeated his father's scripture:  \"Samson took the jawbone of an ass and killed 10,000 Filipinos.\" The teacher sent Craddock home with a stern note to his parents for his use of profanity. Ethel Craddock chided her husband, but he chuckled, saying, \"I bet the class enjoyed it.\"Draw your breath in pain to tell my story.Fred Craddock Sr., quoting \"Hamlet\"  The elder Craddock developed a following. Storytellers were admired in rural Tennessee during the first half of the 20th century. Television was nonexistent. Books were expensive. People spent their day around pot-bellied stoves, whittling wood and spitting tobacco while swapping stories. When Craddock Sr. stopped on a corner to roll a cigarette, crowds gathered, because they knew a tall tale was coming. They rarely guessed how it would end. Craddock  Sr. would uncork a story, lead his audience up to the edge, then suddenly announce that he had to go to work and walk away.  Says his son:  \"I'm convinced now that he didn't know where his stories were going when he started.\"  'Another name, another pledge'  Stories, however, don't feed hungry children. Craddock's father had enough education to devour Shakespeare in his spare time. But he discovered, after inheriting 10 acres, that he couldn't farm. He wasn't good with his hands, either. Doors, fixtures and steps hung off-kilter in his house.  The elder Craddock had a bigger problem. He was an alcoholic.  When the Great Depression tore into rural Tennessee, Craddock Sr. drank to cushion the pain. His drinking, though, only magnified his self-loathing. His mood darkened. He yelled at his family, but Craddock says he never saw his father hit his mom.  When visitors came by, though, everyone was embarrassed.    Sometimes, Craddock saw his father break down in tears.  \"He wanted to do better by his family. He didn't know how.\"   At times, Craddock Sr. would sober up. He vowed never to drink again. He found an odd job. Once, he even arranged for a dentist to pull a gold crown from one of his molars so he could buy Christmas toys for his children. \"Sometimes, when something nice happened,\" Craddock says, \"he would just go into the kitchen, take my mom away from the stove, and they would dance around the house.\"  His father's pluck, though, couldn't prevent the family's slide into poverty. They lost the farm and moved into a shack with a dirt floor and no electricity. A spigot in the yard was the only running water.  Craddock's family even struggled to clothe him. He still remembers walking to grade school on a cold day, hiding his donated sweater under a bridge and walking to school shivering in his shirtsleeves. He didn't want to risk any classmate recognizing that he was wearing a sweater that had once belonged to them. \"There's something worse than being poor,\" Craddock said. \"It's being ashamed.\"   Ethel Craddock held the family together. By day, she worked in a factory, sticking labels on Buster Brown shoes. At night, she gathered her children around the fireplace to play word games: \"If you can say it, you can spell it: omnivorous.\"   And faith held Ethel Craddock together. She took her children to church, sang hymns at home to the accompaniment of her harmonica and welcomed down-on-their luck strangers who needed a hot meal or a place to stay.  At first, Craddock's father shared the pews with his family. He was even named after a preacher. But he stopped attending as his drinking grew worse.  \"He felt guilty,\" Craddock says. \"He'd say, 'Every time I go to church, they preach against the drunks like they can't go to heaven.' \"   Craddock Sr.'s hostility toward the church deepened when they decided to come to him. The church dispatched preachers to his home, hoping to draw him back to the pews. He belittled them so much that Craddock's mother worried a fight would erupt.  \"I know what the church wants,\" he'd say. \"Another name; another pledge. Right?\"  Craddock, though, found acceptance in the church. It was the only place where he didn't feel different -- any less or any more than anybody else.  Pastors told him he would be a good preacher one day; church ladies doted on him with new shoes and a picture book filled with stories about Jesus. \"We loved our dad, but we loved the church,\" Craddock says.Fred Craddock Sr. battled his own demons during the Great Depression. Home was a place filled with fantastic stories. But Ethel Craddock kept one story from him. It centered on the horrible night when she decided her son had been set apart by God.Saved by a miracle? A winter night in 1928, Humboldt, Tennessee. Ethel Craddock is sprawled in a barn on a bale of hay, crying and praying to God. Her 8-month-old son, Fred, is dying. He has diphtheria, a highly infectious disease that forms blockages over the lungs, gradually suffocating a child.  The boy can barely draw breath. His father has run a mile to summon a doctor. But the doctor can't do much, and Craddock's breathing has grown more labored.  His mother couldn't watch him suffer any more. She has fled to the barn, where she prays:\"Dear God, if you will let him live, I will pray every day that he will serve you as a minister.\" She falls asleep on the hay. When she awakens at daybreak, she runs to the house, where the doctor says her son is going to be fine. He leaves without asking for payment.  Ethel Craddock didn't reveal this story to her son until he came to her after turning 17 to tell her that he was thinking about becoming a minister.  She began to cry after hearing the news, quickly regained her composure and told Craddock the story.  He was bewildered. Why hadn't she told him before?She didn't want him to feel pushed into becoming a minister, she said. She believed that a deed couldn't be good if the motive was wrong. When Craddock told his father of his decision to join the ministry, he listened intently before finally saying it was a big decision. Then he simply said: \"Good, son.\"  Craddock was deflated. No tears. No sober, fatherly advice. The only reaction his father would give to his calling in the days ahead would be to crack jokes. \"Don't be like John the Baptist and lose your head.\" \"He might have been embarrassed that I became a preacher,\" Craddock says. \"It was kind of the opposite of him. Maybe that created some discomfort. \"I wanted more.\"   His father seemed to rub away some of the luster from his calling again when Craddock went off to college. Wanting to make sure his call to the ministry was genuine, Craddock sought out a counselor.  Over several sessions, the young student ended up talking about his childhood.  The counselor's verdict was devastating:\"I think I'm clear why you're in the ministry: to redeem your father.\"  The counselor didn't elaborate, and Craddock was too stunned to ask questions. He thought about what his mother had taught him -- and knew what he had to do.\"I thought I was disqualified,\" he says. \"My mother had always told me nothing can be right if the reason is wrong.\"  He quit the ministry and started picking up odd jobs. Dear God, if you will let him live, I will pray every day that he will serve you.Ethel Craddock \"It crushed me,\" he says of the conversation with the counselor. \"I didn't have a Plan B in my life. I was kicking the can down the road every night, trying to figure it out.\"  The answer came while reading one of his favorite books in the Bible.  The book of Philippians, written by the Apostle Paul, is regarded by some as one of the most uplifting in the New Testament. Yet the backdrop for Paul's composition is grim. He is imprisoned, and the church is splintering into factions. Paul thinks he's about to be executed; his enemies are spreading division and preaching Christ out of selfish motives.  But Paul says that none of that matters. Whether he lives or dies, or whether his enemies preach Christ out of selfish gain, what ultimately matters is that Christ is proclaimed. Something shifted inside of Craddock. What did it matter if he preached Christ to save his father or save souls? Christ is preached. \"They're preaching for the wrong reason, yet Paul said thanks God for that,\" he says. The message was clear; living it would prove more difficult:\"I had to get to a point where I disagreed with my mother. That was tough.\"  Craddock returned to school and started preaching at rural churches. He had ignored his father and defied his mother's teaching to pursue the ministry. Now he was about to revolutionize preaching. Changing the rules of preachingCraddock had three books in his childhood home: his mother's King James Bible, his father's complete works of Shakespeare and \"The Life and Times of Billy Sunday.\"Sunday was a Major League Baseball player who became one of America's most famous preachers during the early 20th century by transforming preaching into an athletic event.   He'd smash chairs, throw parts of his clothing into the audience and run across the preaching platform as if he were sliding into home plate while proclaiming, \"Safe at home -- by the blood of Jesus!\" Sunday was the type of pastor Craddock grew up admiring. They strode the pulpit like human firecrackers: booming voices, explosive movements, big men who radiated power. Craddock had a problem. He couldn't bring the thunder. He was short, and his voice was weak. His high school counselor tried to talk him out of becoming a preacher because of his size. And his first church sermon landed with a thud. While preaching about three wise men visiting baby Jesus, an elderly man stood up in the back and blurted: \"How do you know there were three?\" A flustered Craddock had no reply. But he eventually found a way to be heard and owed part of that breakthrough to his father. When he started preaching in rural Tennessee during the 1950s, Craddock employed the traditional \"deductive\" preaching style. The sermon is structured like a term paper: thesis, three supporting points, restatement of thesis.\"Something in me said that's not the way to do it,\" he says.Fred Craddock struggled as a young preacher to find an audience before experiencing a breakthrough.  Maybe it was the stories he heard growing up, but Craddock gradually stumbled onto his preaching style.   While serving as a young pastor at a church in Columbia, Tennessee, he noticed that people responded more to his informal talks outside church service than to his sermons.He started experimenting. What if you didn't structure the sermon like a legal argument but more like an extended conversation? The listener -- not the preacher -- would be challenged to give the sermon its meaning. Craddock never took to preachers who tried to bulldoze people into converting. He had seen plenty of preachers try to goad his father back to church. And his mother, by withholding the story of his near-death experience, had taught him that people's faith decisions must be genuine, not coerced.  So Craddock became a preacher who didn't preach. He once said that a \"yes\" is no good unless a \"no\" is possible.  \"No one wants to listen to pulpit bullies, behaving as though they had walked all round God and taken pictures,\" he wrote in the introduction to his book \"Craddock on the Craft of Preaching.\"He is a preacher like no other.The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor Over the years, people have tried to describe Craddock's style. Some use the term \"inductive,\" a word he resists because it sounds like a legal term. One of his prize students, the Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor, offers one of the best descriptions of Craddock's preaching style.  In an introduction to \"The Collected Sermons of Fred B. Craddock,\" Taylor wrote: \"He assumes from the start that we are capable of attending to the text, handling some scholarship, dealing with open-ended stories, and drawing our own conclusions. He does not tell us what he is going to tell us, and then tell us what he told us. He sits down before we are ready. He lets us chew our own food.\"  Craddock's sermons, though, don't go down like broccoli. They are playful, inventive, filled with hyperbole.  They sound like probing short stories or front-porch yarns.    In one sermon, Craddock recounts a conversation with an overweight sparrow that doesn't know it can fly. In another, he imagines bored teenagers who \"sat out on the hoods of their camels\" listening to a shaggy John the Baptist preach in the desert, and in another he pretends to emcee a debate at a dreary church committee meeting between early Christian leaders arguing over whether Gentiles should be included in the church.  Craddock didn't have to break chairs to get people's attention. His stories did the job. His reputation spread. He began writing influential preaching textbooks. When he became a preaching professor at Emory University in Atlanta, he spawned a new generation of preachers who took his style out into the pews. People started describing him as a pulpit genius. In 1996, Craddock received one of his most celebrated honors. Baylor University in Texas polled 341 seminary professors and editors of religious periodicals and asked them to name the most effective preachers in the English-speaking world.  Newsweek magazine published  the top 12.  Craddock was selected for the list. So were two pastors he heavily influenced: Taylor and the Rev. Thomas Long.  Long says Craddock tilted the homiletic world \"on its axis\" with his 1971 book on preaching, \"As One without Authority.\" He calls it one of the most pivotal books on preaching to appear in the past century.  \"There's a homespun nostalgic quality to his sermons,\" says Long, who now teaches at Emory. \"He rarely preaches about the engineer with the complex ethical decision. It's more about the pot of beans served at the back door.\" Taylor still remembers the first time she heard Craddock speak at Yale Divinity School in 1978. She was working as a secretary at a local church on the weekends, but listening to Craddock stirred her desire to preach. \"He simply spoke of the gospel so compellingly that I wanted know more -- about the way of life he was describing, about why his words struck me with such force and about how I could learn to use language that way, too.\" Some preachers transform their eloquence into business ventures. They build megachurches, TV empires. Some even get entourages. Craddock wasn't driven to build a personal brand. He has no e-mail address, doesn't drive and refused to turn on a personal computer his son and daughter bought him several years ago. \"If Fred Craddock ever tweets, I'll know the world has come to an end,\" Taylor says. Craddock used some of his renown to reach out to the region that nurtured him. He gave preaching workshops to itinerant pastors in the Appalachian Mountains and established the Craddock Center, a nonprofit group that offers free meals and storytelling to needy kids in three Southern states. He built a family as he built a career. He married his high school sweetheart, Nettie, and they raised their two children, John and Laura, as he taught at various seminaries and accepted preaching invitations across the country.Fred and Nettie Craddock were high school sweethearts and are still together more than 50 years later. \"Sometimes we felt like we were in competition with the church and God,\" says Laura, his daughter, who named her son after her father.  His son, John, never felt pressured to become a minister. He is the CEO of America's First Choice Warranty company in Atlanta.  His father, he says, is the most remarkable person he has ever known. \"I don't care if it's a guy on the street asking for a dollar or the president of the United States, he makes you feel as if you're the most important person in the world when he's talking to you. \"I won the lottery as far as great fathers go.\" Telling his father's story Craddock yearned to hear such praise from his father. Yet his father never even came to hear him preach. Craddock says he sometimes overheard his father accept praise for his son's decision to enter the ministry, but he can't recall ever hearing his father admit to anyone that he was proud of his son's choice. \"He never said it.  I looked for little signals. I finally decided that I was reading into things that were not there.\"   His father may not have acknowledged him, but Craddock affirmed his father. In the dedication in his book \"As One without Authority,\" he wrote: \"To my mother, and in memory of my father: She taught me the Word. He taught me the words.\" One Sunday, he did get a sign that maybe his father would have enjoyed hearing him preach. At his childhood church in Humboldt, Tennessee, a man approached after hearing him preach. The man was about his father's age. \"You sound like your daddy,\" he said.  The comment stirred strong emotions in Craddock. He had to compose himself before he shook the man's hand and thanked him. He says it was the grandest compliment he's ever had about a sermon.   \"He was a good storyteller and a good man,\" Craddock says of his father. \"For him to relate me to my father ...  I spent a lot of time working through my relationship with my father.\" Perhaps he still is. When asked in one interview whether he became a minister to save his father, he says, \"I'll never know.\"  Yet in his memoirs, \"Reflections on My Call to Preach,\" he wrote:  \"I was confident that my being a Christian minister would have a life-changing effect on my father. With a son, his own namesake, going into the ministry, would not Daddy toss the bottle forever and return to the pew beside my mother? Surely. But I was na\u00efve, knowing nothing about the power of addiction.\"  Craddock's last visit with his father revealed to him the results of addiction. His father never stopped drinking or smoking and was hospitalized with throat cancer. He was 63.  That's when Craddock received the phone call from his mom: You need to go see your father.  When he entered his father's hospital room, he noticed that it was filled with flowers and a stack of get-well cards 20 inches deep besides his bed. Every card and every blossom came from Craddock's childhood church in Humboldt, the church his father scorned. His father confessed that he was wrong about the church and the people in the pews. They didn't just want a name and a pledge. They wanted him.    His father's admission didn't provide relief. It deepened his grief.    \"It was so late. It was at the end.  With his personality and his education -- he was generous to a fault; give you the shirt off of his back. He could have been such a good person, helping people, talking to people, playing with children -- he could do all these things.\"  Would it have been better if his father had said he was also wrong about his son and his decision to become a minister?  Would it have been better if he had finally said, \"I'm proud of you, son\"? Craddock doesn't dwell on those questions.  \"In my tendency to choose between yes and no, I choose yes. I really think he would be proud of me because he loved a storyteller. He would have taken credit for it, though. He would have said, 'I taught you real good, son.' ''  What Craddock remembers of their last moments together is not just his father's confession but something his father did. After he asked his son to \"tell my story,\" Craddock reached out and clutched his gaunt hand. \"I just held his hand. ... He couldn't move. I couldn't move.\" Craddock squeezed his father's hand, and both men cried.",

        "content": "Story highlightsU.S. leaders play \"Game of Thrones,\" fans, scholars say HBO show has five parallels with United States, fans say Do \"white walkers\" represent climate change?Scholar: In show and United States, politics is \"played by the elite\" (CNN) A fire-breathing dragon has never vaporized a senator giving a pompous speech on C-SPAN. No candidate has ever poisoned a rival at his wedding reception, and no \"white walker\" zombie has ever dragged a screaming climate change skeptic away.  Yet anyone who thinks HBO's popular \"Game of Thrones\" is just about kings and castles misses how much the show reflects contemporary America, several scholars, authors and fans of the show say. The fantasy TV series is set in the fictional kingdom of Westeros, where a small group of powerful families scheme against one another to seize control of the \"iron throne.\" Look past the dragons and knights, though, and the show offers eerie political and racial parallels between the world of Westeros and the United States, fans and scholars say. Here are five of them:JUST WATCHED'Game of Thrones' author digs DOSReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Game of Thrones' author digs DOS 00:10JUST WATCHED'Thrones' is back: 'All men must die' ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Thrones' is back: 'All men must die'  01:58JUST WATCHEDThe future of \"Game of Thrones\" ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe future of \"Game of Thrones\"  01:37Only elites can play the gameRead More There is no middle class in \"Game of Thrones.\" The \"99%\" of Westeros -- the peasants, innkeepers and farmers -- survive at the whim of a small group of wealthy families who treat them with indifference and cruelty.  The HBO show is an adaptation of George R.R. Martin's series, \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\" (HBO and CNN are both owned by Time Warner.) Martin modeled his books on medieval Europe, where there was a huge gap between the rich and poor, says Steven Attewell, author of  \"Race for the Iron Throne\" and editor of a blog with the same title. Medieval thinkers justified that gap by using some of the same rhetoric people use today to explain poverty: It's the poor's fault. The poor were told that there was something inherently wrong with them: They were the descendants of Noah's son, Ham, a cursed Biblical figure, Attewell says. \"They said that because the poor people are sons and daughters of Ham, it was God's will that they serve as peasants,\" Attewell says. \"They also cited passages in the Bible that commanded obedience to the king and the servant to the master.\" The 99% of Westeros could identify with the anger of Occupy Wall Street, fans of the show say. Social mobility was extremely limited by modern standards, Attewell says. A typical peasant paid taxes to a lord who essentially owned him.  \"It was hard to get past the idea of a monarchy,\" Attewell says. \"They didn't have examples of democracy. Even when you had a social revolution from below in this period, they didn't have an alternate model of government to look to.\"  Neither does \"Game of Thrones,\" because the rich control everything. They own the land and the political process, and the only contenders for the iron throne come from a small group of powerful dynastic families. The show's depiction of families fighting for control mirrors where U.S. politics could be headed, says Joshua Weikert, a political science professor from Albright College in Pennsylvania.  The 2016 presidential election could well feature another Clinton vs. Bush contest if Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush decide to run. Could Americans one day say, without irony, \"The House of Bush\" or \"The House of Clinton\"?  In the show, \"two or three primary families trade off and form alliances to enhance their position,\" Weikert says. \"Can we really see none of the Kennedys, Bushes and Clintons in these machinations?\"  When the rich control the political process, it's difficult for a country to remain a democracy, according to one of the most popular books in the United States. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century\" is not just a best-seller, it has become a cultural phenomenon. Thomas Piketty, a French economist, warns in his book that concentrating wealth at the top invariably corrodes democracy. He argues after studying two centuries of economic data that economic inequality is wired into the machinery of capitalism. And he says the United States is headed toward an aristocratic future resembling 19th century Europe, where powerful families sustained by inherited wealth rule the rest. There are no royal families in the United States, but Weikert says many Americans share the same sentiment as the jaded \"99%\" of Westeros: \"The game is played among elites.\" It's a man's world The late soul singer James Brown never makes an appearance in \"Game of Thrones,\" but his song, \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\" could be its unofficial soundtrack. There are no men pushing for gender equality in \"Game of Thrones.\" Male characters unapologetically beat women, rape them and throw them away as if they're old sofas. Yet to paraphrase Brown, the show \"wouldn't be nothing\" without a cast of formidable female characters who refuse to play the roles assigned to them.The character of Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) doesn't wait for men to rescue her.   The women of Westeros don't wait for knights to rescue them from dragons; one of them commands three dragons of her own. She is Daenerys Targaryen, the young sole survivor of a royal family. She starts as a timid pawn of men who violate her and treat her with contempt. She becomes a legendary warrior queen.  The show's fan base is filled with women who identify with characters like Daenerys Targaryen. They revel in her ability to rise to the top in a male-dominated world, says Paul Levinson, a communications professor at Fordham University in New York. \"They're seeing women in positions of power more and more,\" Levinson says. \"Not only Hillary but people like (Sen.) Elizabeth Warren and Sarah Palin. Daenerys captures that aspect. She constantly gets the better of men.\"  One of the most beloved characters in the show is Arya Stark, an adolescent girl who outthinks and out-toughs men. Born to a noble family, she rejects the notion that she must marry a lord and bear his children to be a successful woman. She forges herself into a skilled warrior to avenge her family's honor. \"We gravitate to Arya because she provides a refreshing alternative to the damsels in distress we typically see in medieval dramas,\" says Jamie Adair, editor of the \"History Behind the Game of Thrones\" blog. \"Arya's assertiveness speaks to our modern values. She's driven by revenge and she's willing to be ruthless.\" We gravitate to Arya because she provides a refreshing alternative to the damsels in distress we typically see in medieval dramas...Jamie Adair, editor of \"History Behind the Game of Thrones,\" on Arya Stark character in the HBO show The show's portrayal of women is a reflection of a deeper message in Martin's \"Game of Thrones\" books: Kings may rule, but their rise and fall ultimately depends on the small folks, says Charli Carpenter, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \"What Martin has done is create a story about elite politics told through the viewpoint of the marginalized: women, prostitutes, bastards, dwarfs,\" says Carpenter, author of an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled, \"Game of Thrones as Theory.\" Political paralysis jeopardizes the future In one of the most famous scenes in \"Game of Thrones,\" another powerful woman, Cersei Lannister, the Queen of Westeros, schools a rival on political power. \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,\" she tells him. \"There is no middle ground.\" Cersei Lannister isn't much for bipartisan cooperation. She would fit right into the current U.S. Congress, which is on its way to becoming the least productive and most ideologically divided one in history, according to some reports. (It's also the richest, as well as the first Congress where the majority of its members are millionaires, another report says). The price of political paralysis is one of biggest themes in \"Game of Thrones\" and a persistent theme in U.S. politics, scholars and fans say.  In Westeros, leaders spend more time fighting one another than helping their subjects. Most are only driven by self-interest. They constantly question the right of other kings to rule. The kingdom even has its own version of a \"birther\" controversy: A king is accused of being illegitimate because his family hid his true lineage. Could white walker zombies represent the global warming threat represented by melting icebergs?The political paralysis in Westeros comes at a dangerous time. Feuding leaders ignore the real existential threat to their world. An army of ice-encrusted zombies called \"white walkers\" is mobilizing to destroy the kingdom and usher in an ice age. \"Winter is coming,\" is the ominous conclusion one leader delivers after watching the deadly white walkers in action, but no one listens to him.  You couldn't find a more apt comparison to feuding political leaders in the United States who are ignoring global warming, says Gordon Coonfield, a communications professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \"Multiple factions are so busy with infighting,\" he says, \"that they are completely unaware or indifferent to a looming apocalypse.\" The rulers in \"Game of Thrones\" also ignore another looming political issue, fans and scholars say: Westeros, too, has an immigration problem no one wants to tackle. Instead, the rulers have relied on a giant wall originally built to keep out white walkers but now used to stop border crossings of an impoverished group the people of Westeros dismiss as \"wildlings.\" The rhetoric used to justify the wall is similar to some of the language used in America's immigration debate, says Weikert, the political science professor at Albright College.\"They say we need to make sure that 'they' don't come in here and ruin our society and culture,\" Weikert says. \"Some people were lucky enough to be born on the 'right' side of the border and have an interest in keeping out those who are threatening the existing order.\" A nation lives beyond its means There are plenty of supernatural creatures and vicious villains in \"Game of Thrones,\" but there is one entity that no one dares cross: The Iron Bank of Braavos.Multiple factions are so busy with infighting that they are completely unaware or indifferent to a looming apocalypse.Joshua Weikert, political scientist, on leaders in \"Game of Thrones,\" and the United States If you think the Wall Street money managers who almost ruined the global economy are heartless capitalists, you should meet the dreaded bureaucrats from the Iron Bank.  It's the most powerful bank in the world of \"Game of Thrones.\" It doesn't really care about the health of Westeros' economy or the poor people living on a \"bowl of brown\" in the kingdom's \"Flea Bottom\" ghetto. They just want their money, and they're willing to unleash chaos to get it. \"The great thing about the bank,\" says Weikert, \"is if you don't pay what you owe, they give loans to your enemy to overthrow you.\" Think of the Iron Bank as America's deficit, fans of the show say: It's an economic guillotine that hangs over the future, they say. Several kings of Westeros have amassed huge national debts because of Iron Bank loans, but they're afraid to tell their subjects that their country is living beyond its means.  National debt, in the United States as in Westeros, scares political leaders. In \"Game of Thrones,\" all leaders dread the Iron Bank's motto:   \"The Iron Bank will have its due.\"Race still matters There are no racial scandals in Westeros. No one secretly recorded a ruler dehumanizing another ethnic group. But that doesn't mean racial stereotypes in contemporary America haven't wormed their way into the show's scripts, some bloggers and authors say.   Much of that criticism centers on the storyline involving Daenerys Targaryen, the exiled warrior queen.Daenerys Targaryen's warrior queen has been criticized for being a \"white savior.\" The pale, silver-haired leader liberates an army of black and brown slaves as she marches through a North African-like region, breaking the chains of oppressed peoples. It's thrilling stuff -- \"Occupy Wall Street\" with three fire-breathing dragons.  Still, some critics say the plotline unwittingly resurrects a racial stereotype often used to justify U.S. imperialism: white saviors rescuing dark-skinned people from the barbarity of their ways.  Whiteness is \"both a conquering and civilizing force\" in \"Game of Thrones,\" stand-up comedian Aamer Rahman wrote in his blog. British blogger Shane Thomas called Targaryen's conquests the \"save the coloureds\" tour. Saladin Ahmed, author of \"Throne of the Crescent Moon,\" says the show also reinforces some stereotypes about black and brown men in its depiction of the Dothraki people, a nomadic, brown-skinned tribe  portrayed as hypersexual and hyperviolent.  Even more fully drawn characters of color like Missandei, a regal woman who acts as Daenerys' translator and aide, slip into stereotypical behavior, Ahmed says. The actress who plays Missandei, Nathalie Emmanuel, is fantastic, but her character becomes a clich\u00e9 at times, Ahmed says. \"She is the black best friend every white girl has,\" he says. \"She has no story of her own. She has no desires or wants of her own. She's just there to give advice to Daenerys.\" With the introduction of new characters like Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, also known as the \"Red Viper,\" there are hints the show may begin treating its characters of color with more complexity. But that day hasn't quite come yet, Ahmed says.  The show, Ahmed says, \"has the same problem Hollywood in general has: limiting actors of color to villains, best friends and martyrs for white people.\"  \"Game of Thrones\" may yet evolve. Part of its appeal is its unpredictability. No one really knows where the story is headed because Martin is still adding books to his series and he's not afraid to kill beloved characters. Martin may yet give fans a happy ending. But as some Americans look ahead to their own country's future, they may also conclude: \"Winter is coming.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsFans beginning to appreciate how Hendrix's race shaped his life and musicFor decades, audiences misunderstood the importance of guitar icon's heritageBlacks dismissed him as a musical Uncle Tom; whites only saw him as a stereotypeBut he was influenced by blues and R&B, as well as stinging racism, observers say (CNN)Two weeks after closing Woodstock with his reinvention of \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" Jimi Hendrix decided to offer a free concert for a group he called \"my people.\" He held a concert for an African-American audience in Harlem, a place he once called home. Hendrix's homecoming, though, was almost ruined as soon as he stepped onstage. Someone threw a bottle at him that shattered against a speaker; eggs splattered on the stage. Hendrix gamely played on while much of the crowd melted away. \"They didn't like him,\" says Charles R. Cross, who recounts the episode in his biography of Hendrix, \"Room Full of Mirrors.\" \"He was jeered. People heckled him.\" A new film focusing on a more triumphant period in Hendrix's life is rekindling interest in the guitar icon. \"Jimi: All Is by My Side\" shows how Hendrix left New York for London to become a star. Yet no film has explored another twist in Hendrix's journey: How black and white audiences misunderstood the importance of Hendrix's race, both to the man and to his music.   Hendrix traveled to Harlem because he was trying to connect with blacks who had dismissed him as a musical Uncle Tom: a black man playing white man's music. Music critics and biographers say Hendrix also was frustrated by legions of white fans who only saw him as a racial stereotype -- a hypersexual black man who was high all the time -- instead of a serious musician. Read More There are signs today that more fans are starting to appreciate how Hendrix's race shaped his life and sound. Yet he's still seen by many as a musical genius who just happened to be black instead of a man whose genius was inseparable from his race, says Jeremy Wells, author of \"Blackness Scuzed: Jimi Hendrix's Invisible Legacy in Heavy Metal.\"  Wells first noticed this pattern when he examined how white heavy metal musicians and fans described Hendrix. They rarely mentioned his race, or even said that his music transcended race. Wells said he found that odd given Hendrix's sound was steeped in the blues tradition of black guitarists such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters. \"Nobody would say that race doesn't matter for Muddy Waters,\" says Wells, an English professor at Indiana University Southeast. \"But there's a whole industry devoted to saying it doesn't matter for Hendrix.\"  Race mattered more to Hendrix than most people realize, critics and biographers say: He was hurt by black radio's refusal to play his music; he experienced stinging racism during his time as an R&B sideman and star; and some of his most famous songs were profoundly shaped by his experiences as a black man in America.  Are they reading too much race into Hendrix's music? Here are three reasons why they say Hendrix's race mattered.  He took black music to Mars Hendrix was post-racial before the term was even invented. Check out the photos from his four years as a star, and he seemed to live in a virtually all-white world. His two bandmates in the Jimi Hendrix Experience were white, his audience was virtually all-white, and most of his girlfriends were white. Hendrix even talked and dressed like a hippie, with his spacey verbal references, crushed velvet pants and bandannas. Now close your eyes and listen to the growling guitar and wolf howls that Hendrix unleashes on songs like \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" \"Red House\" and \"Machine Gun.\" YouTube is filled with Hendrix's songs. He sounds like a black guitarist who one music critic said took \"the blues out of the Mississippi Delta and sent it to Mars.\"  What Hendrix described as his \"funky freaky\" sound is drenched in blues. Hendrix spent his formative years listening to black blues guitarists such as T-Bone Walker and Curtis Mayfield. He honed his chops playing back-up to R&B artists such as Little Richard and The Isley Brothers on the \"Chitlin' Circuit,\" a string of clubs in the segregated South that hosted black performers.  \"He was widely understood to be the best R&B player of his time on the Chitlin' Circuit,\" says Greg Tate, a musician and a journalist who has written about Hendrix.  Hendrix expanded the range of the electric guitar when he became a star. He coaxed sounds from the instrument that no one had thought possible: \"jet engines, oceans, exploding suns, and planets, wounded wildebeests, weeping seagulls,\" Tate wrote in an essay, \"The 12 Best Jimi Hendrix solos.\" \"The electric guitar is an instrument whose history can be divided up into two eras: before and after Jimi Hendrix,\" Tate wrote. Yet no matter how far out Hendrix's guitar sounded, the foundation of his music was always black music, musicians and critics say.  Eric Gales, a guitarist featured in Experience Hendrix, an all-star band touring the country playing Hendrix's music, says even on Hendrix's ballads, the blues seep through.  Listen to \"Little Wing,\" one of Hendrix's best-known ballads, he says. It's filled with little guitar flourishes and a guitar tone that pay homage to Mayfield.  \"Hendrix was not playing white man's music,\" says Gales, whose new album, \"Good for Sumthin,' '' was released this month. \"He took what was old traditional blues and R&B and amped it up. When white people started doing it, it was labeled their thing.\" Hendrix's racial identity even suffused a song that at first glance had nothing to do with the blues.  His classic take on \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock was noted for its sonic impact: Hendrix summoned the sounds of falling rockets and bursting bombs from his guitar. Yet others heard something more, a black man's protest. Hendrix played the song at the height of the Vietnam War, where black soldiers were dying in high numbers. He reportedly refused the pleading of his white business manager to forgo performing the anthem for fear of provoking a riot.  Hendrix's interpretation of the national anthem was a protest on par with King's \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" says Wells, the English professor. Hendrix took a founding American document and reminded Americans how far they had strayed from their values. \"It was like Hendrix was saying, 'This is my country. This is my national anthem,' \" Wells says. \" 'Now look at what I'm going to do with it.' \" Hendrix was criticized for being unpatriotic after playing the anthem. When he went on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" after Woodstock, he told the talk show host he thought his version was \"beautiful.\"\"I'm an American, too,\" he told Cavett.He was racially profiled It might seem odd to suggest that Hendrix's race was invisible to white fans; his skin color was one of his selling points when he burst onto the American scene in 1967 with his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in California. Hendrix may have been the first black sex symbol American whites unabashedly embraced. At a time when a black man could be killed for being with a white woman, Hendrix was surrounded by white groupies, flicking his tongue and grinding his guitar before thousands of cheering white girls. These adoring fans certainly noticed Hendrix's race, but what they saw was actually a stereotype of the hypersexual black man that Hendrix played up for fame. The press of his day extended the stereotype further. Rolling Stone called him a \"Psychedelic Superspade\" while another magazine called him the \"Wild Man of Borneo.\"   Few of these white fans knew, though, how much Hendrix's life had been marred by racism. Hendrix left his hometown of Seattle because of racism, says Cross, his biographer. He grew up in a world of abject poverty and family turmoil that was typical of black families at that time. When he was a teenager, he was arrested on dubious charges of driving in stolen cars and given the choice of being jailed or enlisting in the Army, Cross says. He enlisted and became a paratrooper.  \"What happened to Jimi would have never happened to a white male in that era,\" Cross says. \"Jimi was run out of Seattle for being black.\"  Hendrix continued to experience racism as a musician. When he toured the Chitlin' Circuit, he couldn't go to the bathroom at gas stations in the South because they closed their doors to blacks. Even after he became a rock star, he was still racially profiled. Cross tells stories of Hendrix being mistaken for a bellhop in a swanky New York hotel, and of New York cabbies refusing to pick him up. Even the rapturous reception Hendrix received when he traveled to London in 1966 for his first big break was tinged with racism. Various biographies of Hendrix noted that many of the white musicians he encountered had little exposure to black people and had difficulty accepting Hendrix as a superior musician. Some of their resistance to him was rooted in ego as well as race. One infamous story tells how Hendrix had to kill God before he was accepted in London. The Almighty was, in 1966, incarnate in Eric Clapton, the guitarist for Cream. He was considered so good that one graffiti artist in London declared, \"Clapton is God.\" When Hendrix arrived in the British capital, he shocked onlookers by asking Clapton if he could join him onstage. Clapton consented and Hendrix launched into a blistering version of \"Killing Floor,\" an up-tempo blues classic.  Clapton couldn't keep up and afterward stormed off the stage, humiliated.  \"You didn't tell me he was this f*ing good,\" Clapton told Chas Chandler, Hendrix's manager.   After Hendrix died, some white fans still had trouble accepting Hendrix's race, says Wells, the music critic.  Wells noticed that heavy metal artists hardly ever mentioned Hendrix's race as they raved about his guitar. They could hear his genius but they couldn't see his heritage. That kind of adoration would not have pleased Hendrix, Wells says.\"He didn't want to be known as just a black musician,\" Wells says, \"but he didn't want to be not known as a black musician.\"  He wanted blacks to celebrate his music  Before he held his ill-fated Harlem concert, Hendrix told a New York Times reporter why he returned to his old neighborhood. \"Sometimes when I come up here, people say, 'He plays white rock for white people,' \" Hendrix said. \" 'What's he doing up here?' Well, I want to show them that music is universal -- that there is no white rock or black rock.\" Hendrix's quest for acceptance among his own people was a lifelong journey. He first tried to make it among black clubs on the Chitlin' Circuit, but his virtuoso guitar playing didn't fit the black popular music taste of the time.  \"There was no place for Hendrix,\" Tate, the journalist, says. Black music then \"was based around the style of singing, harmony and production of Motown.\"  Hendrix even stopped by black radio stations to encourage them to play his music to no avail, says Cross, author of \"Room Full of Mirrors.\" \"It was very upsetting to him that he was not accepted in African-American radio stations,\" Cross says. Hendrix didn't want to be confined by racial categories, but musical audiences were segregated like the rest of America, Cross says. \"Because Jimi played to white fans in an era of Black Power and separatism, they felt that he had betrayed his own race by having a white band and playing to an audience that was primarily white,\" Cross says.  Hendrix aggressively reached out to black audiences during the last two years of his life. He grew an Afro, wrote protest-themed songs and replaced his white bandmates with two black friends to form the Band of Gypsies. The group released a live album featuring Hendrix's classic, \"Machine Gun.\"  The \"Band of Gypsies\" album gave hints of a new musical direction for Hendrix. He had befriended jazz musicians like Miles Davis who encouraged him to stretch. (The two had discussed making a recording together.) Hendrix was experimenting with larger bands, adding percussion and recording songs that sounded like a cross between jazz fusion and funk music. He told friends he was tired of the sexual showmanship and playing the Psychedelic Superspade. Still, it would be a mistake to assume that Hendrix was on the verge of becoming a black militant. Hendrix's racial identity, some say, was like his music: ahead of its time. There's one class picture of a young Hendrix that might explain why. The elementary school portrait is featured in David Henderson's biography, \"Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky.\" In it, a smiling, crew-cut Hendrix is surrounded by kids of all races: Japanese, Filipino, Native American, white. Hendrix was raised in a multicultural world -- he even had Native American blood. Hendrix's high school was one of the most integrated schools in America in the 1950s, says Cross, his biographer. \"There was no school more diverse in America than Garfield High,\" Cross says. \"He grew up in a world where race was not thought of as a barrier to music. It was not thought of as a barrier to friendship.\"  Today at least some of the barriers to seeing Hendrix's blackness are starting to come down, some say. Hendrix has been sampled by hip-hop artists such as Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest and Frank Ocean. Groups like the Black Rock Coalition talk openly about Hendrix's influences. Rock, punk and metal are no longer seen as \"white man's music.\" \"It's shifting,\" Cross says of black perceptions about Hendrix. \"I get letters every day from young African-American men and women who say, 'Thank you for writing this book.'\" Hendrix is even being included among the pantheon of black musical heroes. Previously, books and documentaries on great black musicians would mention people like James Brown, John Coltrane and Michael Jackson -- but not Hendrix.  That could be changing. Lamont Robinson created the \"Official R&B Music Hall of Fame Museum\" three years ago to honor black musical greats such as Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye and others. He's in talks with four cities to find a permanent home for the museum by 2016.   Robinson says the museum has already decided on its 2015 inductees, and Hendrix is one of them. Blacks rejected him earlier, he says, but now more are starting to call him one of their own.  \"If you had to build a Mount Rushmore to black music, you have to put his face on it,\" Robinson says. \"It would have to go up there with Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin -- he's right there.\" Too bad Hendrix didn't live to see that day.  He died in London in 1970 after accidentally mixing too many sleeping pills with alcohol one night. He choked on his own vomit in his sleep. He was 27. Hendrix had just built his own recording studio in New York and had spoken of taking time off to learn how to read music and play other instruments. He had changed so much from the shy unknown guitarist with acne who had come to Britain four years earlier. In \"Room Full of Mirrors,\" Cross recalls one of those magical moments in London when no one really knew Hendrix but turned out to see him because they sensed he was special. Hendrix was playing at a London club and much of rock's elite -- the Beatles, Clapton, Pete Townshend, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck -- walked in and sat on the front row to listen to this guitarist from Seattle.  During a break in the show, Brian Jones, one of the Rolling Stones' original leaders, ran into another musician returning to the stage to hear more of Hendrix. \"It's all wet down front,\" Jones warned the musician. The musician looked puzzled so Jones explained. \"It's wet from all the guitar players crying.\" Forty years after his death, it's still tempting to shed a tear listening to Hendrix -- not just because of what we hear, but for all the sounds we will never hear because he died so young.",

        "content": "Story highlightsSome of our greatest presidents were skillful liarsMachiavelli said a leader must be a \"great pretender\"The difference between good vs. bad liesWhy one honest president should have learned how to lie (CNN)\"I cannot tell a lie.\" That's the signature line from a classic American story. When the nation's first president was asked as a boy if he had chopped down his father's cherry tree, he didn't say \"I can neither confirm nor deny those reports,\" or \"it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\" George Washington told the truth even if it got him in trouble. The moral of the story -- Washington was a great leader because he would not lie, and all presidents should be as honest as our founding father. Well, guess what? That story about Washington and the cherry tree is a lie. Never happened. And the notion that a good president doesn't lie to the American people -- that's an illusion as well. Historians say many of our greatest presidents were the biggest liars -- and duplicity was part of their greatness. \"Every president has not only lied at some time, but needs to lie to be effective,\" says Ed Uravic, a former Washington lobbyist, congressional chief of staff and author of \"Lying Cheating Scum.\"Read MorePresidential lying is a hot topic because of a promise made by President Obama. While promoting Obamacare, Obama told Americans that they could keep their health insurance if they wanted to. That turned out to not be true for some, and Obama has been accused of lying.  Some political pundits warn that  Obama's \"lie\" will undo his second term. They say Americans won't forgive a president who violates their trust. It's a good sound-bite, but it's bad history. A great leader must \"be a great pretender and dissembler,\" Machiavelli said in \"The Prince.\" And so should a president, some historians say.You might say lying is the verbal lubricant that keeps the Oval Office engine running. Some of our most popular presidents told the biggest whoppers, say historians, including Benjamin Ginsberg, author of \"The American Lie: Government by the People and other Political Fables.\" While preparing the country for World War II, Franklin Roosevelt told Americans in 1940 that \"your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.\" President John F. Kennedy declared in 1961 that \"I have previously stated, and I repeat now, that the United States plans no military intervention in Cuba.\" All the while, he was planning an invasion of Cuba.  Ronald Reagan told Americans in 1986, \"We did not, I repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else [to Iran] for hostages, nor will we,\" four months before admitting that the U.S. had actually done what he had denied. Even \"Honest Abe,\" whose majestic \"Gettysburg Address\" the nation commemorated this week, was a skillful liar, says Meg Mott, a professor of political theory at Marlboro College in Vermont.Lincoln lied about whether he was negotiating with the South to end the war. That deception was given extended treatment in \"Steven Spielberg\" recent film \"Lincoln.\" He also lied about where he stood on slavery. He told the American public and political allies that he didn't believe in political equality for slaves because he didn't want to get too far ahead of public opinion, Mott says. \"He had to be devious with the electorate,\" Mott says. \"He played slave-holders against abolitionists. He had to lie to get people to follow him. Lincoln is a great Machiavellian.\"6 things presidents wish they hadn't saidForgivable vs. unforgivable lies Presidential lies fall into two categories: forgivable vs. unforgiveable. Forgivable lies are those meant to keep the nation from harm. Some consider the National Security Agency's lies about the scope of domestic spying to be in this category because they protect us from terrorists, says Uravic, author of \"Lying, Cheating Scum.\"  Unforgivable lies fall into the Nixonian \"I am not a crook\" category, Uravic says. Those are lies meant to cover up crimes, incompetence or protect a president's political future. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, kept the full cost of spending on the Vietnam War from Congress and the public to preserve his political power, Uravic says. \"The American people remain forgiving of their politicians, as long as those politicians put the people first and deliver tangible benefits for all of us,\" says Uravic, who also teaches at the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology in Pennsylvania. The ultimate test of whether the American public will accept a lie from a president is if the nation determines that the lie serves the national interests. That distinction is why Bill Clinton remains popular, and George W. Bush remains reviled for his \"lie,\" says Allan Cooper, a political scientist and historian at Otterbein University in Ohio. In a nationally televised address in 2003, Bush said that invading Iraq was necessary \"to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.\"  \"Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised,\" Bush said. Clinton told the nation that he did \"not have sexual relations with that woman.\" I did not have sexual relations with that woman.President Bill Clinton \"Clinton's lies about a sexual affair were understandable given his interest to protect his marriage and to shield the nation's children from having to ask their parents to explain the phenomenon of oral sex,\" Cooper says. \"Bush's lies led to the death and injuries of thousands of Americans.\" Obama's statement will be judged by the same standard: Did it help the country, or did he say it just to save his bacon? Obama apologized for saying people could keep their insurance if they like it. But some Americans who buy policies on the private market recently received cancellation notices because their plans don't meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care.Americans may forgive Obama if Obamacare improves their lives, says Christopher J. Galdieri, who teaches a course on the U.S. presidency at Saint Anslem College in New Hampshire.\"Ultimately, this is going to come down to whether the federal [health care] exchange improves, and whether people come to view that as a successful and viable option for buying insurance for themselves and their families,\" Galdieri says. Will George W. Bush's reputation ever recover from the accusation that he led the nation into war under false pretenses?  It's hard to say from history. Several presidents were accused of deceiving the American public to sell military action, says David Contosta, a history professor at Chestnut Hill College in Pennsylvania. President James Polk lied to Congress in 1846  -- claiming Mexico had invaded the United States  -- because he was determined to take the Southwest from Mexico. That lie led to the Mexican-American War, Contosta says. President William McKinley lied to the American public in 1898 when he insisted that Spain had blown up the USS Maine warship in Havana Harbor, Cuba, although he had no evidence. That lie led to the Spanish-American war.Every president has not only lied at some time, but needs to lie to be effective.Ed Uravic, former Washington lobbyist and author of \"Lying Cheating Scum.\" One popular president got caught telling a lie about a failed military action but his popularity remains intact. \"President Dwight Eisenhower denied that the United States was flying U-2 spy planes over the Soviet Union, until the Soviets shot down one of the planes, capturing the pilot, and he was forced to admit the truth,\" Contosta says. Some presidents were so deceitful that they even lied to their friends. Franklin Roosevelt was such a president. Roosevelt led the nation out of the Great Depression and through World War II. But even his allies couldn't bank on honesty.Roosevelt told three different men that he wanted them to be his next vice president during the Democratic national convention in 1944. Then he picked a fourth man, Harry Truman, for the office, says David Barrett, a political science professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \"He did it with such skill that all three men were completely convinced that Roosevelt was behind him.\"The lost art of the quotable speechWhy we need a president who lies Roosevelt's deceitfulness hasn't stopped historians from widely picking him as one of nation's three greatest presidents, along with Lincoln and Washington. Perhaps they and ordinary Americans forgive presidents who lie because there's something in human nature that believes a leader needs to be cunning.  Sure, we tell our children about Washington cutting down the cherry tree. The 19th century writer Parson Mason Weems inserted that fable into his 1800 biography \"A Life of Washington.\"  But then we close the children's book and turn on the TV to admire the lethal duplicity of a leader like the mafia patriarch Vito Corleone in the classic 1972 film \"The Godfather.\"  We want our presidents to have a little gangster in them. It's the presidential paradox that scholars Thomas Cronin and Michael Genovese talked about in their recent book, \"The Paradoxes of the American Presidency.\"  They wrote:\"We want a decent, just, caring, and compassionate president, yet we admire a cunning, guileful and, on occasions that warrant it, even a ruthless, manipulative president.\" The most sublime execution of presidential deception comes when a president discovers that he doesn't have to lie to deceive. Why lie when a simple misimpression will do, says James Hoopes, an ethics in business professor at Babson College in Massachusetts. These presidents learn from Machiavelli, who said that the Prince must be a \"fox and lion\" -- a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify enemies who would trap him, Hoopes says. President Andrew Jackson foxily campaigned on a lie insisting that he was for a \"judicious tariff\" which to Southern ears in the 1828 presidential election meant a low tariff. After Jackson was elected, though, Congress passed a high tariff that prompted outraged Southern leaders to talk about nullification and secession, Hoopes says.  The fox then became the lion, Hoopes says of Jackson. \"Like the lion he was, Jackson faced down the challenge with threats of force, threats that had the ring of truth, coming from a former general who summarily executed enemy civilians and hanged mutinous soldiers under his command,\" Hoopes says. If you still think you want a leader who is always honest, consider the fate of one recent president.He vowed during his presidential campaign that \"I will never tell a lie to the American people.\" He wore a sweater during a nationally televised speech from the Oval Office because he had turned down the White House thermostat to conserve energy. He brought peace to the Middle East and even taught Sunday school. He was also swept out of the Oval Office after one term.  \"The country fell apart,\" Mott says of this president's time in office. \"He was too noble, too pure. He didn't know how to play people against one another. He should have read his Machiavelli.\"  That president was Jimmy Carter. He won the Nobel Peace Prize after leaving office, and he's been widely praised for his humanitarian efforts around the globe. He still builds homes for the poor around the world.  No one ever labeled Carter a liar while he was in office. But then hardly anyone calls him a great president today.",

        "content": "Story highlightsA racial revolution is spreading across TVSci-fi, fantasy and horror shows giving sneak preview of post-racial AmericaMultiracial casts in \"The Walking Dead\" are becoming the normAny color, or gender, can be the superhero, fans say (CNN)It's a classic \"Star Trek\" story people love to tell.When Nichelle Nichols, the African-American actress who played Lt. Uhura, decided to quit the television show after its first season in 1966, she just happened to meet a beaming Trekkie who told her he loved \"Star Trek.\"It was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.King approached Nichols at a Beverly Hills fund-raiser and told her \"Star Trek\" was the only show he let his children stay up late to watch. His smile evaporated though when Nichols broke the news. He told her she couldn't leave because the world was finally seeing blacks on television, not as servants but as beautiful, intelligent people journeying to the stars.\"At that moment, the world tilted for me,\" Nichols said as she told the story for a documentary on TV's greatest pioneers. \"That's all I could think of, everything that Dr. King said -- 'The world would see us for the first time as we should be seen.' \"Read MoreIf King clicked on TV today, he might shout that we've reached the Promised Land. A racial revolution is quietly taking place on the small screen, and zombies, witches and headless horsemen are leading the way. There's been an explosion of multiracial casting on science-fiction, fantasy and horror shows, and the people powering this trend say it is here to stay.Popular shows such as \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Arrow\" are giving us a sneak preview of a post-racial America that can still seem far away, fans and creators say. The most eye-popping elements are not the special effects and supernatural creatures but the multiracial casts and the casual acceptance of racial differences. These shows routinely feature actors of color in nonstereotypical roles, and interracial relationships are the norm.Frankenstein meets the X-MenIn our real world, racial tensions erupt over everything from \"stand-your-ground\" gun laws to a white rock musician calling the nation's first black president a \"subhuman mongrel.\" But in the world of sci-fi, fantasy and horror, storytellers can ignore reality and create an alternative America where anyone, regardless of race or gender, can be a superhero.AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" shows a world where even the zombies come from all sorts of racial backgrounds.\n\"Sometimes you have to show people the world you want them to see before they can believe it's possible,\" says K. Tempest Bradford, a sci-fi author and member of the Carl Brandon Society, a nonprofit group that raises awareness of people of color in the sci-fi, horror and fantasy fields.This mini-racial awakening on TV is new, but its roots are more than two centuries old. The persecuted outsider has long been a central character in classic sci-fi, fantasy and horror tales. When Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" was published in 1818, it featured a character who was treated like a monster because of his appearance. The popular X-Men comic books, which depict \"mutant\" superheroes as an embattled minority, debuted in 1963 at the height of the civil rights movement.\"When you look at any kind of monster, they are sort of 'the other,' '' says Gale Anne Hurd, executive producer of the AMC hit show \"The Walking Dead,\" which depicts a multiracial cast of survivors fighting zombies in a post-apocalyptic United States.\"They've always challenged our assumption that someone who doesn't look like us is someone to be feared, and that often the person who looks like us is the monster who should be feared.\"Traditionally these classic stories of persecuted minorities have been told by white men such as \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry and Stan Lee, the visionary behind Marvel Comics' franchises such as \"Spider-Man.\" Now a new generation of writers and actors on TV are flipping that script. They explain why there's been a racial awakening, why it matters, and cite the shows that best illustrate this trend. Hollywood's rejection of a screen legendBefore there was any kind of racial awakening on TV though, Hollywood was a brutal place for actors of color. One famous story shows why.In 1971, the producers of a new television series were looking for someone to play a Chinese Kung Fu master roaming the 19th-century American West. They considered an unknown Chinese actor but eventually chose American David Carradine. He didn't know any martial arts but apparently the producers didn't think television audiences were ready for a Chinese action star.The jilted Chinese actor left Hollywood in frustration and traveled to Hong Kong, where he starred in three martial arts films. His name was Bruce Lee.\"Sleepy Hollow\" breaks ground with two African-American actresses in leads. Nicole Beharie stars with Tom Mison.Lee's inability to get the lead role in the TV series that became known as \"Kung Fu\" is a well-known story. There's been a long debate over the specifics of his involvement with \"Kung Fu.\" Still, the only consistent role Lee could get in Hollywood during the late 1960s was playing the chauffeur Kato in a short-lived series called \"The Green Hornet.\"To see how much television has changed, one should look at an engrossing, contemporary fantasy show that bears many similarities to \"The Green Hornet.\"The show is called \"Arrow,\" and while there are Asian actors, none plays a chauffeur. Like the Green Hornet, the lead character of the CW Network show is a wealthy young man who becomes a masked vigilante at night to battle crime. He also has a chauffeur who acts as his bodyguard and confidant. The hero even wears a green mask.But that's where the similarities end. The cast of \"Arrow\" looks like a miniature United Nations: Asian actors play complex characters and love interests; the show's villain is played by a Latino actor; black and biracial characters are common; and two interracial relationships are central to the show. A TV show that's trying to say something about America should look like America, says \"Arrow\" creator Marc Guggenheim.\"You're trying to hold a mirror up to society, and if that mirror is skewed in one direction, then it's not a true mirror,\" Guggenheim says.Ask Guggenheim and other creators of these sci-fi, fantasy and horror shows to elaborate, and they say the same things: We try to reflect the world we live in; we grew up with friends from different races so we don't like all-white backdrops; successful shows such as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal\" prove that all of TV is getting more diverse.Making dollars, making senseDiversity also makes dollars and sense -- it's good for ratings and the bottom line, the creators say. A recent study backs them up.TV shows that hire more racially diverse casts and writing staffs attract more viewers, a 2012 UCLA study found. Cable shows with 30% to 40% minority casts brought in bigger audiences; shows with casts and writing staffs that were less than 10% minority had the lowest ratings, researchers at the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA concluded.At some point you start to normalize the notion that only white men can be the hero and only white men can be in charge.UCLA professor Darnell Hunt on stories that only show white men saving the worldDespite these numbers, minorities, who collectively accounted for 36.3% of the U.S. population in 2010, are still under-represented on television, the study said. Minority actors claimed 5.1% of the lead roles in comedies and dramas on broadcast TV and 14.7% on cable TV, which is traditionally more daring.\"America has gotten a lot more diverse, but Hollywood is not keeping up,\" says Darnell Hunt, a UCLA sociology professor and director of the Bunche Center.Hunt says it appears that sci-fi, fantasy and horror TV shows employ more actors of color, but his study didn't look at those specific genres. But he says \"there's something\" to the trend and it might be due to the urban settings for shows such as \"The Walking Dead.\"\"You're dealing with ensemble shows with relatively large casts set in urban settings,\" he says. \"There's some recognition from the people who make these shows that we have to be a lot more diverse.\"There's also recognition from actors of color that a more diverse audience won't accept them in stereotypical roles, says Russell Hornsby, co-star of the NBC series \"Grimm,\" a police procedural that features a homicide detective hunting supernatural characters inspired by the Brothers Grimm's fairy tales.  Actors of color wouldn't complain before about being cast in stereotypical roles in shows such as the 1996 series \"Homeboys in Outer Space,\" says Hornsby, who plays detective Hank Griffin in \"Grimm.\"\"The excuse we gave is that we were just happy to be in the game,\" Hornsby says. \"Twenty years ago that was fine, but not any longer. We're savvier as a people. We're asking for our characters of color to be well-drawn.\"The impact of Octavia ButlerSo are television fans.In the 1960s, when \"Star Trek\" became one of the first shows to field a racially diverse cast, television audiences couldn't easily reach a writer or producer to tell them they didn't like how a character was being portrayed.Shows such as the 1960s sci-fi TV series \"Lost in Space\" were set in the future, which appeared to be all-white.Today, fans don't have that problem -- they can act as virtual co-creators of shows. They hop onto social media sites such as Facebook, Tumblr and Reddit and launch online campaigns to shape casting choices, alter storylines and complain if they don't think a cast is diverse, says Tara Aquino, pop culture editor at Complex. Aquino, who is Filipino-American, recently wrote an online column condemning makers of the CBS series \"How I Met Your Mother\" for showing characters in yellow face dressed in kimonos. She's a big fan of \"Arrow.\" \"It's important that these characters are not sidekicks anymore or characters to fill a quota,\" Aquino says. There's also something inherent in nerd culture that makes sci-fi, fantasy and horror fans more demanding of tolerance, others say. Many self-described geeks never quite fit in and have more sympathy for outcasts because they identify with being victims of prejudice.More on CNN: What it's like being the only black nerd in the room Perhaps the most unheralded change in the sci-fi and fantasy worlds is the color of the storytellers themselves. Minority writers have traditionally been expected to write angry tomes about the suffering of their people. But not all black writers, for example, wanted to write another \"Roots.\" Now more writers of color are penning sci-fi, fantasy and horror. Many were inspired by the late Octavia Butler, the first science-fiction writer to receive the MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" Fellowship.The impact of Butler, who was black, is immense. She proved that a writer of color can write a successful sci-fi novel without shedding her racial identity. One of her most popular novels is \"Kindred,\" which follows a contemporary black woman who is whisked back in time to 19th-century America, where she meets her ancestors. Contemporary writers of color such as Tananarive Due, Colson Whitehead and Walter Mosley (\"Devil in a Blue Dress\") have also written sci-fi and horror novels.\"It's liberating as a black woman to see yourself in the books of people like Butler and on TV,\" says Alexis Charles, a Stanford University graduate student who wrote an essay for the online magazine Salon called \"The future can't be all white: Why Uhura and Beetee matter.\"\"It's wonderful to see the diversity in characters, and to see someone who looks like me doing amazing things in the future and helping to create that future.\"What shows are the most diverse?So what shows do you turn on if you want to see this new racial sensibility?Fans tend to cite the same ones: \"Sleepy Hollow,\" \"The Walking Dead,\" \"Arrow,\" \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"The Originals.\"When you look at any kind of monster ... they've always challenged our assumption that someone who doesn't look like us is someone to be feared.Gale Anne Hurd, executive producer of AMC's \"The Walking Dead\"Some of these are breaking racial ground in a more daring way. They are casting people of color in roles that were traditionally written as white. It's a reversal of the practice of casting white actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal to play characters of color in films such as \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.\"The CW Network show \"The Vampire Diaries\" selected a biracial actress to play a role written originally as a white, red-haired witch. The show is based on a series of young adult novels depicting the love triangle between two vampire brothers and a high school girl. The actress, Kat Graham, gives a soulful performance as Bonnie, a witch who takes on vampires and werewolves to defend her friends.Some \"Vampire Diaries\" fans will occasionally go online to complain about the diverse casting, but Julie Plec, the show's co-creator and executive producer, says they are a minority.\"I don't even bother to respond,\" she says, \"because most of the fan base will respond for us and shut down the person.\"The acceptance of racial diversity on sci-fi, fantasy and horror shows is so ingrained that Plec hesitated when asked if a show could get away with an all-white cast.\"It's possible -- they damn well better be all related,\" she says, chuckling.Perhaps the most audacious example of this new post-racial landscape on TV is the character R.M. Renfield on the NBC show \"Dracula.\" In Bram Stoker's original 19th-century novel, Renfield was a white man. In virtually all Hollywood versions of \"Dracula,\" he's been depicted as a demented white man slavishly devoted to Dracula. In the new TV series, Renfield is played by Nonso Anozie, a black British actor, as a fiercely intelligent and self-possessed man who earns Dracula's admiration.The creator of NBC's \"Dracula\" says he decided early on that he would rewrite Renfield as a black man.\"As a nonhuman who is spurned and hated, Dracula would naturally have an affinity for black Americans who suffered oppression and alienation from society,\" says Daniel Knauf, the show's executive producer. \"It was a natural choice.\"Anozie says he's received \"nothing but love\" from fans.\"I have people doing things like making Renfield artwork and figures, right up to posting pictures of themselves ... with posters and my character,\" he says. \"It's more intense than anything I've experienced.\"Film, however, seems to be less receptive to this new racial sensibility.Some people still want their big-screen heroes to be white men. There was an online uproar when the makers of the upcoming Marvel Comics \"Fantastic Four\" film selected Michael B. Jordan, a black actor, to play the Human Torch superhero. Fans also objected when Jeffrey Wright, a black actor, was picked to play Beetee, who was a white character in \"The Hunger Games\" book series.Why it mattersThe debate over a superhero's color may seem silly at first. Why should it matter if the Human Torch is black, brown or white -- he's a torch, big deal. But sci-fi, fantasy and horror stories do more than give people thrills. They can drive social change or slow its progress, some say.\"Will & Grace\" and \"Ellen,\" for example, were credited with helping ease acceptance of gays and lesbians by using comedy to normalize a group of people deemed different.At that moment, the world tilted for me. That's all I could think of.\"Star Trek\" actress Nichelle Nichols after meeting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Similarly, sci-fi, fantasy and horror shows teach children about tolerance without being preachy because their young audiences are wrapped up in the stories, says Michael D. Baran, a cultural anthropologist who studies how youth learn about race. \"They're not going to get messages that a kid's worth is dependent on how they look,\" Baran says. \"One of the things these shows don't do is come out and say 'everyone is equal.' As soon as kids feel like they're being taught something, they're wary about it.\"When shows tell stories where marginalized groups are excluded from the stories a nation tells about itself, children get another message, says Hunt, director of UCLA's Bunche Center.\"At some point you start to normalize the notion that only white men can be the hero and only white men can be in charge,\" Hunt says.That notion won't last though if more shows such as \"Sleepy Hollow\" get good ratings. Television will change because America is changing, Hunt says.\"As the audience gets more diverse, it's going to gravitate to more things that tend to be important to them,\" he says.For all the talk about a racial awakening on TV, there's still one final frontier that's waiting to be crossed, says Anozie, the actor on \"Dracula.\" Perhaps one day a fan will boldly go where few have gone before when they talk about his roles.\"People often tell me how rare it is to be cast in the roles I have as a black man,\" says Anozie, who has also appeared in \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Ender's Game.\" \"I guess things will have really changed when people compliment your work without having to mention skin color.\"",

While the pandemic is not over, The Best in Us is a series that highlights people whose pandemic stories exemplify the resilience of the human spirit. (CNN)The doctor pleaded with Paige Deiner to close her eyes and sleep. But she refused to listen. She was terrified.\"If I go to sleep, I'm not going to wake up,\" she told him.It was an October night in 2021, and Deiner was fighting for her life, and the life of her 24-week-old baby. She was in the intensive care unit of a Delaware hospital after being diagnosed with Covid. She had lost 30 pounds in 12 days after being put on a ventilator. A doctor later told her that at one point he estimated she had a 5% chance of survival.Deiner was trying to calm her nerves when the doctor entered her room. She played Celtic music on her iPhone and watched \"Peppa Pig,\" an animated children's television show, on a TV set. But each breath became a painful rasp, and she couldn't tune out the beeping from the monitors as the doctor urged her to listen.\"You have to sleep,\" the doctor told her. \"If you don't go to sleep, you're going to die. You can't heal yourself if your brain can't sleep.\"Read More Deiner fought back her panic and closed her eyes. She thought it was the end. Her world went dark.  But her story was just beginning. A new kind of near-death experienceAnyone who has read about near-death experiences (NDEs) can imagine what they think happened to Deiner next. Floating through a tunnel to a light in the distance. Hearing celestial music. Greeting loved ones who died many years earlier. These are the type of stories people tell in bestselling books like \"90 Minutes in Heaven\" and \"Proof of Heaven.\" Each survivor of a near-death experience shares stories of being spiritually transformed by what they glimpsed in the afterlife.Paige Deiner, in a hospital, while recovering from a near-death experience that changed her perspective.\nBut in the two years since it began, the Covid pandemic has spawned a new category of near-death experiences -- recounted by people like Deiner who returned to see the miraculous in the ordinary rhythms of daily life: Being able to taste and smell coffee, hug a child again and see the sun rise after fearing you'd never again hear birds singing in the morning.They were spiritually transformed not by a glimpse of the afterlife but by what they saw in this life, when they were struggling to stay alive after being stricken by Covid.Those type of stories don't tend to get book or movie deals. Yet people like Deiner, 41, have these incredible stories of survival that can help all of us.Start with the power of gratitude. It's a clich\u00e9 for some, but not for many Covid survivors. \"I think often of how much we take for granted,\" Deiner wrote in a Facebook post not long after she was released from the hospital in December, \"from the ability to walk or swallow to breathe.\"Angels all around us Before she became ill, Deiner was a ball of energy. She was working on her doctorate in Oriental Medicine after getting an undergraduate degree in international relations. She was a mom, a former journalist, a massage therapist living in Lincoln, Delaware and a Reiki master. She once hiked through Central America with nothing more than a backpack.\"I was at the top of my A-game,\" she says.You're dependent on upon people and strangers to keep you alive.\"Paige Deiner recalls of her hospitalizationCovid changed all that. She had to learn what many of the greatest spiritual traditions say: We come into the world helpless; we leave it the same way. We need one another.\"When you're really sick, you're put in a position where you're powerless,\" she says. \"You're dependent on upon people and strangers to keep you alive.\"Like many near-death survivors, Deiner met angels. But they weren't the glowing, winged creatures depicted in books and movies.There was the nurse who patiently cleaned her up after she was covered in vomit and blood.The pastor who came by the ICU, recited the Lord's Prayer with her and cried with her even though she never met him before.The doctor who urged her to go to sleep. When she opened her eyes eight hours later, \"He was still there,\" she says.A prayer for the livingDeiner didn't think she was going to end up in the hospital. She had already gotten her first vaccine and was about to get her second shot last year when she became sick. As she hovered between life and death in the ICU, she says she started to experience ICU psychosis -- a disorder where patients hallucinate, become paranoid, and lose track of time and space. When she was taken off the ventilator, she lost all sensation in her body and found herself floating above herself, looking down at doctors working on her. She could see her body covered with bruises and tubes dangling from her arms.\"I couldn't feel the baby move anymore because I couldn't feel anything,\" she says. \"I thought I was dead.\"So Deiner did what any child of the Internet age would do when trapped in limbo, not knowing whether she was alive or dead. She texted a friend. I think I'm dead. I can't feel my body. I must be a ghost.\"Paige Deiner's frantic message to a friendShe doesn't how she did it, but she somehow dispatched a text to a friend after she came off the ventilator. She was so disoriented at the time that she believed she was texting her friend through a form of telepathy.The friend was Craig Maull, a fellow message therapist interested in alternative forms of spirituality who also repairs roads for Delaware's Department of Transportation. He got a text from her after not hearing from Deiner for 12 days (\"I was down to checking the obituaries three or four times a day,\" he said). Her text was simple: \"I think I'm dead. I can't feel my body. I must be a ghost.\"\"You're alive. Trust me on this,\" he wrote back. \"You've been under for about 12 days.\"Maull gave her a mantra, a traditional Hawaiian meditation to chant and quiet her mind:\"I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Thank you.\"The meditation helped save her life, Deiner says. Its power is rooted in its simplicity. She says it helped \"bring my mind, body and spirit together.\"One question she cannot answerDeiner recovered and gave birth in December to a healthy six-pound, eight-ounce son. She named him Soren and says he is \"growing like weed.\" She says she only realized how close she came to death when a doctor told her later that he had initially given her a 5% chance of survival.Paige Deiner with her son, Soren. She calls him a \"miracle baby.\"Hearing that prognosis terrified her. \"It felt like cold water, horror and panic all at once,\" she says. But Deiner still faces huge challenges. She can't cut her own food, tie her shoes or change Soren's clothes because of constant pain in her hands. She has trouble walking and needed therapy to learn how to swallow again. Her sense of taste and smell is gone. The nerve damage from her illness still lingers, and she's in constant physical therapy. She depends on her daughter, Isabella, 15, for help. \"It's hard. I'm not going to lie,\" Isabella says. \"It's hard to watch someone struggle. It's hard to constantly drop things and help her. But I'm very thankful she's alive to ask for help.\"Deiner's body may be weaker, but her dreams are bigger. She owns a massage, wellness and yoga center, but wants to do more. She says wants to get a degree in Eastern medicine to help others. She thinks of moving to a small town in an undeveloped country to provide medical care. She can't envision going back to her life the way it was before.Almost a million Americans have died from Covid. Many of us have lost parents, siblings, friends, co-workers -- the sudden absence of people who in the words of the poet Billy Collins have \"left a shape of air walking in their place.\"For Deiner, there's still one mystery about her illness that she can't answer: Why did she survive when so many others died?\"What do I say? It wasn't my time. I had more people praying for me. I'm really lucky to have good medical care,\" Deiner says. \"I have no idea.\"But Deiner says she can answer that question in part by how now she chooses to live.\"I feel a profound sense of responsibility,\" she says. \"I was given a second chance of life. I have to live a life in a way that's honorable for the people who didn't get a chance, and for the people who will never walk, talk or breathe on their own.\"",

In recent days stories of Ukrainian courage have also been heard around the world: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky turning down an offer to evacuate him from the country by saying, \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride\"; the besieged defenders of Snake Island who told a Russian warship to \"go fk yourself\"; the images of Ukrainian civilians making Molotov cocktails and carrying assault rifles while heading to the front lines. \"Each passing day adds more stories that Ukrainians will tell not only in the dark days ahead, but in the decades and generations to come,\" the author and historian Yuval Noah Harari said in a recent essay. \"This is the stuff nations are built from. In the long run, these stories count more than tanks.\" Members of Ukraine's Territorial Defense Force in Kyiv prep their weapons to defend themselves against Russian forces on February 26. Read MoreBut here's another reason why the Ukraine struggle is so inspiring: This is also the stuff that built the US.  The war in Ukraine isn't just a geopolitical struggle -- it's a call to remember.  The courage of the Ukrainian people is a reminder of what the US used to be -- a \"beacon of liberty,\" where virtually every schoolchild memorized the \"Concord Hymn\" poem inscribed at the base of the Minute Man statue. The Ukrainians are teaching Americans two lessons about democracy that many of us have forgotten. Lesson 1: The most ferocious defenders of democracy are those who have been denied it   Ukrainian's democratic tradition bears little comparison to the US at first glance. The country has been independent for only 31 years. And it's not clear that everyone opposing Russia is fighting for liberal democracy in Ukraine. There's evidence that ultra-nationalists and far-right groups are part of the armed Ukraine resistance.Ukraine also borders Russia, an oppressive regime that has installed puppet governments in the country before. The country is familiar with brutal leaders imposing their will on its people. The Russian dictator Joseph Stalin caused the deaths of nearly 4 million Ukrainians in the 1930s by engineering a famine. The German invasion of Ukraine in World War II led to the deaths of an estimated seven million people. But that history of brutality is partly why so many Ukrainians are willing to fight so hard for democracy. Freedom tastes sweeter for those who have never had it. This is the same dynamic that helped make the US. Members of the Japanese-American 442nd Infantry Regiment stand at attention while their citations are read in France  on November 12, 1944, during World War II.The most fervent believers in American democracy tend to come from groups that have been denied liberty and equality -- either in the US or from their country of origin.  The first martyr in the fight for American independence was a runaway slave named Crispus Attucks, shot by British redcoats during the Boston Massacre. The most decorated unit in US military history was a Japanese American regiment that fought during World War II. These \"Nisei\" soldiers volunteered for combat though they came from families that had their property confiscated and were placed in internment camps by the US government. The first people who made a genuine democracy a reality in the US were Black civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, and other Southern cities. They forced the US to abandon its neo-apartheid political system by pushing Congress to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  You can't talk about exclusion in the US without mentioning immigrants. The country's history is filled with spasms of intolerance and raw racism directed at immigrants. And yet many immigrants outwork, outvote and outfight many native-born Americans. Ukrainian militia members set up anti-tank barricades in Kyiv on March 2.One in five Medal of Honor winners have been immigrants. Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as native-born Americans. Nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies -- including Apple, Google and Amazon -- were founded by immigrants or their children.Many of these immigrants left countries run by dictators and convulsed by civil wars and political violence because of one American trait: Our democratic ideas. \"Since World War II, that has been the single most important driver of American influence and power,\" said Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, in a recent interview. \"Yes, we have a big military. Yes, we have a strong economy. But it's our ideas that attract others. Russia under Putin doesn't really have that power of attraction. He only has the power of coercion, and we are seeing that now in Ukraine in a brutal way.\"Lesson 2: Ordinary people are the true heroes of democracy When a CNN crew recently interviewed Ukrainan President Zelensky in a bunker in Kyiv, the country's capital, he said something that was revelatory. A journalist asked him what it was like to go from being a comic actor to becoming a globally acclaimed wartime leader. But Zelensky was not interested in adding to the Western praise of his charismatic leadership. \"I'm not iconic,\" he said. \"I think Ukraine is iconic.\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has received global acclaim for his couragous leadership during the Russian invasion.It's the kind of statement that would have made the \"embattled farmers\" who fought at Concord during the Revolutionary War nod in recognition. Ordinary people, not charismatic leaders, sustain democracy. This was an abiding belief throughout US history. There was a time when most young men were expected to join the military or go into government as part of some form of public service. This expectation also applied to the wealthy and the famous. That's part of the reason why former president George H.W. Bush, the grandson of a steel industrialist and scion of a wealthy family, enlisted as a fighter pilot in World War II.  Actor Jimmy Stewart turned down an offer to stay stateside as a flight instructor and volunteered for combat duty as a US Army Air Force pilot. He flew 20 bombing missions in harrowing combat conditions, an experience he rarely talked about after the war. This attitude, though, wasn't confined to World War II. It was there at the nation's beginning. It was Nathan Hale, an American Revolutionary War officer, who reputedly said, \"I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.\"  And it wasn't confined to the military. There's a generation of Americans who entered the Peace Corps because of what President John F. Kennedy declared at his 1960 inaugural address:  \"Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can for your country.\" When asked what he learned from studying US history, historian Howard Zinn once said, \"Democracy is not what governments do; it's what people do, too.\" Civil rights protesters arrive in Montgomery, Alabama, on March 29, 1965, after their march from Selma to seek expanded voting rights.His message: Don't depend on saviors. \"Don't depend on the founding fathers, on Andrew Jackson, on Theodore Roosevelt, on Lyndon Johnson, on Obama,\" Zinn said. \"Don't depend on our leaders to do what needs to be done, because whenever the government has done anything to bring about change, it's done so only because it's been pushed and prodded by social movements, by ordinary people organizing. \"Lincoln was pushed by the antislavery movement,\" he added.  \"Johnson and Kennedy were pushed by the Southern Black movement...\" This power of ordinary people is what Zelensky evoked when he released a taped appeal to the Russian and Ukrainian people before Russia's invasion.  He said there was one group that could ultimately prevent war: \"Regular people. Regular, normal people.\"It's a lesson many contemporary Americans have seem to have forgotten. Our political discourse is driven by searches for a savior: a charismatic leader who will vanquish the other side; a pivotal Supreme Court appointment that will finally \"take back\" the country, a commentator who will \"destroy\" opponents on TV. Many have stopped believing that ordinary people can change anything because of political gridlock.  The spirit of democracy in the US feels like it's under siegeMore Americans even now doubt the power of their democratic ideas. One recent poll showed that 64% of Americans believe their democracy is \"in crisis and at risk of failing.\" Another recent poll found 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy for other countries to follow but has not been in recent years. It's not as if the democratic spirit has been extinguished in the US. The 2020 presidential election was held during a pandemic but saw the highest voter turnout in a century. The nationwide protests after the murder of George Floyd that same year have been described as the largest movement in the country's history. And there was a palpable hope early in 2020 that the pandemic would bring Americans together. But that burst of civic participation was followed by 19 states passing voter restriction laws. The pandemic became a political wedge issue. And the US still lags behind most developed nations when it comes to voter turnout. Today it's Ukranians -- not Americans -- who are embodying Kennedy's exhortation: They're asking what they can do for their country, not the other way around. Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, right, and his brother Wladimir Klitschko, also a former boxing champion, have vowed to help defend Ukraine against Russia.Ukrainian citizens are blocking Russian tanks with their bodies. Ukrainians are leaving safety and well-paying jobs in Europe to go fight for their homeland. Famous figures like Ukrainian boxer Vasiliy Lomachenko, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, are giving up lucrative paydays to go home and join a defense battalion. Ukrainian tennis star Sergiy Stakhovsky left his wife and their three young children in Hungary to join the fight in his homeland.And now Americans and other foreign fighters are traveling to Ukraine to defend the country.These stories don't just inspire, they force people in the West to reexamine our cynicism, Tom McTague wrote in a recent Atlantic essay. McTague said the US and Western Europe have lost their sense of being a force for moral good and taking on heroic struggles in the cause of freedom. Instead we follow cynical opportunists in shows like \"Succession\" and \"Billions\" and pragmatic, cautious leaders who lack any overt idealism, he said. Ukraine changes that, McTague said. One of the reasons why Zelensky reduced hardened politicians -- and even a translator -- to tears in his appeals to freedom is because \"Western countries don't have this type of leadership anymore: unembarrassed, defiant belief in a cause.\" Residents of Uzhhorod, Ukraine, prepare Molotov cocktails to defend their city on February 27 after Russia launched a massive military operation against Ukraine.In standing up to Putin, McTague wrote, \"Ukraine is articulating a certain idea of itself that is righteous and dignified and heroic -- virtues we long ago dismissed as old-fashioned. How tragic it is that Zelensky's idea has to be attacked for us to be reminded of ours.\" It would be more tragic if Americans could no longer remember the ideas we stand for at all. Our country's history is filled with brutality. It is also riddled with hypocrisies. Yet that's why monuments like the Minute Man still stand. They remind us of who we are at our best, that democracy is something worth fighting, and dying for. Ukrainians know that. We used to know that. Their story echoes our story. Let us not forget.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Supreme Court justice is appointed for life, is virtually impossible to impeach and has the \"unbridled\" ability to nullify any law through the power of judicial review.  It's that power that affirmative action supporters dread now that the high court has decided to consider the use of race in college admissions. They fear the conservative majority on the court will undo more than 50 years of racial progress in higher education, and the ripple effects could cause American institutions to backtrack on efforts to become more diverse.  But there is another perspective that says that the legal power of the Supreme Court cannot withstand an even more formidable power:   The will of the American people.  That perspective insists that it ultimately won't matter what conservatives on the Supreme Court decide on affirmative action.   Read MoreA decision banning the use of race in college admissions could cause minority enrollment in higher education to plummet, but colleges will adapt. And so will the rest of America because concepts such as diversity and inclusion are too widely accepted now to be erased, some scholars and diversity consultants say.   \"Society is moving in the direction of diversity and inclusion, and there is no turning back,\" says Barry Friedman, author of \"The Will of the People: How Public Opinion Has Influenced the Supreme Court and Shaped the Meaning of the Constitution.\"  \"The ultimate check on the Supreme Court is popular will.\"   Why critics dislike affirmative action  \u200b The issue of affirmative action in higher education may turn out to be the ultimate test of Friedman's optimism. After years of conservative legal attacks, it has become the legal equivalent of a dead man walking -- it's operating on borrowed time.     Read more from John Blake:They grew up surrounded by racism. But early on they chose a different pathThere's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White manConservatives actually love critical race theory -- when they turn the subject to 'oppressed White people'White supremacy, with a tanThey lost their loved ones to Covid. Then they heard from them againDemocrats are on the verge of repeating a voting rights blunder that led to the rise of Jim CrowHow 'good White people' derail racial progressAffirmative action has been under attack since political leaders introduced it in the mid-1960s to improve educational and employment opportunities for racial minorities. It was instituted in part to compensate for centuries of slavery and segregation.\"A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for the Negro,\" the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in his final book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.\"   Affirmative action didn't just help Black people. It expanded educational and job opportunities for other groups like women and persons with disabilities. Some studies say affirmative action has helped White women more than any other group.The battle over affirmative action in higher education is part of a larger legal struggle. The contemporary conservative legal movement was formed in part to strike down anti-discrimination laws and race-conscious policies designed to promote diversity.   That movement says dividing people up by race is unconstitutional, that the Constitution is \"colorblind\" and that all Americans should be treated as individuals, not as members of a racial or ethnic group.  The current high court, seated from left: Associate Justice Samuel Alito, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer and Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, standing from left: Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Associate Justice Elena Kagan, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch and Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Justice Breyer has announced his retirement.A Gallup Poll last year found that 62% of Americans \"generally \"support affirmative action. But nearly three-quarters of Americans in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey said colleges and universities should not consider race or ethnicity in student admissions.  The broad opposition fell across racial and political lines: 62% of Blacks and 63% of those that either \"lean\" or identify as Democrats said race should not be a factor along with 78% of Whites holding the same views.    Affirmative action in higher education survived a near-death experience in 2016 when former Justice Anthony Kennedy cast a surprising vote upholding the University of Texas' race-based admissions plan.   The makeup of the high court, however, has since become more conservative. Justices announced last month that they will reconsider race-based affirmative action in college admissions. The case in question challenges policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina that use students' race among many criteria to decide who should gain a coveted place in an entering class.  The issue also is part of a larger debate over diversity and inclusion in the US that impact all sectors, including corporations, the military, and even the National Football League.  Former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores filed a class action lawsuit against the NFL and three of its teams earlier this month. He accused the league and teams of systemic racism in hiring practices for head coaches after he was fired as the Dolphins' head coach despite a winning record. About 70% of NFL players are Black; currently only two of its 32 head coaches are Black. The NFL said that Flores' lawsuit was \"without merit\" and that \"diversity is core to everything we do.\" And the Dolphins \"vehemently\" denied the allegations, saying they are \"proud\" of the inclusion in their organization. Brian Flores sued the NFL, claiming racial discrimination in hiring, after he was fired as head coach of the Miami Dolphins.Affirmative action has even factored in recent discussions over the nominating process for Supreme Court justices. On Friday President Joe Biden selected federal appellate court judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is African American, as his nominee to the high court.GOP Sen. Ted Cruz has called Biden's promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court \"offensive\" and an \"insult,\" while Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said a Black woman high court nominee would be the \"beneficiary\" of an affirmative action quota.  There is, however, precedent for presidential candidates making specific promises for potential appointees, such as Reagan's promise to place a woman on the Supreme Court. Why some form of affirmative action is here to stay  Despite the constant attacks against affirmative action, though, some say the concept is here to stay.  Some scholars say colleges can adapt to a Supreme Court ruling eliminating race in college admissions by shifting the focus to income.  One of the biggest proponents of this approach is Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive independent think tank. He says that giving a leg up to economically disadvantaged students of all races would benefit people of color because they make up a disproportionate share of the poor.   It's good politics, too, he says.  Students protest outside the meeting of the University of California's Board of Regents in favor of affirmative action. An economic version of affirmative action is fairer and more appealing -- and would not be so easily used as a wedge issue between Blacks and Whites, he says. He points to a 2016 Gallup poll which said that 61% of Americans favor a college considering a family's economic circumstances when making admissions decisions.  \"The notion that the poor of all races have a special claim is a fundamental tenet of most of the world's great religions,\" Kahlenberg wrote in a 2018 essay. \"This is consistent with social science research which finds that today, being economically disadvantaged in America poses seven times as large an obstacle to high student achievement as does race.\" Keeping affirmative action alive is also good business, diversity consultants say.   A conservative majority on the high court can't eliminate a growing recognition that the country needs an educated and diverse workforce to remain competitive, they say.   This recognition is driven by demographic changes. The US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790 and that the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.  Howard Ross, a diversity consultant and social justice advocate, says corporate America and institutions like the military won't retreat from diversity efforts because they realize it's good for their bottom line. They are driven by what he calls \"enlightened self-interest.\"  \"People are realizing that there is an enormous amount of talent out there that's being underutilized and that companies and leadership that reflect their customer base perform better in the stock market,\" Ross says.  To reach a more diverse customer base, companies increasingly understand they must hire diverse workers who know how to reach those customers and make them feel welcome.   Protesters supporting diversity in college admissions hold signs in front of the US Supreme Court on October 10, 2012, in Washington. Corporate diversity makes dollars and sense, says Ross, author of \"Everyday Bias: Identifying and Navigating Unconscious Judgements in Our Daily Lives.\"   \"When you go into a store and you see people like yourself, you feel more comfortable, and a greater sense of belonging, and you feel they may understand your needs,\" Ross says. \"That's something that may be the difference between you buying a product at that store versus another one.\"  And Supreme Court scholars cite another point: The court can try to remake society, but it can't enforce its own rulings. For example, the court declared in 1962 that prayer in school was unconstitutional, \"but in many schools people kept praying,\" Friedman says.   \"The Supreme Court hands down decisions, but when they say everybody has to change their behavior, it's almost impossible for them to get compliance.\"   Why some say the court could derail social progress  But there are others who say a high court ruling against affirmative action in higher education will be devastating in both the short term and the long term.  In the short term, minority enrollment will probably plummet at some colleges if history is a guide. In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 209, which banned the use of what it called \"preferential treatment\" on the basis of things like race and sex in public educational settings and public sector jobs.   The ban hurt Black college applicants. From 1995 to 1998, admission offers to Black applicants at UCLA and the University of California, Berkeley, fell by 55%, according to one estimate. One UCLA faculty member told The New Yorker that his school ended up \"looking more like Ole Miss.\"   In 2020, California voters rejected Proposition 16, which would have restored the use of race and gender in public\u200b college admissions.  In the long term, economic affirmative action is not enough to help applicants of color, others say.  They point to research that shows that a focus on income alone in college admissions does not help students of color as much as other approaches that explicitly use race. This is an area of dispute among those who support affirmative action. But there is some evidence that racial diversity falls at colleges when income is used as a substitute for race in admissions decisions.   The US Supreme Court building as seen on January 26, 2022. The high court has become more conservative in recent years, leading some observers to believe affirmative action could be curtailed.And who says the high court can't defy popular will? They do it all the time, says Gerald N. Rosenberg, author of \"The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change?\"  Rosenberg cites the movement to abolish child labor in the late 19th and early 20th century. It had sympathetic victims. Smudge-faced and barefoot children were routinely employed as workers in dangerous factories, where their smaller size could help them do certain tasks and their age made them more unlikely to strike. Activists successfully persuaded the public to turn against child labor through photo exposes, pamphlets, and mass mailings. They even forced the US Congress to act.  But the Supreme Court didn't care, Rosenberg says.  \"There was a majority support to abolish child labor,\" he says. The Congress passed two separate bills using two different constitutional law hours to abolish child labor. The court invalidated both those laws, postponing the end of child labor for a generation.\"  The Supreme Court is insulated against social pressure to change because the nation's political system is also designed to deflect majority will, Rosenberg says. That's because America's Founding Fathers created a government that was built to resist \"pure democracy,\" such as the direct election of presidents, he says. They feared too much democracy would degenerate into \"mobs\" and \"factions.\"  The Constitution dictates, for example, that every state gets two senators, no matter how small the state's population. And as we saw with Donald Trump in 2016, it allows that a presidential candidate can lose the popular vote but still become president through the electoral college.  Any optimism about the will of the people being stronger than the high court doesn't consider the gridlock of our politics, Rosenberg says. What chance is there for Congress to pass a law overruling a high court decision when Congress barely functions?   \"If we had a political system in which majority views were pretty closely translated that optimism would be well-taken,\" he says. \"But we don't have that system.\"   Why 2023 will bring an answer to a key question There are other signs that the current makeup of the Supreme Court is well-suited to ignoring popular will.   The court's conservative bloc has already moved aggressively towards overturning Roe v. Wade, despite polls showing a majority of Americans believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.   Those who think the popular will can supplant the high court forget their history: The Supreme Court's traditional role has been to block political and social change, not validate it, scholars like Rosenberg say.   The high court has historically listened to one demographic above all: the wealthy, the powerful and the privileged, court critics say.  \"I always say don't underestimate the ability of the status quo to continue,\" Rosenberg says.  The high court is expected to deliver their final say on affirmative action in higher education by June of 2023.  If the conservative bloc on the high court rules as expected, the aftershocks could ripple into other segments of a rapidly diversifying American society where buzzwords like diversity and inclusion are now taken for granted as facts of life.   We will then learn what is stronger:  The will of the Supreme court or the will of the people.",

        "content": "(CNN)The podcaster Joe Rogan did not join a mob that forced lawmakers to flee for their lives. He never carried a Confederate flag inside the US Capitol rotunda. No one died trying to stop him from using the n-word.   But what Rogan and those that defend him have done since video clips of him using the n-word surfaced on social media is arguably just as dangerous as what a mob did when they stormed the US Capitol on January 6 last year.     Rogan breached a civic norm that has held America together since World War II. It's an unspoken agreement that we would never return to the kind of country we used to be.    That agreement revolved around this simple rule:   A White person would never be able to publicly use the n-word again and not pay a price.  Read MoreRogan has so far paid no steep professional price for using a racial slur that's been called the \"nuclear bomb of racial epithets.\" It may even boost his career. That's what some say happened to another White entertainer who was recently caught using the word.    It is a sign of how desensitized we have become to the rising levels of violence -- rhetorical and physical -- in our country that Rogan's slurs were largely treated as the latest racial outrage of the week.   But once we allow a White public figure to repeatedly use the foulest racial epithet in the English language without experiencing any form of punishment, we become a different country.  We accept the mainstreaming of a form of political violence that's as dangerous as the January 6 attack. Why Rogan's use of the n-word may not hurt his career   Some might say that comparing a podcaster's moronic musings about race to January 6 is hyperbole. They will invoke \"cancel culture\" and political correctness.   The man apologized, they will say. And he did.   \u200bHe called his comments \"the most regretful and shameful thing,\" adding \"I know that to most people, there's no context where a White person is ever allowed to say that word, never mind publicly on a podcast, and I agree with that,\" Rogan said after a video showed him using the n-word more than 20 times in different podcast episodes.   Rogan has one of Spotify's most popular podcasts.Rogan has also apologized for a video of him comparing a gathering of Black people to \"Planet of the Apes.\" He has said he is \"not racist.\"    In the past, White public figures who used the n-word provoked universal and unqualified condemnation. But Rogan has gotten some support.   His comments drew criticism from Daniel Ek, chief executive of Spotify, which reportedly pays Rogan at least $100 million to carry his mega-popular podcast. Ek said Rogan's racial slurs \"do not represent the values of this company.\"   But Ek also said Spotify will continue to stand by Rogan, who had the most popular podcast on the streaming platform last year.   \"We should have clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed, but canceling voices is a slippery slope,\" Ek said in a memo to his staff.   Another media mogul offered Rogan a lucrative new gig.  The chief executive of another social media company offered Rogan $100 million to bring his podcast to its platform, citing Rogan's \"legion of fans in desire for real conversation.\"   And former President Donald Trump told Rogan he should \"stop apologizing\" for his controversies -- including the racial slurs and spreading Covid-19 misinformation -- because he shouldn't allow critics to make him \"look weak and frightened.\"    Rogan's use of the n-word could even boost his career if it follows the trajectory of another White entertainer, country music star Morgan Wallen.   Wallen's career seemed finished a year ago after he was caught on video using the n-word in a conversation with a friend. Radio stations and streaming services dropped him from their playlists. The Academy of Country Music declared him ineligible for the 2021 ACM Awards. Wallen apologized but was widely condemned.   A year later, \"Wallen's career has \u200bnot only rebounded but exploded,\"  according to Billboard magazine. His songs are back on the radio and he had the most popular album of 2021 in the US, according to Billboard. Wallen is embarking on a nationwide tour, with many dates already sold out, and is slated to headline music festivals this summer.   Country singer Morgan Wallen performs on February 9, 2022, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Rolling Stone published an article earlier this month with the headline: \"Did Dropping the N-Word Actually Help Morgan Wallen's Career?\"  The article quoted a Nashville industry insider who said Wallen's popularity surged after his use of the n-word because the backlash \"made him a martyr... to people that hold what I would say are prejudices.\"   A recent USA Today story said Wallen has become an \"anti-cancel culture hero\" and quoted an executive  who said that the more the mainstream criticizes Wallen \"the more power those who support his bigotry begin to feel.\"    Meanwhile, Rogan is now reframing the backlash over his use of the n-word as a cancel culture battle.  \"This is a \"political hit job,\" he recently said, suggesting that the controversy may actually help him.    \"It's good because it makes me address some (expletive) that I really wish wasn't out there,\" he told a guest on his show Tuesday. \u200b\"You just have to stay offline ... Life goes on as normal.\"   The line that no White person once dared cross  For decades, life would never go on as normal for a White person caught using the n-word. This represents a momentous shift in American culture. There used to be a consensus that any White person caught using the n-word or other racial slurs would pay a hefty price.   Not that long ago, many did.    In 2018, the actress Roseanne Barr had her popular sitcom canceled after she made a series of racist tweets.   That same year, a top executive resigned from Netflix after using the N-word in front of Black employees.   Comedian Michael Richards performing at the Hollywood Improv comedy club on October 12, 2006, in Hollywood, California.Celebrity chef Paula Deen lost her business empire and saw her cooking shows canceled by the Food Network in 2013 after she admitted using the n-word during a deposition in a lawsuit.    And the career of \"Seinfeld's\" Michael Richards cratered after he was caught calling hecklers the n-word in 2006.  The price that White people paid for crossing this line wasn't legal. No one called for them to be jailed or fined.  But many were shamed and exiled from their professional communities.  The prohibition against White people using racist language in public was so severe that a person could see their career destroyed even if they used a racial slur that most people didn't comprehend.   George Allen was a popular US senator who seemed to be cruising to re-election in Virginia in 2006 when he was filmed\u200b using the word \"macaca,\" a type of monkey,\" to describe an Indian-American volunteer with the campaign of his opponent. He lost his re-election bid after both Republicans and Democrats criticized him. His political career never recovered.   US Senator George Allen concedes the 2006 election to rival Jim Webb at a news conference on  November 9, 2006, in Alexandria, Virginia.Using the n-word became a rhetorical red line because it represents arguably the most shameful part of US history: slavery and the Jim Crow era.    Neal Lester, an Arizona State University English professor who has taught a course on the n-word, noted it has been described as \"the most toxic in the English language,\" a term \"almost magical in its negative power,\" and a slur that \"occupies a place in the soul where logic and reason never go.\"    \"The word is inextricably linked with violence and brutality on Black psyches and derogatory aspersions cast on Black bodies,\" he said in an interview. \"No degree of appropriating can rid it of that blood-soaked history.\"    The decline of 'public racism'  It took a lot of work to ban the n-word from the public square. That shift wasn't about political correctness. It was about our survival as a multiracial democracy and our standing in the world.   The n-word became forbidden in the US public sphere around the mid-20th century when a consensus emerged that \"public racism\" was sabotaging democracy, some academics say. But in the decades before that, White entertainers and politicians talked like Rogan all the time.   World War II helped change that. The war against Nazism and revelations about the Holocaust raised awareness of racism, while  America's new role as a leader of the \"free world\" caused White elites to see racism as the nation's Achilles heel, wrote Robert L. Fleegler, a history professor at the University of Mississippi, in a paper titled, \"Theodore G. Bilbo and the Decline of Public Racism, 1938-1947.\"    Bilbo, a US Senator from Mississippi, felt free enough to tell White supporters during an election campaign in 1946 that \"I call on every red-blooded White man to use any means to keep the  n*ers away from the polls.\" US Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi ran for reelection in 1946 on a White supremacy platform.Bilbo won the Democratic primary and faced no opposition in the general election, but his Senate colleagues barred him from taking his seat in the chamber because of his open racism.    In the years that followed, Southern White politicians still used racially coded words like \"state's rights,\" but most avoided using the n-word in public, Fleegler wrote.   The civil rights movement also created a stigma around Whites using the n-word and other racial slurs. The assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the eruption of race riots after King's death showed White Americans what could happen when a group of citizens were treated with systemic disregard for their humanity.  \u200b  Using the n-word came to be seen as a vulgar relic of a shameful past, said Jacob Levy, a scholar and author of an essay titled \"The Weight of the Words.\"   \"The norm against publicly legitimizing Klan-type racism was built up over a long time,\" Levy wrote, \"calling on white Americans to do better than they were, partly by convincing them that they were better.\" How we become desensitized to hate speech  Why the change now?    The theories vary. Some cite the rise of social media, the growth of White supremacist groups and a right-wing media ecosystem that has mainstreamed racist rhetoric.     Former President Trump played a part, too. He rode a trail of racist, sexist, and antisemitic  statements all the way to the White House.    All these factors converged to create a chain effect that led to what one scholar calls \"defining deviance down.\" That's what happens when a country starts accepting offensive language it rejected before, wrote Steven Levitsky, co-author of the book, \"How Democracies Die.\"  \"When unwritten rules are violated over and over, we become overwhelmed -- and then desensitized,\" Levitsky wrote. \"We grow accustomed to what we previously thought to be scandalous.\"   Something else happens that's even more deadly. When people in positions of power use dehumanizing language to describe other groups, atrocities often follow. This is not ancient history: Consider what happened less than 30 years ago in Rwanda when some 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a three-month period in 1994. Hutu extremists targeted both the Tutsi minority, who were a majority of those killed, as well as moderate Hutus.  This photo taken on April 9, 2019, shows victims' clothes recovered from pits used as mass graves during the 1994 Rwandan genocide and hidden under houses in Kabuga, on the outskirts of Kigali.What triggered the violence in part were the messages that came from people in positions of power in Rwanda. Many, like Rogan, had a public megaphone and an audience.In a New Yorker essay on \"How Norms Change,\" the author Maria Konnikova described how Hutu leaders took to the radio calling Tutsis \"cockroaches,\" sanctioning the violence that followed. She said that \"norms can shift at the speed of social life\" when the wrong leaders command the public's attention.  \"To a great extent, the norms in Rwanda shifted so rapidly because they did so from the top: Influential radio stations broadcast a powerful, persuasive and constantly repeating message urging listeners to join killing squads and organize roadblocks,\" Konnikova wrote.  \u200b Genocide is a worst-case scenario. But we don't have to look as far as Rwanda to see how quickly civic norms can change when people in power start lowering standards. Earlier this month the Republican National Committee drafted a resolution calling the deadly January 6 insurrection \"legitimate political discourse.\"  CNN's Stephen Collinson responded in a column, \"The Republican Party is ever closer to the destination to which it has long been headed under former President Donald Trump -- the legitimization of violence as a form of political expression.\"    Why shrugging off the n-word is so dangerous  Rogan's use of the n-word may also be drawing us closer to something else: destroying any plausible shot at building a genuine multiracial democracy.  The January 6 insurrection was so dangerous because it violated a political norm. The citizens in a healthy democracy are supposed to accept the peaceful transfer of power, not to use violence as a tool of political protest. That's what most Americans agreed to leave behind after we fought a bloody Civil War over a political and moral issue: slavery.  The universal condemnation that used to greet White people who publicly used the n-word was also part of a civic norm that made a multiracial democracy possible. That word was a vestige of a hateful Jim Crow era that most Americans agreed to leave in the past. It was considered un-American.  This is the America that former President Ronald \u200bReagan evoked in his famous \"shining city on a hill\" 1989 farewell address. He described us as a nation \"teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace,\" with doors \"open to anyone with the will and heart to get here.\"   What are we now?  Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as people try to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in Washington.What are we when a White entertainer with a huge public following can use the n-word repeatedly -- and get a $100 million offer to bring \"real conversation\" to another platform?  What are we when Rogan's employer can say that his company has \"clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed,\" but that line doesn't include using a word that was used during the enslavement, rape and torture of millions of people.Rogan once called himself a \"f---ing moron... a cage-fighting commentator\" and not a \"respected source of information, even for me.\" He is something more now. He is unleashing lethal forces that he may not understand.  He is also a blinking red light, warning that the civic and political rules that once held the nation together no longer apply.  We are poised to enter an era where a White person can use the n-word publicly and not only survive but thrive if they portray themselves as a victim of cancel culture. It's a world where hate speech and violence are rebranded as \"legitimate political discourse,\" and \"public racism\" returns to ordinary life. Don't let the Rogan n-word controversy devolve into another tired discussion about cancel culture. This moment is bigger. If Rogan goes on with business as usual, all of us -- not just Black people -- will pay a price. Our country won't be the same. This is another January 6 moment.",

        "content": "(CNN)People cite a familiar cast of villains when they talk about the decline of democracy in America. Some point to the GOP legislators who craft voter suppression bills. Others blame those who spread the \"Big Lie\" that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Some even mention the two Democratic Senators who doomed voting rights legislation this week because they would not alter the filibuster. But there is someone most people rarely mention when talking about roadblocks to voting or the decline of democracy, says legal analyst Elie Mystal: Chief Justice John Roberts.Mystal, one of the most sought-after legal analysts in the country and author of the forthcoming book, \"Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution,\" sat down with CNN for a recent Q&A on race, voting rights and the decline of democracy in the US.Mystal says people can't talk about these issues without talking about Roberts' central role in removing federal oversight of elections to allow unfettered voter suppression to become normalized. Roberts' majority opinion in the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision was a crucial milestone in his decades-long campaign to turn back racial progress, Mystal says.Read MoreThe 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed to prevent local and state governments from adopting laws that denied citizens the equal right to vote based on race. The Shelby decision gutted the law by allowing states with a history of racial discrimination to change their election practices without getting approval from the federal government.\"His [Roberts'] opinion purposefully opened the door to all manner of voting rights restrictions,\" Mystal writes. \"When you see lines of Black people waiting hours and hours to vote, you can largely thank John Roberts for these scenes of racism. And he hasn't gotten nearly enough blame for it.\" Elie Mystal, right, speaks during a panel about  impeachment at the Politicon convention on October 27, 2019, in Nashville.A spokesperson for Roberts did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Mystal's remarks.  Such blunt talk by Mystal is characteristic of his new book, which is a lively, pugnacious, and accessible look at the legal theories that shape everything from voting to gun rights.  Mystal says he wrote it to show Americans \"what rights we have\" and \"what rights Republicans are trying to take away.\" Here are excerpts from our interview with Mystal. His answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.  What will be the fallout now that Democrats failed to pass a voting rights bill? The Republican Party has no agenda. No way of appealing to Black voters and minority voters across the country. Their only strategy is to suppress the minority vote. Now that the Democrats have failed to pass voting rights legislation, what they have effectively done is rubber-stamp the Republican strategy of suppressing the minority vote. The Republicans never leave their base out in the cold. Republicans always give their base red meat, something for them to get excited about every election. Whereas the Democrats never give their base, which happens to be Black and brown voters, anything to be pumped up and excited about during their governing years. And then two or three months right before the election, they're like, 'Oh yeah, by the way, you guys got to come vote and save the party.' Black people can't save the country if Democrats don't let us. If you don't put the laws in place to protect our right to vote, then the 14 or 15% of us can't save America from its White, right-wing theocracy.  Voters stand in line to cast their ballots during the first day of early voting in the US Senate runoff election on December 14, 2020, at the Gwinnett Fairgrounds outside Atlanta. What does it mean for the country, and for democracy itself, now that the voting rights bill has been defeated?  It's hard for me to not think of it kind of holistically, because not allowing Black people to participate in the polity is as American as apple pie. This country was founded on an apartheid system of government. They fought a war over slavery -- the losing side won the peace. And while they were not able to reinstitute slavery, they were able to reinstitute segregation and oppression and an apartheid government. The 15th Amendment, which says you can't discriminate against people voting based on the color of their skin, meant nothing for 100 years because there was no law to back it up. Without a statute, a constitutional amendment is more like a suggestion. It has no enforcement kick. There was no statute passed to make the gains of the Fifteenth Amendment real.  That's why I said the 1965 Voting Rights Act is the most important piece of legislation in American history. It is the first and only piece of legislation that makes the 15th Amendment real in this country. That is why Republicans have been trying take it away pretty much since its start.  So when we say what is the effect on the country now that Democrats failed to pass voting rights legislation -- the country will just do what the country has always done, which is oppress the voice and political opportunity of African Americans and minorities writ large in this country. We will be going backwards.  In your new book, you say something that stood out to me: \"The Constitution was designed to create a society dominated by White males.\" Not all the Founding Fathers were slaveholders. What about men like John Adams and Benjamin Rush, who helped birth the Constitution? They were opposed to slavery.  Isn't what you said unfair to them?  No, because even for the founders who weren't slaveholders, they willing to make deals with slaveholders. One of the ways that we know that the John Adamses of the world knew that slavery was wrong is that they refused to put the word \"slavery\" in their precious document.  The word \"slavery\" is referred to only obliquely in the original Constitution. The first and only time the word \"slavery\" appears in the Constitution is in the 13th Amendment outlawing it.  What do I take from that? These White people knew that what they were doing (by accepting the existence of slavery in the original draft of the Constitution) was wrong. And they did not stop it. Instead, they made deals with the Southern slaveholders in order to have a frigging country.  This oil painting by Howard Chandler Christy depicts the signing of the Constitution of the United States in 1787. The painting  hangs in the US Capitol. But what about the pragmatic side to that decision? The only way the US could have a nation and a Constitution was to make that deal.   How is it pragmatic to say that the only way we can have something that we really want is to hold an entire people in bondage for hundreds of years.?  How is that a deal? They didn't ask my people. They didn't ask women if they wanted to be part of the deal. I understand from the perspective of a rich White person, it was a fair deal. If you are sick of being taxed by a government from across the sea, it makes sense. I find that argument to be intellectually and morally weak. So don't make the deal. Don't break bread with slavers and slaveholders for economic opportunities. I don't think that that is how things had to happen. There were people in real time who were saying slavery is wrong and should never be allowed.  Rep. Ruen Gallego, left, the King family, middle, and other local activists lead the march across the 16th Street overpass to call for voting rights in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. on January 15, 2022, in Phoenix, Arizona.  I saw a recent interview where you called Chief Justice John Roberts the \"chief architect on the assault on democracy\" in this country. That sounds harsh for a public figure that's pretty popular. You may have heard about the recent Gallup Poll, where he had the highest approval rating of any federal leader.   John Roberts has been the enemy of voter equality for his entire professional career. In 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act because while it was illegal to discriminate against people based on the color of their skin, in 1981 you had to prove that the state legislature intended to discriminate. In 1982, they updated the law to mean that you didn't have to show intent. If your voter law had a discriminatory impact, the fact that it was discriminatory was enough. [What Mystal is describing has long been a battleground in voting rights: Can a law violate the Voting Rights Act even if legislators never announce their \"intent\" by mentioning race?][President Ronald] Reagan said that the Voting Rights Act humiliated the South. Reagan brought in a guy to figure out how to oppose the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendment, and that guy is John Roberts. John Roberts got his legal start arguing against the Voting Rights Act.  John Roberts has been the enemy of black people voting for his entire career. He showed it in the 2013 [Shelby v. Holder ruling] when he eviscerated Section Five of the Voting Rights Act. That's the preclearance provision that Reagan thought was humiliating to the South. He has been the architect of this assault on democracy.  Alabama residents stand in line outside the US Supreme Court for the chance to hear oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on February 27, 2013, in Washington.  Why is Roberts' Shelby decision so offensive to you? In your book, you talked about Roberts' deciding in his majority opinion that racism was over and that Section Five was no longer needed. [Author's note: Roberts never claimed racism was over but wrote in the decision that \"our country has changed\" and that Congress must pass voting rights legislation that \"speaks to current conditions.\"]  It's ridiculous to me that John Roberts, a White elite person, would be the guy to know when racism in the Deep South has subsided to the point where Black people do not need protections of their equal rights. He would be the last guy to know that in terms of his own experience and quite frankly in terms of how the Supreme Court is supposed to function. The Supreme Court would be the last institution to know that. Congress is supposed to be the institution to know that. And Congress said we still need the Voting Rights Act. It was reaffirmed in 2006 by a voice vote in the House, which means it was so popular that they didn't bother to do a roll call, and in the Senate. Congress says that we needed the Voting Rights Act, but the Supreme Court stepped in and said, 'actually, no, we don't,' because racism has been defeated in the South.  Chief Justice John Roberts sits during a group photo of the Justices at the Supreme Court on April 23, 2021.  You talk in your book about how the Supreme Court in the late 19th century made a string of racist decisions that made the rise of Jim Crow possible. Do you think one day historians will look at rulings from the Roberts Court, such as the Shelby decision, and place them in the same league?  History is written by the victors, and right now his side is winning.  But assuming that his side eventually loses, I think Roberts' popularity will fade as we get further from his decisions. The negative and racially biased impact of the decisions will become more apparent. People will look at things like Shelby County and come to the determination that Roberts was an enemy of racial progress in this country. He is a friend and a handmaiden to White supremacy. People look at his persona and they're saying he can't possibly be that bad. It's because very few people have actually read his decisions and actually understand his entire history on these issues.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. has been called a socialist, a Republican, an \"angry Black man\" and a \"teddy bear.\" It's an annual ritual on the birthday of the iconic civil rights leader: Pundits offer provocative interpretations of King to make him relevant for a contemporary audience.  But these commentators won't have to work as hard this year to explain why King matters. Anyone who wants to remind Americans about the urgency of King's message can now cite January 6, 2021.  That's when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol and tried to block Congress' certification of the 2020 presidential election because they wrongly believed Trump had won.  January 6 and January 15: These dueling dates are just nine days apart, yet they offer two radically different visions of what the US stands for. Read MoreFor part of America, January 6 is a \"1776 moment,\" a great patriotic uprising. Another part of the country celebrates King's January 15 birthday and his dream of a Beloved Community -- a \"world in which people of all identities are equal and included.\"The two dates present the country with a choice: Are we going to be a nation of We, the People, or We, the White people? The question may seem abstract, but if you look closer at what both men did with their defining moments in Washington, the differences are clear.Consider the contrasts between King's \"I Have a Dream Speech\" on August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial and Trump's January 6 \"Stop the Steal\" rally at the Ellipse.King drew a peaceful, interracial crowd to Washington and talked about a dream that united \"all of God's children -- Black men and White men, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants...\"President Donald Trump speaks during a January 6, 2021, rally in Washington  protesting the electoral college certification of Joe Biden as President. Trump drew an overwhelmingly White crowd that included members of White supremacist groups, a man wearing a \"Camp Auschwitz\" T-shirt and people who erected a lynching noose on the Capitol grounds.King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech helped spark the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which helped make the US a genuine democracy for the first time.Trump's speech directly preceded an attack on Congress that killed five people and injured many others and prompted a wave of voter suppression laws that have weakened American democracy.  King drew a cross-section of religious leaders, activists and celebrities like singer Joan Baez, future congressman John Lewis, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier and Charlton Heston.Trump drew \"QAnon Shaman\" Jacob Chansley, a man who paraded a Confederate Flag through the Capitol and others who smeared poop in the building's hallways.One crowd inspired the country. Another debased the US Capitol.King had a dream. Trump had a mob.Supporters of US President Donald Trump protest in the US Capitol Rotunda on January 6, 2021. King's radical belief in democracy The January 6 marker may help revitalize interest in King's holiday in another way. More people might pay attention to an under-appreciated aspect of King's legacy: His passionate defense of democracy. Our system of government could use some inspired defenders right now. President Biden called this month for the passage of new voting rights legislation that would make it harder to steal elections. But a wall of Republican opposition and at least two Democratic senators who reject any filibuster reform has for now doomed that bill. King lived in an era where the filibuster was routinely used to deny Black equality. NAACP leaders once fumed that the filibuster was the legislative equivalent of a lynching.  Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as they try to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.King offers voting rights advocates today a model for explaining why voter suppression laws betray democracy.  \"So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my mind\u2014it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact\u2014I can only submit to the edict of others,\" he said in a 1957 speech titled, \"Give us the Ballot and We Will Transform the South.\" That King speech wasn't considered revolutionary at the time. But January 6 now makes King's belief in democracy seem, well, radical. Most Americans no longer consider their country to be a beacon of democracy to the world. A recent Pew Research Center poll revealed this stat: 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy for other countries to follow but has not been in recent years.  The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., center with arms raised, marches along Constitution Avenue with other civil rights protesters to the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Many Americans believe the Big Lie that the 2020 presidential election, which had record turnout, was stolen. About half of Republicans describe the Capitol mob's actions as \"patriotism\" or \"defending freedom.\" Authoritarian governments in China, Russia and Brazil are on the rise, and democracy is in retreat around the globe. How can Americans lecture other countries about democracy when so many of its own citizens no longer believe in it? That's why King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech is more important than ever. You won't find a more eloquent defense of multiracial democracy anywhere. It is widely considered the greatest political speech of the 20th Century because, in part, it is profoundly unoriginal. King was like a master DJ -- mixing and sampling all of the nation's founding documents to create something new.  He quotes or alludes to The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address. He ended the speech by evoking an African American spiritual. He turned a political rally into a church revival for democracy. A crowd gathers at the Lincoln Memorial to hear King and other March on Washington speakers in 1963. \"We consistently marginalize or ignore Dr. King's commitment to the core values of democracy,\" Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of \"Parting the Waters,\" said. \"He planted one foot in American heritage, the other in scripture, and both in nonviolence.\"  King's 'table of brotherhood' is still unrealized Here's another part of King's vision that now seems radical after January 6: His belief in racial integration.  His \"I Have a Dream\" speech reflected his belief that perpetual racial conflict didn't have to be his country's destiny. His hope is reflected in one of the most famous lines from the speech: \"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\" Voting rights activists prepare to be arrested on Capitol Hill in Washington on October 28, 2021.Almost 60 years later, that table of brotherhood is still waiting for more diners to pull up a seat. The country's public schools, neighborhoods and communities of worship remain largely racially segregated.  When was the last time you heard any political or civil rights leader talk with passion about racial integration? The reasons for this are complex, but it boils down to this: There are never enough White Americans -- including progressive White people - who are willing to embrace integration when it comes to accepting nonwhite people in their backyards.  President Lyndon Johnson, a contemporary of King's, had a word for what many Americans will experience if they remain segregated. He said the country would suffer an \"unraveling.\"  The violence of January 6 seemed like a snapshot of that unraveling. Has the news ever before felt so grim? America has more guns than ever, pundits warn about an impending civil war and polls show a growing number of Americans say \"political violence\" is justified. King knew what it was like to live in a country where violence and racial antagonism seemed ineradicable.   Even so, he still declared that the \"arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in Oslo, Norway, on December 10, 1964.  \"I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history,\" he said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech a year after the March on Washington. \"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.\" Those are words that lift the soul. How much will they mean, though, if the US becomes a performative democracy -- a country with the veneer of fair elections but run by White minority rule. If that happens, January 6 -- not January 15 -- will be a truer reflection of what the US stands for. And what King said in 1963 will no longer be a dream. It'll be a mirage.",

        "content": "(CNN)He's been called a \"racist P.O.S.\" and accused of indoctrinating students. He lost the job he loved. The constant attacks have reduced him to tears.Matt Hawn has become a focal point of one of this past year's biggest racial controversies. The former public high school teacher in Tennessee was thrust into the national spotlight after he was fired from his tenured job for the way he taught students about White privilege. Hawn became one of the most prominent casualties in an ongoing debate over how racism and history should be taught to students in the US. His plight has divided people in his conservative, heavily White city near the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. But Hawn's improbable personal journey is as dramatic as the headlines he's provoked.There is nothing in his background that suggests that he'd take such a public stand against racism. Hawn grew up in a White community and says he didn't have a single nonwhite classmate from kindergarten through high school. He says he was surrounded by people who used the N-word, flew Confederate flags and wore T-shirts declaring \"The South Will Rise Again.\" Read MoreSo why did he turn out differently? One way to answer that question is to examine a group of Americans who rarely come up in discussions about race. They are White people who grew up in families and communities where racism was the norm, but they rejected those beliefs early on. They zigged when everyone else around them zagged.These aren't the type of people who made headlines in 2021, when White supremacists waved a Confederate flag at the US Capitol on January 6, racist conspiracy theories entered mainstream politics and new voter suppression laws were enacted across the nation. It's easy to conclude after the events of this past year that human beings are too tribal to see past color, and racism is a \"permanent feature of American life.\" Yet these racial non-conformists show that even the most unlikely people can change. None of them claim they are free of racism. As children some of them absorbed the attitudes they saw in their family or friends. But people like Hawn possessed an innate ability to self-correct when they were young and defy expectations at an age when the pressure to conform is the highest.These outliers appear in history books, in news stories and in public life. Many can't explain why they turned out so different.Hawn, 43, says when he was growing up his family never talked about racism.\"There wasn't anyone to have these conversations with,\" he says. \"It's really hard to talk about racism in the US without someone who experienced it.\"A closer look at people like Hawn reveals at least four traits that they all share.They can imagine being in someone else's shoesDuring the height of the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020, filmmaker Kasi Lemmons wrote a searing essay titled, \"White Americans, your lack of imagination is killing us.\"Lemmons, director of \"Harriet\" and \"Eve's Bayou,\" said pervasive racism exists because many White people cannot imagine what it's like to be Black. They can't imagine what it's like to be murdered by a police officer or to experience the constant vulnerability of dealing with racism every day.\"As a filmmaker, I help people imagine what's it's like to be someone else, to experience things from a character's point of view \u2014 things they never will experience outside the theater,\" she wrote. \"But when it comes to black life in America, there's only one conclusion I can reach about some white people: You don't care to put yourself in our shoes.\"Kasi Lemmons speaks at \"A Celebration of Women in Film\" event on February 8, 2020, in Los Angeles, California. Yet there are some White people who can imagine what it's like to be an outsider -- because they are outsiders themselves.Hawn was diagnosed at age 13 with Type I diabetes. He had to carry his blood-sugar meter everywhere, and insulin  to his baseball games.  He was painfully thin.\"I was very sick for a long time,\" Hawn says. \"My entire seventh-grade year I was sick.\"The illness made him stand out at a young age.Rhonda Hawn, his mother, says she had a friend who gave birth to twin boys with Down syndrome. Her son was one of the few boys in their community who would visit them and take them outside to play baseball.\"Matt has always had an empathy for anyone who is different,\" she says. \"That made him totally different from his peers. \"None of his peers were diabetic. He knew what it was like to be different, not because of his skin color but in other ways.\" They've been transformed by a relationshipMany White progressives say they were transformed by a close relationship or a memorable encounter with a nonwhite person.Charles Black, Jr. was a White man who grew up in Texas during the Jim Crow era, believing that Black people were inferior. Then he met a Black man that changed his life.In 1931, Black went to a hotel in Austin, Texas, to hear jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong play. He knew nothing about jazz, but something shifted in him as he watched a rapturous Armstrong perform.\"He was the first genius I'd ever seen,\" Black recalled in a Yale Review essay. \"It is impossible to underestimate the significance of a 16-year-old Southern boy seeing genius for the first time in a black person. We literally never saw a black man in anything but a servant's capacity.\"Louis opened my eyes wide and put to me a choice: Blacks, the saying went, were 'all right in their place,' but what was the place of such a man, and of the people from which he sprung?\"Black would go on to join a team of lawyers that successfully convinced the US Supreme Court to overturn the segregation of students based on race in the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision.Hawn had a similar experience. He says he began to question what many of his peers believed when he met a Black teenager in an American Legion program designed to promote teenage boys' civic engagement. The teens spent a week together with others in a dormitory. Hawn bonded with his new friend over their love of hip hop music, sports and girls.\"He was the first African-American person I'd ever befriended,\" Hawn says. \"I just remember him being just like me and my friends, somebody I could instantly make a connection with.\"Elizabeth Eckford, one of the \"Little Rock Nine,\" ignores the jeers and stares of fellow students on her first day of class at Little Rock's Central High School in 1957.The transformative power of interracial relationships has been so well documented by social scientists that there's a name for it: \"contact theory.\" That's the term that Gordon Allport, one of the towering figures of psychology in the 20th century, used to describe experiences similar to Hawn's. In one of his most famous studies, Allport conducted surveys of White soldiers who fought alongside Black soldiers during World War II. He discovered that in companies with both Black and White platoons, White soldiers disliked Black people far less than did White soldiers who served in segregated units. But Allport found it was not enough for Whites and non-Whites to simply know one another. Other conditions also had to be met, such as personal interaction, equal status and both groups sharing common goals. Allport's findings, which were replicated with civilians in varying settings, proved that hatred and racism stem from lack of contact, the historian Rutger Bregman wrote in an essay describing Allport's work.\"We generalize wildly about strangers because we don't know them,\" Bregman wrote. \"So the remedy seemed obvious: more contact.\" They have been moved by a story The Rev. Gibson \"Nibs\" Stroupe comes from an even harsher racial environment than Hawn. He grew up in Helena, Arkansas, during the Jim Crow era. Stroupe was a boy when a group of Black students braved jeering White mobs to integrate White public schools in Little Rock. The President of the United States had to summon federal troops to protect them. The Black students were dubbed \"the Little Rock Nine.\"Stroupe cast his sympathies with the mob. He thought Black people were inferior, almost like animals. He couldn't imagine sharing classrooms with them.\"No one ever sat down with me and told me that Black people were inferior,\" he says. \"It was just in the air; you breathed it in.\"Then one day Stroupe opened a book. He was a junior in high school when a teacher handed him a copy of \"Cry, the Beloved Country\" by Alan Paton. The novel is a classic that focuses on a rural Black pastor's search for his missing son against the backdrop of apartheid South Africa.The pastor's search stirred painful feelings for Stroupe. His own father had abandoned him when he was a kid. The pastor's earnestness and kindness touched him. Stroupe wished his father would search for him. Something in him shifted. He began to think of the Black people he made fun of his in his hometown.\"I remember looking up from the book's page and thinking, 'Gosh, they might be like us.\"The Rev. Gibson \"Nibs\" Stroupe grew up in rural Arkansas. He says that as a boy he thought Black people were inferior to Whites.Stroupe, now 75, became a civil rights activist, an award-winning author and one of the nation's most prominent anti-racist speakers. He and his wife, Caroline Leach, became co-pastors of Oakhurst Presbyterian Church in Decatur, Georgia, whose successful efforts to build a vibrant interracial congregation drew national attention and became a model for others.Some stories are so powerful that they can change White people who grew up in even the most racially isolated circumstances. Charissa Johnson was raised in a fundamentalist Christian community in rural Colorado that cut off contact from much of the world. She was home-schooled, and the people she encountered were almost entirely White.  Racism in her town was common, she says. She heard people say that Blacks were lazy and lived off government handouts. Townspeople openly opposed interracial marriages. She occasionally heard them use the N-word.\"If we saw a Black person walking down the street, someone would say, 'Oh be careful. Lock your car doors,' '' she says.But Johnson says she rejected much of this thinking because of her love of reading. She recalled one book in particular. Titled \"Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters: An African Tale,\" it was a lavishly illustrated folktale set in Zimbabwe that centered on a father's attempt to marry one of his two daughters to a king. The book portrays the African girls as beautiful and intelligent and the father as noble and wise.Johnson started reading other African folk tales. Then she read the \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" The girls in the books looked different than her, but she shared many of their dreams and hopes. \"I was curious about the world and about people, and finding connection with those people in the books helped break down a lot of the us-versus-them mentality I learned,\" says Johnson, now 35. The stories inspired her to take a stand when she was in the fourth grade.Charissa Johnson read a book as a child that challenged her beliefs. She was attending a home-school enrichment program with other students when she noticed how a Black girl was being treated. None of the White students would play with the Black girl in their physical education class. Young Charissa approached the girl, introduced herself, and asked if they could be PE partners.\"It didn't just make sense to me,\" she says. \"Nobody ever wanted to partner with her. And so we became friends. We would run together, and she became my buddy. It was a lot of fun.\" They are willing to pay the price  During many of his sermons, Stroupe made an observation that made some White parishioners squirm in their seats.He said he didn't learn racism from unapologetic racists like members of the Ku Klux Klan. Nice White people taught him how to hate.\"I had been taught racism by my family, my church, and my teachers -- by really decent white people in my hometown on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River Delta,\" Stroupe wrote in a 2018 essay in The Atlantic.One of the biggest challenges any White racial non-conformist faces is being expelled by their tribe. It's hard to break from family and friends who see you as an oddity or a traitor.Stroupe had to break with his mother, Mary, who viewed the civil rights movement with suspicion. When he was a teenager, he started to ask her about it to sort through his evolving perspective. \"Don't mess with this, Nibs, and don't fret about it,\" she told him. \"It is not our business.\"He didn't take his mother's advice. After high school, he enrolled in a church program that took him to New York City where he forged friendships with Black people for the first time. He became a civil rights activist. He even dated a Black woman. He decided to go into the ministry.The Rev. Gibson \"Nibs\" Stroupe. \"I learned from my mother and church that God loved me and God loved everybody,\" he says. \"The question was, who is everybody?\"When he returned to Arkansas to bring the good news to the nice White people in his church, many rejected him. Church elders told him that going to the North had corrupted him.\"They said that I had gotten 'Yankified,' '' Stroupe recalls.But Stroupe was willing to jeopardize the relationship with his mother and his community for his beliefs in racial justice. And eventually, his mother became a convert and supported his civil rights activism. Stroupe, the author of five books, is currently working on a memoir about his relationship with his mother.\"I learned from my mother and church that God loved me and God loved everybody,\" he says. \"The question was, who is everybody? Once I could make that connection with Black people being part of everybody, then that was really it.\"Hawn, too, is paying the price for his beliefs.His parents have stood behind him. But some people in his staunchly conservative community denounced him on Facebook, and the lengthy dismissal process, which ended with his firing last May, has worn him down at times. School board members said they didn't fire Hawn because he taught students about White privilege. They said he treated the concept as a fact, and didn't offer students opposing points of view.Hawn's firing came the same month that Tennessee legislators passed a law dictating how public school teachers should talk about race in classrooms. The law was passed as heated debates spread nationwide over critical race theory, the idea that systemic racism is part of American history and institutions, and that racism remains an everyday experience for most people of color.A school official said Hawn's firing had nothing to do with the passage of the law. The school board voted in December to uphold Hawn's firing. He's considering appealing the decision.Hawn says he misses teaching and has financial worries now. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help him.\"What am I going to do for health insurance?\" he says. \"I'm a Type 1 diabetic.\"But he still calls himself an \"anti-racist teacher,\" and says there's a need for people like him in small towns. \"If I didn't teach those lessons, I wouldn't be doing my job,\" he says. \"It's important for teachers to see, in light of these bills and laws, that if you get caught up in all of this (debate over teaching about racism) that there are people out there to support you.\"And if no one does, I will. At least you'll have one.\"History shows that compassion can bloom in the most unlikely placesBut even just one person who refuses to conform can change history. A South African man showed how. Abraham and Constand Viljoen were identical twin brothers and Afrikaners, members of South African's dominant White ethnic group. Both were indoctrinated from birth to defend apartheid, the brutal system that denied Blacks and other people of color equal access to political and economic power. They were taught that Blacks were biologically inferior, and to dread the \"Black danger\" -- a scenario in which armed Blacks would pillage and take over South Africa.Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie salute a cheering crowd upon his release from prison on February 11, 1990.But then their paths diverged. Abraham became a minister, joined the underground resistance to apartheid and became a close ally of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first Black president.  His brother became chief of the South African Defense Force, which crushed Black dissent and, some say, assassinated Black activists. He was apartheid's ultimate enforcer.Afrikaners called Abraham Viljoen a traitor. But he helped save his country from a civil war in 1993 when he brokered a meeting between Mandela and his brother. Constand Viljoen's disdain for Mandela changed after he met the anti-apartheid legend over tea in Mandela's home. When Mandela was inaugurated a year after their meeting, Constand Viljoen saluted him in the halls of Parliament and would later call him \"the greatest of men.\"Abraham Viljoen's example could help us today.  The news is filled with stories about White people acting in blatantly racist ways. Racism can seem like apartheid once did: ineradicable.Yet we are also surrounded by people like Abraham Viljoen. They show us that compassion can bloom in the most unexpected places. And while many people are taught to hate, there are others who seem born with the instinct to question those messages.It's time we started paying more attention to them as well.",

        "content": "(CNN)If the Jazz Police began launching midnight raids against musicians who offended their sensibilities, Kenny G would be at the top of their list.The 65-year-old saxophone player has been called the best-selling instrumentalist of all time, someone whose songs have formed the sonic backdrop of so many weddings, shopping mall and dental office visits that one music critic said he's \"part of the musical furniture of American culture.\"The Jazz Police -- fans and critics who are self-appointed enforcers of jazz purity -- have called Kenny G's music \"safe sax\" and compared it to takeout Chinese food (\"an hour later you're hungry again\"). Jazz guitarist Pat Metheny has dismissed Kenny G's style as \"lame-ass, jive, pseudo bluesy out-of-tune, noodling.\" But a new documentary film by Penny Lane may lead some of Kenny G's critics to reconsider. \"Listening to Kenny G,\" which premiered this week on HBO Max, offers surprising glimpses into the songs and private life of the skinny, White guy who became the face -- and hair -- of smooth jazz. Read MoreThe film suggests that Kenny G, who just released his first album in six years, is not only unappreciated but a groundbreaking artist who pursues perfection and innovation in his own sweet way. The documentary also asks bigger questions outside of music. It explores racial prejudice and the art vs. commerce debate, and offers some lessons on what it takes for someone to be successful in any field.What comes through is that Kenny G probably would have been successful at whatever he chose to do. He is relentless striver -- practicing his sax at least three hours each day -- with a compulsive need to get better at everything, even if it's just baking an apple pie in his opulent kitchen.Many critics have disparaged his musicKenny G's devotion to his craft, though, will probably not impress his critics. His music has been described as bland and soporific -- like an aural hit of Ambien. It has furnished many Internet memes, and shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"South Park\" have made fun of his \"Snooze Jazz.\"Pat Metheny perform in 2018 in Rome, Italy. The jazz guitarist has been critical of Kenny G's music.Some of the funniest scenes in the documentary come when jazz critics are asked to appraise Kenny G's music. Many squirm like toddlers at the dentist, with looks of discomfort across their faces as Kenny G standards like \"Songbird\" play in the background.When Ben Ratliff, a well known jazz and pop music critic, was asked what he thought of Kenny G's music, he struggled to give an assessment. \"I'm sure I heard of a lot of Kenny G's music -- while waiting for something,\" Ratcliff says, referring to the piped-in music he hears in stores or during visits to his bank.Another critic, though, cited Kenny G's massive popularity -- he has sold at least 75 million records -- as a form of defense.\"It can't simply be that millions of people are just stupid and Pat Metheny is the smart one,\" says Jason King, a musician and scholar at New York University. The center of the documentary, though, is Kenny G himself. His canny deflections of his detractors take the film in unexpected directions.Kenny G refrains from labeling his own music. Is it jazz, pop? You tell me, he says. He also dismisses the notion that he deliberately set out to create jazz Muzak that would appeal to the masses.\"These are songs from my heart,\" he says. \"This is just the way I hear it. They [critics] think I just decided to play these songs because I knew they would sell well. If only I was that smart.\"Even so, he created a signature soundBut the film makes clear, as it traces his rise in the musical world, that Kenny G is a lot smarter than people realize.He was born Kenneth Bruce Gorelick in Seattle, Washington, a quiet Jewish kid who was expected to take over his father's plumbing business one day. But young Kenny became enthralled by the silky music of jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., whose hits like \"Just The Two of Us\" heralded the 1980s rise of the smooth jazz genre.Kenny G performs at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival's opening gala at Radio City Music Hall on April 19, 2017 in New York City.Kenny G's high school music teacher recalls him as a shy kid with no girlfriend who was \"super, super smart.\" The teacher tells a funny story about Kenny G stealing the show during one of his first live gigs by holding a prolonged note -- a signature stage move that would be recognizable to any of his fans today.Some of the best scenes show Kenny G's cockiness. He's also an outstanding golfer as well as a pilot and a successful investor. \"That's a hard lick and I just played it really well,\" he says with a self-satisfied smile after an impressive practice run on his soprano sax.The film also does a good job explaining why some jazz critics despise him. Many say his music is not jazz. Jazz, they say, is about improvisation and vigorous interplay between musicians who are testing musical boundaries. Those qualities don't describe Kenny G's music.Fred Armisen, middle, as a Kenny G lookalike on an October 2021 episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\"  But even some of his critics concede that Kenny G created a new type of instrumental music with massive hits like \"Songbird\" and \"Silhouette.\"  What's inarguable is that he has a distinctive sound that's sold millions of records. How many musicians can claim that?\"I don't think a lot of people could say they created a new sound, but I did,\" he says.Some dismiss that sound as \"easy listening,\" but Kenny G seems nonplussed by the label.\"When you hear the words, 'easy listening,' it almost sounds bad,\" he says. \"Well, I don't see anything wrong with something that's easy to listen to.\"His music sparks debate about what is authentic jazzJazz purists criticize Kenny G because they don't think his music reflects any exceptional jazz chops or innovation. They also complain that he's earned so many millions from his music while many jazz musicians who are much more skilled toil in relative obscurity.As the film makes clear, the debate over what constitutes true jazz is as old as jazz itself.Louis Armstrong is widely seen as the greatest jazz musician of all time for his virtuoso trumpet playing and singing. But is \"What a Wonderful World,\" one of his biggest hits, jazz? And if not, does it tarnish his legacy?Jazz singer and trumpeter Louis Armstrong poses for a 1970 portrait in London.Miles Davis, another jazz legend, was accused of selling out when he went electric on his album \"Bitches Brew,\" which helped launch jazz fusion music in the 1970s. Yet no one would claim Davis isn't an authentic jazz artist.Besides, there is another purpose that jazz, and all music, serves.Music offers people an escape, a way to feel good. Some of the most moving passages in the documentary show Kenny G's wide appeal. His fans come in all races, age groups and nationalities (he's huge in China). The film depicts them all blissfully nodding along to his music with the same contented look.The great jazz drummer Art Blakely once said that \"jazz washes away the dust of everyday life.\"Kenny G's music may not fit the classical definition of jazz. And it may put some listeners to sleep.But maybe we shouldn't underestimate a musician who can wash away the dust of everyday life for many listeners who are worn down by living in an increasingly divided world.If we go by that standard, Kenny G just might be a maestro.",

        "content": "This is part of a CNN series, \"The Helpers,\" which showcases people who are going the extra mile to help others. (CNN)Zak Khogyani has seen sights and wonders that would fill you with awe.He's walked through Antelope Canyon in Northern Arizona, surrounded by swirling sandstone formations formed by flash flooding.He's stood on the rugged Cliffs of Moher in Ireland, which rise some 700 feet over the Atlantic Ocean -- a stunning emerald backdrop that's been featured in music videos, a folk song and movies like \"The Princess Bride.\"He's watched sunlight dance off the cobalt blue domes of whitewashed homes carved into a hilltop above the Aegean Sea on the Greek island of Santorini.Khogyani is a United Airlines pilot and a photographer who has spent much of his life snapping scenes that look like postcards from the Garden of Eden. Read MoreBut the image that moved him to tears recently is not something he saw in nature. It's something he stumbled upon while volunteering last summer during a nine-hour flight to the US, on a plane filled with Afghan evacuees.Khogyani was gazing at the anxious and drawn faces of Afghan children sitting with their parents when he realized he was looking at a younger version of himself.\"I was nine years old when I experienced similar circumstances,\" the 53-year-old Khogyani says. \"It all came rushing back. It was harder than I thought.\"He fled Afghanistan with his family as a boyFor the fortunate among us, the holiday season is a time to spend time with friends and family. This year Khogyani's thoughts are turning to some Afghan families he recently met for the first time -- and one he left behind.Khogyani came in contact with these families through his day job. He's been a pilot for United Airlines for 27 years. When the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August, the Pentagon called on the Civil Reserve Air Fleet to help supply commercial planes for the emergency evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies. Khogyani wrote the CEO of United Airlines and volunteered to help. For him, it was personal.He grew up in Afghanistan but fled the country with his family in 1977, when he was nine. Zak Khogyani playing with a camera as a boy in Afghanistan. He came to the US with his parents when he was 9.His grandfather was a judge and a senator, while his father governed three provinces. A shift in the country's political climate led to escalating death threats against his family.Khogyani still remembers the tense car ride to the Kabul airport.He carried one small bag. They brought no family mementos, no photos or extra clothes. He was abruptly yanked from one life into an uncertain future. \"The atmosphere was very heavy,\" Khogyani says. \"Nobody said very much. My mother had not told me that we would leave the country.\"He surprised Afghan evacuees by greeting them in their languageThose memories were on Khogyani's mind when he was given permission in August to join the airlift. He flew to an airbase in Germany to meet the evacuees, who had been flown there from Kabul. Over the next nine days he accompanied 1,000 Afghan passengers on three flights from Europe to the US, serving as an interpreter for the refugees -- and a symbol of a more hopeful future.At first, he surprised the evacuees. He stood at the boarding gate and greeted them in Pashto, their own language.\"Welcome,\" he told them. \"I hope you come joyfully.\"Many Afghans looked at him with surprise, and then confusion. Then relief. They started bombarding him with questions:Where do I go next? Who can I turn to for help? How can I find a job?An air crew prepares to load evacuees aboard a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft at Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 21, 2021, in Kabul, Afghanistan. He tried to help, but he knew there were some questions he could not answer. A big one dealt with the loneliness of leaving family members behind.\"I never saw my grandparents again,\" he says. \"I never saw most of my extended family, and I know they face the same future.\" United Airlines employees had donated diapers, baby wipes, pacifiers and blankets to the Afghan families. The overhead bins were filled with these donations, along with chocolate and toys. Someone taped children's crayon drawings to the inside of the cabin to make the kids feel more comfortable.For Khogyani, that's when the memories started flooding back. His emotions surprised him. Suddenly, he was not an intrepid world traveler but that anxious nine-year-old boy leaving Afghanistan.\"There were a lot of kids on the flight, and every single one in one way or the other reminded me of our own escape,\" he says.He's thrived in America, and he wants to help other immigrants do the sameOne of the US' mottoes is E Pluribus Unum, which is Latin for \"Out of Many, One.\" The motto, adopted in 1776, reflects the belief that the US becomes stronger when it embraces people from all different types of backgrounds and beliefs.Khogyani has tried to honor that motto. He lives in Phoenix, Arizona, with his wife and their twin 14-year-old sons. He's taught his kids about their heritage and Afghan values such as dignity, humility and hospitality. He tells his kids, and anyone who will listen, the same thing about his people:\"You will never meet an Afghan who is willing to give up,\" he says.Zak Khogyani has been a pilot for United Airlines for 27 years.Khogyani is also proud of his adopted home. He says he will donate half of the proceeds he earns from the sale of his photographs this year to charities that benefit refugees.\"The United States is the land of opportunity, \"he says. \"If you are willing to work hard no one is going to stop you from having what you want to achieve.\"It may sound like a platitude, but history backs him up. Immigrants have built the US into one of the most powerful nations in the world.  They work hard at jobs that many others refuse to do, and they don't take for granted many of our freedoms. Immigrants are nearly twice as likely to start businesses as native-born Americans. Companies such as Apple, Google and Amazon were founded by immigrants, or their children.Many Afghan kids are now making the same journey Khogyani made more than 40 years ago. About 50,000 Afghan evacuees remain on eight military bases across the country, but many of the younger Afghans are now being enrolled in public schools in places as diverse as Texas, Virginia and California. Their families are taking the same journey that waves of immigrants did before then. They, like Khogyani, will become Americans.His gift to them: hope Bob Miller, a United Airline pilot and friend, says Khogyani is the \"preeminent example of the American dream.\" Miller is optimistic about the Afghan refugees' futures in the US, in part because of Khogyani's journey.Afghan refugees at an airbase in Madrid, Spain,  board a US aircraft heading to Germany after being evacuated from Kabul on August 24, 2021.  \"It really is the beginning for those Afghan refugees,\" Miller says. \"They came to America with just the clothes on their back, but that's not the end of it.\"   Khogyani says there was one remark that kept coming up during his conversations with Afghans on the flights to America.As the evacuees looked at Khogyani, resplendent in his United Airlines captain's uniform, many kept evoking one word.It was hope.\"A lot of them told me that they were proud of me,\" he says, \"and that I gave them hope that the future will be bright.\"It was something that only Khogyani could give because he had taken their same journey and built a prosperous new lifeHe never gave up. He doesn't think they will either.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Brute. The Buck. And, of course, the Thug.  Those are just some of the names for a racial stereotype that has haunted the collective imagination of White America since the nation's inception. The specter of the angry Black man has been evoked in politics and popular culture to convince White folks that a big, bad Black man is coming to get them and their daughters. I've seen viral videos of innocent Black men losing their lives because of this stereotype. I've watched White people lock their car doors or clutch their purses when men who look like me approach. I've been racially profiled.  It's part of the psychological tax you pay for being a Black man in America -- learning to accept that you are seen by many as Public Enemy No. 1.  Read MoreBut as I've watched three separate trials about White male violence unfold across the US these past few weeks -- the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, the Ahmaud Arbery death trial and the civil case against organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville -- I've come to a sobering conclusion:  There is nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man.   Kyle Rittenhouse carries a rifle in  Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2020, during a night of unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse shot three people, two fatally, that night but was acquitted this week after claiming self-defense.It's not the \"radical Islamic terrorist\" that I fear the most. Nor is it the brown immigrant or the fiery Black Lives Matter protester, or whatever the latest bogeyman is that some politician tells me I should dread.   It's encountering an armed White man in public who has been inspired by the White men on trial in these three cases. Here's what legal experts say helped acquit Kyle RittenhouseThe US' legacy of White male violence  I'm not suggesting we start racially profiling White men. The vast majority of White men are no menace to society. Countless White men swallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year's protests over the murder of George Floyd. Plenty of White men -- like the Rev. James Reeb, a White Unitarian minister -- died for Black people during the civil rights movement.   There is nothing inherently violent about White men, or any human being.  But recent events have convinced me it's time to put another character on trial: A vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they \"can rule and brutalize without consequence.\"  Demonstrators during a protest outside the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. This angry White man has been a major character throughout US history. He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. It's this angry White man -- not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night -- who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America.  That's a sweeping claim. But these trials represent something bigger than questions of individual guilt or innocence. They offer a disturbing vision of the future, and a choice about what kind of country we want to live in.  The facts of the trials are well known to many Americans.  In Wisconsin, a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges in the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during a racial protest last year. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, said he was in Kenosha during the protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake to help protect property. He said he shot the men in self-defense.In Georgia, three White men are accused of chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, last year while he was jogging. The men say they were trying to conduct a lawful citizen's arrest, and the man who shot Arbery says he acted in self-defense.  Defendant Greg McMichael listens  during the trial over Ahmaud Arbery's shooting death on November 8, 2021, in Brunswick, Georgia. And in Virginia, a civil trial is underway to determine if organizers of the \"Unite the Right\" rally intended to incite racial violence. One person was killed and dozens injured there after White supremacists clashed with counter-demonstrators.   Race is an inescapable theme that runs through all the trials. At the center of each are White men who are accused of using unjustified violence, either against an unarmed Black man or during racial protests. In Rittenhouse's case, a jury cleared him of criminal wrongdoing. It's what's happening outside these courtrooms, though, that is most frightening. It suggests these trials are a symptom of a dangerous shift.  Our politics are becoming more menacingIf there was an Exhibit A to describe this shift, it might be an anim\u00e9 video. Earlier this month, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped anim\u00e9 video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword.  The House voted this week to censure Gosar, with virtually no Republicans backing the resolution. Gosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize, and later retweeted a post that contained the video. Congressman Paul Gosar of Arizona takes an elevator on Capitol Hill in Washington on November 17, 2021.Gosar's video wasn't an isolated incident. Violent political rhetoric has been escalating among some members of the Republican Party. And while not all of it is fueled by White men, much of it starts at the top -- with former President Donald Trump. Trump's violent and sexist rhetoric has been well-documented. More White men now identify as Republican, and the gender gap between both major parties is as large as it's ever been in the last two decades.One New York Times columnist, under the headline \"The Angry White Male Caucus,\" said this anger is driven by White men who fear a changing America \"in which the privilege of being a white man isn't what it used to be.\"  The anger also seems to be getting worse. After President Joe Biden signed an infrastructure bill into law this month, some House Republicans who voted for it reported receiving death threats. Election officials and school board members across the country are also reporting escalating threats.  A recent poll revealed that 30% of Republicans believe that violence is justified to save the country. Political violence is not limited to the GOP. A Bernie Sanders supporter who publicly declared his hatred of conservatives shot five people at a Republican baseball practice in 2017. But talking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal -- and seemingly acceptable -- in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:\"When do we get to use the guns? ... How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\" President Donald Trump speaks during a rally on March 4, 2016, at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan.Add to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but, in some cases, seem to embolden vigilantes.  Activists hoped that widely seen videos showing White police officers and White men shooting Black men like Arbery would inspire the courts and state legislatures to revisit laws that made such actions possible.But even after nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, little has changed. A growing number of Americans now want police funding increased. And though Georgia overhauled its citizen's arrest law, a reform bill called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act died in Congress two months ago.    We could see more guns on the streets  The conservative-leaning US Supreme Court now seems poised to make it easier for people to carry guns in public, based on recent oral arguments over a New York gun control law.    The US' civilian population is already the most heavily armed in the world. And our streets could soon become even more violent. \"A significant portion of the gun safety movement's current agenda is likely to come under attack in the coming years,\" Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of \"Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\" recently told Newsweek. \"I think bans on assault weapons and bans on high-capacity magazines are ripe for the new Supreme Court, with its newly invigorated Second Amendment, to strike down.\"  Members of far-right militias rally near Stone Mountain Park in  Georgia on August 15, 2020.The Supreme Court has also recently ruled once again in favor of \"qualified immunity,\" the legal doctrine that shields police officers accused of misconduct. There's been little national movement on reforming \"stand your ground laws,\" some of which allow people who believe they're facing an imminent threat to use lethal force without first trying to escape. At least 25 states have such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislators.  And despite the shocking nature of the Arbery video, there's been little progress on reforming citizen's arrest laws, which allow private citizens to detain or arrest someone they suspect in a crime.  The White men on trial in the Rittenhouse and Arbery cases both said they acted in self-defense. One of the men in the Arbery case testified that the unarmed Black jogger tried to take his gun, and his life was at risk. But consider the potential danger of other White men -- or any person wielding a gun in public -- feeling emboldened to use deadly force against even an unarmed person by evoking the logic in those defenses, said Eric Ruben, a Second Amendment expert.  Judge Bruce Schroeder, left, Kyle Rittenhouse, center, and his attorney Mark Richards watch an evidence video during Rittenhouse's trial  on November 12, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  \"In other words, their own decision to carry a gun became a justification to use it, lest it be wrested away from them,\" Ruben recently told the New York Times.  While prosecutors didn't show that Rittenhouse was angry that night, there is a perception -- fair or not -- that he went to Kenosha for reasons more than simply maintaining public safety. The comedian Trevor Noah reflected this sentiment in a comment that became a meme: \"No one has ever thought, 'Oh, it's my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.\" And finally, there's a growing fear that no one will be severely punished for the January 6 insurrection because most of the rioters were White. The trials of various defendants are winding their way through the courts now. Jacob Chansley, the so-called \"QAnon Shaman,\" was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot.   Jacob Anthony Angeli Chansley, known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" is seen at the Capital riots on January 6, 2021 in Washington. He was recently sentenced to 41 months in prison.  But many believe the punishment will never match the severity of the crime. What if, say, a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election of a Republican president? How do you think conservative lawmakers would react?   We are seeing more threats, more guns and more suspicion that the courts will go easy on White people who employ violence. This is the combustible mix that makes more violence almost inevitable.   Angry White men have damaged democracy  We have enough problems with White male violence as it is. Mass shootings in the US are committed more often by White men than by any other group. Top law enforcement officials now say the nation's biggest domestic terror threat comes from White supremacists. And many of the most indelible news images of recent years include angry, red-faced White men, often armed with guns.  Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as they try to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 in Washington.Consider scenes from the US Capitol riot, which were filled with angry White men wielding crude weapons and pummeling police. Or the snarling faces of young White men holding tiki torches during the 2017 rally in Charlottesville. Or the angry White men who clashed with anti-racist protesters across the US last year.  White male anger has become one of the most potent political forces in contemporary America. That anger helped a White man win the White House. Trump's rise to power is inconceivable without his ability to tap into White male anger and embody it.   Has there ever been an angrier modern president? He is the White male id unleashed.  This White male anger is causing many people -- including other White men -- to look over their shoulder when they go out in public. The two men who were shot and killed by Rittenhouse in Wisconsin were White, as was the man he wounded. Ijeoma Oluo, author of \"Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America,\" wrote that she lives with the constant fear that angry White men will turn violent toward her and \"countless other black people, brown people, disabled people, queer people, trans people, and women of every demographic.\" White male anger could prove to be one of the biggest roadblocks we face in building a successful multiracial democracy.White supremacists chant at counter protesters after marching through the University of Virginia campus with torches in Charlottesville, Virginia, on August 11, 2017.Lee Drutman, a scholar who has studied political violence, recently told the New York Times: \"I have a hard time seeing how we have a peaceful 2024 election after everything that's happened now. I don't see the rhetoric turning down, I don't see the conflicts going away. I really do think it's hard to see how it gets better before it gets worse.\" This isn't hyperbole. It's history. It happened before.  After the Civil War, the US attempted to build the first biracial democracy by incorporating formerly enslaved people into the country's political and economic life. That period, known as Reconstruction, was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials, prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state governments.   In 1898, for example, a mob of primarily White men staged a coup against the city government of Wilmington, North Carolina, which had elected a multiracial coalition of leaders. More than 60 Black people were killed, and Black residents of the city were barred from voting, and from elected office, for decades afterward.   The January 6 insurrection wasn't unprecedented. In many ways it was a sequel. No more lectures about Black 'thugs'  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned the GOP that \"We're not generating enough angry White guys to stay in business for the long term.\"  He was wrong. The angry White guy business is booming. Yet no matter how obvious it becomes that the country has a problem with White male violence, most Americans will escape what Black and brown men experience on a weekly basis. Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as people try to storm the US Capitol on January 6.Not many drivers will lock their doors when White men approach at a stoplight. Few women will clutch their purse when they pass a White man on the street. Someone recently posted a meme about this double standard by evoking the memory of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Black boy who was killed in Cleveland by a police officer who authorities said mistook his toy pistol for a real firearm.  \"Tamir Rice was 12 and killed for having a fake toy gun. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, killed two people. Walked by police after killing two people. Got to go home and sleep.\"  That meme is why it's hard for me for to tolerate hearing another lecture about \"Black thug culture\" or a \"Black culture of violence.\" My response to the White men who use these tired phrases: Look in the mirror. And look at these three trials, because they point to one frightening future. This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by \"stand your ground\" and citizen's arrest laws, inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment.  And more dead Americans.",

        "content": "(CNN)On a rainy spring morning in Muncie, Indiana, a White, middle-aged, conservative woman met a transgender woman for a date.It did not start well. The transgender woman was waiting at a table when the other woman showed up. She stood up and extended her hand. The other woman refused to take it.\"I want you to know I'm a conservative Christian,\" she said, still standing.\"I'm a liberal Christian,\" the transgender woman replied. \"Let's talk.\"Their rendezvous was supposed to last about 30 minutes. But the conversation was so engrossing for both that it lasted an hour. It ended with the conservative woman rising from her seat to give the other woman a hug.Read More\"Thank you,\" she said. \"This has been wonderful.\"This improbable meeting came courtesy of the Human Library, a nonprofit learning platform that allows people to borrow people instead of books. But not just any people. Every \"human book\" from this library represents a group that faces prejudice or stigmas because of their lifestyle, ethnicity, beliefs, or disability. A human book can be an alcoholic, for example, or a Muslim, or a homeless person, or someone who was sexually abused.The Human Library stages in-person and online events where \"difficult questions are expected, appreciated, and answered.\" Organizers says they're trying to encourage people to \"unjudge\" a book by its cover.This setup leads to some of the most unlikely pairings anyone will ever see.A feminist meets with a Muslim woman in a hijab and asks if she wears it by choice or compulsion.A climate change activist meets with someone who thinks global warming is a hoax.A Black antiracist activist meets with a supporter of former President Trump.Or, in the case of Charlize Jamieson, a transgender woman meets a conservative Christian woman who thinks she is living in sin.Charlize Jamieson, a transgender woman, serves as a \"book\" for the Human Library for readers who are curious about transgender issues.Jamieson says she agreed to be a \"book\" in the Human Library because she wants to encourage empathy. An animated and jovial conversationalist, she says she spent years denying who she was while working in corporate America.\"There's rough edges around people, and people form opinions based on what other people say or what the TV news says,\" she says. \"And then you get in front of them, and you're sometimes like a nail file, filing off those rough edges.\" This man founded the library to build bridgesThe Human Library was created 21 years ago by Ronni Abergel, a Danish human rights activist and journalist who became interested in non-violence activism after a friend he describes as a \"troubled youth\" survived a stabbing in Copenhagen. Abergel was born and raised in Denmark but lived in the US as an exchange student and has seen the political climate become increasingly partisan.He wondered if a human library could bring people together like a traditional one. Only in this one, stigmatized or unconventional people would be treated like books -- readers could loan them out, ask them questions, learn something they didn't know and challenge their perceptions.Ronni Abergel founded the Human Library in Denmark in 2000.\"I had a theory that it could work because the library is one of the few places in our community where everyone is welcome, whether you're rich or poor, homeless or living in a castle, professor or illiterate,\" he says. \"It's truly the most inclusive institution in our time.\"Abergel's idea has spread like a bestseller. The Human Library has hosted events in more than 80 countries, in libraries, museums, festivals and schools. It has more than 1,000 human books in circulation in more than 50 languages, with an especially strong presence in American cities such as Chicago and San Francisco, Abergel says.If people check out a book, they won't need a translator. A librarian makes sure to pair readers with someone whose language they can understand. \"If you speak English, we make sure not to put you in a room with French books,\" Abergel says. Abergel believes the library's mission has taken on more urgency in recent years. People across the globe are becoming more divided by social media bubbles, political beliefs and demagogues who cheer on these divisions to gain power.A woman listens to a Satanist explain his beliefs at a Human Library event. How many people, for example, will tiptoe around holiday dinner conversations this year for fear of sparking a political argument with a relative? How many people will boycott holiday gatherings altogether because of who is hosting them?Abergel says there's a need for people to have conversations with others who see the world differently -- minus the verbal combat.\"People want to have safe spaces to connect and maybe diffuse some of the tension in the air,\" he says.How to open a Human Library 'book' The Covid-19 pandemic has also reinforced the importance of the Human Library.Most of its events were traditionally held in person, but organizers have adapted. The virus has driven millions of people indoors, isolated in their homes and fearful of being too close to strangers. So on a recent afternoon, the library offered a virtual session that demonstrated how it can restore some of the human connections frayed by the pandemic.The session opened when a cheerful host appeared on screen and introduced herself as the \"head librarian.\" Nestled in a brightly lit room lined with bookshelves, the librarian told the online audience of 43 \"readers\" that they could ask any question, \"so long as you ask questions with respect.\"The man on the right talks about why he modifies his body at a Human Library conference in London.You will only have 30 minutes with each book, the host said, so make it count. \"Don't waste time asking about the weather,\" she said. \"Make it personal. Go deep quick.\"The screen briefly went blank, and then a broad-shouldered man with a trimmed beard and faded haircut appeared, sitting in what looked like a cozy bedroom. He was identified only as \"Wheelchair User,\" and he began by assuring listeners, \"there is no such thing as a silly question.\"For the next 30 minutes, the others on the call fired questions: What was it like for you to go to school as a kid? How should I offer help to a person with a disability if I see them needing assistance in public? What do you do about sexual intimacy?The man answered them all. He said being a wheelchair user is hard work. Taking a subway to see friends requires up to three hours of planning. Just making sure you're near a bathroom that's designed for a wheelchair user is a huge hassle, he said. \"Disabled people can't be spontaneous,\" he said. \"I just can't go for lunch today.\"Next up was a young woman, identified as \"Eating Disorder.\" She waved her long, slender hands expressively as she explained in wrenching detail how she dropped from 400 pounds to 100 pounds, triggered by an uncle's cruel remark about her weight when she was a girl. \"It reinforced the idea that nothing is more important than being thin,\" the woman said, her voice breaking with emotion.\"And so it went -- person after person, opening the pages to some of the most intimate details of their lives. The session included about eight \"books\" in all, with titles ranging from autism, Black activist, transgender, ethnic minority and Muslim.This man has been homeless and serves as a Human Library \"book\" to answer questions about that issue.The emotional tenor of the conversations created an unexpected sense of closeness. Listeners nodded their heads in agreement or offered smiles of encouragement as the books flipped the pages of their lives. Here was a case of the internet bringing people together, not driving them apart.\"It's been lovely,\" one human book said before signing off. \"Stay safe and well wherever you are in the world.\"The conversations flowed with a professional smoothness, but much of that comes through training. Abergel, the Human Library founder, says books are vetted and trained to engage with others. He says that people who apply to become books but want to engage in political debates or have other agendas aren't accepted.\"We're completely neutral, as neutral as Switzerland,\" he says. \"As long as you're not preaching hate or intolerance, you have potential on our bookshelf.\"The library helped bring together two neighborsThe nonpartisan nature of the Human Library has made it attractive to corporations interested in diversity training. The library has staged \"reading hall\" events where a company's employees meet with books for 30-minute sessions at rotating tables. The library also has provided an internal \"human bookshelf\" for such companies as Microsoft, Heineken and Procter & Gamble. There are now plans to create a Human Library app that would allow a reader to use a smartphone to search for a desired topic and set up a reading.A UK packaging company enlisted the Human Library for a conference for its employees in 2019.One of the library's biggest supporters is Masco, a Michigan-based company that manufactures home improvement and building products. Keith Allman, Masco's CEO, recalls a Human LIbrary conversation he had with a Muslim woman in a hijab, a head covering some Muslim women wear to show modesty in the presence of men outside their immediate family. Allman says he was raised in a \"lily-white, middle class background\" on a farm in Western Michigan, so talking to her expanded his perspective.\"I'm raised Catholic, and I thought that (the hijab) was a control mechanism of men over women,\" he says. \"She had me thinking it's not different than praying a rosary.\"Allman says his company partners with the Human Library because he doesn't think it's enough for companies to have employees from different races, genders and socio-economic backgrounds. Those employees must also feel like they're being listened to, he says. \"The folks on the team don't feel like they belong, or that their team member has their back, or that they can bring their whole self to work,\" he says.A Human Library session hit close to home for one Masco employee. Sue Sabo was talking to a Muslim book when she mentioned that she had a neighbor who was also Muslim, but she never asked her about her faith. Maybe this is a good time to start, the book suggested.A Human Library volunteer, right, discusses his life as a gay man at a recent gathering. So Sabo decided to do just that. She noticed her neighbor had some Islamic iconography on her front porch and asked what it represented. A conversation ensued. It was the first time Sabo had even talked to her neighbor about her faith. More conversations followed.\"Now she says wherever you have a question, please don't hesitate,\" Sabo says. \"I can Google and learn a lot about the Muslim faith, but I can't understand it as much as when I hear it from a person.\"After years of hiding her true self, she's happy to answer questionsThat personal interaction was what Jamieson, the transgender woman, sought when she decided to become a book at the Human Library. Jamieson spent 30 years in retail and IT management, hiding who she was from the world. She had a wife and three children, but she thought she would lose everything if she came out as a woman.That denial led to a dual existence, where she would dress in women's clothes when nobody else was around. Once, she ordered pizza and forgot to change out of her dress when the deliveryman showed up.\"He didn't even blink when I opened the door,\" she says. \"He's probably seen it all.\"When Jamieson finally came out, she says her wife and kids supported her. When her son said, \"I got your back,\" Jamieson says, \"it was like a thousand pounds came off my shoulder.\" She's still married to her wife. And now, after years of hiding, she's become an open book. She's sharing her story with others, who may find their attitudes changed by the simple act of listening. A conversation between someone like Jamieson and a stranger might not seem important. But at a time when our political and cultural divisions have turned so hateful, listening to the story of a person with whom we disagree might be the most radical thing anyone can do.",

        "content": "(CNN)Atlanta has long been called a Black Mecca, but in the 1990s it was also known for something else: The home of some of the country's baddest Black baseball superheroes.Those Braves teams featured a colorful lineup of Black superstars: Fred \"Crime Dog\" McGriff, speedy Otis Nixon, two-way star Deion \"Prime Time\" Sanders and the dimpled chin of David Justice, who was married to actress Halle Berry. The Braves then were part of the heartbeat of Black Atlanta. Hip-hop artists wore their caps, and legions of Black fans, ushers and street vendors mingled with White fans at the team's ballpark in a historic Black neighborhood near downtown.  Outfielder Otis Nixon of the Atlanta Braves in 1999.But when the Rev. Michael Clayton Harris, co-host of the Red & Rev. Sports Show, attended a recent Braves game at Truist Park, he sat in a crowd of overwhelmingly White fans in a predominantly White suburb while a soundtrack of mostly rock and country music played over the sound system.  \"When you go to the game, it has a Trump feel to it with the fan base,\" says Harris, who is a pastor at Acts of Faith Baptist Church in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta. \"It felt weird for the simple fact that I remember when the stands had a lot more Black people, and a lot more were enticed to games because they had more representation.\" Read MoreHarris' experience demonstrates that one of the most fascinating storylines of the 2021 World Series is happening off the field. The Braves aren't just playing the Houston Astros -- they're also battling a perception that the franchise has abandoned the city's Black community. I've lived in Atlanta for 30 years, and I've long heard this talk in barbershops and sports bars. Some Black fans say the team has few, if any, African American players they can relate to. Others believe the team left Atlanta because its suburban White fans felt uncomfortable coming to games downtown, where they were surrounded by Black people.  A pedestrian walks down the street as Turner Field, former home of the Atlanta Braves, stands in the background. The Braves left Turner Field after the 2016 season for a new ballpark in suburban Cobb County. Atlanta, once known as the \"city too busy to hate,\" in recent years has been engulfed by racial turmoil: police shootings of Black men, racial protests and clashes over voting rights. These tensions spilled over into the sports world this year when Major League Baseball pulled the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta to protest new state laws that make it more difficult to vote.  A World Series title usually brings a city together. But I wonder: Will this Braves' championship begin to heal the rift with the city's Black community? Atlanta's racial tensions go beyond sports This question may be surprising because of the Braves' history. The franchise's most famous and beloved player, the late Hank Aaron, was a hero in the Black community. He received racist taunts and death threats when he broke Babe Ruth's home run record in 1974, but the Braves organization embraced Aaron as a symbol of racial reconciliation in his retirement.

The Braves also hired Bill Lucas, the first African American to run the player-personnel department of a Major League Baseball team. But in recent years the city's fan base has become more segregated. The NBA's Atlanta Hawks and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, are seen by many as the \"Black teams,\" while the Braves are increasingly known as the \"White team.\" The Braves seem aware of this rift. When I contacted them this week about the Braves' relationship to the Black community, team officials sent me a 1,600-word, bullet-point response detailing all their efforts to promote racial diversity: being the first MLB team to create a diversity and inclusion department; creating foundations and career days to recruit players and front-office talent from historically Black colleges; and offering an array of community programs to promote baseball in Atlanta's Black neighborhoods, among others. But bullet points can only go so far when the tension between the Braves and some of its city's Black residents goes beyond sports. A vendor sells Braves merchandise during a game at Turner Field on July 29, 2013, in Atlanta.Part of this is a byproduct of the city's tense racial and political climate. Consider any explosive racial issue you can think of -- White flight, voter suppression, racial protests, the killings of Black people on video -- and it has somehow detonated in Georgia in the past few years. A White police officer killed Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, in an Atlanta parking lot last year only weeks after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparking protests and the resignation of Atlanta's police chief. Three White men are now on trial for the killing Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, in February 2020 while he was jogging in a coastal city in south Georgia. And in March, over furious protests by Black voters and Democrats, the Republican-led Georgia legislature passed one of the nation's most racially restrictive voting laws. The Braves 'Tomahawk chop' is getting politicalSports and politics aren't supposed to mix. But Georgia's current Republican governor ignored that adage during the Braves' playoff run this season. After the Braves won the National League pennant, Gov. Brian Kemp criticized MLB's decision to move the All-Star Game while attacking Stacey Abrams, the Black voting rights advocate and a political rival.     A fan holds a sign stating \"the chop is racist\" during the ninth inning in Game One of the 2021 World Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston.Kemp tweeted: \"While Stacey Abrams and the MLB stole the All-Star Game from hardworking Georgians, the Braves earned their trip to the World Series this season and are bringing it home to Georgia. Chop On, and Go @Braves.\" Kemp's \"Chop On\" reference only served to highlight the Braves' problematic \"Tomahawk chop\" symbol and gesture, which some Native American groups and activists say perpetuates \"dehumanizing\" racial stereotypes. Former President Donald Trump injected himself into the controversy Saturday night when he appeared at Game 4 of the World Series and did the Tomahawk chop from his Truist Park suite. Images of a smiling Trump chopping away, flanked by exuberant White fans doing the same, won't help the Braves' relationship with the city's Black community or their White allies.Critics have long demanded that the Braves eliminate the chop and change their team name -- as the former Cleveland Indians did earlier this year -- from one seen by many as a racial slur. Former first lady and president of the United States Melania and Donald Trump do the \"Tomahawk chop\" prior to Game Four of the World Series between the Houston Astros and the Atlanta Braves on Saturday at Truist Park in suburban Atlanta.Some have suggested the Braves change their name to the \"Hammers\" to honor \"Hammerin'\" Hank Aaron's nickname. Last summer the Braves said they were reviewing use of the chop, which is traditionally done by fans at the ballpark to rally the team. But the Braves have so far resisted a name change, saying in a 2020 letter to season ticket holders that \"We will always be the Atlanta Braves\" and citing the team's relationship with regional Native American groups. To some fans, especially after the racial reckoning over George Floyd, this stance seems racially insensitive.  A lesson from the Atlanta Hawks Even Atlanta's sprawling geography contributes to this rift between the Braves and the city's Black community. The city of Atlanta is 51% Black, but many suburbs, in places like Kennesaw and East Cobb County, are predominately White. As someone who has worked in downtown Atlanta for more than 20 years, I've seen a racial divide in the city's fan base.  The crowds for Falcons and Hawks games, in the city's downtown, are filled with Black and brown faces. But the throngs of Braves fans who passed through on their way to Turner Field were noticeably whiter. And some White fans looked palpably nervous as I watched them navigate Black crowds on their way into the Hawks' arena and Falcons' stadium.  The Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic observe the guilty verdicts in the Derek Chauvin trial prior to a game at State Farm Arena on April 20, 2021 in downtown Atlanta.Talking openly about these racial optics is what got a former owner of the Hawks in trouble not too long ago. Bruce Levenson, the former majority owner of the Hawks, sold his interest in the team in 2014 and apologized after emails he sent to other Hawks executives went public. Levenson said crowds at the Hawks' arena were \"70 pct black\" and that they \"scared away the whites.\"  One writer said Levenson's sentiments were not unique in the Atlanta sports world. \"This message that the Hawks owner apologized for delivering\u2014that white fans are more valuable than black ones\u2014is the exact one the Atlanta Braves have been broadcasting for the last several years,\" Robert Weintraub wrote in an essay for Slate. Add these elements together, and a perception has hardened among Black residents that the Braves don't cater to them, says Nubyjas Wilborn, an Atlanta native and sportswriter who covered the Braves from 2016 to 2018. \"There are people who believe that the Braves are for straight Christian White people,\" says Wilborn, who writes for AL.com. The many challenges facing the Braves One of the biggest obstacles the Braves face in erasing that perception is a primary cause for the rift: the team's decision to move to a predominantly White suburb for the 2017 season. Team officials said at the time that they left Turner Field downtown because there wasn't enough parking and reliable mass transit. The Braves now play in Cobb County, near a constellation of primarily White suburbs north of Atlanta. Dansby Swanson of the Atlanta Braves looks on from third base during the first inning against the Milwaukee Brewers in game four of the National League Division Series at Truist Park on October 12, 2021.The move reminded some of a big-league version of \"White flight,\" the historical pattern from the 1960s and 1970s in which White residents fled urban neighborhoods across the country for the suburbs when Blacks moved in. Yet for anyone who knows Atlanta, saying the Braves moved to a conservative, White community is overly simplistic. Cobb County, the Braves' new home, is becoming more racially diverse -- and is now a majority Democratic county. It's also unfair to say the Braves' challenges with race are unique to them. It's true that the Braves' World Series roster includes several Afro-Latino players but just one African American: reserve outfielder Terrance Gore. But few Black athletes are playing Major League Baseball in 2021. The presence of Black players in the majors peaked in 1981 at 18.7%, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. On Opening Day this year it was 7%, the group said. Will Smith of the Atlanta Braves celebrates with Dansby Swanson after closing out the 2-0 win against the Houston Astros in Game Three of the World Series. There are several reasons for this shift. More Black athletes are going into football and basketball because it's less expensive to play and more college scholarships are available. And some Black players say they feel isolated in MLB clubhouses. Harris says the scarcity of African American players on the Braves is part of a bigger issue.  \"What the Braves are dealing with is not just an Atlanta problem -- it's a major league problem,\" he says. What this Braves title could do for the city Winning, it's been said, cures everything. A Braves World Series title may not heal all wounds with Atlanta's Black community, but it may help the team recapture some fan loyalty from an earlier era. \"Sports is the great melting pot,\" says Gerald A. Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP and a self-described Braves fan \"since I could walk.\" \"When you have the opportunity to talk about something other than the things that divide us, it's a great opportunity. African American fans like winners. If they win a championship, I think a large majority of the metro Atlanta area, which is diverse, will start to come together and support the team.\" The Atlanta Braves celebrate after winning Game 6 of baseball's National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers on October 23 in Atlanta. Where the Braves hold their victory parade could also be key. When the team last won a championship in 1995, they celebrated with a parade in downtown Atlanta. I was a bystander. The crowd looked like a mini rainbow coalition as Black, White and brown fans lined up to cheer the players. If the team holds a victory parade downtown this year instead of in Cobb County, it could send a signal to Black Atlanta that the Braves haven't forgotten them, says Harris, the sports talk-show host. \"Sports definitely can be used as a healing agent,\" he says. \"It would show a lot of character for the Braves to go and connect with the Black community, especially when they're on top.\" If that happens, this World Series may be memorable for something other than an athletic triumph. The Braves would no longer be such a symbol of the city and state's racial divisions. They would become part of the solution. That kind of victory won't be as dramatic as a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. But in a city and a region in desperate need of racial healing, it would still be a grand slam.",

        "content": "(CNN)Dave Chappelle's latest Netflix special may have attracted a barrage of criticism from the LGBTQ community, but there is another group that he has offended that no one mentions:The long list of iconic Black comics who affirmed gender nonconforming people or were members of the LGBTQ community themselves. Richard Pryor was bisexual and raised money for a gay rights organization. \"Moms Mabley,' who was the first Black female standup comic to go mainstream, was a lesbian. Cross-dressing Black men have created some of the enduring comic characters in Black comic history, from comedian's Flip Wilson's sassy \"The Devil Made Me Do it\" character of \"Geraldine\" to Tyler Perry's \"Madea.\"Read MoreBlack comics have indeed peddled their fair share of harmful stereotypes about LGBTQ people. Eddie Murphy, for example, unleashed a blistering series of homophobic slurs in his early standup routines -- performances for which he's since apologized.Before there was Tyler Perry's Madea, there was comedian Flip Wilson's \"Geraldine.\" Wilson's character was a gender bending star of his popular television variety show.But the stage has been one of those few places in the Black community where LGBTQ members had some measure of freedom to be themselves -- or to escape the cruelty they faced in the outside world. Chappelle has taken some of that space away.\"There's a long tradition of trans and non-gender conforming performers in our history, from the Harlem Renaissance throughout our performing history,'' says Marlon M. Bailey, author of \"Butch Queens Up in Pumps: Gender, Performance, and Ballroom Culture in Detroit.\"This is what gets lost in the controversy over Chappelle's comments in his latest standup film, \"The Closer.\" Much of the attention has focused on the content of his jokes. Chappelle joked about trans women's genitalia and told a story about beating up a lesbian woman. And then there's the fallout. Netflix employees and supporters demonstrated Wednesday to protest the streaming company's reaction to complaints. GLAAD, the LGBTQ media advocacy organization, also condemned Chappelle's comments in \"The Closer.\"It's easy, though, to forget with all the focus on Chappelle that there were Black comedians who took big risks to affirm LGBTQ people,  and to be honest about their own sexuality.Richard Pryor and Moms MableyConsider the story of Richard Pryor, arguably the greatest standup comic ever. Richard Pryor was open about his bisexuality to friends. At one notorious public performance, he opened up to an audience about his attraction to men.There is a generation of moviegoers who only know him through the insipid Hollywood movies he starred in like \"The Toy.\" But Pryor was a different performer on the comic standup stage: fearless, unpredictable, profane. And honest about his bisexuality.In 1977, Pryor headlined a gay rights fundraiser where he talked on stage about enjoying sex with a man. Pryor's bisexuality was well-known among his friends, though some who were close to him still deny that he was gay.\"With that confession, Pryor became perhaps the first major Hollywood celebrity to talk graphically about his own positive experience of gay sex -- and certainly the first to do so in front of tens of thousands of people,' according to an excerpt from the book, \"Becoming Richard Pryor\" by Scott Saul.Moms Mabley, another Black comic great, was so open about her sexual identity that she was known as \"Mr. Moms\" off the stage, some say.Other Black performers like entertainer and actress, Josephine Baker, who was dubbed a \"radical bisexual performer and activist, and Ma Rainey, the blues singer dubbed the \"Mother of the Blues,\" upended gender tropes. Jackie Moms Mabley was a comic pioneer onstage and an open lesbian offstage. Friends say she didn't try to hide her idenity.Rainey sang openly about lesbian relationships and cross-dressing in the early 20th century when homosexuality was seen as a form of mental illness. In her 1928 song, \"Prove it on Me Blues,\" she sang:\"I went out last night with a crowd of my friends,It must've been women, 'cause I don't like no men.Wear my clothes just like a fan,Talk to the gals just like any old man.\"From Geraldine' to RuPaulChappelle may have problems with trans women, but Black audiences have traditionally embraced Black male comics who create gender bending characters in dresses.And so do many contemporary Black male comics. It's almost a rite of passage for a Black male comic to create a female persona or stage character. The entertainer and author Tyler Perry built his entertainment empire on the ample bosom of \"Madea,\" the down-home, wise-cracking Black matriarch. RuPaul has a huge following. Comedians as diverse as Martin Lawrence (\"Big Momma's House\"), and Marlon and Shawn Wayans (\"White Chicks\") have put on dresses for some of their most popular movies. There is, of course, a debate to be had about Black men impersonating women or portraying LGBTQ characters on stage and in film. Some of these depictions may have reinforced stereotypes or been in poor taste. But none of them have the gratuitous cruelty toward LGBTQ people that Chappelle brings to his Netflix specials.As one critic asked, \"What is Dave Chappelle's problem with gay people?Timing, it's been said, is everything in comedy, and the timing for \"The Closer\" is awful. Chappelle's comments come during a year in which at least 33 states have introduced bills to curb the rights of transgender people -- and while a record-high number of transgender people, most of them trans women of color, have been murdered.\"Right now, the trans community is under siege, particularly the trans community of color,\" says Bailey, who is also a professor in the African and African American Studies department at Arizona State University. \"Performers should take that into account.\"Chappelle should take something else in account. From one perspective, his latest special is a success. It's generated headlines, viewers and added millions for his personal fortune. He can tell himself that all great comedians spark outrage. It's part of their job description. It's how they get people to think. It's one of the reasons that Chappelle, who is a student of comic history, received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.Tyler Perry has built his entertainment empire on \"Madea,\" a stern, wise-cracking matriarch who proves that Black audiences don't object to Black male comics dressed as women, if they're funny.But ambitious comedians also face another unseen audience -- the great ones that inspired them, some of whom are still alive. They face this audience during each performance. They must contend with and borrow from the masters before developing their own voice. Chappelle says he was inspired by Pryor. Pryor was inspired by Lenny Bruce. The Black comic duo of Key & Peele (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) were inspired by everyone from Abbott and Costello to Steve Martin.Chappelle's betrayal of the Black comic traditionChappelle turned his back on this audience by doing something they never did -- making a career of going after a group that's even more reviled than Black people.The great comics that Chappelle says inspired him didn't make that mistake. \"Forefathers like Bruce and Pryor reveled in infiltrating the mainstream with beliefs so progressive about sex, race, and culture as to be dangerous,\" the commentator Charles Bramesco declared in a 2019 article where Chappelle, yet again, offended the LGBTQ community with comments about what he calls \"the alphabet people.\"\"Chappelle would rather retreat into his niche as an old crank, where all is expected and safe,\" Bramesco says.Chappelle's beef with the LBGQT community dishonors the memory of all those Black comic greats who made his career -- and millions -- possible.They created a safe space on the comic stage for people who didn't fit the traditional gender norms. Black comics like Pryor weren't perfect when it came to their sexual politics (Pryor ended his gay rights fundraiser by going after White gay people and telling the crowd to, \"kiss my happy, rich Black ass.\"But they did prove that a Black comic could be edgy and brilliant without beating up on another stigmatized group to be considered great.",

        "content": "(CNN)Jon Gruden's resignation as head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders is a prime example of what marketing strategists call \"going off brand.\"Gruden resigned earlier this week after reports surfaced that he used racist, homophobic and misogynistic language in emails sent years ago while he worked as an ESPN analyst.He reportedly belittled the intelligence of the president of the NFL players' union, who is Black, while saying he \"has lips the size of michellin [sic] tires.\" He also reportedly called NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a \"pssy\" and a \"fggot,\" among other offensive comments.Gruden has apologized, saying \"I had no racial intentions with those remarks at all.\"But there is a bitter irony behind the coach of the Raiders becoming the focal point of a controversy over racism and intolerance in pro football.Read MoreThe Raiders' identity is built on being the most racially progressive and inclusive team in the NFL. The \"Silver & Black\" has always been, as one commentator said, about \"the full rainbow.\"The Raiders have broken one barrier after anotherThe Raiders, who were based in Oakland and Los Angeles before relocating to Las Vegas in 2020, were practicing diversity and inclusion before those terms became commonly used.They were the first team in the modern NFL to hire a Black head coach: Art Shell, in 1989.They were the first NFL team to hire a Latino head coach: Tom Flores, in 1979.They were the first team to hire a woman as chief executive: Amy Trask, in 1997.And they broke ground on the field as well as off.Art Shell is announced as the Oakland Raiders' new head coach at a NFL press conference led by Raiders owner Al Davis on October 3, 1989.They were the first team to start a Latino quarterback -- also Tom Flores.Jim Plunkett, a Mexican-American, led the Raiders to two NFL titles in the 1980s, becoming the first minority quarterback to win the Super Bowl. He remains the only Latino to be named Super Bowl MVP.And Carl Nassib, a Raiders defensive end, earlier this year became the first active player in league history to announce he is gay.Gruden's emails weren't just embarrassing. They dishonored the legacy of the franchise that he inherited as head coach.Their franchise has working-class roots Gruden also insulted Raiders fans, otherwise known as Raider Nation. There is no NFL fan base quite like them. In the hyper-masculine world of the NFL, there may be some who weren't offended by Gruden's comments. But the Raiders have traditionally been embraced by those who see themselves as outsiders. Raider fans have included everyone from Black Panther co-founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale to gangsta rappers such as Ice Cube to a devoted army of Mexican-American supporters. Rapper-actor Ice Cube greets Oakland Raiders fans before a game on September 14, 2009, at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.Much of the team's identity was formed in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was based in Oakland. It's impossible to disentangle the Raiders' reputation from its ties to this working-class city, says Peter Richmond, author of \"Badasses: The Legend of Snake, Foo, Dr. Death, and John Madden's Oakland Raiders.\"If the Dallas Cowboys were known as \"America's team,\" the Raiders were \"America's badasses\" -- a collection of misfits and renegades who wouldn't fit on other NFL teams that emphasized conformity and militaristic discipline.\"From the very beginning, as the also-ran team in the Bay Area, representing an industrial multiracial town lying a couple of bridges away form a gentrified cultural capital, the Raiders appealed to underclasses,\" Richmond said in an interview with The New Yorker. \"In the seventies, when the team was half African-American, the stands in the Coliseum were equally black and white, and the tailgating parties the players joined in on after every game in the parking lots were always multiracial.\"And there was no other NFL owner quite like the late Al Davis, who gave the franchise its swashbuckling identity. Davis was a civil rights pioneer on the gridiron. A colorful character who sported sunglasses and slicked-back hair, Davis in the 1960s refused to allow his team to play in cities where Whites and black players were required to stay in separate hotels. Head Coach Tom Flores of the Los Angeles Raiders is carried off the field by his players after they defeated the Washington Redskins 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII  in 1984.He also recruited some of the Raiders' best-known players from historically Black colleges and universities at a time when most NFL teams ignored those schools.Some pointed to Davis' upbringing to explain why he championed being inclusive when it wasn't popular.  As a teenager in New York City, he watched Jackie Robinson endure racist taunts as the first Black major league player with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.\"He grew up in New York, he was Jewish, and obviously there was tension with ethnicity,\" his son Mark Davis, the current Raiders' owner, once said. \"He always knew about how different cultures are affected by other people's antagonism. He felt it as well.\"Gruden's downfall is part of a bigger NFL problem The norm-busting culture that Davis built for the Raiders franchise seems increasingly out of step with the modern corporate NFL, which has become a multibillion-dollar business.The US is rapidly diversifying, but the NFL is still run overwhelmingly by White men. Earlier this year, USA Today reported that of the 327 full-time coaches and general managers hired in the NFL since 1990, only 40 were Black and brown. The NFL has increasingly become identified with politically conservative White values. One report found that NFL owners' campaign donations in the 2020 election cycle went nearly 9-1 to Republicans, including former President Trump. Many of these NFL owners are out of step with the racial activism embraced by a new generation of players. After Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem before a game in 2016 to protest racial injustice, sparking similar protests by other NFL players, the league instated a policy prohibiting players from protesting on the field during the anthem. The NFL said any player who didn't comply would be subject to punishment.Colin Kaepernick, center, and two other members of the San Francisco 49ers kneel during the national anthem prior to a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on October 23, 2016, in Santa Clara, California. The NFL is now filled with players who grew up in an era of Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd video. About 70% of the NFL's players are Black. The optics of a coaching fraternity made up of virtually all White men like Gruden bossing mostly Black and brown men around seems more anachronistic with each passing day.The contemporary sports world has changed as well. With the help of social media, more players in the NFL, NBA and other professional sports now speak out on hot-button issues and exercise more financial control over their careers. These two cultures within the modern NFL -- majority-White owners versus majority-Black-and-brown players -- are on a collision course. Gruden's resignation won't erase that tension. It will manifest itself in other ways.Gruden's resignation also won't erase another bitter irony.Al Davis and the Raiders were ahead of their time in the 1970s when they ignored the racial and gender stereotypes that had held the NFL back for years when it was a segregated league. The comments attributed to Gruden suggest, though, that racism, sexism and homophobia still moves the chains in NFL circles. So do the numbers when you look at who runs the league.It took a Raiders coach, of all people, to remind us that 40 years after the badass Raiders ruled pro football, the egalitarian spirit that's central to the team's mystique is still a rarity in the NFL.",

        "content": "(CNN)At first, Clint Smith had trouble making out the objects beside a white picket fence in the distance. Then he drew closer; what he saw made him shudder. Planted in a garden bed in front of the fence were the heads of 55 Black men impaled on metal rods, their eyes shut and jaws clenched in anguish. Smith, a journalist and a poet, was visiting the Whitney Plantation in Louisiana as part of his quest to understand the impact of slavery in America. He had spent four years touring monuments and landmarks commemorating slavery across America and in Africa, but his stop at the Whitney, in his home state, stood out. Author Clint Smith: \"America has a lot of accounting to do for what it has done to different groups of people.\"There he encountered no mint juleps or \"Gone with the Wind\" nostalgia about slavery. Instead, the plantation displayed statuettes of impoverished, emaciated Black children. Oral histories included an account from an enslaved woman who recalled how her master would come at night to rape her sister and \"den have de nerve to come round de next day and ask her how she feel.\" The plantation's harrowing centerpiece, though, was what made Smith stop in his tracks. The severed heads were ceramic sculptures -- a memorial to the largest slave rebellion in US history. In 1811 some 500 slaves, led by a mixed-race slave driver named Charles Deslondes, marched through Louisiana in military formation before federal troops captured them. Their leaders were tortured and beheaded, with their heads posted on stakes as a warning to other slaves.This memorial by Woodrow Nash at the Whitney Plantation commemorates an 1811 slave uprising after which its leaders were beheaded.Read MoreThe scene is one of many searing moments Smith captures in his New York Times bestseller, \"How the Word is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America.\" There is no other book on slavery quite like it. Smith explores slavery's impact on the present as much as on the past.  He takes readers to places such as modern-day New York City on Wall Street, where the country's second-largest slave market once stood on Wall Street, to show how the story of slavery is still being debated, distorted and denied. Smith also visits such landmarks as Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation in Virginia and Goree Island in Senegal, a notorious slave-trading center.

When I see that at the Whitney, I think of all those sacrifices.\"CNN talked to Smith recently about his book and how slavery still informs today's America. The conversation was edited for brevity and clarity.How do you respond to people who say, 'Why should I care about slavery? It happened centuries ago. I didn't own any slaves, and neither did my ancestors. Why are you trying to make me feel guilty for something I didn't do?'Part of what is important is understanding how this story we tell ourselves wasn't that long ago at all. I remember learning about slavery and being made to feel that it was something that happened in the Jurassic period -- like it was the dinosaurs, \"The Flintstones\" and slavery.I always think now about the woman who opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016 alongside the Obama family, who rang the bell. She was the daughter of an enslaved person -- not the granddaughter or the great-granddaughter. She was the daughter of someone born into intergenerational, chattel slavery. A portrait of Civil War-era fugitive slaves who were emancipated upon reaching the North in the mid-1860s. My grandfather's grandfather was enslaved. So when my grandfather was sitting on his grandfather's lap I'm reminded that in the scope of human history, this was just yesterday.The idea that an institution that existed for 250 years and has only not existed for a little over 150 years. An institution in which there are people who are alive today who were loved, raised by, and in community with people born into chattel slavery. The idea that that would have nothing to do with what the contemporary landscape of inequality looks like today is morally and intellectually disingenuous.When people talk about what makes America exceptional, what made us so economically powerful, they often talk about American ingenuity, can-do spirit, and people like John D. Rockefeller. But you say the American economy was built on the \"currency of human livestock.\" How was slavery crucial to the way this country's economy grew? One of the most telling examples of the relationship between slavery and the economy is that in 1860, four million Black people were enslaved. Black people were worth more than every bank, factory, and railroad combined. The four million Black people were worth more than all the manufacturing in this country before the Civil War began. A poster advertising a slave sale in 1863 in Frankfort, Kentucky.Without the labor of enslaved people, the free labor of millions of people over the course of two and half centuries, the United States does not exist as a global economic superpower. It's that simple. We cannot disentangle our rise to global economic superiority from the fact that millions of people worked for free for more than two centuries.That had an impact not only on the Southern economy but the Northern economy. Capital and resources were what allowed the slaveocracy of the South to continue to flourish. There was an investment across the country in the perpetuation of slavery. It's why in 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, the mayor of New York City would propose that New York City secede from the Union alongside the Southern states because the economic and political infrastructure of New York City was deeply invested in slavery.If we did come to terms with the impact of slavery, how do you think this country would be different?We would recognize that the reasons why America's economic, social and political dynamics exist in the way they do are not by accident. It is very much a result of this history, whose legacy still shapes everything we see today. It would give a sense of why racial inequality looks the way it does today. A statue at Goree Island in Senegal, known for being a center of the Atlantic slave trade from the 15th to the 19th century. The site is now a museum.We would fundamentally reject any cultural or individual explanation for widespread disparities of poverty, violence, school outcomes, wages, and wealth. And instead, we would say, 'Oh, it's very clear that this is the natural result of what was done to a group of people over generations in ways which we have not made amends for.' Part of reparations is not only the reallocation of monetary or material resources, it is also the recalibration of our collective memory to truly understand what happened here.Do you support reparations for African Americans?Absolutely.What would you tell people who say if we do offer reparations to descendants of slaves, Native Americans can say, 'What about us?' Where does this stop?I would say that Native Americans should get reparations. The sort of slippery slope argument is not convincing to me. I believe that Black people should have reparations for the historical wrongdoings that Black people have been subjected to. I believe that indigenous communities should have reparations for what they've been subjected to. Those things aren't mutually exclusive. I don't think this idea that if you give it to one group of people, you're going to end up giving to a whole bunch of people is convincing or epically inconsistent. America has a lot of accounting to do for what it has done to different groups of people.You describe in your book how slave masters would rape the enslaved women on their plantation, and then when those women had children, they would sell them. They were, in effect, selling their own children off into slavery. What was the psychological impact on men who did that?We see this most famously through Thomas Jefferson. People had ways of justifying it to themselves. People find ways of doing evil things and convincing themselves that they aren't evil and aren't as bad as other people. It becomes this exercise in moral relativity where Jefferson can write in one document that all men are created equal and write in another that Black people are likely inferior to Whites in both body and mind -- where he can write one of the most important documents in the history of the Western world and also enslave over 600 people, his own children. Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, third president of the US, whose legacy is complicated by his ownership of hundreds of slaves.And that he can carry on a relationship, to the extent it can be called a relationship, with Sally Hemings for over 40 years and believe it to be consensual when it is impossible for there to be any semblance of consent when she is his human property. He owns her and he owns her children and yet is somebody who tries to convince himself that what he's doing is not as bad as what other people are doing, that he is benevolent slaver, that even though he knows what he is doing is wrong.Slaves did more than just survive. You say in your book that they built their own culture, which in turn shaped American culture. How did they do that?Anti-Black racism manifested through slavery is one of the worst things this country has ever done, alongside Native American genocide. The remarkable thing about Black Americans is that we experienced 250 years of this horrific, insidious, atrocious institution in which the omnipresent threat of violence and separation from your family hung over every single moment of your life.Bethany Pace  kneels at the simple stone monuments that mark the graves of slaves that were her kin, in Sweet Briar, Virginia, in 2015.\nIn spite of that, Black people created the music, the food, the culture that has shaped not only American society but global society. Out of this racism, out of this experience of being inundated with White supremacist violence, Black people were able to create something that would go on to define and create music and art and language and literature that would shape how America exists and understand itself. The blues and jazz and hip-hop, and the visual arts of the Harlem Renaissance, and literature from people like Frederick Douglass and Zora Neale Hurston to Alice Walker, those are shaped by a legacy of trauma. Black people have taken that trauma and regularly turned it into art. Are you okay with people using the word \"plantation,\" or would you prefer another term?Plantation is fine, as long as we're clear what they were. They were intergenerational sites of torture and exploitation. Your book depicts your meetings with people who deny this history. How do you not lose hope for the future of this country when you've met so many White people who are in denial about slavery's impact?My orientation for this book was one of curiosity. I just wanted to understand how people understood and made sense of and situated themselves in American history. A genuine curiosity was the governing force behind this book. There were certainly moments when I did feel angry. I don't operate under any pretense of objectivity. I'm deeply invested in the subject matter of this book, which is why I spent four years writing it. Crews remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee on September 8, 2021, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia. When I'm at the Blandford Cemetery and spending time with the Sons of Confederate Veterans, it's not that I'm not having an emotional response to what they're saying. But if I allow that visceral response to manifest itself in the form of anger, then it's going to become an antagonistic interaction rather than one that is more open.I knew that if I wanted people to tell their truth, I had to listen, and I had to be open to things I disagree with and things I profoundly disagree with. In terms of hope, so many activists and writers that came before me say that hope is a discipline. Hope isn't passive. Hope demands active and proactive work. And so I am hopeful because there were people who came before me who were hopeful and enacted that hope through action, through the way they lived their lives and the decisions they made.",

        "content": "(CNN)Critics often describe the wave of voter restriction laws sweeping the nation as a new version of Jim Crow, the 19th century minstrel figure whose stage name became the symbol of a brutal era of Black oppression. But if you want to understand how these new voter restriction laws also oppress White people, it's more useful to invoke another cultural figure: Wile E. Coyote. Wile E. Coyote is the Looney Tunes cartoon character whose obsessive quest to catch the Road Runner always backfires. Though he employs an array of outlandish gadgets such as jet-powered roller skates, the coyote's schemes to capture his prey inevitably ends up injuring him instead.This comparison is not designed to make light of voter suppression, which is an alarming attack on our democracy. It's to make a point that doesn't get emphasized enough as Democrats approach a crucial stretch in their efforts to pass a new voting rights bill: White people -- not just people of color -- have been some of the biggest victims of voter suppression tactics.  The Republican Party's crusade to make voting more difficult isn't just morally wrong. It's folly. By obsessively chasing the phantom of widespread voter fraud, they are actually hurting their own base of White voters. Read MoreSo far this year, at least 18 states have passed laws that make it more difficult to vote. All but one are led by GOP-controlled legislatures. Some of the more obvious boomerang effects of these laws have already been noted. Voter restrictions anger and mobilize voters of color. They make it more difficult for older, rural White citizens to vote. And they discourage some White voters from even participating in elections.  Even some GOP leaders are now warning that restrictive voting laws are hurting their base.  One commentator went further, saying Republicans are \"inadvertently suppressing their own voters.\"   Read more from John Blake:Conservatives actually love critical race theory -- when they turn the subject to 'oppressed White people'White supremacy, with a tanThey lost their loved ones to Covid. Then they heard from them againDemocrats are on the verge of repeating a voting rights blunder that led to the rise of Jim CrowTwo enemies discover a 'higher call' in battleA war hero who was a stranger in his own landHow 'good White people' derail racial progress That's the conclusion Joel Mathis came to after examining the results of the recent recall election in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom decisively thwarted the GOP-led effort to remove him from office. Initial signs suggested Republicans were energized after conservative talk show host Larry Elder entered the race, but almost every major demographic group in the state rejected the recall.The effort to replace Newsom failed, in part, because Elder and other GOP leaders discouraged many of their own supporters from voting by alleging voter fraud in the lead-up to the election, Mathis said in a column in The Week. This was the same dynamic that led to Democrats winning Georgia and control of Congress in the last presidential election, Mathis noted. \"We now have a likely answer to the question of what will happen if Republicans keep manufacturing charges of 'voter fraud' every time they lose an election: Fewer Republican voters will go to the polls,\" Mathis said. But there are other, less apparent reasons why voter suppression tactics not only harm White people but can literally cost them their lives.   They cause more people to 'die of Whiteness' Take, for example, recent comments by Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, which has the highest death rate for Covid-19 deaths in the US and one of the worst vaccination rates in the country.  Reeves says every Covid death breaks his heart but told CNN he still opposes President Joe Biden's vaccine mandates because they are \"tyrannical.\" The fact that Mississippi has some of the nation's most restrictive voting laws and an overall health system that's ranked dead last in the nation may seem unrelated. But some say they're not, because restrictive voting laws lead to voters electing less competent political leaders who don't respond to the needs of all their constituents.   A worker secures a railing on a state-run mobile field hospital at the Mississippi State Fair Grounds on March 19, 2020, in Jackson. That's what Alex Keena, a political scientist, discovered while researching a book he co-authored, \"Gerrymandering the States: Partisanship, Race, and the Transformation of American Federalism.\" Keena says members of Congress who get elected to office in part because of restrictive election laws or partisan gerrymandering often focus on cultural wedge issues or conspiracy theories because they're in safe voting districts where they don't have to address a diverse constituency. \"It leads to legislators who are good at getting elected and raising money, but they don't know a lot about government,\" says Keena, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. This inability to govern can have lethal consequences. Keena says. States that enacted partisan gerrymandering -- redrawing congressional districts to favor the Republican party and deprive Black people of voting power -- tended to have higher infant mortality rates, Keena says. They also were more likely to challenge the Affordable Care Act in courts and were generally less responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 than Republican-controlled states that didn't gerrymander, he found.  There is a phrase that describes what happens to some White voters in states like Mississippi. It's called \"Dying of Whiteness\" -- the name of a 2019 book by Jonathan M. Metzl that describes a political dynamic where racial, \"backlash governance\" leads to White voters picking political leaders who enact policies that tend to make them sicker, poorer and more likely to die early by gun suicide. This same dynamic is partly why most of the counties in the US with the fewest fully vaccinated people are in Southern states led by GOP governors. \"When state governments rig the voting rules to suppress the voting power of their opponents, there are measurable decreases in public health and policy outcomes that affect everyone,\" Keena says.  They alienate young White voters Republican leaders who seek to restrict voting rights also hurt themselves by turning off young White voters who could make the difference for them in future elections.  Some GOP leaders make an effort to appeal to young voters, but their party's voter restriction laws send another message: We don't want you to vote. This message hurts young White voters by breeding political cynicism and apathy, says Mary A. Evins, coordinator for the American Democracy Project, a program that encourages civic engagement among youth. She says \"the big chunk\" of White voters impacted by voter restriction laws are the youngest voters. Many students already offer all sorts of excuses for not voting: They're too busy with their classes and they believe their vote doesn't count. Voting is an acquired habit that needs to be taught and practiced to take root, Evins says. Students at Phoenix College gather to fill out voter registration forms on September 24, 2019, in Phoenix, Arizona.  The best way to ensure that students turn into good citizens who vote in every election is through steps such as placing polling places on every college campus -- something discouraged by many new, restrictive voting laws, she says. \"Make voting easy and accessible to first-time voters, \"says Evins, a history professor at Middle Tennessee State University. \"And that is precisely what the voter suppression laws expressly opt not to do,\" she says. \"Instead they limit opportunities, narrow locations and choices.\" The Democrats' voting overhaul bill would address many of Evins' concerns. The new bill would make Election Day a public holiday, make it easier to register to vote, ensure states have early voting for federal elections and allow all voters to request mail-in ballots. They suppress the political power of middle-class White peopleVoter suppression hurts White people in another, more insidious way.  It silences their voice in the political process. A famous 2015 study concluded that the US is not a democracy but an oligarchy where the elites, not ordinary voters, determine public policy. That study validated a belief among many lower- and middle-class White voters that politicians listen to wealthy donors but not to them. Voter suppression laws make it easier for political leaders to do just that -- favor wealthy people over others, says Lindsey Cormack, an expert on voter suppression and elections at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. A poll tax sign in Mineola, Texas, 1939. Poll taxes were designed partly to keep lower-income people of color from voting. She says that when lawmakers erect additional hoops for Black or brown voters to jump through, they are also making it harder for poor and middle-class White voters to be heard. That's because those White voters also get less access to the political system and are less likely to contribute to political campaigns. Voter suppression laws \"enshrine inequalities\" by transforming politics into a pay-to-play system where politicians tune out ordinary voters, she says. \"Voter suppression laws that make it harder for any poor and middle-class people to vote make it so that members of Congress have less of a reason to listen to the wants of people who are less likely to be able to turn out and vote,\" Cormack says.   They unravel the progress that remade America Finally, there is a bigger reason why voter suppression laws could hurt Whites even more in the future. They could weaken the US economy and damage the country's standing in the world. History tells us this. The first wave of voter suppression laws that targeted Blacks in the South during the late 19th and early 20th century also hurt poor White voters and the Southern economy. The South become an economic backwater where child labor flourished, workers were exploited and state governments did little to invest in social services and public schools for ordinary people. Such measures as poll taxes and literacy tests also prevented poor Whites from voting. Despite being warned to keep away from the polls, thousands of Black residents turned out to vote in Democratic primaries held July 17, 1946, in Marietta, Georgia. The civil rights movement that swept away the apartheid system in the South also helped White people. The fall of Jim Crow lifted the economy of the entire South. It raised the standard of living for White people as new Southern leaders abandoned racial demagoguery to invest more in social services, education and public works that benefitted everyone, Whites included. The passage of landmark civil rights laws like the Voting Rights Act also strengthened the country abroad. It was hard for American political leaders during the Cold War to preach the virtues of democracy when the world was seeing images of Black people being brutalized for trying to vote in Selma, Alabama. The movement that got rid of voter suppression laws inspired Democratic movements around the globe. \"We Shall Overcome,\" the civil rights anthem, was sung by pro-democracy demonstrators in China's Tiananmen Square and in South Africa during the anti-apartheid movement. Why would any political leader want the US return to those days when America's unequal treatment of its Black citizens made it look like hypocrites on the world stage -- especially at a time when the country is engaged in a geopolitical struggle with autocratic countries like Russia and China that disdain democracy? A return to an updated version of a Jim Crow voting system that led to some of the ugliest chapters in US history wouldn't just be folly. It would be tragic.",

        "content": "(CNN)Cutting taxes for the rich helps the poor. There is no such thing as a Republican or a Democratic judge. Climate change is a hoax. Some political myths refuse to die despite all evidence the contrary. Here's another: When White people are no longer a majority, racism will fade and the US \"will never be a White country again.\"This myth was reinforced recently when the US Census' 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790. The majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color, and people who identity as multiracial increased by 276% over the last decade.  New census figures show America is more diverse and multiracial than everThese Census figures seemed to validate a common assumption: The US is barreling toward becoming a rainbow nation around 2045, when White people are projected to become a minority. Read MoreThat year has been depicted as \"a countdown to the White apocalypse,\" and \"dreadful\" news for White supremacists.\" Two commentators even predicted the US \"White majority will soon disappear forever.\" It's now taken as a given that the \"Browning of America\" will lead to the erosion of White supremacy. I used to believe those predictions. Now I have a different conclusion:Don't ever underestimate White supremacy's ability to adapt. The assumption that more racial diversity equals more racial equality is a dangerous myth. Racial diversity can function as a cloaking device, concealing the most powerful forms of White supremacy while giving the appearance of racial progress.Racism will likely be just as entrenched in a browner America as it is now. It will still be White supremacy, with a tan.  My personal stake in a multiracial AmericaI don't like raising such a pessimistic scenario, in part for personal reasons. I want to believe my country is on the verge of this Brown New World where there will be such a rich gumbo of skin hues, hair textures and racially ambiguous people that racism will lose its sting. My family is a symbol of these demographic changes.  My mother is Irish; my father was Black. My wife is an immigrant from Central America with a biracial mother and a White \"Ladino\" father who was Jewish and Castilian. My stepmother is Chilean, and half of my siblings are Afro-Latino.

And I have another Black relative who went to court to argue that he was White (he lost). The 2020 Census could have used my family portrait for a poster. There is a yearning embedded in my DNA that a demographic tide will overtake White supremacy -- the belief that White people are superior and they should maintain political, social and economic power over other races. This yearning is not driven by some wish that people of color will someday rule over Whites. It's a hope for a more just America, a hope that we can somehow escape the tribalism that tore other countries apart. That hope was captured by one of the savviest commentators on race in America, in a passage I can't seem to forget. After President Obama was re-elected in 2012, David Simon, creator of the HBO series \"The Wire,\" wrote:  \"America will soon belong to the men and women -- white and black and Latino and Asian, Christian and Jew and Muslim and atheist, gay and straight -- who can walk into a room and accept with real comfort the sensation that they are in a world of certain difference, that there are no real majorities, only pluralities and coalitions.\"  New US citizens gather at a naturalization ceremony on March 20, 2018, in Los Angeles. The  ceremony welcomed more than 7,200 immigrants from over 100 countries who took the citizenship oath and pledged allegiance to the American flag.Simon added that \"this may be the last [presidential] election in which anyone but a fool tries to play -- on a national level, at least -- the cards of racial exclusion, of immigrant fear...\" We know what happened next:  Donald Trump was elected president. White supremacists marched in Charlottesville. Rioters waved Confederate flags during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The list goes on. It turns out that the reports of White supremacy's demise were exaggerated.Whiteness is elastic  White supremacy isn't just more resilient than many assume. It's also elastic. Consider how Whiteness has been defined. It's a prime example of how White supremacy adapts. The census suggests that White Americans will be a minority by 2045, but as several commentators have already noted, that date can easily be postponed. Whiteness isn't a fixed identity; it's like taffy -- it expands to accommodate new members, if they have the right look. In books like \"How The Irish Became White\" and \"Working Toward Whiteness,\" scholars have argued that the definition of Whiteness has expanded to include Irish, Italian and Jewish people -- groups that once weren't considered fully White in the US.  A group of Italian immigrants ready to be processed at Ellis Island in New York in 1905.The US has broadened its definition of White people throughout history enough to maintain power over Black, Asian and Latino people, writes political scientist Justin Gest in a recent essay, \"What the 'Majority Minority' Shift Really Means for America.\" \"Through a historical lens, being white in America today is like belonging to a once-exclusive social club that had to loosen its membership criteria to stay afloat,\" Gest writes. Why do so many racial groups gravitate toward Whiteness? The answer is both pragmatic and psychological. It's due to a racial hierarchy that places Whiter-looking people at the top and darker-skinned people at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder.  \"Sometimes looking White puts money directly into your pockets,\" says Tanya K. Hernandez, author of the forthcoming book \"Racial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias and The Struggle for Equality.\"\"You get access to jobs, opportunities and being viewed as competent.  But there's also a psychological benefit, that feeling of having enhanced status, of being part of Whiteness.\" A new US citizen waves an American flag while departing a naturalization ceremony on March 20, 2018, in Los Angeles.This racial hierarchy is the foundation of White supremacy. Europeans created it around 500 years ago to justify slavery and colonialism. This hierarchy is where we get the modern conception of race -- how a person's inherent worth, intelligence or attractiveness can be determined by the pigmentation of their skin. For those who fret about the \"disappearing White majority,\" I say look at history: The numbers and types of people who are defined as White may change, but the status and power that comes with being White has remained the same. The future of Whiteness could rest with LatinosIt's a hard truth for me to accept, because I see that racial hierarchy at work within my family.  I have young male relatives who appear to the world as Black, and one who appears as White. They might as well live in different universes. One is an artistic teenager with curly blonde hair, blue eyes and pale skin who is already more physically imposing than most men. I call him an \"Undercover Brother.\" A priest greets worshippers after leading a Spanish-spoken church service in West Liberty, Iowa, on August 25, 2019. When a classmate tried unsuccessfully to get him suspended by accusing him of bullying her, I surprised myself by telling my wife: \"Thank God he looks White.\"  If the same accusation had been made against a darker relative of mine, the outcome may have been different. My relative is a proud Afro-Latino. His mother teaches him about his heritage. But I wonder when he becomes an adult -- and competes for jobs and deals with the police -- whether will he come to the same conclusion I did: \"Thank God I look White.\" Someday he may even mark \"White\" on his census forms. Other Latino Americans have already made that same choice. This is another way that Whiteness preserves its dominance. In the 2010 Census, for example, researchers discovered that some 1.2 million Americans who had identified as \"Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin\" a decade earlier had changed their race from \"some other race\" to \"white.\"  \"The data also call into question whether America is destined to become a so-called minority-majority nation, where whites represent a minority of the nation's population,\" said the The New York Times. \"Those projections assume that Hispanics aren't white, but if Hispanics ultimately identify as white Americans, then whites will remain the majority for the foreseeable future.\" That number, however, plunged in the 2020 census. It revealed a drastic drop in the number of Latinos or Hispanics who identify as White. That drop may be due to Black Lives Matter protests and former President Trump's well-documented hostility to non-White immigrants and his administration's unsuccessful attempt to reduce the count of Latinos by manipulating the 2020 Census. An attendee wears Spanish-language buttons during a campaign event for Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff in Lilburn, Georgia, on December 7, 2020. The future of Whiteness in America may rest with Latino people.  It could go either way. A study suggests that Latino identity fades across successive generations as immigrant connections fade away. If large numbers of Latino people identify as White in the future, Whiteness will expand. The enhanced status and socio-economic benefits that come from identifying as White will be too tempting for many to ignore.   Racism in unexpected places The link between Whiteness and status is already a reality in some Latin American countries. In places like Brazil and Cuba, mixed-race people and interracial marriages are common. Latin Americans tend to think of themselves not in terms of race, but nationality. Yet discrimination against darker-skinned and indigenous people is common there and many other Latin American countries. There's still a widespread belief that the Whiter a person looks, the better it is for them. These countries offer proof that a country can have a large and expanding population of Black, brown and multiracial people -- and still be governed by the same racial hierarchy that gave us slavery and colonialism. Consider Brazil. It is home to more people of African heritage than any country outside Africa, and roughly 40% of Brazilians identify as mixed race. People attend a theatrical performance on April 18, 2015, in Salvador, Brazil.  But many Brazilians' economic and educational prospects are still shaped by colorism -- the notion that a person's inherent worth is determined by their skin color, according to an article in Foreign Policy that looked at the country's racial landscape. Some 80% of the country's one-percenters are white, the article said.\"Today, Brazilians see themselves as falling across a spectrum of skin colors with a dizzying assortment of names: burnt white, brown, dark nut, light nut, black, and copper,\" Cleuci De Oliveira wrote in the article. \"What ultimately binds these definitions together is an awareness that the less 'black' a person looks, the better.\" In a recent twist, the percentage of Brazilians who identify as Black or mixed race has risen slightly because of affirmative action policies and because they identify with the racial protests in the US that followed the murder of George Floyd.Cuba also has a complex history with race. Racism is often described as a relic of capitalism in the communist country. Hernandez, the author, says the country's late ruler, Fidel Castro, outlawed racial discrimination and political parties built along racial lines.  But while racism is banned by law in Cuba, it is \"alive on the streets.\" The country's Afro-Cuban population is still locked out of most elite circles, which are dominated by Anglo-looking Cubans.  Cubans line up to buy food in Havana on March 3, 2021. \"What you have is a very highly educated Afro-Cuban population and yet there's a glass ceiling,\" says Hernandez, who is also a professor at the Fordham University School of Law in New York City. \"There's still a penalty for Blackness where it can only reach so high.\" What's happened in some Latin American countries can easily happen in the United States. There will be cosmetic changes in our racial makeup -- more Black, brown and multiracial people. But the dominant group will remain White people, however they may be defined by 2045. We will have arrived at one what one sociologist calls the \"Latin-Americanization of race\" in the US. There will be more, not less, racial inequality in the US because people will cite the nation's growing diversity to \"drown out\" those voices of darker-skinned people still fighting for racial justice, says Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, author of \"Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America.\"\"The apparent blessing of 'not seeing race' will become a curse for those struggling for racial justice in years to come, Bonilla-Silva wrote. You can no longer fight racism if everyone believes their country has moved past race. Multiracial people will not save America Some people pin their hopes for a more racially tolerant future on multiracial people. That issue hits even closer to home for me. I'm old enough to remember when biracial children were treated as objects of pity -- confused \"mixed nuts,\" accepted by neither Black nor White people. That belief is where we get the \"tragic mulatto\" myth reflected in Hollywood movies like \"Imitation of Life.\"  The tragic mulatto, however, has been transformed into what I call the \"magic mulatto.\" Being biracial is now cool. People like Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris, golfer Tiger Woods and director Jordan Peele are now seen as inspirational figures.  We're often described as the vanguard of a new racial order in which interracial couples and their children will chip away at White supremacy until it collapses. Sheryll Cashin, author of \"Loving: Interracial Intimacy in America and the Threat to White Supremacy,\" once said that people who pursue interracial relationships \"are our greatest hope for racial understanding\" because they encourage white Americans to empathize with other races. Waizeru Johnson holds her new husband's hand as she passes a group of people celebrating the Juneteenth holiday at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington on June 19, 2021. \"Eventually, a critical mass of white people will accept the loss of the centrality of whiteness,\" Cashin wrote in a New York Times essay.  \"When enough whites can accept being one voice among many in a robust democracy, politics in America could finally become functional.\" But the explosive growth of Americans who now identify as multiracial could also be used to reinforce racial inequality.  How? It depends on how we check the box. During his first term in office, President Obama made headlines when he marked his race as \"African-American\" on the 2010 Census. He could have checked \"some other race\" because his mother was White, but there are political ramifications for marking \"Black\" on Census and other forms. Racial classification numbers are a great tool for uncovering the hidden hand of White supremacy: systemic racism. These numbers are used to enforce civil rights laws, track discrimination and protect voting rights.The US Justice Department, for example, relied on racial classification statistics in its 2015 report to detail how the city government in Ferguson, Missouri, systematically violated the constitutional rights of its Black residents. Police subjected Black citizens in Ferguson to a disproportionate share of unwarranted traffic stops, arrests and \"use of force\" incidents, the report found.  This pattern of racial discrimination would not have been uncovered, though, if federal officials didn't have records for the number of Blacks in Ferguson.\"The Census is not an invitation to express yourself,\" Hernandez says. \"That race data is central to enforcing our civil rights laws.\" A Confederate flag flies outside of a home on April 17, 2021, in Langtry, Texas.There has long been a debate in the multiracial community, though, about how we express ourselves. Some say we shouldn't confine our choice to the Black box but should instead select \"some other race\" -- or even White.  That debate erupted at the dinner table with my father one day. When I told him that I define myself as Black, he dropped his fork in anger and raised his voice. \"When you say you're Black, you deny your mother,\" he said. I didn't know how to explain to my father that if more multiracial people with a Black parent checked the \"some other race\" box, it could make it easier for institutions to conceal racism. It's a tricky subject, because some multiracial people feel torn between their loyalty to a parent and to a race. How we check the box, though, can shield White supremacy instead of dismantling its power.  What real racial progress would look likeHere's the hard truth we must face about the future: We may live someday in an America where there are no racial majorities, but Whiteness can still reign supreme.  Nothing will change, though, unless we go after the racial hierarchy that makes Whiteness such an exclusive club. That requires radical change. It would involve uprooting systemic racism embedded in our public schools, neighborhoods and justice system. It would involve a more equitable sharing of power and resources -- not out of White guilt or compulsion but out of the knowledge that \"We all do better when we all do better.\"  It will ultimately require that we discard the modern notion of race, the biological fiction that there is something called a \"Black person\" or a \"White person\" or an \"Asian person.\"  More diversity alone won't help the US achieve racial equality, John Blake writes. We must weed out the systemic racism embedded in institutions such as public schools.The modern concept of race has been used too long to enslave and exploit. As Audre Lorde, the poet and activist, once said, \"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\"  We can't get there, though, if we continue to underestimate the resilience of White supremacy. It is a shapeshifter that can adapt to any environment. It survived a revolution whose leaders declared \"all men are created equal,\" a Civil War, the civil rights movement, several \"racial reckonings,\" and the nation's first Black president. It keeps on keeping on. The US may indeed become a majority minority country around 2045. We may become a rainbow nation of varying racial identities, skin tones and interracial unions.  But if we don't dismantle the racial hierarchy that gives status and power to Whiteness, this new version of America won't really be new. It'll be just another updated version of White supremacy -- with a tan.",

        "content": "(CNN)The \"Yes We Can!\" bumper sticker that seemed to be plastered on every passing car. The \"fired up, ready to go!\" chant that once rocked arenas. And, of course, those iconic photos of Black, White, and brown people shedding tears of joy at a victory celebration in Chicago's Grant Park that November evening in 2008. These are glimpses of \"the unadulterated political joy\" that millions of Americans felt 13 years ago when Barack Obama was elected the nation's first Black president. They also feel like quaint snapshots of what seems now like another country.It's hard not to feel nostalgic about those moments because Obama has been back in the news. A new documentary series, \"Obama: In Pursuit of a More Perfect Union,\" is airing on HBO this month. Obama recently celebrated his 60th birthday at his vacation home on Martha's Vineyard. Tributes to the former President have poured in from pundits who argue why Obama still \"matters.\"  Read more from John Blake:Conservatives actually love critical race theory -- when they turn the subject to 'oppressed White people'The look in Derek Chauvin's eyes was something worse than hateThey lost their loved ones to Covid. Then they heard from them againDemocrats are on the verge of repeating a voting rights blunder that led to the rise of Jim CrowTwo enemies discover a 'higher call' in battleA war hero who was a stranger in his own landHow 'good White people' derail racial progressBut left unsaid in all of these accolades is an inconvenient question that's grown even more urgent after a tumultuous year marked by persistent racial divisions, an insurrection at the US Capitol and a partisan divide over wearing masks during a pandemic that's killed at least 618,000 Americans:Read MoreWill we ever believe a political leader who talks about hope and change again?  The fragility of a new America It's an inconvenient question, because it's far easier to celebrate Obama's legacy than to consider that many of us abandoned the vision of America he embodied. The nation's first Black president was living proof that the nation could transcend its original sin of racism, that its citizens could find common ground. It was Obama who said in arguably his greatest speech that \"America is not some fragile thing\" that can't tolerate citizens demanding change. \"What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical?\" Obama asked in his 2015 address in Selma, Alabama, on the 50th anniversary of a historic civil rights campaign. An Obama supporter holds up a sign reading \"Yes we can\" as  President-elect Barack Obama gives his election night victory speech on November 4, 2008, in Chicago's Grant Park. But what happens when a large segment of White America stops pretending it even cares about democracy? What happens when these Americans refuse to accept the results of a presidential election, praise foreign dictators and pass a new wave of voter restriction laws?These are the nagging questions that lurk in the background of all the recent nostalgia surrounding Obama. It's common for pundits invoking Obama's \"tattered idealism\" to say the former President has changed since 2008. But American voters may have changed as well. Obama may be the political version of the Last of the Mohicans -- a charismatic leader whose soaring rhetoric about transcending our differences now seems as outdated as a Blockbuster video store. The multiracial elation we saw in Grant Park may be the last time in many of our lifetimes we witness such unified joy. Our politics will get even uglier That's a brutal thought to contemplate. But consider some of the events of this past year -- even this past month.The country still hasn't come to terms with a violent insurrection that saw a member of a mob brandish a Confederate flag during an attack on the Capitol while others hung a noose and scaffold outside on the grounds.  A major political party is passing a wave of laws across the country that may restrict voting by racial minorities and other groups that don't tend to vote for them. Trump supporters clash with police and security forces as they try to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, a hero of the right, traveled to Hungary the same week of Obama's 60th birthday to conduct a fawning interview with the country's leader, Viktor Orban, who once said: \"...We must defend Hungary as it is now. We must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed. We do not want our own color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others.\" And new census data are raising fresh questions about the future of our democracy. For the first time in the country's history, the number of White people in the US is declining -- a benchmark that's come about eight years earlier than projected.  The news should make anyone who knows this country's history shudder. It's been well documented that a segment of White America will abandon any commitment to democracy if they no longer consider themselves the dominant group. One can envision a future where White politicians and partisan judges double down on voter restriction laws and appeals to racism in a desperate bid to hold onto power.That's why one commentator warned the shifting US demographics are about to \"set our politics on fire.\"\"If recent history tells us anything, though, it's that the census news will create a fresh wave of right-wing anger, and that much of it will be directed against America's minority populations,\" Joel Mathis wrote in a recent column in The Week. \"Our ugly politics are probably going to get uglier.\"In such a future, there may be no leaders who talk about seeking common ground. There will be no stirring oratory about how America doesn't have red or blue states. It'll be a war of attrition where both sides seek only to turn out their bases for elections. US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington on January 3, 2021. I foresee this future as a distinct possibility.  Leaders will keep speaking to people's fears instead of their hopes. There won't be any poetry in politics, just trench warfare. Even Obama, who embodies the idea that the US is a work in progress toward a more perfect union, sounded a note of skepticism in his recent memoir, \"A Promised Land.\" \"Except now I found myself asking whether those impulses\u2014of violence, greed, corruption, nationalism, racism, and religious intolerance, the all-too-human desire to beat back our own uncertainty and mortality and sense of insignificance by subordinating others\u2014were too strong for any democracy to permanently contain,\" he wrote. \"For they seemed to lie in wait everywhere, ready to resurface whenever growth rates stalled or demographics changed or a charismatic leader chose to ride the wave of people's fears and resentments.\"   A different type of hope and change Some say there will always be an audience in America for idealistic leaders who offer visions of hope and change. \"This is a cycle that America always goes through,\" says Melanye Price, a political scientist who specializes in contemporary Black politics and political rhetoric.  \"If I didn't believe that I might as well resign from my job, live off the grid somewhere and prepare for the coming race war.\" Then-President elect Barack Obama gestures during an election night victory gathering on November 4, 2008, in Chicago.  She says the US has repeatedly shown the ability to \"course correct.\" The Obama era was a glimpse of a country whose arc, to paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr., bends towards justice. \"I rely heavily,\" she says, \"on the Winston Churchill quote: 'You can always count on Americans to do the right thing -- after they've tried everything else.'\" Eric Liu, the author and activist, is one of the most eloquent spokesmen about what makes the US so resilient. In one of my favorite books, \"Become America,\" Liu writes:  \"American history is a record of small groups of people who keep remaking this country over and over, and who reveal to us all that the perpetual remaking is the greatest statement of fidelity to our creed and our national purpose, which is not to be like Russia, white and stagnant and oligarchic, or like China, monoethnic and authoritarian and centralized, but to be more like America, hybrid and dynamic and democratic and free to be remade.\" A demonstrator holds a sign  outside the Pennsylvania Capitol Building to protest the continued closure of businesses due to the coronavirus pandemic on May 15, 2020, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.   Liu says it may be good if Americans don't swoon over a leader the way they once did over Obama -- and for those on the right, former President Trump. He says change comes from the bottom up. It's part of the message he preaches around the country to encourage civic knowledge and engagement.  \"My emphasis is on trying to fortify people so they don't need a savior leader to come and put in all their hopes in,\" he tells me. \"I'm always quoting the great organizer Ella Baker, who said, 'Strong people don't need strong leaders.' \"  Determining America's future  The massive protests that followed the murder of George Floyd seemed to vindicate Liu's emphasize on citizen power, not charismatic leadership. It was driven by ordinary people hitting the streets. But if a large segment of White America abandons any pretense of believing in democracy, I'm not sure we will ever see another leader like Obama gain such wide appeal. A protester walks by as the American flag flies at half-staff at the US Capitol on January 8, 2021, in Washington.Ours will be a future Obama warned about in his memoir, when the impulses of violence, racism and intolerance will be too strong for any democracy to contain.If that becomes our future, some may look back and regard the images of Black, White and Brown people sharing tears of joy in Chicago's Grant Park as quaint and na\u00efve.And when another charismatic politician says, \"There are no red states or blue states, just the United States,\" people won't cheer and rush out to vote.Most won't even listen to such lofty rhetoric anymore.Is this our future? Or will enough people still believe that \"America is not yet finished\" and commit to becoming the vibrant, forward-looking multiracial democracy that Obama embodied?It's a question that Obama can't address. He's done his part.Only we can answer.",

        "content": "(CNN)There comes a point in every awful horror movie where a character does something so careless and shortsighted a viewer loses faith in the storyteller.There's the hapless victim who can't flee from the monster without falling, the stubborn homeowner who won't move out of a haunted house, and my favorite: the person who walks toward, not away, from a sinister noise at night while asking, \"Hello, is anyone there?\"As I watch some Democrats handle the voting rights issue, I'm seeing a replay of a 19th-century political horror story. It ended with Black voters losing faith in the leaders who were supposed to protect them.President Biden has called voting rights \"the single most important\" issue and described a wave of voter restriction bills recently passed by Republican legislatures across the US as \"Jim Crow on steroids.\" Yet he has refused to throw the full weight of the Oval Office behind passing two pending voting rights bills in Congress. He has stopped short of embracing calls to jettison the filibuster -- the parliamentary tactic Republicans can use to halt a voting rights bill -- because he says it would \"throw the entire Congress into chaos.\" Read more from John Blake:Conservatives actually love critical race theory -- when they turn the subject to 'oppressed White people'The look in Derek Chauvin's eyes was something worse than hateThey lost their loved ones to Covid.

It's complicatedTwo enemies discover a 'higher call' in battleA war hero who was a stranger in his own landHow 'good White people' derail racial progressRead MoreHe's focused instead on passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill that could rejuvenate the economy and appeal to a broad swath of voters.But for anyone who knows this country's shameful voting rights history, Biden is following a script that once doomed Black voters and made the rise of Jim Crow possible.Biden and Democratic leaders who prioritize infrastructure in part to broaden their appeal to reluctant White supporters are making the same mistake White political allies of Black voters made in the late 19th century. That's when the more progressive American political party of that era -- the Republican Party -- abandoned Black voters to focus on an economic agenda that emphasized infrastructure and uniting a country that was bitterly divided by race.That blunder gave us a century of Jim Crow segregation, reduced the Republican Party to a \"dying institution\" 'in the South and forced countless Black Americans to confront an uncomfortable truth that many are now facing again: Our White political allies are rarely willing to match the intensity and cunning of our political opponents. When chickens ask foxes for helpEvoking Jim Crow may cause some people to cringe because the comparison seems overblown. No White vigilantes are gunning down or lynching would-be Black voters. No White mobs are brazenly murdering Black elected officials or launching what's been described as the nation's only successful coup -- against a Southern city filled with Black leaders. All of this happened during that era.But there are two lessons today's Democratic leaders can learn from the mistakes their White counterparts made in the late 19th century:Economic appeals to White voters driven by racial resentment have limited value. And when you refuse to go all out to protect your most loyal voters, the results can be disastrous.Democratic caucus members of the Texas House join a rally on the steps of the Texas Capitol to support voting rights on July 8, 2021, in Austin.These aren't abstract lessons for me. I am a Black voter in Georgia, the epicenter of the new voting rights struggle.I watched Black voters save Biden's presidency during his primary run last year.  I glowed with pride when he picked Kamala Harris, my classmate at Howard University, to be his vice president. I watched Black voters flood voting precincts in a pandemic and honk their horns in jubilation after they delivered the Oval Office and control of Congress to the Democrats.What I am seeing now, though, is a rising sense of betrayal among Black voters. Many don't think Democratic leaders are pushing hard enough on voting rights. More are frustrated by Democratic leaders like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who says he won't support gutting the filibuster and insists on Republican buy-in to support a new voting rights bill. (He did propose a compromise on voting rights legislation that won the support of voting rights activist Stacey Abrams.)Leonard Pitts Jr., a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, captured some of this bitterness when he called Manchin's reasoning \"nonsensical.\" Pitts also alluded to the \"For the People Act,\" a bill to expand voting rights, when he posed a rhetorical question to Manchin: \"Would you decline to support a For the Chickens Act solely because the foxes refused to sign on?\" Why some White voters won't care if you build them a bridgeA Black voter who voted Republican in the late 19th-century South could have related to some of Pitts' sarcasm.Black voters in the South were then the most loyal supporters of the Republican Party. The Republicans were the party of Abraham Lincoln, the \"Great Emancipator,\" and the driving force behind Reconstruction, which lasted roughly from 1865 to 1877. It was the nation's first genuine attempt to build a multiracial democracy.Author and abolitionist Frederick Douglass  became a strong supporter of the Republican Party in the late 19th century.Those Republicans were strong supporters of Black voting rights. Black Americans were so loyal to the party that Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and civil rights icon, once said, \"The Republican Party is the ship and all else is the sea around us.\"But as White resistance to Reconstruction grew, the Republican Party gradually began to treat Black voters as castaways. GOP leaders said that the party shouldn't become too dependent on Black voters and should craft an economic message that would appeal to more White voters, says Richard White, author of \"The Republic for Which it Stands,\" an acclaimed book that explores US history from Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century.A central part of Republicans' economic message to reluctant White voters was infrastructure: They vowed to rebuild the roads, railways and ports throughout the South.\"They said we're going to give you economic opportunity,\" says White, a professor of American history at Stanford University. \"We're going to build an economic infrastructure you can use. You are going to be able to increase your standard of living. And that's why you're going to join the Republican Party.\"That approach didn't work in the South. Racism trumped economics. Many White Southerners from the Civil War generation saw the Republican Party as \"an alien embodiment of wartime defeat and black equality,\" the historian Eric Foner said in his classic book on that era, \"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution.\"White resistance to Black voting rights ground down the will of many Republican leaders. Black political power was crushed by a combination of White terrorism, a wave of voter suppression laws and an indifferent Supreme Court that turned a blind eye to injustice.President Rutherford B. Hayes pulled federal troops who were helping support Reconstruction efforts in the South.Reconstruction roughly ended with the disputed presidential contest of 1876. An election too close to call was resolved after candidate Rutherford B. Hayes agreed to a backroom deal that resulted in him pulling troops out of the South in exchange for the presidency. The Republican Party ceased being a major player in the South. Democrats became so dominant that the region became known as the \"Solid South.\"What followed was a century of Jim Crow segregation throughout the South that only ended with the rise of the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s. That's when the Democratic Party began attracting massive numbers of Black voters because of its support for civil rights.The reasons why Reconstruction ended are complicated. But one lesson contemporary Democratic leaders should take from that era is simple: An economic appeal to White voters consumed by racial grievances can only go so far. Many Southern White voters were willing to sacrifice the economic benefits of Reconstruction -- the regions' first public schools, rebuilt roads and railroads, the construction of public hospitals -- to prevent what some called \"Negro Rule.\"White, the historian, says Democratic leaders touting the crossover appeal of the infrastructure bill \"sound like moderate Republicans during Reconstruction.\" \"That's why I think the infrastructure argument is ridiculous, because in the South they were more than willing to hurt themselves if in fact they could hurt Black people more,\" White says.That impulse among some White voters survives today.Many White conservatives opposed Obama's Affordable Care Act, even though it helped them get health insurance.Look at the resistance to Obamacare. The Democratic Party's passage of a national health care law that helps many struggling White families did not turn many conservative White voters into Democrats. Many red states still won't accept the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare despite the financial and health benefits.Or consider the impact of Biden dispatching stimulus checks to White voters.A Washington Post reporter recently traveled to an impoverished, rural Ohio county whose White voters overwhelmingly voted for former President Trump. Though virtually all of them said they benefited from Biden's stimulus checks, virtually none said the help would lead them to support Democrats.The lesson: Building a new road won't build a new bridge to reluctant White voters who despise Blacks.  Both parties have taken Black voters for grantedThe White political allies of Black voters made another big mistake that Democrats may be making now.They're forgetting to \"Dance With the One That Brought You.\"That's the title of a song by country music star Shania Twain. The title also reflects a popular sports expression which advises coaches to stick with the players that helped them win.Demonstrators outside the Georgia Capitol protest a proposed state bill to restrict voting rights on March 3, 2021 in Atlanta.The Republican Party in the 19th century ignored that rationale. Black voters in the South were crucial to Republicans' success in the early days of Reconstruction. They were the party's most loyal supporters. At one point in the late 19th century, there were an estimated 2,000 Black Republicans holding office throughout the South. As White resistance to Reconstruction mounted, though, Republican Party leaders shifted their emphasis from racial equality to big business.\"Republicans started taking the Black vote for granted, and the Republican Party were always divided,\" the historian, Foner, said in a USA Today interview. \"There were those who said, 'We got to really defend the Black vote in the South.' And others said, 'No, we've got to appeal to the business-minded voter in the South as the party of business, the party of growth.\"Many Black supporters of the Republican Party felt betrayed. They were the backbone of the GOP in the South but watched Republican leaders do nothing as Black Southerners were being slaughtered while trying to vote.Henry Adams, an ex-slave who fought for the Union in the Civil War, once told congressional investigators in 1880: \"The whole South \u2014 every State in the South \u2014 had got into the hands of the very men that held us slaves.\"The Rex Theatre in Leland, Mississippi, which was segregated under Jim Crow laws, as seen in this 1939 photo. Southern states began enacting such laws  in the late 1800s to restrict Black residents' rights.When a political party allows its political opponents to restrict access to the vote, the impact can last for multiple generations. That happened in the Jim Crow South. The US didn't become a genuine democracy until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.Voting rights advocates warn that some version of a Jim Crow 2.0 could repeat itself today -- minus the raw violence but with an array of new tactics that restrict voting by Black Americans.Nse Ufot, a voting rights advocate in Georgia, said that if Democratic leaders can't replicate the staggering turnout from last November's presidential election, then \"We're f---ed.\"She used another f-word when she talked about Biden's recent speech on voting rights.\"When I think about the f-word that cannot be said on television, I didn't think it was the filibuster,\" she told me.Ufot says she and other Black voters have often felt that the Democratic Party takes their vote for granted. Many now also face the dilemma Black voters faced in the late 19th century South -- the alternative is worse. They can't envision voting for today's Republican Party, which they view as dominated by White supremacists.Sen. Strom Thurmond is surrounded by reporters as he steps from the Senate Chamber after ending his 24-hour filibuster  against the Civil Rights Bill of 1957. Still, some Black voters could make a third choice that should frighten Democrats: to not vote at all.Ufot says if the voting rights bill fails, many Black voters in swing states like Georgia may wonder if standing in long lines and taking time off for work to navigate a thicket of voting restrictions is worth it.\"We run the risk of people withdrawing from the process because the cost of participation is too high and they don't feel like any party represents their interests and will fight for their agenda and priorities,\" she says. The potential death spiral facing the Democratic PartyBlack voters won't be the only ones hurt if Democratic leaders don't go all out to protect voting rights. The party itself could suffer from a modern version of the death spiral that doomed Republicans in the Jim Crow South.If the Democratic Party doesn't pass new voting protections, it could lose the House, Senate and White House within the next four years, says Ronald Brownstein, a senior political analyst at CNN, in a recent Atlantic magazine essay.President Joe Biden speaks in support of voting rights at the National Constitution Center on July 13, 2021, in Philadelphia. He says the country is facing a 'turning point\" in the voting rights battle that will determine whether its democracy \"grows more inclusive or exclusionary.\" He writes that Republican voter restrictions \"amount to stacking sandbags against a rising tide of demographic change\" and that millennials and Gen Zers represent the most racially diverse generation in American history. If Republicans eventually impose red state voting rules on blue states, Democrats may not be able to pass national voting rights rules \"for another 50 years,\" said one Democratic senator quoted in Brownstein's essay.For Democrats, passing a new voting rights bill is a question of survival, Elie Mystal, a writer with The Nation magazine, said during a recent interview with Slate.\"There are entirely too many Democratic senators and establishment folks who do not see the existential threat to their own jobs if these voter suppression laws are allowed to stand,\" she said. \"They think they can still convince that middle-of-the-road White person that left the party during the Reagan years... They don't understand that the base of their party is these Black and brown people who turn out for them. They don't understand that they cannot win if they do not have overwhelming turnout from Black and brown communities.\"Other voting rights advocates are less pessimistic. They say that voter suppression laws aimed at Black voters can sometimes backfire.\"Black people have a history -- when you make us mad, we turn out,\" says Timothy McDonald, an Atlanta pastor who founded the African American Ministers Leadership Council, the group which created the \"Souls to the Polls\" get-out-the-vote movement among Black churches nationwide.Supporters attend a campaign rally for Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock on January 4, 2021 -- the day before their runoff election in Atlanta. McDonald says it's time to do away with the filibuster if it's used to stop a new voting rights bill. But he also supports the Biden administration's focus on passing what could possibly be two major infrastructure bills. New construction offers tangible signs of progress that could even cause some White, conservative voters to switch their votes to Democrats, he says. \"Even Bubba might say, 'I don't like Democrats,' but that's a good thing there,\" says, McDonald, referring to infrastructure improvements such as new roads and bridges. \"When he goes into the voting booth, he's not going to tell his buddies who he's voting for but don't be surprised.\" But the expectation that Blacks can counter voter suppression by turning out in record numbers amounts to a cruel double standard, Michael Arceneaux argued in a recent column for The Week entitled, \"Biden's voting rights betrayal.\" \"White voters are never asked to 'out-organize vote suppression,\" he wrote. Why the time is never 'right' for a voting rights billAs I hear Democratic leaders rationalize why now is the wrong time to get rid of the filibuster or push aggressively for voting rights, a question comes to my mind:When did White political allies of Black people ever say the time was \"right\" for us to demand our equal rights?The time wasn't right to reclaim Black voting rights in the South until Americans were horrified by images of White state troopers beating marchers in Selma in 1965.The time wasn't right to press for police reforms until Americans were horrified by the video of George Floyd being murdered on camera in 2020.An ex-slave and his wife on the steps of a decaying plantation house in  Greene County, Georgia. Many Black Southerners saw their rights gradually eroded in the late 1800s. The time isn't right to get rid of the filibuster and pass a new voting rights bill now, even though a recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that 48% of White Americans now say that voting is a \"privilege,\" not a right.Politics, it's been said, is the art of the possible. But determined political leaders can often make things happen if they're passionate enough. The Democratic Party used to know this. When a senator warned President Lyndon Johnson that if he pushed for the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act the Democratic Party would \"lose the South forever,\" Johnson's response was resolute, according to a passage in historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, \"Leadership In Turbulent Times.\"\"You may be right,\" Johnson said. \"But if that's the price I've gotta pay, I'm going to gladly do it.\" When it seemed like the passage of Obamacare was doomed, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a nervous Democratic leader who wanted to pursue a less ambitious health plan focused on children that she wasn't going to settle for \"kiddie-care.\" There are some issues that are so fundamental to a party's identity and survival that there is no middle ground, no way to finesse a hard choice.As one voting rights activists recently tweeted: \"I am uncompromising on voting rights because there is no middle point between the arsonist and the fireman.\"Voters in Gwinnett County stand in line to cast ballots during the first day of early voting for the US Senate runoff in Georgia on December 14, 2020.Black voters like Henry Adams, the courageous soldier who tried to organize Black voters in the South, had that attitude. But their White political allies took their vote for granted and treated them, in the words of Frederick Douglass, like \"field hands.\"If the Biden administration doesn't pass a new voting rights bill after Black voters help give them the White House and control of Congress, the sense of jubilation I witnessed firsthand in Georgia will evaporate.And if more White Americans continue to regard voting as a privilege rather than a fundamental right, more Black voters will ask Democratic leaders a variation of a question that was first posed by their ancestors in the Jim Crow South:What's the use of building a new bridge or road when you don't protect the voting rights of those people who gave you the power to do so in the first place?",

        "content": "(CNN)He spoke in a Boston-accented monotone that barely rose above a whisper, hated personal attention, and was a brilliant Harvard-trained mathematician who quoted Albert Camus.Bob Moses, who died this week at age 86, was an unconventional civil rights leader. He didn't energize crowds with fiery speeches, and wasn't known for leading marches, yet few leaders have inspired such veneration.Moses helped put the Black struggle for voting rights on the national radar at a time when many judges, politicians, and ordinary Americans were indifferent to the issue. He was beaten numerous times and almost killed while registering Black voters in Mississippi in the 1960s. Still, he never gave up. \"Things looked pretty bleak back then as well,\" said Diane Nash, a civil rights leader and former student sit-in leader who knew Moses. \"Even in those days, when they were using literacy tests and poll tests and claiming that they weren't doing it for racial reasons just like they do know, Bob can certainly be an inspiration for those working for freedom.\"As activists and lawmakers protest in Washington, DC, demanding that Congress pass federal voting rights legislation to counter state-level voter restrictions, Moses has left them a blueprint on how to win in the most hostile circumstances, civil rights leaders say.Read MoreBob Moses, civil rights legend, dead at age 86President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama praised Moses for his undying fight for voting rights. Biden released a statement Monday saying Moses led with \"uncommon grace, calm, and humility despite every bullet, arrest, and unrelenting brutality he faced.\"Biden dared the nation to continue Moses's unfinished work, crediting him with helping dismantle the Jim Crow system that suppressed Black voters, and he urged Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.Biden gives an angry cry for action on voting rights but stops short of calling for filibuster reform\"Let us build the coalition of Americans of every race and background that he once formed to meet the urgency of the moment,\" Biden said. \"And let us follow his towering legacy and ensure every American is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\"Obama said he was inspired by Moses. \"Bob Moses was a hero of mine,\" Obama tweeted. \"His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a difference. Michelle and I send our prayers to Janet and the rest of the Moses family.\" A 'consistent' leaderMany of the tributes to Moses focused on his work as a voting rights organizer in Mississippi during the civil rights movement. It had a well-deserved reputation as the most harrowing place in the South for Black people to vote. When Moses arrived in Mississippi by 1961, only about 5% of voting-age Black people had been allowed to register to vote. In many counties, no Blacks were registered to vote.These iconic civil rights leaders have lost most of their friends. But their hope enduresMoses was instrumental in putting voting rights on the national agenda -- by empowering ordinary people. He was a central organizer of Mississippi Freedom Summer, a project in which an interracial group of student volunteers was invited to come to the state and work alongside local organizers to register Black voters. He served as a field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. One of Moses's key insights is that ordinary people can become powerful agents of change. He was influenced by the organizer Ella Baker, who said, \"Strong people don't need strong leaders.\" Moses was known for partnering with and empowering local leaders to take over long after the media and other civil rights activists had left.Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said she admired Moses for his \"consistency\" in the voting rights movement. Campbell said while she never met Moses, his legacy should teach today's activists that the fight for voting rights or civil rights can't be won overnight.\"He never left the movement,\" Campbell said. \"The fight for justice is never-ending, you have to keep moving the ball.\"A humble leaderMoses also earned respect for his courage. Those who met Moses, often remarked on the Zen-like calm he seemed to project even in the face of great physical danger. Once, when attacked by a White mob in Mississippi, local sheriffs rushed to his side -- joining the mob and beating him in the head with blackjacks. He, like civil rights icon John Lewis, never fought back with violence. Even when he spoke to the Black sharecroppers he met in Mississippi, Moses was calm and respectful, said Bernard Lafayette, a civil rights activist who worked with Moses and other civil rights campaigns. \"His approach was very different,\" Lafayette says. \"He wouldn't go in hollering and screaming to tell people that you should vote. He would sit down and talk to them and find out what were some of the things they wanted to accomplish and then relate that to the vote.\"Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, told CNN that Moses's life should also inspire voting rights leaders to focus on the result of their fight instead of the notoriety that comes with it. Moses, he said, was not a \"self-promoter.\"Moses \"put community interests before his own ego,\" said Johnson, who was a friend of Moses's. \"In this age of social media, you have many people who are more concerned with the number of followers and clicks and likes than they are with the desired outcome that they are fighting for.\" 'The organizer of the organizers'Moses helped change the trajectory of voting rights with Mississippi Freedom Summer. It drew national attention to the brutal conditions Blacks faced in the South when trying to vote. Three civil rights workers were killed that summer trying to register Black voters. The Voting Rights Act, dubbed the crown jewel of the civil rights movement, was passed the following year in 1965.One of the legacies of that summer was how it transformed the local Black people in Mississippi whose talents Moses helped nurture. Many went into politics and became community leaders. One of the most famous examples of local leadership was Fannie Lou Hamer, a sharecropper who became a charismatic voting rights organizer.Moses also showed in Mississippi that voting rights advocates worked better when they put their agendas aside and worked together. The civil rights movement was full of rivalries and competition between groups. But under Moses's leadership, many groups were able to set aside their dueling agendas, at least for a time, says Ravi Perry, a historian and chairman of the political science department at Howard University.\"During an era when people had so many different ideas about how to create change, he was able to hear these different arguments and build consensus,\" Perry says. \"He was the organizer of the organizers.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)One autumn evening, Nelson Mandela answered a knock at his front door and found himself facing his most dangerous enemy.The man's name was General Constand Viljoen, and he was dubbed the \"ultimate enforcer\" of apartheid, the brutal system where Whites had ruled over Blacks in South Africa for much of the 20th century. Viljoen was the former chief of the South African Defense Force, which had crushed dissent in Black townships and, some say, assassinated Black activists. He thought Mandela was a terrorist who deserved execution.\"Ah, hello, General,\" Mandela said, greeting Viljoen with a big smile. \"How very good to see you. I have heard so much about you. Thank you very much for accepting my invitation.\"It was October 1993, and both men were trying to stop a looming civil war. Many White South Africans were terrified of losing political power in an impending national election. Political factions murdered one another in the streets. And an alliance of White supremacist groups had asked Viljoen to lead an armed insurrection against the government. Viljoen didn't trust Mandela but accepted his invitation as a last resort to avert war.But then something happened to Viljoen after he talked over tea with Mandela. By the end of the evening, Viljoen had not only accepted Mandela's request to call off the insurrection; he persuaded other White South Africans to participate in the upcoming election. And when Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's President a year later following the nation's first fully Democratic elections, Viljoen stood in the middle of the new parliament, saluted him, and would later call him \"the greatest of men.\"Read MoreHow did Mandela change the mind of a man once described as the \"ultimate racist?\" The answer to that question holds some critical lessons for the treacherous political environment in the US today.As the world commemorates the 103rd birthday of Mandela this Sunday, this is the perfect time to explore how Mandela helped steer South Africa through some of the same racial and political divisions that engulf the US today. He took a political divide and racial divisions that go way beyond what you're living in the US right now, and he managed to build a bridge. John Carlin, journalist and author of \"Knowing Mandela.\"\"He took a political divide and racial divisions that go way beyond what you're living in the US right now, and he managed to build a bridge,\" says John Carlin, author of three books on Mandela, and a journalist who befriended Mandela .\"For those people in America who would like to explore how to build bridges across chasms that get ever wider in America, he's worthy of study,\" says Carlin, author of \"Knowing Mandela,\" and \"Invictus,\" which was made into a Hollywood movie.The standard explanation for Mandela's success is he forgave his former captors, flashed his luminous smile, and won them over with decency. The truth is more complicated, and so was Mandela.We can learn a lot about how Mandela operated by looking at three crucial decisions he made when facing some of the same issues that divide America today.He turned empathy into a political weaponIf you think the mood in the US is ugly today, consider the country Mandela was trying to lead in the early 1990s.A mob of armed White citizens stormed the most important political venue in the country as lawmakers fled for safety in an attempt to derail the upcoming elections. White citizens stockpiled guns. Unscrupulous political leaders egged on street violence to raise their profiles and build followers. It looked in some ways like a sneak preview of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.A country built on White supremacy was trying to become a multiracial democracy, and many observers didn't think they would make it. Police drag a young black student to a police van after rioting broke out on Wednesday, August 12, 1976 in a African township  near Cape Town, South Africa. Images of White police brutalizing Blacks were common during the apartheid era.At the center of much of the violence was fear of what the Afrikaners -- South Africa's dominant White ethnic group -- called the \"Black danger,\" or \"Swart Gevaar.\"  Apartheid denied 85% of the population, those born with dark skin, any political power. Blacks couldn't vote, compete with Whites in the workplace; couldn't use the same public toilets, buses, beaches, and many lived in squalor.\"White South Africans were the most privileged people in the world in the 1990s,\" Carlin says. \"Even if you were a working-class White guy in a factory, you possibly had two [Black] live-in maids and a swimming pool.\"Mandela had to sell democracy to a people that had richly benefitted from its absence. That sale became harder on April 10, 1993, when a White supremacist assassinated Chris Hani, a beloved Black South African leader. Hani, widely seen as Mandela's heir apparent, was a surrogate son to Mandela.But that's when Mandela made a crucial decision that stopped South Africa from tumbling over what he called \"the brink of disaster.\" Mandela went on national radio and television to appeal for calm. He didn't just focus on the White supremacist that murdered Hani, he highlighted a White hero, a White woman who witnessed the murder, and helped authorities identify the killer by writing down the license plate of the killer's getaway car.\"A White woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know and bring to justice this assassin,\" Mandela said.Afrikaners had caused Mandela a lifetime of anguish. Their regime had sentenced him to life in prison in 1964. They took him away from his family and his wife. They tortured and assassinated his closest friends.  And yet, in that moment, he chose the highlight the decency of an Afrikaner woman he had never met. \"What I know is that if he hadn't been around, the country would, in fact, have torn itself apart,\" Archbishop Desmond Tutu said about Mandela's conduct after Hani's assassination during a PBS interview.It's become customary for people to demonize political opponents in this country. Videos go viral on social media that show commentators \"destroying\" their political opponents. Surveys reveal that while Americans are more open to interracial marriage and marriage equality, more now also oppose \"interpolitical\" unions, or marriages to someone of another political party.But Mandela turned empathy into a political weapon. He used it not only to diffuse a national crisis but to survive prison. Mandela developed such a close relationship with Christo Brand, his White jailer, that Brand once snuck his infant son into prison just so Mandela could hold his son in his arms. Nelson Mandela stares out of the window of the prison cell he occupied on Robben Island for much of his 27 year prison sentence. It was at Robben that Mandela learned the language and ways of his White jailers. Those who knew Mandela as a younger man say he was a hothead with a temper, but prison changed him. He developed a radial form of empathy that went beyond political expedience. \"Prison steeled him, but it broke many others,\" Richard Stengel, the author of \"Mandela's Way: Fifteen Lessons on Life, Love, and Courage,\" wrote. \"Understanding that made him more empathetic, not less. He never lorded it over those who could not take it. He never blamed anyone for giving in. Over the years, he developed a radar and a deep sympathy for human frailty.\"He addressed the hearts, not the mind of his opponentsProfessional athletes refuse to stand for the national anthem. Protesters clash over the removal of Confederate monuments. People still clash over how racism should be taught in the classroom.Mandela faced many of the same challenges when on April 27, 1994 he became the first democratically elected President of South Africa. He had to decide how South Africa came to terms with the racist symbols of its past.A debate over South Africa's national anthem revealed how Mandela adroitly faced this challenge.Leaders in the African National Congress, the party Mandela led, voted to abolish the anthem. It was seen as a racist relic because it brazenly celebrated the White conquest and subjugation of Black people. They voted to replace it with Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika, a stately, soulful ballad favored by Black South Africans.When Mandela heard about the decision, he was livid. \"Well, I am sorry. I don't want to be rude,\" Mandela started. \"... This song that you treat so easily holds the emotions of many people who you don't represent yet. With the stroke of a pen, you would take a decision to destroy the very -- the only -- basis that we are building upon: reconciliation.\"Mandela proposed instead that South Africa should have two national anthems. The White and Black South Africans anthems would both be sung one after one another at official ceremonies and other public events. His proposal was passed unanimously by the chastened ANC leadership.The anthem was a difficult choice, but it helped, says the Rev. Nontombi Naomi Tutu, a human rights activist, speaker and the daughter of Bishop Demond Tutu, the South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate.Barbie Byrd, of Columbia, South Carolina joins a group of demonstrators on the grounds of the South Carolina State House calling for the Confederate flag to remain on the State House grounds. \"I still struggle with it,\" says Tutu, who is also the associate rector at an Episcopal church in Beverly Hills, California. \"When I get to the part of the Die Stem [the White national anthem], I still have to take a deep breath before I start singing, but I recognize that this was an attempt to say this is all part of our country's story.\"There is a legitimate debate about preserving racist monuments. Mandela, for example, never said that all relics from apartheid's past should be preserved. What's important, though, is that he grasped that the cultural symbols of the Afrikaners -- their anthem, their love of rugby (which many Black South Africans disdained because it was seen as the sport of their oppressors) and their monuments -- weren't just issues to argue about. It offered opportunities to reach them.That's why Mandela often spoke a few words of Afrikaans at the beginning of his speeches. It's why he publicly rallied behind South Africa's 1995 Rugby World Cup Final championship run, an enthralling sports story that was made into a Hollywood movie. And its why, Mandela later explained, he spent his years his prison learning Afrikaans, the language of his oppressor while studying their history and reading their favorite poets. Mandela once said of persuading many Afrikaners to accept him as their leader:\"You don't address their brains; you address their hearts.\"That approach is how he disarmed Viljoen, the South African general who visited his home, Carlin the author says. Viljoen was considered a racist and a criminal by many Black South Africans. Carlin called him the \"ultimate enforcer\" of apartheid because the system was built on the brute force of the South African military. Viljoen was Mandela's most dangerous adversary because he could have mobilzied a force of about 30,000 White South African soldiers who were ready to wage war for a White homeland.But Mandela charmed Viljoen by speaking to him in Afrikaans, the general's native language, while spinning parables about Afrikaner farmers who were tough but fair to Black people. Yet he also spoke bluntly to Viljoen about his own anger because he knew that directness was a trait that Afrikaners valued. Mandela knew what notes to hit because he had spent virtually 30 years addressing the hearts of Afrikaners who had imprisoned him.Gen. Constant Viljoen was one of Mandela's most formidable enemies. Mandela's ability to forge a relationship with Viljoen saves South Africa from a potential civil war.\"He knows the general better than the general knows him,\" Carlin says of that meeting.Some may reduce Mandela's charm offensive had political manipulation, but Carlin and others says it went deeper. They say Mandela had a Lincolnesque ability to appeal to the better angels in his political opponent's nature. He treated them not as the globally reviled henchmen of a criminal regime built on racism, but also as leaders who could transcend their backgrounds.He knew on some level that they wanted to be seen as more than monsters and dangled opportunities before them to do so.\"Mandela understood on some profound level that ultimately, whether you are Black or White, right wing or left wing, is ultimately a function of change things for which you have no control,\" Carlin says. \"Political views are like the dress you wear, but underneath them is a flesh and blood human being. If you cut through those and start finding the heart and appeal to their generosity, you're going to make them feel better about themselves.\"That's why Carlin and others observe a curious pattern when some of the toughest enforcers of apartheid talk about their relationship with Mandela. Many of them cry. Tutu says Mandela made the men realize on some level that apartheid had also victimized them.\"They recognized that the dehumanization of Black South Africans had also led to the dehumanization of White South Africans,\" she says. \"They could not fully live as human in a system that dehumanized the vast majority of South Africans.\"He showed that a leader's integrity mattersNone of Mandela's empathy or sensitivity toward his enemy's culture would have made any difference if he didn't possess another quality. Calin calls it a \"diamond-like\" integrity.The contemporary political scene is filled with slippery leaders who exude dishonesty and moral cowardice. A former president makes it to the White House despite being a habitual liar. A major political party embraces the \"big lie\" that a presidential election was stolen. A never-ending stream of scandals routinely reveals the gap between a politician's public pronouncements and their private conduct.But many say there was little separation between the private and the public Mandela. Sure, he could disarm political opponents with public displays of empathy. But he did the same in private, treating everyone with what he called \"ordinary respect.\"White South African man holds up a flag for the Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), one of many groups that once threatened to push the nation into a civil war.After Mandela left office, he heard that the now-adult son of his former jailer at died in a car accident. The infant boy he once held in a jail cell as he teared up was gone. He flew to his former jailer's home and spent the afternoon consoling him, Carlin says.\"There was no political payoff to it,\" Carlin says. \"He just did it out of kindness and loyalty.\"Mandela's integrity made his political opponents look small. In 1985, when South Africa's leadership felt the pressure of a growing international campaign to release Mandela, they offered him a deal. Reject violence as a tactic to fight apartheid, obey the country's security laws, and we will release you.Mandea refused. He composed a response to their offer that was read by one of his daughters at a packed rally in a stadium in Soweto, South Africa. \"I cherish my freedom dearly, but I care even more for your freedom,\" Mandela wrote. \"I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.\"Lies may offer politicians short-term gain, but Mandela's integrity proved instrumental for one of his greatest triumphs. When Viljoen, the South African general, was asked to identify the decisive factor that persuaded him to abandon leading an insurrection, he cited one person.\"The character of the opponent -- whether you can trust him, whether you believe he is genuinely for peace,\" Viljoen told Carlin in the book, \"Invictus.\" The important thing when you sit down and negotiate with the enemy is the character of the people you have across the table from you and whether they carry their people's support. Mandela had both.\"  Protesters storm the US Capitol in January, driven by former President Trump's claims of election fraud. A similar assault took place in South Africa as a White mob tried to prevent a peaceful transition to power.Viljoen's paid another public tribute when Mandela voluntarily relinquished power after serving one term as South Africa's first democratically elected President. He gave a speech praising Mandela in Parliament. This time he spoke in Mandela's native language, Xhosa.\"Go and have yourself a well-earned rest, Mr. President,\" Viljoen said as Mandela looked on. \"Go and lie in the shadow of a tall tree.\"Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. What he and countless other South Africans did seems like a miracle today. Their country is still afflicted by many socioeconomic divisions that linger from apartheid. But few are talking anymore about armed insurrections and a country splitting apart.But they are invoking those scenarios in the US today. Many commentators says the county is in the middle a political and cultural civil war. The FBI director recently said White supremacy represents the nation's biggest terrorist threat. The future looks scary, as it once did in South Africa.We need Mandela's example more than ever.",

        "content": "(CNN)If you're trying to figure out why so many conservatives despise critical race theory, here's some historical context you should remember:  White conservatives oppose critical race theory --  only when it's applied to Black people.  But many have no problem adopting some of  CRT's language and core insights when complaining that contemporary America discriminates against White people.  This is the audacious double standard that's often overlooked in the current debate over critical race theory. Many White conservatives roll their eyes when Black people claim that systemic racism exists, that racism is baked into the nation's policies and legal system, and that it can't be reduced to individual prejudice -- all key CRT concepts.  Yet White conservatives have steadily built a legal and political movement that claims White people are the primary victims of covert forms of racism embedded in American institutions such as religion, education, and throughout popular culture.    Read MoreThere's a name for this rhetorical sleight of hand, which insists that systemic racism exists for White Americans but not for people of color. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the renowned author and essayist, calls it \"frame-flipping.\"   Read more from John Blake:The look in Derek Chauvin's eyes was something worse than hateThere was no racial reckoningDid Black lives matter to Abraham Lincoln? It's complicatedTwo enemies discover a 'higher call' in battleA war hero who was a stranger in his own landTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same sinceHow 'good White people' derail racial progressCoates says that while overt, ugly acts of bigotry attract the most attention, the most potent component of racism is \"positioning the bigot as the actual victim.\"  \"So the gay do not simply want to marry, they want to convert our children into sin,\" he wrote. \"The Jews do not merely want to be left in peace, they actually are plotting world take-over. And the blacks are not actually victims of American power, but beneficiaries of the war against hard-working whites. This is a respectable, more sensible, bigotry, one that does not seek to name-call, preferring instead 'to' change the subject and strawman.\"  The recent debate over CRT is the latest variation of frame-flipping. But conservatives have used similar tactics to thwart the feminist movement and to notch victories in the culture wars on American campuses.   CRT is a complex subject that can easily be mischaracterized  Critical race theory is a perfect candidate for the latest version of frame-flipping because so many people do not know what it is -- including some conservatives who condemn it. Critical race theory emerged in the 1970s as legal scholars and activists sought to figure out why racial inequality persisted despite the passage of landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s, which penalized the most blatant forms of discrimination. They concluded that racism had mutated and embedded itself in policies and institutions, such as housing and the justice system.These modern forms of racism are what some call \"racism without racists.\" They are often hardwired into institutions, and can't be traced back to a White person being overtly racist. For example, a critical race theorist might point to an actual 2011 case of a lender caught charging Black and Latino customers higher fees than White applicants with similar credit histories. Demonstrators protest critical race theory being taught in Springfield, Missouri, schools on Tuesday, May 18, 2021.Many critics, though, ignore how CRT exposes how racism persists in the contemporary world. They say critical race theory \"poisons our discussion of race\" by suggesting that those who question CRT are automatically assumed to oppose fighting racism. They also argue it teaches White students to be ashamed of their color and country.   Conservative lawmakers have now passed laws in at least six states to ban what they describe as the teaching of critical race theory in public schools, with similar legislation being proposed in at least a dozen more. One commentator called this campaign the \"most far-reaching assault on academic freedom since the McCarthy era in the 1950s.\"But it is something more. It is a textbook example of conservative hypocrisy.     Critical race theory opponents borrow from the anti-racists they denounce  Conservatives accuse critical race theorists of \"planting hatred in the minds of the next generation\" and being obsessed with skin color.  Yet many continue to rally behind a former President who is widely perceived to have spread hatred against Americans of color with such remarks as telling four nonwhite Democratic congresswomen to \"go back\" to the crime-infested places they came from and rose to political prominence partly based on a racist birther conspiracy theory that reflected his obsession with the first Black President of the US.  Protesters against critical race theory being taught in Loudoun County schools gather in Leesburg, Virginia, on June 12, 2021. Conservatives admonish critical race theorists for saying racism transcends individual prejudice and is embedded in American institutions.   Yet they insist that White Americans are the victims of bias in such institutions as mainstream media, law schools and in corporate America, where some now say that White conservative men can't get ahead. Conservatives say critical race theory teaches \"that Blacks should forever be regarded as helpless victims,\" and that \"America is not a racist country.\" Yet they also warn of pervasive \"anti-White mania\" in America. A large number of Whites even say they face more discrimination than Black people, while a majority of White evangelicals say Christians face more discrimination than Muslims.   Some conservatives deny White privilege but believe in 'Black privilege'  The battle over critical race theory is actually the latest outbreak of an older phenomenon: More White Americans in recent years have come to see themselves as a racially oppressed majority group.   This belief is reflected in how casually many White people use the language of racial persecution to describe their state in contemporary America, a fear that Trump has stoked for years.  Numerous studies show that Blacks lag behind Whites in many socioeconomic categories. White people make up the bulk of the country's CEOs, billionaires and political leaders. There is no widely cited study showing that job applicants with a White-sounding name on their resume like Emily or Greg are 33% less likely to get called back for a job interview than a Jamal or Lakisha. A man holds an \"All Lives Matter\" sign at a pro-Trump demonstration on August 1, 2020, in Yucaipa, California. Still, many White people talk today as if they are an embattled racial minority. Powerful White men lament they are increasingly \"being silenced by 'woke\" culture.\" Conservative politicians describe critical race theory as being as racist as \"Klansmen in White sheets\" and complain that Democratic voting proposals represent \"Jim Crow 2.0.\" One conservative leader called it a \"monstrous evil\" that would enable people of color to rise up and use the \"whip handle\" on their White neighbors.White privilege is bogus, conservative commentators say, but \"Black privilege,\" where Blacks get \"automatic victim status' that makes it easier for them to land affirmative action slots, is a real problem.  Critics don't accept CRT's premise that systemic racism persists in contemporary America.  Like critical race theorists, though, many see racism as a subtle and adaptable force woven into contemporary American institutions -- except they believe these racist forces are arrayed against White people.   Opponents of critical race theory follow a well-worn script  This new language of White persecution is no accident. It reflects in part real sentiments from White Americans who are anxious about demographic changes in their country. But it also reflects a strategy.  Much of this can be traced to conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who has vowed to lead a \"one-man war\" against critical race theory and has been open about his desire to turn CRT into a negative term.Rufo wrote on his Twitter feed:\"We have successfully frozen their brand\u2014\"critical race theory\"\u2014into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.\"More than 100 people gathered at a diner in Howard County, Maryland in June to listen to a panel held by local Republican groups on school Covid-19 shutdowns and critical race theory.Bending left-leaning language and concepts to attack progressive reforms is something conservatives have been doing for centuries, political theorist Corey Robin argues in \"The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump.\"In his book, Robin looked at how conservative movements have traditionally specialized in absorbing \"the ideas and tactics of the very revolution or reform it opposes.\"   Robin cited another cultural war battle that grabbed a lot of headlines not too long ago -- the battle over political correctness on college campuses.    He says conservative leaders deftly advised conservative college students to use the language of the left to take on campus liberals. They accused colleges of lacking intellectual \"diversity,\" said conservatives were \"underrepresented\" and that schools should be more \"inclusive\" of right-leaning students.  Robin also pointed to another conservative movement that borrowed the language of the left in the 1970s to defeat a progressive dream: The Equal Rights Amendment, an update to the Constitution that would have guaranteed equal rights to women.  After the feminist movement of the 1960s, ratification for the Equal Rights Amendment seemed assured by the early 1970s. But Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative activist, led the successful campaign to torpedo the ERA movement by shrewdly using the language of the left. Phyllis Schlafly leads members opposed to the equal rights amendment in protest in this undated photo.She argued that the ERA would be \"a takeaway of women's rights,\" said she was defending \"the real rights of women\" and added, \"a woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother.\"  Schlafly used the language of human rights to \"put women back into the home,\" Robin noted. He says Schlafly's semantical maneuver was a common tactic of conservative movements, which, \"without directly engaging the progressive argument,\" absorb \"the deeper categories and idioms of the left.\"Rush Limbaugh, the late conservative talk-show host, used the same rhetorical trick. He used the language of the civil rights movement to attack progressives. He once argued that conservatives are an \"oppressed minority\" in need of a \"civil rights movement\" because its members willingly sit in the \"back of the bus\" and were \"afraid of the fire hoses and the dogs.\"Some opponents of critical race theory are using the same ploy. They won't directly confront what critical race theorists actually say about incidents like George Floyd's murder and what it implied about the persistence of White supremacy in America. They simply absorb the language of critical race theorists to deflect and discourage any deeper discussions of systemic racism.  US Rep. Lauren Boebert speaks at a press conference about banning federal funding for the teaching of critical race theory on May 12, 2021, in Washington.This was the point echoed by Sam Hoadley-Brill, a fellow at the African American Policy Forum, which is headed by the scholar Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, one of the founding scholars of CRT. He wrote in a recent essay:  \"Today's attacks on critical race theory aren't meant to rebut its main arguments. They're meant to paint it with such broad brushstrokes that any basic effort to reckon with the causes and impact of racism in our society can be demonized and dismissed.\"  There is a legitimate debate to be had over critical race theory. Does it accurately reflect US history? Does it really teach hatred? And who gets to define racism: its perpetrators, or its victims? But there is a segment of White conservative America that is not interested in debate. As they dismiss CRT as bogus -- while employing its concepts and language to describe their own perceived racial oppression -- the message they're sending to Black Americans, other people of color and their White allies is clear:  \"Critical race theory for me -- but not for thee.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)One evening, Robin DiAngelo became a nice racist. DiAngelo, author of \"White Fragility,\" remembers the precise moment it happened. A friend invited her to join a few friends of hers for dinner. When DiAngelo arrived at the restaurant, she was excited to see that the couple waiting for them at the table was Black. DiAngelo was a college student who had no Black friends and had rarely spent any time around Black people. But she saw herself as a proud progressive and a feminist. She proceeded to tell the Black couple how racist her family was and spent the entire evening recounting every uncensored racist joke, story, and comment she could remember them making, despite her dinner companions' growing discomfort. She didn't know it at the time, but DiAngelo was doing something she now calls \"credentialing\" -- a conversational tactic White progressives sometimes use to show Black people they are not racist. Well-meaning White liberals do this by casually dropping into conversations such comments as, \"My grandchildren are biracial,\" or \"I don't see color,\" or \"My best friend is Black.\" DiAngelo thought at the time that her progressive credentials preempted any suggestion that she could be racist. Read More\"I thought what I was doing was showing that I recognized how racist these things were, and I would never do them,\" she says now. \"I was a nice White progressive, but what I was actually doing was both objectifying that couple by bringing the conversation to race immediately in a way I would never have if they were White and then subjecting them to all those racist comments and jokes all night long.\"If you're a White person who is now rewinding every conversation you've had with a person of color to see if you flashed your \"I am not a racist\" credentials, then you might understand the power of DiAngelo's hard-hitting new book, \"Nice Racism: How Progressive White People Perpetuate Racial Harm.\" In it DiAngelo delivers a systematic takedown of what she calls \"well-meaning Whiteness\" -- how well-intentioned White people unwittingly reinforce racism.DiAngelo deploys many of the same skills that made \"White Fragility,\" which topped the bestseller lists last summer as the nation grappled with the fallout from George Floyd's murder, an anti-racist classic. She has a gift for taking abstract racial issues and explaining them in accessible terms through concrete examples and colorful phrases.

His life hasn't been the same sinceHow 'good White people' derail racial progress\"Nice Racism\" is built around a startling claim: White progressives can cause the most daily harm to people of color. \"We are the ones -- with a smile on our faces -- who undermine Black people daily in ways both harder to identify and easier to deny,\" she writes. \"To the degree that we see ourselves as \"not racist,\" we are going to be very defensive about any suggestion to the contrary. We will see no further action needed because we see ourselves as outside the problem.\"DiAngelo, an affiliate associate professor of education at the University of Washington in Seattle, makes other provocative claims throughout the book. She explores how a culture of \"niceness\" protects racism, how White progressives try to \"out-woke\" one another and why anti-racist education can sometimes create more \"efficient \"racists.Robin DiAngelo: How 'white fragility' supports racism and how whites can stop it There is arguably no contemporary author who is as skilled at dissecting the strategies White people employ in casual social interactions to deflect or justify racism. Yet some of the most moving passages of the book are when DiAngelo gets personal. She talks about the impact of growing up poor, takes on her critics and explains why she believes it's okay for her to generalize about all White people.CNN recently talked to DiAngelo about her new book, the recent furor over critical race theory and how her life has changed since the huge success of \"White Fragility.\" The conversation was edited for clarity and brevity.How do you define nice racism?In order to understand nice racism, you have to have a basic understanding of systemic racism. You have to understand that racism is a system infused across society, and that means that there are going to be extreme forms that are explicit that we all recognize. And there are going to be more subtle forms. Nice racism is the more subtle action on that continuum. It's the form of racism that well-meaning progressive White people, who believe in racial justice and do not deny that systemic racism exists, inadvertently enact.Can you give us an example?One is this urgency we feel to establish that we're not racist. And the irony here is that if we understand systemic racism, we understand that it's inevitable that we've been shaped by that system and that, of course, we've internalized racist ideology. And of course, we act on that most often without awareness. But it's hard to let go of this idea of racism as an either/or proposition here -- you're either racist or you're not. And if you're racist, you're bad, and if you're not a racist, you're good. And so, we feel this need to let people of color know that we're not, quote-unquote, racist.Demonstrators gather during a protest outside Hennepin County Government Center on March 28, 2021, in Minneapolis. There are some critics who say we don't need more workshops about helping White people face their racism. We need justice, such as voting rights, political change, and Robin should talk more about that. However, you say in your book that organizing for systemic change begins with relationships. Can you elaborate on that?Well, think about Stacey Abrams, who's a very current example of the power of organizing, and how did she, and the people who work with her, organize the voters in Georgia? They went door-to-door. They connected with voters. They built relationships. They saw each others humanity, and they listened and heard one another. The outcome was at a systemic level, but it started with the interpersonal. I don't see that they can be separated. Institutions are not people, but people make up institutions. And the collective biases of those people are translated into policies and practices that affect individual lives.Here's another line from your book that intrigued me. How can anti-racist education make White people more efficient racists?Well, I want to be careful to answer that because, of course, I believe in anti-racist education. I am an educator, but if anti-racist education is not sustained and followed up, then we have a superficial understanding that can allow us to cover up our mistakes and say things like, Oh, I know I have privilege. But our actual behaviors are not changing. It can make us more confident and more complacent and believe that we've arrived, that we know all we need to know, and that we are the ones that are now ready to enlighten everybody else. We begin to point our fingers outward, but rarely ever inward.What do critics tend to get wrong about your work?One is a reaction to my generalizing about White people. That, of course, is a challenge to the ideology of individualism, which is the idea that we're all different and unique, and if you don't know me you can't say anything about me. We are, of course, individuals. I don't know you and all the specifics about you. But we are also members of social groups, and by virtue of our membership in those social groups, we could literally predict whether you and your mother and me and my mother were going to survive our births based on the fact that I'm White and you're Black. There is a collective shared experience, and while there are always exceptions, let's talk about the rule. How 'good White people' derail racial progress  Sometimes I'll see a critique such as, can you believe that Robin says White people are racist. And I always want to ask that person, take a moment and define the criteria by which you would grant that somebody's racist and it's probably going to come down to individual consciously malintent across race. And if that's how you think about racism then I would agree that it's offensive for me to generalize about you because I actually don't think most racism is perpetrated consciously or intentionally, but the impact is still harmful. I'm talking about a system infused with ideologies, racist policies and practices that shapes all of us. The other one is this issue of guilt. I think people who say that I am seeking to invoke guilt are willfully misreading my work. I am very clear that I am not interested in guilt, very clear that I have absorbed racist ideology. I unwittingly enact racial harm. It's on me to address that guilt and the best antidote to guilt is actual reparative action. Guilt serves no one, and while it's a natural response to coming to awareness of this reality, you've got to move through it. Otherwise, it just functions to excuse inaction and to pressure everyone around you to take care of your feelings. What about people who say that a White person shouldn't teach others about racism, that you can't understand it like people of color, and that you should stay out of this space for other Black and brown voices?I don't understand the Black experience, but I do understand the White experience. While I believe that Black people understand the White experience more deeply than White people do because they've had to understand it to navigate it across their lives, there is a place where they just can't know what it is to be White. And that's the piece that I can take up and I can pick it up in a way that is both visible to White people in a way that it wasn't before and is undeniable. It's so much harder to deny a shared experience, and I can articulate it in that way. It was never meant to be a zero-sum game where you only listen to a White person. If you're really engaging with my work, it will lead you right to all the people of color who have been saying these things for a very long time. But unfortunately, White people don't tend to be as open to it. Supporters of Black Lives Matter hold signs during a protest on June 10, 2020, in Los Angeles.Are you surprised that so many White politicians and school leaders are upset about critical race theory? In some ways, I am surprised that it's gone as far as actual legislation making illegal to talk about systemic racism. That's incredible. But we are in a moment where both sides are amplified. So the progress that the Black Lives Matter movement has made has definitely geared up the resistance to that progress. Now true critical race comes out of legal scholarship. And by that definition, I'm not a critical race theorist. It's a very refined academic field. It's used though by the right or those who want to silence these conversations as a stand-in for systemic racism, as a way to not acknowledge the existence of systemic racism. It's perfect in a way because it sounds problematic to an uninitiated ear, right? So first of all, you have the word critical. Oh, that sounds like criticism. And if you don't have an academic background, you don't understand that critical means deep thinking, a deep analysis. And the theory makes it sound like it's just some people's radical thoughts and this is not proven in any way.  It's just really easy to dismiss it as some crackpot thing that's being taught by radicals to turn children against one another. It really does underscore a point I made earlier that racism is a highly adaptive system and it adapts to challenges.You coined a term, \"White Fragility,\" that shapes the way we now talk about race, and you've traveled the world talking about your last book. But were there challenges and pressures you never anticipated that came with the book's success?  Absolutely. I am not somebody who sought to be a public figure. I'm not in journalism. I'm not a TV anchor. I'm an academic. And I didn't set out to coin a tern that would shape the way we talk about race. I could never have dreamed that my book would be as successful as it was. And so I have been surprised at the intensity of the criticism. With that level of visibility comes a pretty vicious level of critique. There's something about racism that really gets people emotional.How have you navigated the criticism?Yeah, I mean, you do get a tougher skin, and I have to work hard to keep perspective. And I remember all of the hundreds, if not thousands of emails, I get from people across the racial spectrum thanking me for my work. Those words just aren't as loud as the other voices. And so, I try to keep a perspective. I am not on social media. I don't think I could get up in the morning if I read it.And there are people in my life, both White and Black, that I trust dearly, and that I have, what I call accountability relationships. What I am clear about more than ever as a result of this last year is that absolutely no one can always get it right on race. So you have to find that center within yourself, and your integrity to keep doing what you believe. I surround myself with people with a deep understanding of systemic racism, and I talk through these challenges.",

She was a redhead with freckles from Wisconsin who worked in corporate recruiting. They talked about everything from sci-fi movies and her love for the rock group Bon Jovi to whether the Lord of the Rings film trilogy did justice to J.R.R. Tolkien's books. He asked for permission to kiss her on their first date. She said yes.When Ian and Michelle Horne got married, he wore a purple tie on their wedding day because it was her favorite color.  As the years rolled by, they got matching tattoos and gave each other nicknames from the movie, \"The Princess Bride.\" He called her Princess Buttercup and she called him \"Farm Boy Wesley.\" They made plans to visit Ireland this year to celebrate her Irish roots. Then came the pandemic. Last fall, after a long battle, Michelle Horne died from complications caused by Covid-19. Ian Horne's \"superpower,\" as he called her, was gone. They had been married almost 10 years. But not long after his wife's death, the morning radio deejay in Wichita, Kansas, wondered if Michelle was still speaking to him. He was driving to his job in the predawn darkness when he spotted something odd. About two dozen streetlights flanking the highway had turned purple. They looked like a lavender string of pearls glowing in the night sky. Michelle and Ian Horne. The couple were married almost 10 years.Read MoreHorne took it as a sign. \"Michelle knew that was my route to work that I take every morning and was the route she took on her final drive to the hospital,\" says Horne, who hosts his morning show on 101.3 KFDI as \"JJ Hayes.\" \"I remember simply smiling and feeling overwhelmed with the idea that Michelle was close.\"Reported encounters with departed loved ones are not uncommonThe coronavirus pandemic has now killed more than 600,000 Americans. Many of us never had a chance to hug or say farewell to loved ones who died alone and isolated in hospital wards due to fears of spreading the virus. But there is another group of pandemic survivors who say they have been granted a second chance to say goodbye. They are people like Horne who believe they've been contacted by a loved one who died from coronavirus.These experiences can be subtle: relatives appearing in hyper-real dreams, a sudden whiff of fragrance worn by a departed loved one, or unusual behavior by animals. Other encounters are more dramatic: feeling a touch on your shoulder at night, hearing a sudden warning from a loved one, or seeing the full-bodied form of a recently departed relative appear at the foot of your bed. These stories may sound implausible, but they are in fact part of a historical pattern. There is something in us -- or in our lost loved ones -- that won't accept not being able to say goodbye.And whenever there is a massive tragedy such as a pandemic, a war or a natural disaster, there is a corresponding surge in reports of people seeing the dead or trying to contact them.After mass tragedies such as wars many Americans have turned to Ouija boards in an attempt to contact departed loved ones.The 1918 influenza epidemic sparked a \"spiritualism craze\" as Americans turned to seances and Ouija boards to contact departed loved ones. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks came a wave of people reporting sightings of and even conversations with those who had been snatched from their lives. When a tsunami struck Japan in 2011, killing at least 20,000 people, so many inhabitants of Ishinomaki reported seeing their loved ones appear that a book and a documentary were made about this city of wandering ghosts. \"These kind of reports are normal in my world,\" says Scott Janssen, an author who has worked in the hospice field for years and studies these experiences. \"It would make sense that in a pandemic or other event that leads to mass deaths that there will be a numerical increase in reports and experiences, given the shared grief and trauma.\"Read more from John Blake:The look in Derek Chauvin's eyes was something worse than hateThere was no racial reckoningDid Black lives matter to Abraham Lincoln? It's complicatedTwo enemies discover a 'higher call' in battleA war hero who was a stranger in his own landTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same sinceHow 'good White people' derail racial progressThese experiences are so common in the psychological field that there is a name for them: ADCs, or \"after death communications.\" Research suggests at least 60 million Americans have these experiences, and that they occur across cultures, religious beliefs, ethnicities and income levels. Many of these encounters occur in the twilight state between sleeping and waking, but others have been reported by people who were alert.Bill Guggenheim, co-author of \"Hello from Heaven,\" a book that explores ADCs, believes there is a spiritual purpose behind the visits. \"They want you to know they're still alive, and that you'll be reunited with them when it's your turn to leave your lifetime on Earth,\" he writes. \"They want to assure you they'll be there to meet you and greet you -- and perhaps even to assist you -- as you make your own transition.\"A dining room encounter with a beloved auntADCs may serve another function in the world created by Covid -- to reassure people who couldn't be at the side of their loved ones when they died. Consider the story of Jamie Jackson, an office manager who lives near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and her beloved \"Aunt Pat.\" Jackson's aunt died of a heart attack last summer after complications from Covid. Jackson said her aunt was like a mother to her -- someone she spent summers with and accompanied to the hospital for routine medical visits.But when her aunt was afflicted with Covid, Jackson couldn't visit the hospital to reassure her. \"That was the hardest thing,\" Jackson says. \"You can't say goodbye and you can't be there as an advocate for your loved one, which is difficult because you have somebody who's in the hospital, who's scared and not used to being alone.\"Gloves worn by pallbearers are draped on the casket of retired officer Charles Jackson Jr., who died from Covid-19 in April 2020 in Los Angeles. Covid restrictions prevented many people from saying goodbye to dying loved ones in person.Seven months later, though, Jackson says she heard from her aunt again.It was December, and Jackson was putting up Christmas decorations in the house while Bing Crosby sang holiday carols. Christmas was one of her aunt's favorite holidays, and she loved decorating. Jackson's bin was filled with the same decorations that once belonged to her aunt.Jackson says she left the bin in her hallway to get something and when she returned, she saw a translucent figure peering into it. It was the figure of a petite woman, with the same haircut, color of hair and white blouse and blue slacks that her aunt used to wear. Jackson froze. Her hearted started pounding. She fled to her dining room and started crying. When she returned, the figure was gone. She says it was her aunt.\"It was overwhelming,\" Jackson says. \"It's hard to put into words. I felt touched by that. It's obvious that she's around and she's visiting me.\"A cold hand on a shoulder and a whiff of perfume  Some post-Covid paranormal encounters are even more dramatic.  One woman says she was literally touched by a loved one who died from complications from Covid. Marie Pina teaches English as a second language in Manitoba, Canada.  She says her 79-year-old mother, Inez, was about to be released from the hospital last November when there was a Covid outbreak in her ward. She tested positive and was put in isolation. She returned home the next month, but had lost her strength. About four months after her diagnosis, her mother died. On the morning of her mother's death, Pina says she was reaching for her slippers in her bedroom when she felt a cold hand on her shoulder. She turned and saw her mother sitting beside her, staring straight ahead with no expression. She looked 20 years younger.\"Her touch was cold, like she had just come from outside,\" Pina says.Family members gather to mourn a lost relative at the Continental Funeral Home on December 20, 2020 in East Los Angeles.One day not long after that morning, Pina reported another classic characteristic of an ADC. She was making spinach soup, one of her mom's favorites, when she suddenly smelled the fragrance associated with her mother -- a combination of White Diamond perfume and her mom's Chi hairspray.\"The scent was overpowering,\" Pina says. \"My husband and I stood in the kitchen awestruck as I stirred the soup. We both could smell it. It lasted for approximately five minutes before evaporating.\"Talk to people who have these experiences, and many will acknowledge that maybe their minds created the episode. Others insist the visitations were too real to deny. Jackson, who lost her aunt, says it's almost irrelevant if they're real or not. Their impact is real, she says. They made her feel better. \"If I needed to see it and it made me feel better and that's all it was, I'm okay with that,\" she says. \"I tell people if they don't want to believe me, that's fine. I don't need to explain to other people.\"Some paranormal visitations aren't so welcomeOther ADCs are more chilling. Some paranormal experiences happen to people who are not reassured by them.\"Some people are creeped out by these things and are certainly not looking for them,\" says Janssen, the hospice worker.  \"For some it clashes with worldviews or religious beliefs. Some people have visits like this years after the fact when they are not grieving, or have visits from people with whom they have struggled and from whom they might not actually wish to have a visit.\"Many victims of coronavirus died alone in hospitals, depriving family members of closure.Haunting ADCs also are common during wartime. War memoirs are filled with stories of combat veterans reporting creepy, after-death visitations from fallen comrades or even enemy soldiers they've killed. In the classic memoir, \"What It Is like to Go to War,\" Karl Marlantes, a Vietnam veteran, wrote about how the ghost of a North Vietnamese soldier he killed stalked him years after he returned home.In one striking passage, Marlantes relates how he exorcised his enemy's ghost. He arranged a private mass with a priest at 2 in the morning at an old church where he says he saw the spirits of the enemies he killed and the comrades who died under his command file into the pews. Even his late grandparents appeared, smiling as if they approved.Counselors working with veterans often hear such stories, Janssen says.\"I've been doing this a long time and I consider it a near universal [phenomenon] that after a particularly heavy engagement, a lot of people in your unit are lost, it is inevitable that some of those troops are going to receive visits from their buddies,\" he says.An unusual bird sighting and a cry in the nightHorne, the radio DJ, reports having other after-death encounters with his late wife. Not long after she died, he was sitting on the deck in his backyard when a cardinal landed on a branch in front of him. Cardinals, according to folklore, often appear when loved ones are near. Horne was struck by the bird because he says cardinals don't normally show up in Kansas in autumn. Horne says he's had moments when he's clearly heard Michelle call to him in the night: \"Ian, wake up!\"\"It's as if she's in the room with me,\" he says. \"It's enough to snap me awake, and I'm a deep, hard sleeper. Call it an auditory hallucination or what you want, but I definitely hear it.\"Perceived messages from deceased loved ones can be comforting but also unsettling.Both signs are comforting to him in part because Horne remembers how Michelle fought so hard to live. He says her immune system was weakened after she received a kidney transplant several years ago. When the pandemic hit, they both dreaded what would happen if she got the virus.After their worst fears proved true, Horne says it seemed at first as if Michelle would survive. She endured a lengthy hospital stay, which included being put on a ventilator, but was released last October. She worked hard to get better, but there were times when Michelle's natural optimism wavered. Horne says she once told him, \"I'm such a burden to you. You don't deserve this. You should just leave.\"He kept encouraging her in physical therapy. \"I was in it for the long haul, for better or for worse,\" he says.Michelle's body, though, didn't have the strength for the long haul. She died from a heart attack last October, her body weakened by Covid, Horne says. She was 50. Horne's radio audience has rallied around him. He's shared his story on the air and it's been featured in local newspapers. He finds it cathartic to talk about Michelle. \"I feel that a person dies twice -- once when they have their physical death and the second time, when we stop saying their name,\" he says. \"Any opportunity I have to talk about Michelle, I will take it.\"Purple streetlights in Wichita, Kansas, which Ian Horne thinks are a signal from his late wife.Yet in an odd way, Michelle may be still talking to Horne, even after he first saw those purple streetlights.When they were married, Horne developed a ritual with Michelle. She worried about his safety driving to work in the dark each morning. After he arrived, he would reassure Michelle by texting: \"I'm here. I love you.\"The purple lights in Wichita are still shining. Horne keeps seeing them on his morning commute. It's as if Michelle is responding with a similar message.He's not sure how long the purple lights will remain. He called the city of Wichita and they attributed the faulty lights to a defective batch. They told him they were going to replace the lights. He's in no rush for that to happen.\"I'm kind of honestly hoping that they don't,\" Horne says.  \"I will always believe that Michelle turned them purple. Whether she actually did or not, that's up to a reader or viewer to decide. They can explain it away ... I believe it was a way for Michelle to be with me on my ride to work.\"And I hope they never change.\"",

        "content": "Washington  (CNN)The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection is planning to produce a multi-media presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative, multiple sources tell CNN. The online multi-media presentation, which would include links to key video evidence, would be in addition to a traditional written report, according to a source familiar with the committee's work. Presenting its information in a comprehensive and engaging way will be crucial to creating a convincing argument for potential legislative changes as well as possible criminal referrals.  It's also a recognition of how most people consume information in 2022 -- and the massive amount of video evidence the committee has at its disposal. \"We don't want it to read like a clunky committee effort,\" Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told CNN. \"We want it to have an authorial voice that tells the story of what happened.\" Read MoreThe effort to hire a writer, confirmed to CNN by three sources familiar with the discussions, comes as the panel enters a new stage of its investigation. After collecting mountains of information, committee members must now determine how much of it to use in building its case to a public still inundated with images of rioting at the US Capitol but which may not understand the full extent of the efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The committee plans to hold a series of hearings as early as May. Since last year, the committee has also been talking to people involved in the 9/11 commission for advice and guidance on how to incorporate its findings into a final report.\"The committee takes seriously its duty to make sure the historic record is as complete as possible,\" said the source familiar with the committee's work. \"It is dedicated to making sure the report is accessible, with all the facts and gravity of what happened.\"Some of these details were first reported Friday morning by the Washington Post, which said the committee is looking to recruit high-profile journalists. According to a source familiar with the matter, the committee has reached out to at least one journalist. Describing the type of candidate to take on the writing job, another source familiar with the decision said \"the person who writes a press release isn't necessarily the person that's going to write the deep dive, and making sure that they can put the time and energy into it, was something that we talked about.\"The source added that Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the panel, first raised the idea of hiring an outside writer as early as November, and that it has remained an active conversation since.\"The last we left it was it's something that we're seeking, but we also have someone in house who's taking on an expanded role to help,\" the source said.'In the slog'The process of winnowing down hundreds of witness testimonies and thousands of documents has spurred debate among committee members about how best to complete their work ahead of the midterm elections in the fall. One source described the committee as being \"in the slog\" with committee members and staff still thrashing out the best way to communicate everything they have gathered.The difficulty, this source says, is how to tell the story about people trying to overthrow the government without making it seem too political or polarizing.   There has also been no decision yet about whether the committee will decide to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department, the source added. In a recent court filing, the panel alleged that right wing lawyer John Eastman and former President Donald Trump were part of a \"criminal conspiracy\" to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Shadow of the Mueller reportWhoever the committee hires to help craft its narrative will face the daunting task of turning months of material into a cogent report. The committee has already interviewed nearly 750 witnesses and collected more than 84,000 documents. It's also spent more than $2 million. In recent months, the committee's staff has grown to more than 40 people. A review of publicly available information reveals the staff's expertise varies widely, and often includes a law degree from top schools, such as the University of Virginia, Georgetown, Stanford or UCLA.  Several attorneys for the committee have experience with the Department of Justice, including one who prosecuted notorious Mexican drug cartel leader Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. Another served as an immigration attorney. Others spent time at DHS and on Capitol Hill.The panel has the added burden of operating in the shadow of the 2019 Mueller report, which at more than 400 pages was largely seen as underwhelming and had trouble breaking through to the American people after years of heightened anticipation. \"The Muller report is the example of how we don't want it to read,\" said Raskin.Decisions still to be madeThompson has told reporters the committee could wrap up depositions as early as April 1. He has been reluctant to put a specific timeline as to when a report will be released.\"It's a moving target. I mean, I wish I could tell you,\" Thompson told CNN. \"We have some timetables, but when we get 10,000 pages of information that we need to go through, it moves.\"If the panel wraps up its depositions by April, it would likely leave a number of key Trump allies who have been subpoenaed in limbo, including Rudy Giuliani and former White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino.  Giuliani has been engaging with the committee, through his attorney, and has signaled a willingness to answer questions but no formal cooperation agreement has been reached.  President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani speaks to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House on January 6, 2021.While many close Trump allies have dodged the committee's attempts to compel them to cooperate, the committee has quietly had success obtaining testimony from a handful of lesser-known White House aides and staffers who were in the West Wing on January 6. In recent months, the committee has interviewed Nick Luna, former President Donald Trump's body man, Cassidy Hutchinson a former aide to then-chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Ross Worthington, a White House aide and one of the writers of Trump's speech on the ellipse on January 6.The committee has also had success in getting some level of cooperation from some Trump campaign officials. Katrina Pierson, a prominent campaign spokesperson who was part of a West Wing meeting leading up to January 6 has met with the committee, as has Max Miller a former White House and campaign official who is now running for Congress.Jason Miller, a long time spokesperson for Trump also met with the committee and his deposition was prominently featured in a legal brief filed by the committee designed to block Eastman's attempts to keep secret a tranche of emails the conservative attorney claimed should be protected by attorney client privilege.Exclusive: Newly obtained records show Trump and Jim Jordan spoke at length on morning of January 6Members on the panel have also yet to make a decision on whether they want to subpoena their colleagues, such as Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, as the Republican lawmakers they have requested to hear from that hold key information have all turned down the voluntary requests. \"We're doing multiple things at once,\" committee member Rep. Pete Aguilar told CNN, referring to the multiple and simultaneous conversations that are ongoing not only about the process moving forward but the questions hanging over the investigation. The lack of cooperation from key holdouts however, will not slow the panel's investigation down, according to members on the committee. \"We really want to have engagement with everybody we approached. But some we've been able to get it and some we haven't,\" Thompson said. \"We haven't given up. It's just that our report didn't rise or fall on one or two individuals.\"Aguilar, a California Democrat, told CNN, \"Maybe we won't ever hear from some of them. But we're not giving up yet. And we're still pursuing lines that would help us get the information we need.\"But just because members believe they can complete their investigation using alternative information sources, does not mean they will stop short of holding individuals accountable, even issuing criminal contempt referrals for specific subpoena targets after the final report is released.\"I think the committee is quite serious that everybody needs to participate. So yeah, I don't think we give anybody a free pass,\" said Raskin. \"You know, what, one possibility is? That we draft a report, and we wait until the end to see if we get everybody's participation.\"  There is also no firm agreement over what the structure or topic of the long-awaited series of hearings will be, even as the panel enters the time frame for when they have said they will take place. \"We're, having those conversations now on what this looks like, timing and which topics to address first,\" said Aguilar.CNN's Whitney Wild contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Top aides to Vice President Mike Pence did not discuss direct conversations with former President Donald Trump over several hours of questioning in recent interviews with the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, three sources familiar with the probe tell CNN.The aides, Marc Short and Greg Jacob, drew that line on what they'd be willing to discuss because Trump's legal team had instructed them not to reveal presidential conversations that the former President's lawyers believe should be covered under executive privilege, the sources said.The committee was aware there would be privilege concerns. The privilege claims rarely came into play during the uncontentious interviews, and the Pence aides only declined to answer a few questions, according to sources. The witnesses did answer questions about conversations they had with the vice president, the sources said.The parameters set in the interviews are the latest indication that Trump still seeks to keep secret his actions in the White House up to and on January 6, 2021 -- and reveal some details about exactly how his legal team is trying to do that. Specifically, Trump's team is invoking the presidential communications privilege that protects from disclosure communications with the president directly so that there can be candor in executive branch decision-making.Read MoreAs CNN has reported, Pence would prefer his aides act as the former vice president's \"proxy\" so he does not have to appear. And deferring to Trump on executive privilege claims sends a message to the former President and his base that Pence and his aides are not crossing him.Representatives for Short, Jacob and the Trump campaign didn't respond to requests for comment this week.Trump's legal team is still trying to draw lines around executive privilege despite losing a lawsuit against the House investigation at the Supreme Court. Also this week, the National Archives revealed that Trump is attempting to assert executive privilege over more than 100 documents from the vice president's office. Former Trump DOJ official Jeffrey Clark met with January 6 committee for nearly two hoursThe House investigation has already swept in vast amounts of information from witnesses -- and the pair of crucial interviews with Pence aides comes as they seek insight into the pressure campaign on the former vice president to block the certification of Joe Biden's electoral win on January 6. Pence refused to go along with Trump and some of his advisers' wishes. The committee has interviewed 475 witnesses, obtained 60,000 documents and followed up on 375 tips to their hotline.The interviews with Short and Jacob could be some of the most illuminating of the House probe. Short, Pence's former chief of staff, was with Pence in the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he participated in a White House meeting days before where John Eastman, an outside attorney working with Trump, explained a fringe legal theory for how he believed Pence could block the Electoral College vote in Congress. Jacob, Pence's general counsel, was part of the team that advised Pence against Eastman's plan, and received an email from Eastman during the Capitol riot that blamed Pence for the violence.Some committee members have cast Pence and his office as heroes who thwarted a President willing to flout the law for his own personal gain. While Trump continues to criticize Pence, saying again this week that he had the power to overturn the election results, the former vice president stands by his decision to uphold the Constitution and certify the election.But it's not clear yet whether Pence himself will cooperate with the House investigation.Given Pence's long-term political interest, including potentially running for president in the future, Trump's former running mate still must appease a Republican base unhappy that Trump didn't hold onto his office.",

        "content": "(CNN)In the weeks leading up to January 6, one of Donald Trump's campaign lawyers wrote memos outlining how she believed then-Vice President Mike Pence could reject electoral college votes and overturn the 2020 election, including one theory that he could ignore a federal law.On January 5, Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis sent a memo to former presidential lawyer Jay Sekulow, which was first reported by Politico. The memo took aim at the federal statute, the Electoral Count Act, which lays out the procedures by which Congress certifies an election, while giving the vice president a limited role in the ceremonial process.Ellis argued that a key provision of the law violated the US Constitution, and she suggested that the supposed constitutional flaw in the act may allow Pence to ignore a provision in the law that limited his ability to disrupt Congress' certification of the 2020 election.In another memo Ellis sent to Trump in December, which was revealed in Jonathan Karl's book \"Betrayal\"  that was published this fall, Ellis claimed that Pence could refuse to open the envelopes holding the electoral college votes from any states that officials claimed were fraudulent.\"I was very public in saying that all Pence could do was open the envelopes,\" Sekulow told CNN on Friday. Sekulow added that Pence \"had a ministerial role.\"Read More\"My view then and my view now is the Vice President didn't have the authority do anything other than the ministerial functions outlined in the Constitution,\" Sekulow said.Ellis said in a tweet Friday that she \"never advocated Pence had the authority to overturn the election,\" and that the memos simply outlined \"legal theories I explored. In a second tweet, she claimed that Politico violated attorney-client privilege.Conservative attorney John Eastman also put forward a memo using a different theory claiming that Pence was the \"ultimate arbiter\" of the electoral count and could thus stop the ballot count. Trump reportedly urged Pence to consider the strategy in a meeting on January 4.",

And the progressives say they won't make it smaller. But explain: Why can't they come up with an acceptable way to make it smaller and give Americans lots of stuff they want -- like lower drug prices? Why are they endangering already endangered seats heading into an already dangerous midterm election for Democrats? Why can't they behave as, er, adults?As if on cue, Democrats faced with the possibility of actually passing popular legislation somehow divide into warring factions. Republicans just watch, get out of the way and cannot believe their great good luck. Republican bad behavior on voting against an increase in the debt ceiling gets short shrift while the Democrats dither on the budget.That Biden needs a big win is obvious. As John Podesta, a Clinton and Obama White House veteran, put it in a memo to his fellow Democrats: \"President Biden has staked his presidency on demonstrating to the American people ... that democracy can deliver. A democracy that fails to solve the problems of its constituents is a failing democracy.\"Ipso facto, a president that cannot deliver is a failing president. So it's either compromise or catastrophe. If the Democrats cannot get over their differences this time around, they will have demonstrated that the Democratic Party is not ready to be a governing party.Read More\"My message is we're either going to swim together or sink together,\" Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin tells me. \"Every man or woman for themselves doesn't work.\"It's almost hard to believe that Democrats are engaging in such potentially self-destructive behavior. Maybe all of this is just one big kabuki dance so the moderates and the progressives can shout their priorities before getting down to business and getting something passed. Failure is so irrational; it seems impossible they would accept it. Then again, you never know how myopic or ideological they will turn out to be.Consider this: Most of the items in the budget bill are things Democrats would love to campaign on (lower drug prices and health care costs, attacking climate change). If they get nothing, why would Democratic voters turn out in the 2022 midterms? The opportunity cost is huge, not to mention the cost to the presidency. If Democratic promises are killed by Democratic infighting, Republicans can say \"I told you so\" -- and with good reason.It's obvious that the sheer weight of these bills could push it all to collapse. The Democrats have proposed nothing less than a wholesale rewrite of the nation's social safety net. At some point, after Democrats figure out that failure really is not an option, maybe they'll get together and work out how to get in a room without bright red lines and write something they can agree on. If they can't, they'll all sink -- along with the President.You have to believe they understand this enough to get out of their own way. And get to yes.",

It takes a calf a little under a year and a half to fully develop in the womb, and they nurse for another year. The Southern Resident population has reduced to 75 animals, and has not had a successful birth in three years. In the past 20 years, only 25% of the babies have survived. \"Extinction is looming,\" Center for Whale Research founder Ken Balcomb told CNN.  CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

This year, nine of them will be used to hold the remains of US military veterans.\"I wanted to make it real clear the status of these Americans -- they're mostly homeless and they were also veterans with full military honors and nobody claimed their bodies,\" said Perez.Gino Perez's wood and metal shop class at Valley High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico.On any given night in America, there are more than 40,000 homeless veterans, according to the latest estimate by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.When honorably discharged, homeless or indigent veterans die in New Mexico, the Forgotten Heroes Burial Program provides a full military funeral at Santa Fe National Cemetery if there are no family members or friends to claim their remains or there is no money to provide for their funeral services, according to the New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services. The program launched in 2011.Read More\"We will do a full on military funeral with Taps, a three-volley salute, the governor gives a eulogy and we invite the public to be a part,\" said Ray Seva, a spokesman for the New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services. \"The public and the other veterans there, they become like the family.\"\"We provide the final salute that they deserve,\" Seva said.The veterans' remains have historically been placed in black cardboard boxes, said Larry Gallegos, a spokesman for Bernalillo County.\"They were elegant and nice but he (Perez) said they deserve more than a cardboard box,\" Gallegos said.\"It's a lot more dignified, in my opinion, to be encased in wood,\" Perez said.Urns built by this New Mexico shop class will hold the remains of veterans.Perez, who has been a teacher for four years and is a Navy veteran himself was looking for a way to get his students involved in the community, while learning about metal and woodworking.\"I've never seen a group of students engage in a project like this. Even students that were down on the military for whatever reason -- they've all got their politics -- would say we're doing a good thing,\" Perez said.Perez's three shop classes of about 30, mostly freshmen, students each completed the boxes in just the first few weeks of school.The Valley High School shop class made 18 wooden urns.\"It was one of the neatest things I've ever seen,\" said Perez. \"The speed which they did these projects is amazing.\"He added: \"We set it up kind of like an assembly line -- a project-based learning idea. Some accused me of sneaking in to work on the urns at night, but I assure you the kids did it all. All I did was keep them off their phones and keep them safe working with the equipment.\"The students' work will be recognized Sept. 20 at an assembly that will include New Mexico Department of Veterans' Services Secretary Jack Fox, Bernalillo County Commissioner Debbie O'Malley and Joshua McManigal of Daniels Family Funeral Services, who all partner in the Forgotten Heroes Burial Program. \"It is amazing what these kids did,\" Perez said. \"Most of the students are freshmen.

The cemetery is administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.This year's the forgotten heroes burial will take place on Oct. 4, Seva said.There will be a ceremony in Albuquerque where the remains will be put in a hearse and turned over from Bernalillo County to the state Department of Veterans' Services, Gallegos said. They will then travel 55 miles to Santa Fe escorted by police cars, fire engines and about 100 motorcycle-riding veterans who are members the American Legion Riders.\"They served our country and they should be given the respectful burial that they deserve,\" Gallegos said.",

She was 88.\"It was unexpected at that moment,\" Downes-Le Guin said. \"Her health had not been great.\"The acclaimed author penned everything from short stories to children's books, but was best known for her work in the science fiction and fantasy realm. Le Guin's stories challenged traditional ideas of power, gender and race with stories of young wizards, dragons and outer space.She is perhaps best known for her Earthsea series, beginning with \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" in 1968. They are set on the archipelago world of Earthsea, where language is power, and a young wizard learns about morality and consequences.Read MoreShe won five Hugo awards, science fiction's most prestigious honor, for titles including \"The Left Hand of Darkness,\" set on the planet of Gethen where fixed gender identity doesn't exist; \"The Dispossessed,\" which Le Guin called an \"anarchist utopia\" novel, and \"The Word for World is Forest,\" where colonists from Earth have enslaved the native planet population.Le Guin took many standard tropes of the fantasy and sci-fi genres and left them behind or turned them on their heads. Her books avoid simple black-and-white moral victories, and don't draw stark distinctions between good and evil. Her main characters often address conflict not with a big sword battle or fight, but with brains.The US Library of Congress designated Le Guin a Living Legend in 2000, for her significant contribution to America's cultural heritage.She had lived in Portland for almost 60 years and had lived in the same house for the past 36 years.Downes-Le Guin described growing up with a mother with such a rich imagination. \"She was an extraordinary conversationalist,\" he said. \"There was never a wasted conversation.\"Last year, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt published a book of her essays titled \"No Time to Spare: Thinking About What Matters.\"She had also written books on poetry and writing that are still unpublished, Downs-Le Guin said. I just learned that Ursula K. Le Guin has died. Her words are always with us. Some of them are written on my soul.

Still honoured I got to do this: https://t.co/U4mma5pJMw\u2014 Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) January 23, 2018\n\nNeil Gaiman, a seven-time Hugo winner, remembered Le Guin for her wit and brains.\"Her words are always with us. Some of them are written on my soul,\" he wrote. \"I miss her as a glorious funny prickly person, & I miss her as the deepest and smartest of the writers, too.\"Writer Shannon Hale lamented Le Guin's death.\"She is a master storytell(er). She is fierce and frighteningly smart and does not tolerate fools. Her EARTHSEA books are a revelation,\" Hale tweeted.\"Look at the top tier of writers in science fiction and fantasy today ... and you see the unmistakable traces of Le Guin in their work,\" author John Scalzi wrote in the Los Angeles Times. \"Multiple generations of her spiritual children, making the genre more humane and expansive, and better than it would have been without her.\" In 2014, LeGuin was awarded the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. In her speech, she decried commercialism in publishing.\"We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable,\" she said. \"So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art and very often in our art, the art of words.\"Le Guin was born Ursula Kroeber in Berkeley, California. Her mother was a writer and anthropologist and her father was an anthropologist. She went to Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and received a Masters from Columbia University in New York.In 1953 she married Charles Le Guin, a historian. Her website says she wrote 20 novels, six collections of poetry and many short stories. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

The administration of Hern\u00e1ndez has also been dogged by allegations of corruption and drug trafficking.In his inauguration speech, Hernandez said he was \"ready to listen to any proposal without barriers because that is what dialogue is about, which will lead us to reconciliation and the healing of the Honduran people.\" Read MoreHis new term will run through 2022.

        "content": "Story highlightsSister Catherine Ann Cesnik was 26 when she disappeared in 1969; her body was found weeks laterBaltimore County Police exhumed the body of a priest for DNA testing in the case (CNN)The exhumation of a Catholic priest's body by Baltimore County Police could hold the key to solving the 47-year-old cold case of a murdered nun.On February 28, police opened the grave of Rev. A. Joseph Maskell after securing an order from the state's attorney, according to Elise Armacost, director of public affairs for Baltimore County Police.Police took DNA samples from the corpse to check against a DNA profile developed from evidence taken in 1970 from the scene in Maryland where the badly decomposed body of Sister Catherine Ann Cesnik had been found by a father and son out hunting. The 26-year-old nun had been missing for nearly two months.In the decades since the nun's killing and as DNA testing has become a vital investigative tool, Baltimore County police have compared the DNA of several other people as part of their investigation into the never-closed case, according to Armacost, but those tests did not match the DNA profile from 1970.The current team of cold case detectives, assigned the Cesnik case in 2016, began discussing the exhumation of Maskell almost immediately, but it took time to get proper authorization.  Read More\"Determining whether Maskell's DNA matches the evidence remaining from the crime scene is a 'box' that must be checked,\" said Armacost.Now, police are awaiting results of DNA from the body of Maskell, a priest who was accused in the 1990s of sexually assaulting young women. They are waiting to learn if those results link Maskell to the death of a nun who, according to an attorney, was a confidant to young women who had been assaulted by the priest.Sexual assault allegations against the priestIn the 1990s, sexual assault and abuse allegations began to surface against Maskell, who had served as a chaplain at Archbishop Keough High School in Baltimore. In 1992, two female former students came forward to say Maskell abused them. By 1994, they and several other students had filed a lawsuit alleging physical and sexual abuse by Maskell through the 1960s and 1970s, according to Armacost. Sean Caine, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, said the archdiocese removed Maskell from his post as soon as they learned of the allegations in 1992, in order to conduct their own investigation. He was permanently removed from the ministry in 1994. While police were never able to bring charges against the priest, Caine said that 16 people who said Maskell abused them have since received money from the archdiocese as part of financial agreements.According to Armacost, in 1994 one of the students who claimed abuse by Maskell when she was in high school said that he took her to a remote dumping area and showed her Cesnik's decaying body as a warning of what would happen if she told anyone about him.Joanne Suder, an attorney for many of Maskell's sexual abuse victims, said, \"If law enforcement, in general, had done their job back in 1970, they'd have brought Maskell in then and this wouldn't have all been necessary in 2017.\"\"There's no question that my clients told Sister Cathy (Cesnik) what was going on,\" Suder said. \"There's no question she told them she would do something about it.\"According to Armacost, Baltimore County police in 1994 took the alleged victim's statement seriously and interviewed Maskell, himself once the chaplain for the Baltimore County Police and other area law enforcement agencies. But investigators found only a few inconsistencies in some statements, and detectives were unable to find any damning evidence against the priest.Maskell was never charged.\"(Cesnik) was a nun. The church was her life and the people important to her were in the church,\" said Armacost. \"The theory that she was killed because she knew something about abuse that was going on by priests within the church continues to be a theory, but is not the only theory. It continues to be one of several theories.\"By 1994, Maskell no longer worked at the high school and was the pastor of Holy Cross Church in Baltimore. When he was removed from the ministry he fled to Ireland, where he lived for a time before returning to the Baltimore area, according to police. He died in 2001, police said.An alternate theoryCesnik was 26 and on a sabbatical from the Roman Catholic Church. She had moved to an apartment outside the convent with another nun and began teaching at Western High School in Baltimore on November 7, 1969, when she left her apartment to run an errand at Edmondson Village Shopping Center in Baltimore, according to Armacost. When she didn't come home, her roommate reported her missing the next day.Sister Catherine Ann Cesnik was last seen alive on November 7, 1969. Her body was found January 3, 1970. The case remains open and unsolved.Her body was found in Lansdowne, south of Baltimore, on January 3, 1970. An autopsy found Cesnik died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to police. Her case has remained open ever since, Armacost said.One of Baltimore's most infamous cold cases, Cesnik's death is the subject of a new documentary series, \"The Keepers,\" which releases May 19 on Netflix. Armacost says the timing of Maskell's exhumation has nothing to do with the documentary, and opening the priest's grave was simply a step that cold-case investigators felt needed to be taken to leave no stone unturned. Police have also looked into whether Cesnik's death is related to the deaths of three other young women in the Baltimore area around the same time.According to police, Joyce Helen Malecki, 20, disappeared from a shopping mall only days after Cesnik on November 11, 1969, in Glen Burnie, a suburb of Baltimore. Pamela Lynn Conyers, 16, was last seen at the shopping mall in Glen Burnie on October 16, 1970, police said. Grace Elizabeth Montanye, 16, met a stranger at a shopping mall on Sept 29, 1971, northwest of Baltimore, according to police.They were all young, attractive women, police said, who looked similar. They were last known to have been at shopping centers in the area, the same as Cesnik.Each of their bodies was found in different law enforcement jurisdictions, delaying any connections from being made for many years, according to Armacost. None of these cases have been solved.",

Seth Williams, who was twice elected as Philadelphia's DA, is accused of accepting bribes between 2010 and 2015 to help two business owners, said William Fitzpatrick, the acting US attorney of New Jersey. Williams also misappropriated a relative's pension and Social Security payments, the US attorney said.The prosecutor pleaded not guilty Wednesday at his arraignment.\"Seth Williams categorically denies that he is guilty of any crime,\" said attorney Michael Diamondstein.  \"We ask only that this rush to judgment stop and that the public recognize that this case is going to be tried in a court of law.\"Read MoreWilliams, 50, faces 23 federal charges: 10 counts of accepting bribes, 11 counts of wire fraud and two counts of extortion. Among the bribes Williams is alleged to have taken:\u2022 1997 Jaguar XK8 convertible\u2022 16 round-trip airline tickets\u2022 $7,000 check\u2022 vacation to Punta Cana, Dominican Republican, worth $6,381\u2022 $3,000 sofa\u2022 Approximately $2,000 in cash\u2022 iPad\u2022 Burberry watch\u2022 Burberry purse\u2022 Louis Vuitton tieIn exchange, authorities allege, Williams made calls to help one business owner avoid security screenings at the airport when returning from foreign travel and attempted assistance with the criminal case of a friend of the business owner. The second business owner was appointed as a special adviser to the DA and issued an official badge. Williams also sent a letter to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control before a hearing on the business owner's liquor license in that state.\"Mr. Williams' alleged willingness to compromise his position of public trust in exchange for private financial gain is all the more unfortunate given that he was elected to protect the interests of the people of Philadelphia as their chief law enforcement officer,\" Fitzpatrick said. The indictment, handed up by a grand jury in Philadelphia, also charges Williams with diverting an unnamed relative's pension and Social Security checks so he could use them for his own purchases instead of paying a nursing home.\"Williams also falsely told a nursing home employee his relative spent the pension and Social Security payments,\" the indictment says. Williams also is accused of misappropriating $10,000 that friends of the relative gave him to cover expenses at the home.Authorities are asking for Williams to forfeit more than $20,000 they say he received.CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.",

In a matter of days, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos has gone from being one of about 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States to a poster child for critics of Donald Trump's hard line on immigration and his promise to increase deportations.Garcia de Rayos, 35, emerged from her seemingly ordinary life after a yearly check-in Wednesday at the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix. It was her eighth visit since her 2008 arrest and conviction for using a fake Social Security number. After each meeting, she was released and returned to her family in Mesa. What we know about this Arizona mother's deportationThis time, Garcia de Rayos was detained and deported to Mexico within 24 hours in what her attorney claims is a direct result of Trump's crackdown. Read MoreICE officials insist there was nothing special about her situation: She had committed a crime and was ordered deported.Now the case has become a flashpoint in the heated national dispute over Trump's executive order that says any undocumented immigrant convicted or charged with a crime that hasn't been adjudicated could be deported. Mexico warns citizens after US deports undocumented mother'We don't deserve to go through this'For her part, Garcia de Rayos appears keenly aware of her role in this unfolding drama. Far from hiding from the cameras, she held a news conference Thursday night in Nogales, Mexico, and said she wants others to see what's happened to her. \"I did this so that more families could see what's in store, what could happen, and so that they could know what they could risk,\" she said, adding that Trump's effort hurts the children of deported parents. \"I am not what he says. I simply am a mother who fights for her children, who fights to give them the best.\"The Garcia de Rayos family stands with lawyer Ray Maldonado outside the Phoenix ICE office Thursday.During an interview in Nogales, Mexico, on Friday, Garcia de Rayos teared up when asked about missing holidays with her family or her daughter's 15th birthday.But, she told CNN's Polo Sandoval,\"Deep down I always knew this could happen.\"  She began to fear deportation \"when the President became the President,\" Garcia de Rayos said, referring to Trump. \"Even before then he started threatening to deport people.\"Garcia de Rayos' children -- who were born in the United States -- crossed the border Thursday night to be with their mother.\"We don't deserve to go through this,\" her daughter, Jacqueline, told reporters. \"No family deserves to go through this. It's heartbreaking. No one should feel this much pain; no one should go through this much suffering.\"#GuadalupeGarcia and her 2 US-born children pause on Nogales side of the border. In a few days they return to other side. She stays behind. pic.twitter.com/VYdAHkgYsd\u2014 Polo Sandoval (@PoloSandovalCNN) February 10, 2017\n Activists and her attorney said they warned Garcia de Rayos she could be deported under Trump's policy. They offered sanctuary at a church, but she decided to check in with ICE anyway, said Lucy Sandoval, an activist who has been working with the family. \"She wanted to confront this,\" Sandoval said. \"They were hopeful that there would be some consciousness and some heart.\"Debate turns on mom's caseGarcia de Rayos might be the first person deported from Arizona under Trump's executive order, her attorney told CNN affiliate KNXV-TV. Her supporters said the deportation signals a marked changed from the policies of the Obama administration.  \"I think this is a direct result of the new executive orders that are being put into actions by President Trump calling them 'enhancing public safety,' which really appears only to be attacking immigrant communities and people of color,\" said her attorney, Ray Maldonado.Carlos Garcia, director of immigration rights group Puente Arizona, said, \"ICE had done what President Trump wanted -- which is deport and separate our families.\"But US immigration officials said this case followed the regular legal process and it was time for Garcia de Rayos to go back to her home country.\"(Her) immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US,\" ICE said in a statement. Immigration advocates say this deportation will cause other unauthorized immigrants to go into hiding. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, called it a travesty. \"Rather than tracking down violent criminals and drug dealers, ICE is spending its energy deporting a woman with two American children who has lived here for more than two decades and poses a threat to nobody,\" he said. But supporters of the move see the deportation as a positive example of Trump's effort to preserve American jobs and ensure public safety.\"President Trump campaigned on the issue of enforcing the nation's laws, and that's exactly what is happening here,\" Dave Ray, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. His nonprofit group backs more restrictive immigration policies.\"Someone who has been in the country illegally for two decades, received final deportation orders from the immigration courts in 2013 and is a convicted felon shouldn't be the least bit shocked that she's being deported.\"A crackdown on illegal immigrationThe executive order signed by Trump could amount to a vast expansion of authority for individual immigration officers and a dramatic increase in efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Trump's plan won't be easy. Just ask ObamaThe order lays out a series of categories of undocumented immigrants that immigration law enforcement officials should prioritize for removing from the country, a reaction to what was criticized by the right as lax enforcement of immigration law by President Barack Obama. The Obama administration had prioritized expulsion of undocumented immigrants who threatened public safety or national security, had ties to criminal gang activity, committed serious felony offenses or were habitual misdemeanor criminal offenders. Trump's order goes far beyond that, using a sweeping definition of \"criminal\" and giving a single immigration officer the ability to make judgments on threats to public safety, regardless of whether the person has been convicted of a crime.CNN's Steve Almasy, Emanuella Grinberg, Mariano Castillo, Laura Dolan, Jean Casarez, Chris Boyette, Polo Sandoval, Jaide Timm-Garcia and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.",

The Larsens, owners of Telescope Media Group, are trying to break into the wedding industry, but only heterosexual weddings.

A violation is punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and/or 90 days in jail.An orthodox definition of marriageIn the lawsuit, the Larsens say they adhere to a \"biblically-orthodox definition of marriage\" -- one between a man and woman -- and that they would be violating their religious beliefs if their company produced a video featuring same-sex marriage. \"The Larsens believe that everything they do -- personally and professionally\u2014should be done in a manner that glorifies God,\" the lawsuit says.But Kevin Lindsey, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Right, sees the Larson's lawsuit as an attempt to undermine LGBTQ civil liberties. (Lindsey is one of the defendants listed in the suit, along with Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson.)\"This lawsuit is part of a pattern of nationwide litigation that is now aimed at eroding the rights of LGBTQ Minnesotans,\" Lindsey said. Another caseIn 2014, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced a settlement against Rice Creek Hunting and Recreation, Inc. the operators of a wedding venue that had refused to rent to a same-sex couple. The settlement required the venue to pay the costs associated with the couple's wedding ceremony and reception and apologize to the couple.According to the Larsen's lawsuit, they have temporarily stopped providing any wedding ceremony services until the issue is resolved.",

In 1980, Castro let another 125,000 leave in the chaotic Mariel boatlift. Among them were criminals released from Cuban jails who brought a violent crime wave to Florida. At other times, desperate Cubans fled the island nation in makeshift boats across the treacherous Straits of Florida. Thousands died from drowning or exposure to the brutal Caribbean sun.Few who left back in 1959 would have believed Fidel Castro would hang on to power for so long, only ceding the presidency to his brother Raul in recent years.Speaking alongside other lawmakers from Florida, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who is Cuban-American, said, \"Today is a reminder of how inevitable it is that the Castro dictatorship will soon enough be a nightmare of the past.\"Jose Soto, with his wife, Alicia, and son Jorge in Miami, touts the \"smell of freedom\" coming to Cuba.Castro lived long enough to see a historic thaw in relations between Cuba and the United States. The two nations re-established diplomatic relations in July 2015, and President Barack Obama visited the island this year.That thaw was welcomed particularly by younger Cuban-Americans but was more problematic for many of the older generation, who have supported strict US sanctions for decades as a means to pressure the repressive Cuban government.CNN en Espa\u00f1ol's Jose Manuel Rodr\u00edguez reported from Miami, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

But immediately afterward, the driver lost consciousness -- and Thompson saw a little boy in the back of the car.The city of East Liverpool, Ohio, said it's trying to warn the public about the dangers of heroin. \"This child can't speak for himself but we are hopeful his story can convince another user to think twice about injecting this poison while having a child in their custody,\" the Facebook post reads.

The officer noticed she was starting to turn blue. He called emergency medical technicians, who administered Narcan, an opiate reversal agent that can save the life of someone acutely overdosing. According to court documents, Acord pleaded no contest to operating a vehicle while impaired and endangering a child. He was sentenced Thursday to 360 days in jail, had his driver's license suspended for three years and was fined $475.Pasek pleaded not guilty Thursday to endangering a child, disorderly conduct and public intoxication. She is scheduled to appear for a pretrial hearing next week in East Liverpool Municipal Court.

Among the protestors, the FBI says, was Donna Joan Borup, an alleged member of the May 19th Communist Organization. The radical group advocated overthrowing the U.S. government. The protest turned violent, and Borup allegedly tossed a caustic substance in the eyes of a Port Authority police officer. According to the Port Authority, he \"lost all or most of his sight.\"Borup and others were arrested and released on bail, but Borup never showed up for her trial. An arrest warrant was issued in 1982. Today, she would be in her late 50s to mid-60s, standing between five feet four inches and five feet six inches.

Time Magazine reported in November of that year that the attack happened shortly before 4 p.m. when Brink's guards Peter Paige and Joe Trombino loaded the money into their truck. Suddenly armed robbers attacked. They opened fire, killing Paige. Trombino was seriously injured, but survived and kept working for Brinks until he was killed in the September 11, 2001, attacks while making a delivery in the World Trade Center.According to the FBI, the robbers drove away after the Brink's robbery, allegedly meeting up with members of the Weather Underground -- another radical organization. They switched cars and drove off. Following a tip, police caught up to them. A shootout left Nyack police Sgt. Edward O'Grady and Officer Waverly Brown dead.Hip hop artist Tupac Shakur's stepfather, Jeral Wayne Williams (known as Mutulu Shakur) is considered by authorities to be the mastermind behind the robbery. In 1988, he received a 60-year prison sentence. He has a parole release date of 2016On November 17, 1982, a federal grand jury operating in the Southern District of New York returned a superseding indictment charging Dalton with various crimes related to the heist.Dalton has ties to Havana, Cuba, and St. Croix, Virgin Islands.

The explosion killed a physics researcher, severely damaged a building at the university and damaged 26 others.According to the FBI, explosives had been placed in a stolen truck three blocks from the building. Burt was part of a radical anti-war group called the New Year's Gang, the FBI says.

ELF made no secret of its responsibility for the Vail fire, and on October 19, 1998, issued a statement saying: \"Vail Inc. is already the largest ski operation in North America and now wants to expand even further. The 12 miles of roads and 885 acres of clearcuts will ruin the last best lynx habitat in the state. Putting profits ahead of Colorado's wildlife will not be tolerated.\"Other environmentalists denounced the fires, calling ELF a fringe group whose actions did far more harm than good.On January 19, 2006, a federal grand jury in Eugene, Oregon, indicted Overaker, Dibee and two others -- since arrested -- on multiple charges related to their alleged role in a domestic terrorism cell. The FBI says Overaker is fluent in Spanish. Dibee may have fled to Syria.The FBI has led a long-running, multiple-agency criminal investigation dubbed \"Operation Backfire\" to combat violent elements of the environmental and animal rights groups, which remains open though not active. The case will remain open until Overaker and Dibee are located, apprehended and prosecuted, the FBI said.Elizabeth Anna Duke Elizabeth Anna Duke is wanted for her alleged involvement in a string of crimes spanning the late 1970s through the early 1980s, according to the FBI. Known as an active member of the radical group known as the May 19th Communist Organization, she was slapped with multiple charges.In May of 1985, Duke was arrested in Bucks County, Pennsylvania with Alan Berkman, who was wanted in connection to the 1981 Brinks armored car robbery in Nanuet, New York. She was released on bail, but fled in October. According to the FBI, Duke is known to speak fluent Spanish and has ties to Texas but is also known to travel in the northern United States near the Canadian border.She may have been travelling with Donna Joan Borup who is wanted for allegedly throwing a caustic substance in the eyes of a Port Authority police officer during an anti-apartheid protest at John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1981, the FBI said. William \"Guillermo\" MoralesWilliam \"Guillermo\" Morales was an explosives expert who allegedly made bombs for an extremist organization violently advocating for Puerto Rican independence. The FALN, translated as The Armed Forces of National Liberation, claimed responsibility for or were blamed for 130 bombings, most of them in New York and Chicago, in the 1970s and early 1980s that caused numerous deaths, injuries and millions of dollars in damage. Morales was captured in May of 1983 in Mexico, but was eventually handed over to Cuban authorities, and the FBI thinks he has lived in Cuba since June of 1988. Morales speaks both English and Spanish. On July 12, 1978, Morales was injured when a bomb he was working on accidentally exploded in East Elmhurst, New York. Badly injured, Morales was taken to a hospital, and arrested. He was held at the Bellevue Hospital prison ward in New York until he was well enough to be transferred to federal prison, but escaped and fled.He is known to wear glasses and may have a beard.Catherine Marie KerkowOn June 3, 1972, Western Airlines Flight 701 was flying from Los Angeles to Seattle with 98 passengers and a crew of seven when Willie Roger Holder and Catherine Marie Kerkow allegedly hijacked the plane, threatening the crew and passengers with a ''bomb in an attache case.'' They demanded $500,000, the FBI says.They were trying to force authorities to free Angela Davis, a prominent black militant, then on trial for murder, kidnapping and conspiracy in San Jose, according to author Brendan Koerner, who wrote a book about the history of airline hijacking called \"The Skies Belong to Us.\"Koerner said Davis was informed of the hijacking by the judge in her trial and refused to communicate with the hijackers.According to Koerner, the ransom was paid in San Francisco, where a little more than half of the passengers were released at the airport. The rest, he said, were released at JFK before the couple took off for Algiers.It was a media circus, and the pair were dubbed a modern \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" according to Koerner.\"Basically the hijackers wanted to take Angela Davis to North Vietnam, then head to Australia to homestead in the Outback. Instead, they ended up crashing with the Black Panthers in Algiers.\"On January 25, 1975, Kerkow and Holder were arrested in France when they tried to get in the country using fake passports, but the FBI says Kerkow skipped out before her trial. Holder was eventually extradited to the United States, but Kerkow could be anywhere. The FBI says she may have ties to Oregon, France, Switzerland, Algeria, Jordan and Cuba.Opinion: Homegrown extremist threat remains 20 years after Oklahoma City bombing",

Deval Patrick declared a public health emergency in MassachusettsInformants help detectives get drugs off the street\"You're constantly pushing back the ocean, basically,\"  detective saysIt's 8 p.m. in Chelsea, Massachusetts, just across the Mystic River from Boston. For Lt. Detective David Betz, his day is about to get busy.After about 30 minutes, Betz, head of the Narcotics and Vice Division of the Chelsea Police Department, leaves to meet with a confidential informant who has been assisting with a case.  \"When we make contact with this person, hopefully they will be able to make a call to any number of their sources, and we'll try to buy some heroin off the street tonight. ... This is basically the meat and potatoes of what we do,\" Betz says.Chelsea is in the middle of a heroin epidemic.  In March, Gov. Deval Patrick declared a public health emergency in Massachusetts in response to the growing opioid addiction sweeping the entire state. From 2000 to 2012, the number of unintentional opiate overdoses in Massachusetts increased by 90%, he said. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, it's happening all across America. The demand for heroin is reaching unprecedented proportions -- fueled in part by a growing number of people who get hooked on prescription painkillers and soon need a cheaper way to get high.Like heroin, the painkillers morphine, methadone, hydrocodone and oxycodone are all opioids and have a similar effect on the nervous system.Heroin, however, is cheaper to get and easier to find. Denver mom survives darkness of addictionIn Chelsea, according to Betz, the majority of illegal prescription pill sales take place behind closed doors, but a heroin deal can be made in the heart of downtown Chelsea, at a busy part of town called Bellingham Square. Betz says in Chelsea, one small dose of heroin runs $10 to $40 depending on size and quality. Prescription opioids, on the other hand, sell for $1 per milligram, or $80 for one 80mg pill.After waiting for the informant to meet with an alleged dealer and make the buy, Betz and several other detectives take the informant into custody. They search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed  heroin or cash, and have the person hand over the drugs. The informant has bought five small bags of heroin. Betz and his team will use the information to build a case against the dealers and secure search warrants and arrest warrants. Informants often work with police to get their own charges reduced.\"For every 10 people we arrest, there's probably 15 or 20 people that are waiting to take over because of the money they could make. It's such a lucrative business, you know. Why would you want to deliver pizza for $8 an hour when you can make $800?\"But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs. \"The smallest community in the heartland of America is going to have some type of drug problem,\" he says. \"I mean drugs are, you hate to say, they're as American as apple pie.\"Betz describes an artery-like network of distribution and delivery that ensures a steady flow of heroin, prescription narcotics, and other drugs into the country -- eventually working its way into small cities and towns like Chelsea.From Southeast Asia or Mexico, the drugs make it into the United States, Betz says. The drugs are smuggled into New York, then Connecticut and Rhode Island before heading into Massachusetts and the Boston area. From there, it is a short trip across the Tobin Bridge to Chelsea. Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources.\"The more affluent a community, sometimes they're able to keep their problems more under wraps than a city that has somewhat less of population who is well off. It's supply and demand, and if the buyers weren't here, the dealers would have to look elsewhere to sell. It's a double-edged sword. If the dealers weren't here, the buyers wouldn't come around.\" What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says. He estimates 50% of the city's heroin buyers and dealers come from the bordering cities of Everett, Revere, Winthrop and, of course, Boston.\"When they're arrested, they'll give us their information -- where they are from, where they were born, and just being familiar with the area, we know certain communities are a lot more affluent then say, Chelsea. They come here, and we'll ask them how did you end up here from a suburb of million-dollar homes, and they'll say they got hooked on opiates, they ran out of money, they're not available there like they are here,\" says Betz, \"The easiest way to look at it is, drugs have no borders.\"With a department of around 100, Betz and his vice squad try to fight heroin in a city of about 35,080 crammed into 1.8 square miles on the edge of Boston. He is proud of his team's work and believes they make a difference, but he doesn't lose sight of what they're up against.\"I think that drugs as a whole are one of the major problems that are plaguing our society, and aside from all the public intervention that we try to do, the people themselves have to have the will and the desire to want to get past it themselves. If they don't, there's no public service programs or no magic pill to better the problem.\"Betz and team have had a relatively successful night making a controlled buy with their informant and gaining information to build a case against suspected heroin dealers. Still, Betz knows that each day is a new day, where the effort to end the heroin problem in Chelsea continues.\"You're trying to keep them from selling the drugs but it's really almost temporary,\" he says, \"You're constantly pushing back the ocean, basically.\" Long Island sees exploding heroin useHolder vows to fight rising heroin deaths",

The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region and has been the target of controversy and civil lawsuits. \"The Zone Assessment Unit, previously referred to as the demographics unit, has been largely inactive since January,\" the department said in a statement Tuesday. \"Recently, as part of an ongoing assessment of Intelligence Bureau operations, personnel assigned to the Zone Assessment Unit were reassigned to other duties within the Intelligence Bureau.\"  The statement continued: \"Understanding certain local demographics can be a useful factor when assessing information regarding potential threats coming to the attention of the New York City Police Department, it has been determined that much of the same information previously gathered by the Zone Assessment Unit may be obtained through direct outreach by the NYPD to the communities concerned.\"Two advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit challenging the unit and its activities said they were pleased it had been disbanded but want to ensure the surveillance stops.JUST WATCHEDSpying on MuslimsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSpying on Muslims 04:57JUST WATCHEDMuslim group files suit against NYPDReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMuslim group files suit against NYPD 04:21JUST WATCHEDOutrage over NYPD Muslim surveillanceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOutrage over NYPD Muslim surveillance 02:27\"While we welcome the dismantling of the Demographics Unit as a long overdue step towards reining in the unconstitutional excesses of the NYPD, what has to stop is the practice of suspicion-less surveillance of Muslim communities, not just the unit assigned to do it,\" said a joint statement by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which filed the lawsuit in 2012. \"We will continue to work, through litigation and advocacy, to ensure the NYPD is fully and finally respecting the rights of the Muslim community.\"That suit, Hassan v. City of New York, was dismissed in February and is currently under appeal.The New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations echoed those sentiments. \"This is an important first step. However, the damage of unconstitutional mass spying on people solely on the basis of their religion has already been carried out and must be addressed,\" said Board President Ryan Mahoney.This decision and the city's move to drop an appeal of a federal judge's August ruling that the controversial stop-and-frisk practice violated the Constitution are seen as signs of changes in the way the city operates. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton have replaced former Mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Commissioner Ray Kelly. \"Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair. This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys,\" de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday.Bratton, who was police commissioner in the 1990s, once again took the helm of the nation's largest police department in December at a time of low crime rates but heightened tension with the public over his predecessor's controversial policies.When Bratton was introduced as New York City police commissioner, he talked about bringing the police and the public \"together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust.\"\"I will get it right again in New York City,\" Bratton said.In February: Spying on Muslims is legal?",

Rafael Reif in a letter Tuesday to the MIT community. Reif had requested an analysis of the university's involvement in the federal case against Swartz from the time MIT first perceived unusual activity on its Web network in 2010.But the report also questioned MIT's \"neutral\" policy on the issues raised by Swartz's prosecution and suggested the university could have showed more leadership. It also asked whether MIT should become involved in debates over reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act -- one of the laws under which Swartz was charged. Swartz, 26, was discovered dead in his Brooklyn, New York, apartment in January. He was facing 13 felony counts stemming from his illegal downloading from MIT of more than 4 million articles from JSTOR, a repository of research journals, and was scheduled to go to trial in April. If convicted on the federal computer-fraud charges, he faced up to 35 years in prison.Internet prodigy, activist Aaron Swartz commits suicideSwartz was an Internet savant who helped develop social-news site Reddit and RSS, the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers. He was an outspoken advocate for the free exchange of information over the Internet and co-founded Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against Internet censorship.As described in the report, Swartz's death \"ignited a firestorm on the Internet.\" Admirers held memorial services, a petition on the White House's website demanded the firing of the federal prosecutor responsible for the case and members of Congress introduced a proposed revision of the law under which he was prosecuted.JUST WATCHEDSwartz's friend: Government bullied himReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSwartz's friend: Government bullied him 03:07JUST WATCHEDInternet prodigy hangs himselfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInternet prodigy hangs himself 02:32After his suicide, Swartz's family issued a statement criticizing prosecutors for seeking \"an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims,\" and claiming that decisions made by prosecutors and MIT officials had \"contributed to his death.\"How Aaron Swartz helped build the InternetThe MIT report on Swartz was issued by a review panel led by Hal Abelson, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science. In preparing its report, the panel reviewed about 10,000 pages of documents and interviewed about 50 people, including MIT faculty, students, alumni and staff; lawyers, police officers and prosecutors; and Swartz's friends and family. \"The review panel's careful account provides something we have not had until now: an independent description of the actual events at MIT and of MIT's decisions in the context of what MIT knew as the events unfolded,\" Reif wrote in his accompanying letter. \"From studying this review of MIT's role, I am confident that MIT's decisions were reasonable, appropriate and made in good faith.\" But others disagreed, including Swartz's family and romantic partner.\"Having now read Abelson's report, it is clear that MIT in fact played a central role in Aaron's suicide,\" Robert Swartz, Aaron's father, said in an e-mailed statement through a family friend.\"MIT made numerous mistakes that warrant further examination and significant changes. MIT was not neutral in the legal case against Aaron. And whether MIT was neutral or not is a red herring: the university had a moral obligation to advocate on Aaron's behalf.\"Robert Swartz had some conciliatory reaction as well.\"We are encouraged by MIT President Raphael Reif's desire to ensure that some positive comes of the terrible, tragic situation in which Aaron found himself, and applaud MIT for its commitment to self-examination.\"Swartz's partner was upset at the report.\"MIT's behavior throughout the case was reprehensible, and this report is quite frankly a whitewash,\" said Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman.\"We have an institution to contrast MIT with -- JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so,\" she said.There was further reaction, too.\"Today's report was intended to provide closure for the MIT community regarding the overprosecution and tragic loss of Aaron Swartz. Instead, the report simply whitewashes MIT's role in Aaron's prosecution and revises history to protect MIT's image,\" said Demand Progress campaigner Charlie Furman.\"MIT does not seem to understand that a few simple, reasonable actions would have saved Aaron's life,\" Furman added. \"If the university had said publicly, 'we don't want this prosecution to go forward,' there would have been no case, and Aaron would be alive today.\"Opinion: Why the Net grieves Aaron Swartz",

The report defines news defined as \"information about events and issues that involve more than just your friends or family.\"The report comes as more and more people turn to social media as a source for news, and as Twitter prepares to begin trading shares this week as a public company. It was published Monday by the Pew Research Center in collaboration with the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.The report follows a similar study last month from Pew that found 30 percent of Americans get news on Facebook. Twitter news consumers skew younger and more educated than those who get their news from Facebook, and are more likely to consume news on a mobile device, according to the new report.Monday's report found that 40% of all U.S. adults get news \"at least sometimes\" on mobile devices, compared to 85% of Twitter news consumers and 64% of Facebook news consumers.JUST WATCHEDCan Twitter, TV save each other?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCan Twitter, TV save each other? 02:21JUST WATCHEDBig week for TwitterReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBig week for Twitter 03:01Information seekers on Twitter are relative youngsters. Forty-five percent of Twitter news consumers are 18-29 years old, while only 2% of Twitter news consumers are 65 or older.  By contrast, 34% of Facebook news consumers are 18-29 years old and seven percent are 65 years or older. Compare this to the 21% of the total U.S. population who are between 18 and 29, and the 18% who are 65 and up.On Twitter, 40% of news consumers have at least a bachelor's degree, compared to 30% of Facebook news consumers and 29% of Americans overall.The Pew report includes analysis of Twitter conversations related to major news events, such as the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man accused in the shooting death of teen-ager Trayvon Martin. The analyses showed that breaking news, not opinion, made up the majority of Twitter news content. In the case of the Zimmerman verdict, the largest segment of the Twitter conversation -- 39% of all sentiments expressed about the verdict -- shared news without offering an opinion.The study also found that conversations on Twitter can evolve quickly, and entiment about a news topic can shift. For example, in the two weeks after Supreme Court hearings on same-sex marriage in March, Twitter sentiment was against legalizing same-sex marriage by a wide margin of 55% to 32%. Yet a month later, opinions on Twitter favored same-sex marriage by 43% to 26%.But the report noted that Twitter sentiment doesn't always reflect the population at large. The Pew report is based on a survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults in late August and early September, along with an analysis of Twitter conversations surrounding major news events. Researchers analyzed Twitter posts for \"information shared, sentiments expressed and ebb and flow of interest.\"Get CNN breaking news on Twitter @cnnbrk.",

Aaron Christopher Kelly, 39, was taken into custody without incident, the Richland Police Department said. Police earlier described Kelly as \"armed and dangerous\" and identified him as the man they believe shot two people inside a Fred Meyer store in Richland on Monday morning, killing one person and injuring another. Kelly is charged with one count each of premeditated first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder, according to charging documents. He appeared in court Tuesday afternoon. Kelly's attorney, Michael Vander Sys, declined to comment on the case when asked by CNN.Read MoreAaron Christopher Kelly was arrested in connection with a deadly shooting at a grocery store in Richland, Washington, Monday.Kelly was arrested on Interstate 90 between Sprague and Spokane, police said, more than 100 miles northeast of where the shooting took place in southern Washington.Bail on an arrest warrant for Kelly had been set at $1 million, Richland police Cmdr. Jon Schwarder said.Police identified the person who died in the shooting as Justin Krumbah, 38. He was an Instacart shopper, the app's CEO Fidji Simo confirmed to CNN Tuesday. \"We are heartbroken as we mourn the loss of a member of the Instacart shopper community,\" Simo said in the statement, adding the company has reached out to Krumbah's family to \"offer our support and ensure they have the resources they need during this incredibly difficult time.\" \"We're also in touch with members of the Instacart shopper community who were in the Richland area at the time of this incident to make sure they have the time and resources they need as they work to process and recover from these terrible events.\"When Kelly entered the store, he was pushing a cart containing a duffel bag and a backpack, Richland's Interim Police Chief Brigit Clary said during a news conference Tuesday. Shortly after arriving, he had a 10-15 second interaction with Krumbah, produced a handgun and fatally shot him, Clary said.Kelly and Krumbah had a conversation before the shooting inside the store, but it was not known what was said, Richland police Cmdr. Chris Lee said.A store employee was injured in the shooting and remains in critical condition, Clary said. Investigators said Tuesday Kelly had no link or relationship with either victim.People leave the Fred Meyer grocery store after Monday's deadly shooting.\"Acquaintances of Kelly have described his condition to investigators as being in decline over the last few weeks and months,\" Clary said. \"He has been described as distancing himself from friends and family.\" How Monday's shooting unfoldedPolice received a call of multiple shots fired at the Richland store just after 11 a.m. Monday, and officers arrived within one minute, Richland Interim Police Chief Brigit Clary said during a news conference Monday. The officers immediately entered the store and found two victims near each other, and one of them had already died. Police provided medical aid to the surviving victim and began evacuating customers and employees, Clary said.Kelly fled after the shooting, but it wasn't clear whether he left on foot or in a vehicle, Lee said.Police posted photos of a man they were looking to identify to social media following a deadly shooting at a Fred Meyer store in Richland, WashingtonPolice later posted a photo to social media of a man pushing a shopping cart inside the store and asked that anyone who recognized him to contact investigators.

The injured officer was in stable condition, an NYPD spokesperson said. \"This young man was on his way to work. On his way to protect New Yorkers from criminals, like the two who were arrested today,\" Sewell said. \"The police department is well past standing at podiums telling people there are too many illegal guns on the street and far too many people carrying them ready to pull the trigger.\"The NYPD has resurrected its controversial anti-crime unit. Success will be determined by avoiding mistakes of the past Tuesday night's shooting unfolded around 10:18 p.m. when the 22-year-old officer was stopped at a traffic light in Queens in his personal vehicle. The officer was not in uniform, the NYPD spokesman confirmed to CNN. Two men walked up to the vehicle and tapped on the driver's side window with a gun, NYPD Chief of Department Kenneth Corey said. Read MoreAfter the off-duty officer got out of the vehicle, one of the men fired several shots, hitting him in the shoulder, Corey said. The officer returned fire and did not hit anyone. The men ran off as uniformed officers who heard the gunfire rushed to the scene, where they rendered aid and radioed a description of the suspects, said Corey.Three blocks away, uniformed Public Safety Team officers saw two men who fit the description, but as the officers got out of their car to stop the men, the suspects fired a shot at the officers, hitting the rear bumper of their unmarked car, Corey said.\"The officers exercised great restraint and did not return fire, and I want to emphasize that. These officers are being fired at and did not shoot back. Instead, they chased the suspects on foot and apprehended the two of them a short distance away without further incident, where a firearm was also recovered,\" Corey said at the news conference.It is not clear if the suspects knew the injured man was a police officer or if he identified himself as one during the encounter.Mayor to talk gun violence with Biden Mayor Eric Adams also praised the arresting officers' restraint, while noting gun violence affects civilians and officers in the city. High number of firearm recoveries underscores America's worsening gun violence epidemic \"The conversation we have been having over and over again -- local proliferation of guns, ready to use them on individuals in blue uniforms or blue jeans,\" Adams said. Adams, a former police captain who became mayor in January, said he will speak to President Joe Biden about gun violence in the city when he visits Thursday.\"We're going to have the President of the United States here in this city, and we're going to lay out clear items we need on the federal level, just as we did with state lawmakers. Everyone must be on the same team,\" Adams said.Tuesday night's shooting came less than two weeks after NYPD officers Jason Rivera, 22, and Wilbert Mora, 27, were fatally shot after a woman called police to report she was having a dispute with one of her sons inside her apartment, police said. The suspect in the shooting was armed with a stolen gun, officials said.NYC mayor eulogizes slain officer Wilbert Mora, vows to give police resources to fight 'senseless violence'Following that shooting in Harlem, Adams laid out an anti-gun violence plan that includes the introduction of a \"newer version of modified plainclothes anti-gun unit,\" the original version of which was disbanded in 2020 after being marked by allegations of aggressive tactics and police brutality.Critics had derided the plainclothes units as counterproductive and argued they were a relic of the stop-and-frisk era of policing that more negatively affected Black and brown communities.The officers in the new unit won't wear uniforms but will wear jackets with police insignia, a slight departure from the past where officers were required to wear the shield identifying themselves as officers outside their outermost layer of clothing.",

        "content": "(CNN)A fire that erupted Monday night at the Winston Weaver fertilizer plant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, still poses a threat to the community Wednesday -- and an evacuation radius remains in place, authorities said.  The fire is still burning at the plant and the one-mile evacuation radius that has affected thousands of people is ongoing, Bobby Wade, division chief of the Winston-Salem Fire Department said at a news conference early Wednesday.\"The potential for an explosion is still there, and we have to be patient and just observe and keep those safe distances and those safe zones established until we get to a point where we can re-enter the site and start assessing that,\" Wade said.The department said it plans to tweet an update at 11 a.m. The fire forced emergency responders to urge the evacuation of about 6,000 people, including Wake Forest University students and more than 200 inmates from a nearby prison.Read MoreThe potential for an ammonium nitrate explosion at the plant was a top concern, fire officials said, as authorities scrambled to evacuate almost 2,500 homes within a mile of the blaze. There were 600 tons of ammonium nitrate and 5,000 tons of finished fertilizer on the site, Winston-Salem Fire Chief Trey Mayo said Tuesday. That compares with the 240 tons of ammonium nitrate at a West, Texas, fertilizer plant blast that killed 15 people in 2013. Winston-Salem is more densely populated than rural West, Texas. \"If that doesn't convey the gravity of this situation and how serious folks need to take it, I don't know how else to verbalize that,\" Mayo said.The fire burns Monday.Through aerial surveillance, officials have been able to determine that there is no imminent heat threat to the rail car on the back of the facility that contains about 100 tons of ammonium nitrate, according to Mayo.Officials on Tuesday were able to shut off two lines that were flowing natural gas into the vicinity of the fertilizer plant, the fire chief said. As the winds begin to shift into the evening, Mayo warned residents that they will be able to see a haze in the air, and they will begin to smell an odor similar to \"spent fireworks.\"The odor is from irritants and not considered toxic, he said.Still, people with \"sensitive respiratory systems\" should avoid being outside, Mayo said.\"We do not encourage folks to be out exercising, running and walking and doing that sort of thing,\" he said. Residents urged to evacuateAt one point, fire trucks were driving down every road in the evacuation zone -- and going door to door in some places -- using a public address system to urge residents to evacuate, Winston-Salem Fire Department Battalion Chief Patrick Grubbs said early Tuesday. The blaze began Monday night at the plant. After battling it for two hours, the fire department pulled back its crews after the blaze spread to the rail car containing ammonium nitrate, Grubbs said.\"Right now, the fire is still active, and there's still potential for explosion. We're asking all the citizens to evacuate the area for a one-mile radius around it,\" he said Tuesday morning. \"We do not know the full extent of the time we'll be here. It will not be anytime soon that we'll be leaving.\"The cause of the fire remains under investigation, Grubbs said, and the fire department has been in touch with the company that owns the plant. The Winston Weaver Co. did not respond immediately to CNN's request for information.On the City of Winston-Salem Facebook page, a company official said there had been no injuries or loss of life.\"We will continue working with first responders and relevant officials to ensure safety of the community, and we would participate fully in the investigation into the cause of the fire,\" he said.Mayor Pro Tempore Denise Adams heard sirens around 7 p.m., Monday, then a \"tremendous boom,\" while watching TV, she said. The fertilizer plant had passed a routine inspection in December, officials said. Inmates moved and students advised to say indoorsAuthorities moved about 220 inmates from Forsyth Correctional Center to the minimum-security Alexander Correctional Institution in Taylorsville, about a 90-minute drive west of Winston-Salem, said North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokesperson John Bull. There was no imminent threat to the Forsyth facility, Bull said. Emergency officials recommended moving the prisoners as a precaution. They'll be returned to Forsyth when it's safe, he said. Wake Forest University canceled classes Tuesday, the university said. The evacuation area includes a unit of on-campus housing, Deacon Place, and students on campus or living outside the 1-mile zone are encouraged to stay indoors and keep their windows closed, the school said. The Wellbeing Center, Benson Center and Z. Smith Reynolds Library are open for faculty, staff or students who need a place to stay.\"Travel in the evacuation area around 4400 North Cherry Street will become increasingly difficult as police begin to shut down roads and prohibit vehicle traffic. Faculty, staff and students are encouraged to evacuate as soon as possible. Use personal vehicles and carpool when possible. Parking anywhere on campus is allowed,\" Wake Forest said early Tuesday.At least 90 firefighters and up to about 150 emergency personnel -- including police and others -- have been working on the fire and evacuating the area, Grubbs said.

        "content": "(CNN)A hotline for people to report hate incidents is being set up in Ottawa as the Canadian capital grapples with ongoing protests over Covid-19 mandates that police say have led to reports of threatening, illegal and intimidating behavior by the demonstrators, rattling downtown residents and workers.\"We already have a number of hate-related incidents that we're investigating,\" Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly said at a video news conference Monday announcing the hotline. \"We encourage anyone who's been the victim of a hate crime or think they may have been the victim of a hate crime or exposed to hate incidents to contact us.\"Truckers and protesters against Covid-19 mandates block a border crossing. Others tried to take meals away from the homeless in Ottawa, shelter saysThe hotline, which is expected to be active within 24 hours, will field reports of criminal activity, threats, assaults and hate-related crimes, \"directly related to the demonstrations,\" Sloly said.The announcement came days after a \"Freedom Convoy\" of truckers arrived in Ottawa to oppose a recent vaccine mandate requiring truckers entering Canada to be fully vaccinated or face testing and quarantine requirements. The event grew into a wider protest of Covid-19 restrictions and snowballed into a blockade of the city and the obstruction of a US-Canadian border crossing.Demonstrators have been accused of desecrating a national war memorial and harassing residents and workers at a homeless shelter.Read MoreDuring Monday's news conference, Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson condemned reports that a couple living near the protests was harassed over a Pride flag displayed on their home.\"This kind of intimidation and bullying tactics, it's causing great angst in the community. And here's an example of homophobia,\" Watson said. \"We see examples downtown of racism, and anti-Semitism, so it's quite a collection of people that have arrived and that are really, quite frankly, terrorizing some of our residents in their neighborhoods.\"The city has intelligence officers, investigative officers, and multi-jurisdictional support, and there are several ongoing criminal investigations \"from bribery to threats to assault to the dangerous operation of vehicles,\" Sloly said. Ottawa soup kitchen donations roll in after truck protesters allegedly harassed staff\"No matter where you live, no matter where your vehicles are registered, if you've come here and committed a crime. If you have committed a hate crime, you will be investigated. We will look for you.

We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.\"Police are negotiating with organizers of the protests, Sloly said. \"We are emphatic in our desire to resolve these demonstrations as quickly, safely and effectively as possible. ... All options are on the table. Through negotiation, through to enforcement. All options remain on the table to safely and effectively resolve this demonstration,\" he said.Supporters arrive at Parliament Hill Saturday for the Freedom Truck Convoy to protest Covid-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions in Ottawa, Canada.Police: War memorial desecrated during protestsBefore the hotline was announced police were investigating the alleged desecration of monuments in the city, including the National War Memorial and that of the late athlete and cancer research activist Terry Fox.Canada's chief of defense, Gen. Wayne Eyre, said he was \"sickened to see protesters dance on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and desecrate the National War Memorial.\"Multiple criminal investigations underway for 'desecration' of Canadian monuments after protests against Covid-19 mandates, police say\"Generations of Canadians have fought and died for our rights, including free speech, but not this,\" Eyre tweeted Saturday. \"Those involved should hang their heads in shame.\"A similar denunciation also came from the Canadian Trucking Alliance, a federation of Canadian trucking associations, which had already said a large number of the protesters appeared to have no connection to the trucking industry.\"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the National War Memorial are sacred sites for Canadians. The desecration of these sites was a disgusting act and is a dishonour to those soldiers who have given their lives for our country and those Canadian soldiers who continue to fight for our freedom today,\" the CTA said in a statement.The CTA called Fox a \"national hero.\" The alleged defacing of Fox's monument was another insult to \"the memory of one of the greatest Canadians in our history,\" it said.Shepherds of New Hope, a homeless shelter and kitchen in Ottawa, said some protesters harassed staff and volunteers for meals.\"While we are not certain of exact numbers, the demands for meals and verbal altercations continued for several hours over the dinner period,\" the center tweeted Sunday.\"Trucks were parked in our ambulance drop off zone for nearly 12 hours until they were removed and towed with the support of Ottawa Police Services,\" the facility said. \"Our staff and volunteers faced significant barriers to get in to work.\"A man yells while holding a smoke firework during a protest against a Covid-19 vaccine mandate on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Saturday.Protesters block border crossingIn western Canada, trucks and cars have been blocking the Coutts border crossing just north of Sweet Grass, Montana, where Interstate 15 is a major commercial artery for US-Canada supply chains. The critical route is called Highway 4 on the Canadian side.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Alberta asked motorists to avoid the area, saying Sunday that northbound and southbound traffic was blocked. \"In an effort to find a peaceful solution the Alberta RCMP had been negotiating with protesters at the Coutts border crossing throughout the day,\" the police service tweeted Monday night. \"While we thought we had a path to resolve this, the protesters chose not to comply.\"The Alberta RCMP will use only the level of intervention necessary to ensure the safety of all citizens and to maintain peace, order, and security. Our goal is to facilitate lawful and peaceful protest,\" the agency said in a statement. \"When an event becomes unlawful we utilize a measured approach, which ultimately includes enforcement. This event is unlawful and we are asking those who are involved to clear the area.\"",

Travis Price \"used his body to bump the Officers backward,\" police said. Brackett said Moreno didn't know Travis Price had the permission of other officers to retrieve his brother's jewelry when Moreno confronted him.Travis Price was told by police he was under arrest for interfering and physically contacting officers, according to police, and officers pushed him against a large gas tank only after he shoved them and would not put his hands behind his back. The video shows Travis Price and officers falling to the ground.Charges against 1 of 2 siblings arrested in South Carolina have been dropped. An officer now charged in the arrest has apologized Moreno was later fired by the Rock Hill Police Department, and an investigation found Moreno's interaction with Travis Price violated department policy, citing his failure to de-escalate the situation. At a news conference in July, Moreno publicly apologized to Travis Price, saying he wished \"my emotions didn't get the best of me.\" Charges against Travis Price were ultimately dropped, according to his attorney. \"While Travis Price is disappointed by this verdict, he respects the jury process,\" Price's attorney, Justin Bamberg, said in a statement. \"Our concern is that other citizens don't suffer the same mistreatment that Travis Price endured.

A date has not yet been set for his next court hearing.Read MoreThe shooting happened Monday just before 2:40 p.m. at a convenience store roughly 4.5 miles west of downtown, police said on their website.Little was involved in a high-speed chase with another vehicle when he opened fire, striking and killing 6-month-old Grayson Fleming, who was sitting in a parked car, according to the arrest warrant.Bryant said authorities were working to \"go after others\" they believe were involved in the shooting, adding there were \"two people involved in gun violence.\"Grayson's mother, Kerri Gray, posted on Facebook, \"God has taken another angel in the worst way possible. At 2:30 this afternoon my son was killed by a drive by shooting. Please pray for me and my family.\"\"I'm almost positive that that guy -- whatever has happened, whatever was going on his mind -- has no idea what wake he left behind,\" Gray told CNN affiliate WGCL. \"Not only have you taken my son away from me, but you have caused fear for the people who live in this neighborhood.\"At a Tuesday news conference announcing the arrest, Mayor Andre Dickens said Fleming had no connection to Little.\"They were bystanders, had nothing to do with this, innocent,\" the mayor said, \"and here they are with blood on their clothes.\"An 8-year-old girl was shot and killed by stray bullet in ChicagoA woman who lives nearby said that she and her husband heard gunshots.\"Other neighbors started walking down the street and we were told a baby had gotten shot,\" Keona Jones told CNN affiliate WXIA.\"Immediately, my heart, it just began to break,\" she said. \"We actually both kind of teared up. Here we go again. Another life lost. Another senseless death.\" This was the third shooting of a child younger than 6 -- two of whom died -- in Atlanta this year, Dickens said.The first victim, on January 12, was a 1-year-old who was shot by another child who found an unsecured gun in a home in west Atlanta's Collier Heights neighborhood, police said. The 1-year-old's mother was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, police said.In the second shooting, a 5-year-old vehicle passenger was struck by gunfire as drivers of two other vehicles were shooting at each other on January 19 in south Atlanta, police said. That child survived, Dickens said. Two suspects were arrested at the scene.Dickens mentioned the shootings of three other children in the last two years in Atlanta, including 8-year-old Secoriea Turner, who was killed in July 2020.\"These children are bearing the brunt and losing their lives because adults are unable to settle their disputes without going to guns,\" Dickens said. \"I'm demanding that it stop. We're going to put an end to it. We're about to work day and night on this, as we have been, but this, this hurts -- it's a 6-month-old child that we've lost.\"British scientist killed by stray bullet while visiting metro AtlantaThe 6-month-old was at least the second person to be killed by a stray bullet in the Atlanta area since last week, according to reports from authorities.Early on January 16, British scientist Matthew Wilson, 31, was shot while he was in an apartment in the northeast Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, police said.Brookhaven police said they responded to 911 calls about shots being fired from an apartment complex there. While officers were checking the area, police said they received another call about a man being shot in an apartment.When officers arrived at the apartment, they found Wilson in bed with a gunshot wound to his head. He was taken to a hospital, where he died, police said.Wilson, an astrophysicist from Chertsey in Surrey, England, was visiting loved ones when the shooting happened, according to police. \"This incident appears to be a random act involving individuals participating in the reckless discharge of firearm(s) which led to the tragic death\" of Wilson, Brookhaven police said in a news release. No arrests have been made in the case.",

More than 2,000 appointments for the treatment were canceled in the state on Tuesday alone, according to a statement from Gov. Ron DeSantis.FDA considers limiting authorization of certain monoclonal antibody treatmentsEarlier Monday, the FDA said it was revising the authorizations for monoclonal antibody treatments made by Eli Lilly (bamlanivimab and etesevimab, administered together) and Regeneron (REGEN-COV, or casirivimab and imdevimab), because data showed they are \"highly unlikely to be active against the omicron variant.\"Omicron accounted for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases in the US as of January 15, the FDA said, noting restricting the authorization for treatments that aren't effective against the variant \"avoids exposing patients to side effects ... which can be potentially serious.\"Read MoreSome people who've received monoclonal antibody treatment reported rashes, diarrhea, nausea and dizziness after treatment, according to the National Institutes of Health. A small percentage of patients had severe allergic reactions.The FDA's announcement came after senior health officials in the Biden administration called the offices of governors and state health officials earlier this month, urging them against using these treatments with Omicron, a source familiar with the calls said.DeSantis has made monoclonal antibodies a cornerstone of his response to surges of coronavirus cases, often pushing the treatment more vigorously than vaccines. A man enters the Regeneron Clinic at a monoclonal antibody treatment site in Pembroke Pines, Florida, on August 19, 2021. Last summer, he introduced new clinics where individuals could receive the treatment at the onset of symptoms or exposure to someone with Covid-19.Earlier this month, amid a record-breaking surge of Covid-19 cases, DeSantis assailed the Biden administration for pausing shipments of the monoclonal antibodies, and has pushed for the treatment to remain widely available.Up to 1 million rapid Covid-19 tests expired in Florida last month, state official says On January 7, DeSantis said he'd secured 15,000 doses of Regeneron's antibody treatment for the state, despite the pharmaceutical company saying in December its REGEN-COV antibodies \"have diminished potency against Omicron.\"DeSantis slammed the FDA's announcement in a statement Monday, saying the Biden administration \"has forced trained medical professionals to choose between treating their patients or breaking the law.\"GlaxoSmithKline's monoclonal antibody, sotrovimab, is the only version of the treatment that appears to work against Omicron, the FDA said last month.  At the time, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the FDA paused allocations of the Eli Lilly and Regeneron monoclonal antibodies, but said 300,000 additional doses of sotrovimab would be made available in January.

        "content": "Chicago (CNN)For the first time in a week, Chicago students are expected back in classrooms Wednesday after the city and teachers struck a deal over Covid-19 safety measures. Negotiators for the Chicago Teachers Union and the city reached a tentative agreement late Monday, ending a deadlock that has become perhaps the nation's most contentious as the Omicron variant surge has raised questions about in-person versus virtual school.The proposed agreement is subject to a vote by the union's 25,000 members, which they began voting on late Tuesday afternoon and will continue Wednesday. Amid the impasse, 340,000 students in the third-largest US school system haven't been in school since January 4.\"I'm certainly relieved to go back to the classroom and see my students,\" said Kathryn Rose, who is both a Chicago Public Schools teacher and parent. \"My kids are really excited to go back, too.\" Read MoreCaroline Robinson, a dermatologist whose two daughters are CPS students, told CNN she understands the unique situation the city, school division and teachers are in right now. \"I think that everyone is going through a lot right now. So for the teachers, they have life  experiences. They have families to take care of. Each of them has a unique perspective through this pandemic. And then the schools,  they have to stay staffed,\" Robinson said. \"I found that during this pandemic that it's really hard to take a side. We just have to work together because at the end of the day, we need to educate our kids, and that's the only side to take.\" What parents should know about sending kids back to school during OmicronThe tentative agreement includes enhanced Covid-19 testing in schools and will extend through the rest of the school year, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said. \"I'm hopeful will have a stable, uneventful rest of the school year,\" she added. Lightfoot announced Tuesday she tested positive for Covid-19. The White House \"very much welcome(s) the reopening of Chicago schools,\" press secretary Jen Psaki said, noting the administration was \"in touch on a regular basis\" with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Lightfoot.Coronavirus testing in schools will ramp up to 10% of students in each school being tested each week, Chicago Teachers Union chief of staff Jen Johnson said. Some 350,000 rapid antigen tests were delivered to the school district to help address testing concerns, Pritzker said Monday night.The Chicago Department of Public Health announced it was distributing 1.9 million KN95 masks into communities this week. Dr. Allison Arwady, CDPH commissioner, said officials made sure Chicago Public Schools had some for staff.\"We know a lot of people -- frankly even a 50 cent or one dollar mask is just one extra cost at a time that is difficult,\" Arwady said, adding that they have more than 100 community-based organizations -- such as churches and libraries -- helping to distribute the masks that are an upgrade from cloth masks.The mayor's administration will work with the teachers union, or CTU, in engaging families to increase testing consents, Lightfoot said. \"That's a critical part of it,\" she said. \"We want to get to as high a number in testing consents as we possibly can.\"The proposal includes details on contact tracing and new incentives to increase the number of substitutes in the district, the mayor said.The two sides also \"reached an agreement on the metrics for, at a school-based level, for when we needed to convert a classroom or school to go remote. Not surprisingly, the component parts of that depend upon staff and or student absences,\" she said.More details of the deal were expected to be released after union's full rank-and-file membership begins voting on it Tuesday afternoon. The agreement is expected to pass, a union official said.How the stalemate over school evolvedThe confrontation over in-person classes began January 4 when CTU voted to begin teaching virtually amid rising Covid-19 cases in the school system. In response, the school district canceled classes.The CTU's House of Delegates voted Monday to suspend the remote work action while its rank-and-file members vote on the proposed agreement.Chicago public school students will return to classroom Wednesday after teachers union suspends work action, mayor saysAmid that voting process, students will return to in-person instruction Wednesday, Chicago Public Schools said in a letter to families. A written document with full details of the agreement would be released after CTU members approved the deal, Lightfoot said.\"I'm not going to say this is a home run,\" said CTU President Jesse Sharkey. \"We're happy it's over, but we're not happy we had to go through it in the first place.\"\"We're still working out some of the details, but we anticipate information to go to members tomorrow about opening polls at some point tomorrow,\" Johnson said at a news conference Monday night.There's a desire for members to \"have time to meet with their colleagues ... and discuss the terms and really grapple with the strategic question of what is and isn't achievable in this moment with this mayor, and then, you know, keep ballots open for sufficient time to have that kind of dialog and debate.\"CTU would also probably have another all-member meeting while the voting window is open to discuss details of the agreement, Johnson said.\"We understand that people want to be able to voice their choice on a timetable that makes sense with what's in the agreement, and we'll have to balance that with ensuring that votes are able to come in,\" Johnson said.District last week notched record-high Covid-19 casesOn the last day students were in classrooms, Chicago Public Schools reported 422 new Covid-19 cases among students and 271 new cases among adults -- both record highs for the academic year.Child hospitalizations are surging in this Chicago hospital. Only one of the young patients was fully vaccinated, doctor saysCTU originally proposed resuming in-person teaching January 18, \"unless (the Chicago Department of Public Health) or the State of Illinois determine that public health conditions are not safe for in-person school at the time.\"This isn't the first time school has been canceled over an impasse between the teachers' union and Lightfoot.In 2019, the same year Lightfoot took office, more than 25,000 Chicago educators went on strike to demand more support staff, higher raises and limits on class sizes.The 11-day strike ended when the city agreed to increase school staffing, including more school nurses and 209 more social worker positions -- enough for one social worker at each school.The deal also included more funding to reduce oversized K-12 classrooms and more funding for recruitment and training.CNN's Adrienne Broaddus reported from Chicago while Amir Vera, Holly Yan, Raja Razek and Chris Boyette reported from Atlanta.

        "content": "(CNN)After a petroleum leak contaminated drinking water and sickened military families and children in Hawaii, the US Navy says it will follow an order from state health officials to halt operations at its Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage facility.The announcement came the day before a Tuesday hearing about the water crisis by the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and weeks after the Navy said it would contest the Hawaii Department of Health's order.Hawaii health officials order Navy to clean up contaminated drinking water after families are forced out of their homesThe fuel facility sits 100 feet above the Red Hill aquifer, which supplies drinking water to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and other parts of Hawaii. Nearly 1 million people on Oahu rely on it for water, according to the Hawaii Board of Water Supply.Since November, members of the military and other residents have reported getting violently sick after drinking the water.\"It happened very quickly,\" said Army Maj. Amanda Feindt, whose husband and two children also fell ill.Read More\"First, it was my 1-year-old son and my husband. And two days later, it ended up being my daughter -- she's 4 -- and myself. It was pretty severe abdominal pain. I've told people the only thing I can compare it to is labor pains, like contractions in my belly.\" Feindt and her children ended up in a hospital emergency room, she told CNN's Brianna Keilar on Tuesday. \"We were all treated for throwing up, diarrhea, severe dehydration. My husband was having ocular migraines all the time, chronic coughing. It was really rough.\" On November 28, the Navy shut down its Red Hill well after reports of people living on base suffering nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and skin-related problems. Testing revealed petroleum hydrocarbons and vapors in the water, the Navy said. US Pacific Fleet Deputy Commander Rear Adm. Blake Converse later confirmed a petroleum leak was the cause.The Hawaii Department of Health recommended all Navy water system users stop using their water for drinking, cooking or oral hygiene, including for pets.The military offered alternative housing for all service members and civilian employees living near the base. Officials said they covered the cost of hotel rooms for more than 700 people. 'My house began to smell like a gas station' \"My house began to smell like a gas station and I couldn't breathe. I was choking,\" resident Bonnie Russell told CNN affiliate KGMB/KHNL in December. \"I opened all the windows for the ventilation, but it still took quite a while for the fumes to clear.\"Another woman demanded answers from the military during a town hall meeting last month. Navy reports contamination at a second water shaft servicing Hawaii base, state officials say\"My children took a bath and for 45 minutes afterward they complained of burning skin,\" the woman said during the town hall, according to KGMB/KHNL. And another resident at a town hall meeting said her toddler got violently sick after drinking the water. \"I'm here to ask why you weren't a wingman to protect my 13-month-old son when I was bathing him, when I was giving him a sippy cup full of water from my faucet, when he has been throwing up for days on end,\" she asked Navy officials.\"I'm here to ask why you weren't my wingman as my husband and I have had mysterious serious symptoms such as sore throats, burning in my stomach, profuse, unusual sweating, headaches unable to be mitigated, requiring multiple ER visits for additional medications, vomiting, diarrhea, skin irritation.\"Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro has called the situation \"not acceptable.\" \"The safety, health and well-being of our service members, civilians, contractors, their families and our communities here in Oahu is of the utmost importance to me,\" Del Toro said in a December statement.\"This is not acceptable, and the Department of the Navy will take every action to identify and remedy this issue. We will continue to coordinate with federal, state and local entities to restore safe drinking water to the community.\"Hawaii health officials ordered the Navy to take actionHawaii's state health department ordered the Navy in December to halt operations at the fuel storage facility.This 2018 photo shows a tunnel inside the Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility at Pearl Harbor.The health department also demanded the Navy install a drinking water treatment system at the Red Hill well; submit a plan to assess system integrity; and defuel the Red Hill underground storage tanks within 30 days of corrective action, Gov. David Ige said.The Navy previously said it would contest the health department's order but agreed to pause operations at the fuel storage facility pending the outcome of an investigation.The Navy also said it would bring in a third party to assess operations and integrity of the facility and to suggest any necessary changes.Monday's shutdown of the Red Hill fuel storage facility was confirmed by Capt. Bill Clinton, director of public affairs and outreach for US Pacific Fleet.The Red Hill fuel facility, located at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, supports US military operations from all branches of service in the Pacific, according to the Navy.\"Unlike any other fuel facility in the United States, Red Hill can store up to 250 million gallons of fuel. It consists of 20 steel-lined underground storage tanks encased in concrete, and built into cavities that were mined inside of Red Hill.\"CNN's Tina Burnside, Natasha Chen and Amy Simonson contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Newark, New Jersey (CNN)Sen. Cory Booker is on the go.On a Friday in May, he delivers a commencement speech at Newark's Kean University, where, after he finishes, students shout \"2020!\" at the New Jersey Democrat. He then quickly boards an Acela train back to Washington for votes, where he offers to buy a fellow passenger coffee. The passenger responds by asking about his 2020 plans.Everywhere Booker goes, the subject of a 2020 presidential run follows. And in the year-and-a-half since President Donald Trump was elected, Booker has spent about half his weekends on the road, visiting most states where a Democratic senator is facing a tough re-election fight, including multiple visits to Wisconsin, Ohio and Florida, as well as stops last year in Indiana and Montana, a recent swing through Minnesota and Missouri and a trip this weekend to Virginia.It's his travel outside the Acela corridor, coupled with a series of legislative rollouts in the Senate, that is drawing the most attention from Democratic insiders and political observers who view his frenetic 2018 midterms schedule and policy moves as a wink-and-nod entry into the party's shadow 2020 presidential primary.In an interview aboard the Acela, Booker says he'll make a decision about whether to run for president at the end of this year.Read More\"I'm not going to play coy. I'm sure after the midterm elections, I'll give it a look,\" Booker said. \"But to me, my momentum, my energy, my focus is 2018 and making sure I get re-elected in 2020.\" His brain trust, which starts with chief of staff Matt Klapper and long-time political adviser Mo Butler and also includes adviser Brendan Gill, finance director Lauren Dikis and former campaign manager and friend Addisu Demissie, is keeping any preparations for a Booker 2020 run under wraps. And Booker's friends and allies say he has not made a decision about his own political future.But Booker acknowledged the inevitability of the question of a presidential run.   \"This is just this period where it's so premature to be thinking about 2020 and talking about 2020, even though clearly we are,\" he adds. \"But I just think that, what I learned as mayor is if you take care of today really, really well, tomorrow is going to take care of itself, and the battle's going to be a lot easier.\"In deciding about his political future, the 49-year-old Booker, a bachelor who most recently dated poet and artist Cleo Wade, acknowledged another concern that some close to him had raised: If he wants a family, the clock is ticking. \"Of all the titles that I sincerely seek in my life, more than anything else is ... to be a husband, and a father. And I've made tremendous sacrifices,\" Booker says. Booker says his time as mayor of Newark, which he describes as a \"24-hour mayor,\" hurt his personal life.\"I don't think about that in the context of a 2020 run; I think about it in the context of the career I've chosen. To be a senator, like right now, it's kind of hard to date when you're on the road, as I am right now, where your weekends are spent in three states,\" he says.\"Look, at a personal level, I really do think about that every day, because I really do think that one of the best titles you can have is a parent and a spouse,\" Booker adds. \"So, anything I do, that's always a consideration, and I pray about it a lot.\"Catch him if you can On the trail, Booker's appeal is obvious: He is a dynamic and passionate speaker who can help white Democrats reach black voters, who make up a large share of the Democratic primary electorate. Booker campaigned in Alabama last year, turning African-American voters out for Doug Jones in the state's Senate special election. He also visited two more deep-red states: Indiana and Montana. Rural America is of particular interest to Booker. He recently read J.D. Vance's book \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" about the lives of poor white people in parts of the country that overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016. Now, he is planning a rural tour, which he said would be to learn about issues facing farmers with relatively little public attention.\"I just have this strong belief now as I meet rural, white Americans, as I meet rural black Americans, we have so much of the common pain but we're lacking the sense of common purpose,\" Booker said. So far this year, Booker has visited Arizona, Ohio, Washington, Wisconsin, Florida, Minnesota and Missouri to support Democratic Senate candidates. He's also held events for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Maryland gubernatorial hopeful Ben Jealous.In order to free up more time for political travel, Booker asked his top New Jersey donors to skip their usual schedule of house parties and private gatherings this year. Instead, he invited them all to a massive fundraiser Thursday night in Newark, where he raised more than $500,000, a source familiar with the event said.Steven Slugocki, the Democratic chairman in Maricopa County -- Arizona's largest and the home of Phoenix -- said Booker's camp agreed to a last-minute request to tack a stop at a local party event onto a January trip to raise money for Kyrsten Sinema's Senate campaign.After the 300-person event at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday wrapped up, an aide tried to rush Booker back to his hotel.\"Cory, like, whispered into my ear, 'What are we doing now?'\" Slugocki said. \"He said, 'No, I want to take photos with everybody.'\"Booker lingered for more than an hour, Slugocki said, and took a selfie and another photo with every person who waited for one.\"Cory was honestly one of the nicest politicians I've worked with,\" Slugocki said. \"He was friendly, he was fun, he took a genuine interest.\" Booker as policy leader In addition to the political travel, aides and advisers said Booker plans to use the rest of 2018 to introduce new legislation intended to offer parts of a Democratic agenda to counter Trump.  Already, Booker is at the forefront among 2020 Democratic prospects on legalizing marijuana. Several other possible contenders -- including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris -- have signed onto Booker's bill.Booker is also among the first Democrats to roll out a proposal for a federal jobs guarantee, calling for a pilot program in which 15 communities with high unemployment would receive federal money to offer every adult there a $15-an-hour job with health and family benefits.Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) listen during a hearing before the Subcommittee on Emergency Management, Intergovernmental Relations, and the District of Columbia of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee November 6, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.In the coming months Booker plans to roll out more bills dealing with criminal justice as well as consumer protections, corporate consolidation and wages, an aide said.The bills have no chance of becoming law under Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. But Booker sees them as important markers of where Democrats would steer the country. \"My party has got to focus on not being anti-Trump. It's not about what you're against in life. It's what you're for,\" Booker says. \"You've got to talk about the vision for the country and for where we're going. It's going to speak to people's hearts and heads, not their partisanship.\"Booker's recent legislative moves have helped win over some progressives who have long seen the man who began his political career in Newark, in the shadow of New York City, as too close to Wall Street and pharmaceutical interests.\"The center of gravity in the Democratic Party is moving in an economic populist direction, and Cory Booker's efforts to improve on issues of corporate power show that he knows economic populism is popular with voters,\" said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee -- a group that brands itself as the \"Elizabeth Warren wing\" of the party.Green specifically praised Booker's jobs guarantee proposal, saying that \"voters will notice if he embraces more big ideas like that and shows an increased willingness to directly challenge corporate power.\"Progressives were incensed last January when he voted against an amendment to a non-binding GOP budget resolution calling for Americans to be allowed to buy cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. A month later he joined Sanders and Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in introducing a bill that would accomplish the same goal of allowing Canadian drug imports and lowering costs. That bill addressed what Booker said was his problem with the resolution: the safety of the imported drugs. But Booker was clearly stung by backlash from the left over his initial vote.\"When you're operating at this level, there are people who are really invested in pushing out fake stories, telling lies and half-truths in order to try take people down,\" he said. \"I feel not only vindicated that we now have a strong piece of legislation that can probably get bipartisan support and actually get passed. But the cascading, untrue attacks definitely shows me the kind of climate that we're in, and how nefarious forces are going to try to spread lies and half-truths about you.\" Since then, Booker has also sworn off corporate campaign contributions, a move Gillibrand, Harris and others have also made ahead of potential 2020 runs.\"I think one of the reasons why we're only one of six United States senators to not say we're not taking corporate contributions is to try to divorce ourselves from anybody's skepticism, as well as, being the change you want to see in the world,\" Booker said.\"I want to be able to make a difference on these issues without people being skeptical, because they're tying contributions -- which have never, never affected the way I decide on issues. ... I think that we were moving in that direction before this whole thing to say 'no corporate contributions whatsoever,' which we've done. Again, we are an early mover, and I bet you that we'll see more people follow over time.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calls on US officials \"to do more\" to help his country, governors around the US are mobilizing to bolster shipments of humanitarian aid and other supplies, including at least one state sending personal protective and medical equipment it had been scrambling to acquire at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.At a state disaster logistics warehouse in Solano County this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom helped pack up a field hospital kit designed for use during the pandemic to treat 50 patients over three days. The self-contained package of hospital beds, IV-starter kits and poles, tourniquets, trauma and oxygen supplies, and automated external defibrillators fits in a 53-foot trailer that will now be deployed in Ukraine.After loading and shrink-wrapping boxes for shipment alongside state emergency workers, the Democratic governor scrawled a message in black marker on one of the containers, promising that this would be just the first of multiple donations from his state. While some of the supplies California is offering Ukraine -- like PPE and ventilators -- were in critically short supply in the US just two years ago, the state now has an emergency stockpile that fills more than a million square feet of warehouse space, Newsom said. \"What a gift for us, for all of us as taxpayers, as Californians, to do this, without any impact whatsoever in terms of our own capacity to maintain readiness and keep us safe,\" Newsom told reporters, describing the state as being in \"an abundant place.\" California's donation will be added to a much larger March 26 shipment -- including emergency and chronic disease medications, antibiotics and backpacks filled with supplies for emergency first responders -- that is being assembled by the California-based charity Direct Relief and flown via a FedEx 777 charter to Poland, with all items specifically requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health.Read MoreThe idea for California's medical supply donations stemmed from a recent meeting between Newsom and Consul General of Ukraine in San Francisco Dmytro Kushneruk. Officials with Direct Relief said California's donation was the first the charity had received from a state government or municipality that had included surplus Covid-19 supplies.Direct Relief noted that medical-grade oxygen is critically needed in Ukraine and demand is likely to grow depending on both the course of the war and the pandemic.\"We'd be more than willing to work with other states, particularly if they have supplies that match the requests that we have from Ukraine,\" said Leighton Jones, Direct Relief's director of emergency response.Newsom and a number of other US governors and municipal agencies are also collecting bulletproof vests, helmets and other protective equipment that has been requested by Ukraine. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who recently signed legislation to provide nearly $645,000 in humanitarian aid to Ukraine that is being sent through Save the Children, is supporting a body armor drive coordinated by Vermont law enforcement agencies through next Wednesday.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has asked law enforcement agencies to look for personal protective gear that could be shipped to Ukraine, including expired or extra helmets and body armor. The equipment would be collected, DeWine's office said, only if a need is identified by US European Command, which is helping coordinate shipments of weapons to Ukraine. Several other governors, including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, have joined forces with private donors to aid in the collection of donations. Cox, a Republican, recently appeared at the launch of a fundraiser and community donation drive known as \"Driven to Assist,\" where private donors have pledged to match donations of up to $2 million as they also collect items for refugees like diapers, waterproof jackets, warm hats, mittens and base layers, as well as emergency thermal blankets, which will be flown to Europe.In West Virginia, Gov. Jim Justice asked the legislature to approve $5 million in spending to help rebuild the maternity ward and children's hospital in Mariupol that was devastated by bombing. In a letter to the state legislature requesting rebuilding funds that would be used \"once the conflict has ended and the sovereign Ukraine is victorious, independent and free,\" the Republican governor said he hoped the pledge would \"spur others to contribute\" and \"show Putin that the free world stands together in support of Ukraine.\" Some states are also taking steps to divest their retirement funds from Russian-owned assets while severing other financial ties with Russia. Phil Murphy, the Democratic governor of New Jersey, signed a new law last week unanimously approved by the legislature that aims to prevent companies that do business with the state from dealing with the Russian and Belarusian governments. It would prevent companies with such ties from bidding on or renewing state contracts, working with state agencies and qualifying for tax abatements. At least 10 states have stopped selling Russian alcohol in their state-run liquor stores, but business analysts have questioned the efficacy of that move since very few US consumers buy vodka that is made in Russia and some smaller US companies that import it will be harmed by the boycotts. Other states with defense contractors manufacturing weapons in their states have been touting the role that their state workers are playing in arming Ukraine. Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey took to Twitter to boast about Javelin anti-tank missiles being manufactured by Lockheed Martin in Troy, Alabama. \"We want the last thing Putin ever reads to be 'Made in Alabama,'\" Ivey tweeted.",

        "content": "(CNN)Weeks after the House panel investigating the January 6 insurrection was formed, former President Donald Trump's political action committee gave $1 million to the non-profit organization that employs his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, campaign finance records filed Monday night show. Trump's Save America PAC on July 26 gave $1 million to the Conservative Partnership Institute, the group where Meadows is a senior partner. The donation came less than four weeks after the House voted to establish a select committee to investigate the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. In December, the House voted to recommend that the Department of Justice pursue criminal charges against Meadows for refusing to cooperate with the committee's probe. Trump's political organization has amassed $122 million in cash reserves, his team announced Monday.The $1 million to Meadows' non-profit made up most of the $1.35 million in donations that Trump's PAC disbursed to political organizations and candidates in the second half of 2021.Read MoreMost of the donations were for $5,000 and went to candidates who Trump has endorsed -- and who have embraced his lies that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 presidential election. The recipients include Republicans who have made clear their willingness to attempt to overturn voters' will. Among them: Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia, who voted against certifying the election on January 6 and is running in the Republican primary against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who has defended the state's election results; and Harriet Hageman, a Republican primary challenger to Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump for his actions on January 6 and is a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack.Recipients also include a slate of Arizona candidates -- gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake, Senate candidate Wendy Rogers and secretary of state contender Mark Finchem -- who have lied about voter fraud in the state and misrepresented the findings of a partisan review of the 2020 results commissioned by state Senate Republicans. Trump's political organization also paid tens of thousands of dollars to law firms that represent current and former Trump aides who have fought against subpoenas issued by the House panel probing the January 6 attack. Recipients include $25,000 to Brand Woodward Law, which has represented Trump aide Dan Scavino, and $29,500 to Abel Bean Law, which represents Trump aide Taylor Budowich. Save America PAC paid $50,000 to JP Rowley Law PLLC, which represents attorney Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump on how to attempt to overturn the November 2020 election results.",

        "content": "(CNN)The political fight over pandemic policy is playing out in America's suburbs, where some of the same voters -- namely suburban women -- who propelled Democrats to big wins in the 2018 and 2020 elections are now breaking ranks ahead of this year's midterms.One window into the brewing fight is in northeastern Ohio. A mother in Shaker Heights, who recently participated in a White House call on Covid-19 policy, was eager to give Democrats the benefit of the doubt and help them win elections. But in Cleveland, another mother who recently wrote an attention-grabbing essay on losing faith in the party offered a glimpse at the peril Democrats could face in November. \"If you would've told me two years ago that I would be alienated from the Democratic Party, I wouldn't have believed it,\" Angie Schmitt, a Cleveland writer with two young children, said in an interview. \"I hated (Donald) Trump and what the administration was doing,\" she said. \"But I just don't think people realized what a big deal closing school for a year was.\"Top Democrats, including President Joe Biden, are attuned to the central role that voters' reactions to pandemic policies could play in the November midterm elections. Read MoreAsked by reporters last week if school closings could be a potent issue to help Republicans win control of Congress, Biden said: \"Oh, I think it could be.\" Democrats across the nation have pushed in recent months for in-person schooling even as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread.How Americans think Joe Biden has done on their most important priorities after one year The Democratic governor of Illinois and mayor of Chicago went to battle with the city's teachers' union this month after the union briefly refused to return to classrooms in person. Colorado's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, in December declared an end to the \"medical emergency\" of Covid-19. He said he would not issue any mask mandates, urged schools to ramp up testing to limit outbreaks during in-person schooling and said of those who remain unvaccinated and end up hospitalized with Covid-19, \"It's your fault.\" Biden has pointed to his administration's efforts to fund school testing and other safety measures. \"We're not going back to shutting down schools. Schools should stay open,\" Biden said in a news conference last week. Too late for Democrats?Still, some in the party worry that the damage might already be done. And Republicans have sought to capitalize on backlash to pandemic-related safety measures. In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the November governor's race in the increasingly blue state on a message that focused largely on schools, which he vowed would remain open without mask mandates. As soon as he was sworn in earlier this month, he signed an executive order making masks optional in school, for which several school districts are now suing him. Schmitt of Cleveland, who said she is a registered Democrat, emerged as a voice representing the backlash potentially facing Democrats over what some voters see as overly restrictive pandemic safety policies when The Atlantic published an opinion piece she had authored early this month. In The Atlantic, Schmitt described a Democratic Party stuck in a moralizing discourse about Covid-19 and hostile to serious conversation about the cost of pandemic-mitigation efforts to children and families. \"Why did I hear so little about that immense social problem and so much shaming of the women who dared to complain about having their kids stuck at home?\" she wrote. \"All in all, the party that supposedly focused on 'systemic' issues was obsessed with demanding personal sacrifice. And the burden fell most heavily on mothers of young children, essential workers, and low-income children.\" Angie SchmittHer own views are at times out of step with the consensus of public health experts. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends \"universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of their vaccination status or the area's transmission rates,\" adding that \"the benefits of mask-wearing are well-established.\" Schmitt said she thinks vaccines should be mandated for teachers and staff but not students and that masks should not be required. \"Why is my son, who's double-vaccinated and already had (Covid-19), masking 40 hours?\" she said. \"I think Democrats have been way too dogmatic about that.\"\"Before, I would not have even considered voting for Republican,\" Schmitt said. \"Now I'm just looking for these magic words. Who's the politician that's going to say, 'School's important. We're keeping schools open.' \" In fact, most schools are now open for in-person learning. Democratic officials, including Biden and his administration, have sought to take credit for that. His White House has also tried to contrast the broad reality of schools being open now with the closures that took place late during the pandemic's first year under the Trump administration.\"Almost 60% of the schools were closed when we took office. Now 96% of schools are open,\" top White House aide Cedric Richmond, a former Louisiana congressman, said in a recent livestreamed interview with The Washington Post. 'We need help' Still, the politics around the pandemic and schools are complicated, and some Democratic voters remain willing to give the party the benefit of the doubt.Katie Paris, a mother of two young children from Shaker Heights, Ohio, and the founder of the pro-Democratic group Red Wine & Blue, which organizes suburban women, and a group of her organization's members said Democrats should be more vocal about the party's support for measures like paid leave and universal child care that would have helped families over the last two years. \"I just watched so many moms suffer,\" Paris said. \"I think the pandemic just identified: We need help.\" Red Wine & Blue participated in the Biden administration's first-ever \"White House Covid-19 Parent Check Up\" last week. Paris said Democrats should \"say that we want to keep our schools open, then make sure that parents and teachers have all the support they need ... and not avoid the conversation because it feels like a political landmine.\" \"I would hope that this is just the beginning of these conversations,\" Paris said. \"Most parents aren't thinking, 'How many days or months are there until the next election?' \"",

        "content": "(CNN)A New York district attorney will not prosecute former Gov. Andrew Cuomo on a misdemeanor sex crime charge of forcible touching, despite finding Cuomo's accuser \"cooperative\" and \"credible.\" Albany County District Attorney David Soares said in a statement Tuesday he was declining to prosecute a former aide's allegation that Cuomo had groped her, ahead of the Democratic former governor's scheduled court appearance this month. Soares said in a statement that he could not prove the charge, filed by the Albany County sheriff in October, in a courtroom to the criminal standard of proof. \"While many have an opinion regarding the allegations against the former Governor, the Albany County DA's Office is the only one who has a burden to prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Soares said.  \"While we found the complainant in this case cooperative and credible, after review of all the available evidence we have concluded that we cannot meet our burden at trial.\" The decision comes after district attorneys in Westchester and Nassau counties also in the last two weeks declined to pursue charges against Cuomo. Those cases focused on different allegations. Read MoreSoares noted that the decision to discontinue criminal prosecution is unrelated \"to any possible civil liability.\"The allegations from Brittany Commisso were among the 11 detailed in New York Attorney General Letitia James' report on allegations of sexual misconduct that led to Cuomo's resignation in August. Commisso, a former assistant to Cuomo, told investigators for the attorney general's office that Cuomo had grabbed her buttocks during hugs and, during an event at the executive mansion, reached under her blouse and grabbed her breast. Brian Premo, an attorney for Commisso, told CNN on Tuesday, \"I can confirm only that in this case my client had no control over the filing or prosecution of criminal charges.  She had no authority or voice in those decisions.\"\"The only thing she has any power over is her resolution to continue to speak the truth and seek justice in an appropriate civil action, which she will do in due course,\" Premo said.Cuomo has denied the allegation. CNN has reached out to his attorney, Rita Glavin, for comment. CNN also reached out to Cuomo representative Rich Azzopardi.The Albany Times Union first reported the story.Soares said in a November letter that filings in the misdemeanor forcible touching case against Cuomo are \"potentially defective\" and asked to delay the former governor's arraignment on a charge filed by the Albany County sheriff. Soares noted that the filing was \"unilaterally and inexplicably filed\" by Albany Sheriff Craig Apple's office and failed to include a sworn statement by the victim.Separately, Cuomo attorney Elkan Abramowitz told CNN that the Manhattan district attorney's office closed an investigation into whether there was criminal liability from nursing home leadership or state officials for Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes. \"I was contacted today (Monday) by the head of the Elder Care Unit from the Manhattan district attorney's office who informed me they have closed its investigation involving the Executive Chamber and nursing homes,\" Abramowitz said.  Abramowitz was outside counsel to Cuomo's office when the former governor was in office. \"I was told that after a thorough investigation -- as we have said all along -- there was no evidence to suggest that any laws were broken.\"CNN has reached out to the Manhattan district attorney's office and Gov. Kathy Hochul's executive chamber for comment. This investigation was not previously disclosed to the public.A March 25, 2020, order by the state's Department of Health while Cuomo was governor mandated that nursing homes must not deny readmission or admission to people \"solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\" Cuomo announced a new policy on May 10, 2020, saying a hospital cannot discharge a person who is Covid positive to a nursing home.A separate, federal investigation into how the Cuomo administration handled Covid-19 nursing home death data is ongoing. CNN has reached out to a spokesman for the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York for comment.The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 that Cuomo's former senior aides were involved in rewriting a 2020 nursing home report from state health officials to lower the coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, citing documents and interviews with people with knowledge of the discussions.The original report listed the number of nursing home deaths at nearly 10,000, according to the Journal. A 2021 investigation by James' office revealed that the state was not counting the nursing home deaths of people who had been transferred to hospitals as their conditions worsened and had died there.CNN's Mark Morales and Sonia Moghe contributed to this report.",

Stutzman, 23, is part of the conservative Swartzentruber community of about 40 Amish families in the area. He and his wife survived the tornado \u2014 climbing into their basement just as their windows shattered.But his neighbors, Jacob and Emma Gingerich, and two of the Gingerich's five children were killed when their trailer home was ripped from its frame. Emma Gingerich was Stutzman's cousin. Family members and friends from five states had arrived by bus early last week for the Gingerich family funerals, and they stayed to help with clean-up and the start of the rebuild. They slept on the floors of homes still standing. Read MoreMembers of the Kentucky National Guard had stopped by earlier Thursday to drop off sleeping bags. In the afternoon, as a heavy rain began to fall, several men were unloading a pallet of new windows that had just been delivered.There's just so much work to be done.An Amish man walks to unload donations brought by community members in Mayfield, Kentucky.A week after the deadly long-track tornado ripped through western Kentucky, residents of the region were rallying around those who had suffered the worst damage, much like the Amish community that had gathered in rural Graves County, several miles outside Mayfield. In Mayfield, a town of less than 10,000 people where more than one-in-three residents live below the poverty line, many people said they were committed to remaining in the area and rebuilding what they had lost. But anxiety over the economic blows so many had suffered had also set in, with many beginning to confront the long process of recovery with more questions than answers. In Mayfield, the owner of a food truck that sells the self-proclaimed hottest wings in the world wondered how he would afford new grills. A basketball trainer hoped the children he works with would have access to a gymnasium soon so he could make a living again. A mother of four worried about where she and her four children would stay after two weeks of free lodging at a nearby resort runs out. Rubble from destroyed offices is seen in downtown Mayfield on December 15.Stutzman had five buildings on his property: a house, a barn, a workshop, and buildings for machinery and lumber. All were destroyed. \"We don't have anything usable as far as furniture. And as you can see, there's a lot of our stuff over there,\" Stutzman said, looking across the street. \"First of all, we're going to rebuild everything and try to get back into our home,\" he said. The challenge, he said, is paying for the materials he will need. \"I'm not going to ask for it,\" Stutzman said. \"But we're going to take all the donations so we can buy what we need for materials and stuff to rebuild.\"'It's just a day.'With Christmas just days away, some in Mayfield who survived the tornado, some of whom saw presents they had already purchased get damaged or destroyed, said they were scaling back their plans. They were simply grateful to have survived to see the holiday at all. \"There is no Christmas. Not this year,\" said Angee Wilson, 46, who works in her mother's tax preparation office, which was demolished by the tornado. \"It's just a day. We're just thankful that we're actually still here. We can celebrate it maybe in February.\" Nicole Rudolph, a 28-year-old housekeeper who lives on the outskirts of Mayfield with her four young children and another on the way, said she expects a low-key holiday season \u2014 but is glad to have survived a difficult stretch leading up to it.A hymnal lies among the debris in Mayfield.Rudolph, who is vaccinated, said she and her children had gotten Covid-19 in the fall \u2014 among the many in Graves County, which saw a severe spike in cases in August and September. She said it was the worst illness she'd ever experienced.\"I know for children, Christmas is about gifts. But in reality, it's just about making it. It's about love. It's about support from your family,\" Rudolph said.Her house was not badly damaged, she said, but the food in her refrigerator had spoiled with much of Graves County without electricity. She was filling a plastic tote with canned goods at the Graves County fairgrounds' supply center on Wednesday. \"It gets harder every day,\" she said. \"I'm still able to make it through, with the people out here to help us.\" 'The bills still go on'Through the streets of Mayfield, most businesses remained shuttered last week as the town waited for power to be restored. A McDonald's was closed, but the fast-food chain operated a food truck in its parking lot. A Walgreens became a gathering spot for distributing water and other supplies to those working on clean-up efforts, with portable toilets in its parking lot. Businesses that weren't demolished have boarded up their broken windows and temporarily patched holes in roofs with tarps. Children's playground equipment, pieces of fencing, patio furniture and more debris were scattered throughout residential areas. Farther away from the tornado's path, those whose houses were not destroyed have lined their front yards with massive piles of sticks and branches, awaiting clean-up crews to haul the piles away.Dozens of buildings and houses that were directly in the tornado's path are now piles of rubble, with cars too damaged to drive left parked beside them. And days after the tornado, those who lived and worked in those homes and buildings continue to search for their belongings and mementos. Shawna Driscoll cries as she hands unbroken ceramic plates to her friend Angee Wilson while digging through debris at Wilson's mother's tax office in Mayfield on December 15.Wilson and her friend Shawna Driscoll on Wednesday were climbing through the rubble of what had been Wilson's mother's tax preparation office.They were securing clients' files. But they were also searching for an important keepsake: a photo of Wilson's grandfather that sat atop a shelf by a window. They didn't find the picture. Wilson and Driscoll met President Joe Biden during his trip to Mayfield on Wednesday. Wilson said the two asked for counseling services and first aid kits, so that hospitals' emergency rooms wouldn't be crowded with people who suffered minor injuries like glass cuts while clearing debris. Both the first aid kits and counseling services had shown up a day later, Wilson said, though she did not know whether Biden was directly responsible for their arrival.On the trip, Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of costs of emergency work for the first 30 days after the tornado outbreak. Wilson, 46, said their immediate needs were covered \u2014 but, like many in Mayfield, expensive repairs are looming in the weeks and months ahead.\"We could use a new roof and a new fence for my dog,\" she said. James Stovall, owner of Larry, Darrell & Darrell Bar-B-Que, lost his food truck and smokers in the tornado outbreak.James Stovall, the 67-year-old owner of Larry, Darrell & Darrell Bar-B-Que \u2014 who claims to have come up with the recipe for the hottest wings on earth, using nine of the world's spiciest peppers \u2014 was trying to recover the grills for his food truck on Thursday. His food truck and grills had been picked up and destroyed by the tornado, left amid the piles of rubble in downtown Mayfield.He said he wants to keep his business going. But he's facing an $18,000 price tag for a used food truck and at least $50,000 for grilling equipment. Still, big business is looming: His barbecue is always a major hit at the spring's annual QuiltWeek convention, which brings tens of thousands of quilters to nearby Paducah. Stovall said he is trying to \"keep it together and get everything that I can salvage.\" \"My banker called me this morning \u2014 'James, you need to make a deposit,'\" he said. \"The bills still go on. It's tough when I look at what it's going to take me.\" 'It's all about moving forward' This rural, conservative region of western Kentucky is relatively isolated from major cities with abundant temporary housing. Larger cities like Nashville, Tennessee, Louisville, Kentucky, and Evansville, Indiana, are at least two-hour drives away. Some residents in Mayfield are desperate to find places to stay \u2014 especially as free, temporary options run out and savings accounts are drained to foot hotel bills. Some have left town. Others are sleeping in their cars, or on the floors of the houses of family members in town. Hotels within a one-hour drive of Mayfield are packed. Food, clothes and other supplies are organized at a supply center in Mayfield on December 15.In a building that's been turned into a supply center at the Mayfield-Graves County Fairgrounds, where dozens of volunteers wearing yellow vests were unloading a constant stream of canned goods, toiletries, diapers, pet food and more while the Kentucky National Guard directed traffic, people described a deep uncertainty about where they will end up and how they will pay for it. Sammantha Smith, a 31-year-old cook who lives in public housing in Mayfield, said that a resort northeast of Mayfield had given her family a cottage for two weeks because her house's windows were shattered and its roof was falling down. She was gathering cleaning supplies, cereal and other necessities in a large plastic tote. She said she doesn't know when she'll be able to provide any sense of normalcy for her four children, who range from age 4 to 10. \"It's hard to gain normalcy, because we're only going to be there for two weeks, and then we have to find somewhere else,\" Smith said. \"It may be a month, two months, before we can even get back into our house. So we're just having to maneuver through everything.\" The Federal Emergency Management Agency had set up a trailer in a parking lot behind a tire store in Mayfield to help those who had lost their housing in the tornado. Among those who stopped in Thursday was Benjamin Dordoye, a 29-year-old basketball trainer in Mayfield. Dordoye said he is paying for a hotel room now, after trying to stay in his house for the first days after the tornado. He said he had to leave because his roof is cracked and he had no electricity \u2014 leading to cold nights. People help clear debris in Mayfield on December 15.Dordoye said FEMA officials told him he would receive a follow-up phone call. In the meantime, he said, he has no income. \"Working on kids, you know, that was mainly my main income. So right now I really don't have an income,\" he said. Many in the region whose homes and businesses were not severely damaged were volunteering at shelters and supply centers and with clean-up crews. Others were driving food, water and supplies to people they knew in Graves County. Rebecca Head, a 45-year-old crisis therapist at Four River Behavioral Health who said she was helping clients find places to stay, was picking up cleaning supplies at a supply center to deliver to those clients.\"It's all about moving forward,\" Head said, \"and just seeing where you can help.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, on Monday launched his campaign to unseat Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022. \"I'm running for governor,\" he tweeted alongside a video announcement. \"Together, we can push past the small and divisive politics that we see in Texas today -- and get back to the big, bold vision that used to define Texas. A Texas big enough for all of us.\" In launching a campaign that many Democrats in Texas had identified as the party's only chance of denying Abbott a third term, O'Rourke -- an El Paso native and former punk rocker who launched an internet services company and served on the city council before being elected to Congress in 2011 -- is making his third run for office in four years.His first statewide run in Texas, a long-shot Senate campaign against Republican Ted Cruz in 2018, electrified Democrats in a state where the party has rarely been competitive for a generation.He rose from little-known congressman to fundraising dynamo, setting what at the time was the all-time record for money raised for a Senate bid. And he did it with a relatively bare-bones campaign structure, mostly driving himself to campaign events across the state with two staffers and live-streaming it all on Facebook. Read MoreO'Rourke's near-miss in the Senate race -- he finished less than 3 percentage points behind Cruz -- led to a short-lived presidential run the following year. By the time he dropped out of the race in October 2019, Democrats in Texas were already publicly musing about him as a candidate for governor in 2022. This time, though, O'Rourke faces longer odds. In 2018, with then-President Donald Trump in the White House, the political environment was extremely favorable for Democrats. In 2022, amid the Biden presidency, it's Republicans who hope the midterm electorate will sweep them into power in Washington and statehouses. In the two-minute video announcing his campaign, O'Rourke used the February failure of the Texas power grid during a severe winter storm to criticize Abbott's leadership, saying those without power and water were \"abandoned by those that were elected to serve and look out for them.\" \"When the electricity grid failed and those in power failed all of us, it was the people of Texas who were willing to put their differences behind them and get to work doing the job at hand, which meant helping our fellow Texans get through that crisis,\" he said. \"We did that out of a sense of duty and responsibility to one another. Now imagine if the governor of Texas felt that same way.\" He said Abbott and Republicans in Austin have failed to tackle larger issues, including expanding Medicaid, legalizing marijuana, improving the electricity grid and improving schools. \"Instead, they're focusing on the kind of extremist policies around abortion or permitless carry or even in our schools that really only divide us and keep us apart and stop us from working together on the truly big things that we want to achieve for one another,\" he said. \"It's a really small vision for a big state. But it doesn't have to be that way.\"O'Rourke's support in Texas remains deep among Democratic loyalists, many of whom never took down their white-and-black \"Beto\" yard signs and bumper stickers. But with Democrats on defense across a much larger playing field, it's not clear he'll be able to tap into the same kind of national fundraising resources he did in 2018. Still, O'Rourke has pointed himself toward a showdown with Abbott for months. He has harshly criticized the governor's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the new law that effectively outlaws abortions in Texas, the state's restrictive new voting law and more. In social media posts, emails to his political group Powered by People and live-streams, he has hammered Abbott. In March, live-streaming on Facebook from his mother's house, O'Rourke lambasted Abbott's handling of a winter storm that shut down huge portions of the Texas power grid and said the governor had taken actions that were \"unconscionable, unforgivable,\" in ending his mask mandate and allowing all businesses to open at full capacity.\"Our governor has checked out of the fight. He's surrendered to the virus. He's going to allow it to run rampant in this state,\" O'Rourke said in the video. \"We are now on our own. But we are not on our own alone -- we are on our own together. And that might be some cold comfort, but let's take what we've got right now and let's work together.\"In October, when Abbott banned all businesses in the state from imposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates, O'Rourke was similarly critical. \"Abbott's latest anti-science, anti-public health order is creating more chaos and more confusion,\" he said on Twitter. \"Businesses need every tool at their disposal to survive the pandemic and keep workers and customers safe.\"One question O'Rourke would face if he attempts another statewide run in Texas is whether his disappointing presidential run, and the positions he took during the campaign, would hurt him.In the wake of a white supremacist gunman targeting Latinos and killing 23 people at an El Paso Walmart in August 2019, O'Rourke said assault weapons should be outlawed and the government should confiscate those currently legally owned.\"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" he said in a September 2019 presidential debate. \"We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\"But in Texas, where guns are ingrained in the state's culture and mythology, Republicans say those comments -- as well as progressive positions he took on immigration, including saying he would tear down the wall between Mexico and Texas, telling reporters it has failed to make his hometown on the border any safer -- would badly damage a future O'Rourke campaign.Abbott has already used O'Rourke's comments from the presidential race on issues like gun control, the Green New Deal, health care reform, immigration and the Black Lives Matter movement -- generally out of context -- in an ad series he has posted on YouTube called \"Wrong Way O'Rourke.\" The Republican Governors Association similarly previewed those lines of attack against O'Rourke in a statement that pointed to policies he advocated as a presidential candidate. \"Texas voters have already rejected Beto O'Rourke for statewide office, and they'll do so again now that they know just how radical he really is,\" said RGA spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez. \"Beto 2.0 vowed to confiscate the firearms of law-abiding citizens, pledged to tear down physical barriers along the border, and supported regulations that would kill over a million jobs across the state and raise taxes and the cost of living on families and small businesses. There's no telling how far Beto 3.0 will go in his vain attempt to stay relevant after running out of promotions to chase in Washington.\"This story has been updated with additional information.",

        "content": "(CNN)Meg Boggs is on a mission to redefine the public perception of a woman's postpartum body. If she could tell moms two things to start them on a self-love journey it would be to \"look in the mirror\" and \"get in the photo with your kids.\" The mother and blogger says she refused to be in photos the first couple of months of her daughter's life, \"I regret so much that I wasn't in the photos with her. It's so important and you have to think about your kids and they are going to want you in the photos with them.\"'I felt as if my postpartum journey and body didn't count'In 2018, Boggs was a first-time mom to a 7-month-old baby and dealing with negative body image issues. As a plus-size woman, she felt she didn't look like other pregnant or postpartum women on social media. It began during pregnancy, \"I would see pictures of a perfect bump and I didn't relate to that because I definitely did not have a perfect bump.\" Boggs would search for images she could relate to online but found none, which was isolating, \"I felt as if my postpartum journey and body didn't count.\"Meg Boggs wants postpartum women of all shapes and sizes to be represented on social mediaIn an attempt to connect with similar women, she started to blog on MegBoggs.com, posted her very first postpartum photo on Instagram and braced for how the internet might react. \"To my surprise, my messages flooded with positivity and things like 'I needed this today.' That's when this idea started finding its way into my heart,\" Boggs said. Read MoreThis week was the culmination of a labor of love where she recruited 25 mothers to share their experiences with body image issues, postpartum depression and anxiety, infant loss and grief using the hashtag #Thisispostpartum on Instagram.

For Dorough, this campaign served as an opportunity to let other women know they are not alone. She struggled with anxiety and depression after her eldest daughter was born with a congenital heart defect, \"My main focus every day was just to keep her alive and experience every day with her to the fullest,\" Dorough said. A couple of years later, after her second daughter was born, she experienced postpartum depression, something that affects one in nine women. \"I felt like I was in survival mode all the time, which is normal to a certain extent, but then it started turning into anger and I knew it really wasn't me, I'm not an angry person,\" she said. Having seen other bloggers online open up about their experiences with antidepressants made her feel empowered talk to her OB. \"My doctor told me that it was OK to need a little help right now and that really stuck with me,\" Dorough said. The combination of therapy and medication has been a \"complete game changer\" for her within the last month and her transparency about it has even led to one of her readers reaching out to her own doctor for help.Ashley Dorough started blogging because she was tired of not seeing anyone that loooked like her.#Thisispostpartum also serves as a platform for Dorough to encourage other women to dig deeper into what's really important and starting the self-love process from the inside out. \"When I look in the mirror right now, at this stomach, I feel like my body is a little destroyed. I just want women to know that it's normal to feel this way but it doesn't have to define you.\" She wants her daughters to grow up knowing that what they look like doesn't equal their worth. She calls them her 'hope wounds'Desiree Fortin's 105-pound body had to stretch as her three babies grew to 5-pounds each.Desiree Fortin knew that being pregnant with triplets was going to change her body, but she told herself she didn't care. After battling infertility, she believed that nothing mattered other than the fact that she was going to be a mom. When she had her babies, conceived via in vitro fertilization, or IVF, she realized, \"My body changed more than I anticipated. There was a lot of extra skin, there were stretch marks covering all over.\" She knew a change in perspective needed to take place. Fortin began writing and talking about embracing her body. An experience as painful as infertility helped Fortin focus her perspective, knowing that there are women walking the same journey she walked through wishing they had her stretch marks and extra skin. \"They are the road map to my motherhood. They are a representation of my three miracle babies who I would not have if I did not walk through infertility and carry three human beings at one time,\" Fortin says that this perspective helped her find the beauty in every single stretch mark on her body. She calls them her \"hope wounds\" because they represent \"things that I prayed for and longed for.\"Fortin shares her body before and after carrying and giving birth to tripletsEven though some of the reaction to these photos has been critical, Fortin remains focused on the reason she's doing this in the first place, to empower women to love themselves and share their stories, \"It's like a connection is made because you're being vulnerable. It's so beautiful and it fills my heart and reminds me of why I'm sharing.\"'They are beautiful, no matter what society tells them'Bethanie Garcia was inspired by her husband and children to view her body the way they did, like it was perfect. \"Once I forced myself to believe that I was beautiful, I started seeing everything in a different light and started that whole journey of self love and self worth,\" the mother of four said. Garcia wants to help create a world in which her daughters can feel beautiful without unattainable standards. She wants women to know that \"they are beautiful, no matter what society tells them or what they look like.\"Bethanie Garcia wants to be honest and open about what motherhood is really like.\nBefore her fourth child was born, Garcia experienced a first-trimester miscarriage. The loss was not only physically and emotionally traumatic but she says it created a sense of failure. Miscarriage is common -- around 10% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage -- but Garcia says that even though she knew this, it still felt like her body had failed her. She decided to post about her loss and received thousands of messages from women saying they had felt shame or failure because of their own miscarriages. Garcia heard from women that had never told anyone other than their partners, \"The response helped me feel a lot less alone.\" 'It's those messages that remind me that it's worth it'For Meg Boggs and these 25 women, the only way to normalize postpartum experiences is to be transparent, raw and continue the conversation. Sometimes, there are people that try to bring them down and cause pain with their words but Boggs says that, \"I can get hundreds of negative comments but it's that one message that I'll get, even if it's just the one that says 'This is what I needed to see today,' it's those messages that remind me that it's worth it.\"",

A few hours later, he was in the emergency room, and doctors told him he might have a kidney infection. They just needed to run a scan to confirm the diagnosis.The next words were a cold reality check: The imaging machine could not support his weight.\"They told me, 'We think you have a kidney infection, but we can't confirm for sure, so we're just going to treat it aggressively and hope that's what it is,' \" Shelton said. He was 25 years old and weighed 592 pounds.Two years earlier, Justin's wife, Lauren Shelton, had had her own medical scare; her gallbladder had to be removed because of weight-related complications. At her heaviest, Lauren weighed 341 pounds.Their size made everyday tasks difficult, too. Years ago, Lauren was on a plane, and the seat belt wouldn't buckle. She was mortified and tried to hide from the flight attendants that she didn't fit into the seat.

They would go out to eat and indulge in one unhealthy meal after another. They knew that in order to get healthy, they needed someone to steer them in the right direction. So they sought help from a weight-loss management program at a local medical school. A physician's assistant gave them guidelines on what they should and should not be eating, and on the amount of exercise they needed.Justin and Lauren started their new exercise routine by doing simple activities such as walking around the park and swimming. In late 2012, they joined a gym. \"We go to the gym five to six days a week and take one day off and try to do something fun and active like hiking or swimming,\" Lauren said.The couple also started using a smartphone app to track the calories they consumed. In the beginning, they ate at restaurants only on special occasions and prepared all meals at home.Lauren found recipes for healthier versions of the foods they loved. Their diet primarily consists of lean meats with lots of fruits and vegetables. Even today, everything they eat goes into a food journal.The weight came off quickly at the beginning. Justin lost 25 pounds and Lauren lost 30 pounds during the first month alone. They tried to keep the weight loss steady after that, knowing they couldn't expect to see such a big number month after month without being disappointed. Weekly weigh-ins helped them track their progress.\"We have graphs that show our weight loss through an app. It helps us stay motivated and get through the hard weeks,\" Justin said.In just 19 months, Justin dropped 362 pounds and Lauren lost 176, for a total of 538 pounds. 'Nobody is perfect'As they begin to move into the maintenance phase of their diet, the couple has allowed themselves to indulge once in a while. They now have what they call their Special Sunday Meal, where they will cook something they don't typically have during the week.\"This Sunday, we may have grilled turkey burgers on a whole-wheat bun with some oven-baked potatoes,\" Lauren said. \"Typically, we do not have starches very often and do not keep breads in the house.\"They still give in to cravings from time to time. Lauren says she has a sweet tooth, but she controls cravings by distracting herself with activities such as walks or naps. What keeps her on track is understanding that \"No matter how many times you slipped or messed up, you just have to start over, and eventually you'll get there,\" she said. \"You have to stay positive and remind yourself that you're human and nobody is perfect.\"Even though they've managed to lose a substantial amount of weight -- Lauren went from a size 32 dress to a size 12, and Justin went from size 58 pants to a size 36 -- the couple struggles with the psychological side effects of such a massive physical change.Self-image has been an obstacle for both Lauren and Justin. They admit to having moments when they still see themselves as the obese people they used to be. \"I don't see myself as quite as small as what the pictures show or people tell us we look like,\" Lauren said.Through both the struggles and triumphs they have found support in each other. They say that doing this as a team has brought them closer together, and they feel like they are almost newlyweds again. Recently, Lauren and Justin traveled on a plane and were thrilled to find they could not only buckle their seat belts but needed to tighten them. They also returned to the theme park and rode the rides with no problems at all. \"It was kind of triumphant,\" Justin said. \"We are a lot more adventurous and outgoing. Our outlook has changed almost completely.\"Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport",

He was covered in sweat, his left arm was completely numb and his heart was pounding violently. He started crying because he was terrified of what was happening to him.That night in January 2010 was the third time in two weeks his sleep had been interrupted by heart attack-like symptoms, and he thought he knew why. \"It's sad to say, but I felt like I deserved this because I never took care of myself,\" Colao says.He was 28, weighed 460 pounds and wore size 6X clothing. He knew his habits of binge drinking, smoking two packs of cigarettes a day and overindulging in food were slowly killing him. \"I asked God to give me another chance,\" Colao says, \"and I passed out.\"The Chicago native had been overweight since childhood. He was born into an Italian family where food was at the center of everything. His parents worked long hours, so his grandfather played a large role in raising him.JUST WATCHEDCan you really lose weight with an app?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCan you really lose weight with an app? 01:54JUST WATCHEDFTC cracks down on weight-loss scamsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFTC cracks down on weight-loss scams 02:40JUST WATCHEDPastor Rick Warren fights fat with faithReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPastor Rick Warren fights fat with faith 07:24In school, Colao was bullied because of his weight, and his grandfather was his only friend. But when Colao was 9, his grandfather died. He turned to food to comfort the loneliness he felt.\"Food became a total escape,\" he says. \"I always considered it my drug.\"The weight kept piling on through adolescence and beyond. At 18, he started smoking. He began to drink heavily when he was 22. All the while he continued to eat unhealthy foods day and night. On his blog, I've Said It All Before, Colao gives examples of some of his regular meals at the time. One included two burgers, a large soda, large French fries and chicken nuggets, totaling more than 2,400 calories. By 2010, Colao was drinking up to 10 drinks in one night and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. But after those scary symptoms kept waking him up, he made a pact with himself to change.\"I quit smoking and stopped eating everything that was bad,\" he says.Colao's parents bought him a treadmill because he was uncomfortable exercising in a gym. \"That's what really helped me the most -- being able to gain the physical and mental stability and work out on my own,\" he recalls. He started by walking and slowly worked his way up to jogging and weightlifting.Colao overhauled his diet as well. He stopped eating fast food, fried food and red meat and drinking soda. He forced himself to get accustomed to healthy alternatives while allowing himself to indulge in small things so he wouldn't feel overwhelmed. He was motivated to change his eating habits by realizing how much time he would have to exercise to burn off the foods he was consuming.Over the first couple of months, Colao dropped 50 pounds. The loss drove him to continue, and he set a goal of losing 200 pounds.When he had lost down to 305 pounds, Colao went through a difficult breakup and eased up on his calorie counting and exercising habits. Six months later, he had gained back 40 pounds. Scared he would continue gaining weight, he got back on the wagon.\"I ended up being so angry at how bad I had gotten again, that I forced myself to get back on track,\" he remembers.He began monitoring his caloric intake again and started exercising two hours a day, five days a week.As a reward for reaching his goal of a 200-pound weight loss, Colao booked a trip to Philadelphia to run up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and re-create a famous scene from the movie \"Rocky.\" He was on course to hit his goal when a foot fracture sidelined him for a few weeks.When the trip to Philadelphia approached, Colao had lost 185 pounds and was just shy of his goal. Regardless, he decided to go and run up those stairs.Colao finally hit his goal weight of 260 pounds in October. He still wants to lose another 20 to 30 pounds, but his focus has moved toward challenging himself with new exercises. He's also weightlifting to tone up some loose skin that has developed around his arms and stomach.Through his journey, Colao has found support and motivation in his parents and girlfriend, Julia Gonzalez. He says he still struggles to see himself in his slimmer body, and Gonzalez pushes him to look on the bright side.\"I'm always going to be a positive voice for him to remember what a great thing he's accomplished,\" she says. \"He inspires so many people. People see him, and they realize that they can do it, too.\"Colao is using his experience to become a certified personal trainer. \"My main desire is to help people like me -- people that are obese and feel hopeless about the situation,\" he says.Four years ago, Colao could not tie his shoes without losing his breath. A few weeks ago, he did a push-up for the first time. In two months, he hopes to be a certified personal trainer and well on his way to helping others reach their weight-loss goals.",

In 2010, she had the opportunity to do it when her employer organized a company weight loss challenge. But when she lined up to weigh in, Privitera realized the scale wouldn't hold her 381-pound frame. \"They wanted me to go down to shipping and receiving and get on the shipping scale,\" she says. She refused. However embarrassing this moment was, it wasn't enough to prompt Privitera to change. A couple of months later, in early 2011, the Cabot, Arkansas, native was put on bed rest because her blood pressure was too high. Doctors gave her three  blood pressure medications and an anti-depressant.Read Rebecca Privitera's story on CNN iReport \"I was out of work for about four weeks,\" Privitera remembers. \"They were afraid I was going to have a stroke.\"Before going on bed rest, she had bought a wedding dress. By the time the dress came in, it was too tight to wear. Privitera had to have a second dress specially made overseas.Instead of a dream night, Privitera's wedding in April 2011 felt like a nightmare. \"I was hot and a sweaty mess,\" she says. \"I was so overweight and so uncomfortable. I was miserable. I couldn't stand it.\"A few weeks after her wedding, Privitera's new mother-in-law asked her to join her in a 5-kilometer run. It took her an hour and 14 minutes to complete. \"My body was physically hurting; I didn't want to do it anymore,\" she says. \"I hit rock bottom.\"Father's nursing home inspires son to lose weightAfter the race, Privitera and her husband, Justin, had an honest conversation. He told her they couldn't afford weight loss surgery or food supplement programs, and she would have to lose weight the old-fashioned way.She agreed and embarked on a journey to lose more than 200 pounds in just over two years.Her first step was to get active. Privitera invested in cardio DVDs and started working out at home. She felt too embarrassed to go to a gym and felt that personal training was too expensive. \"The videos showed results that gave me hope, so I gave it a shot,\" she says.In the beginning, she was losing 10 to 12 pounds a month. She posted her results on Facebook and the overwhelming response from her friends and family pushed her to continue exercising. After losing about 65 pounds, Privitera started to modify her eating habits. She started looking up calorie counts for meals before going out to eat in order to make smarter choices at restaurants. She also began to create healthier versions of meals at home using better ingredients.Privitera was obese her entire life. Her parents divorced when she was 12 years old.  Her mother worked two jobs and struggled to make ends meet. \"A lot of our food choices came out of a paper bag -- I lived on fast food,\" she remembers. There were days during her high school years when she would eat McDonalds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. She recalls being able to eat an entire half-gallon of mint chocolate-chip ice cream in one night. She was a 16-year-old who weighed more than 300 pounds and developed a blood clot in her leg. Even with this serious medical issue, she still made poor nutrition choices and her weight continued to balloon into adulthood.'From Fatman to Ironman;' Dad loses 135 poundsNow, more than two years into her weight-loss journey, Privitera is incorporating new foods into her diet. \"I've followed meal plans with food like quinoa and asparagus,\" she says. \"Until recently, I had never had Brussels sprouts before.\" Privitera approaches this journey as exactly that -- a journey. She allows herself to indulge once in a while, reminding herself if she wants something she can eat it, just not all the time.Instead of focusing on calorie restriction, she focuses on eating reasonable portions of healthy foods. \"You have to balance it out,\" she says. \"You can't extreme diet for the rest of your life.\"She credits her success to the support of her husband and family, but also to the community of people around her. The majority of her 211-pound loss has come from exercise done right inside her home. She has used programs such as TurboFire and Beachbody, and is now on her fourth round of P90X. She's developed friendships and found accountability partners in the people who use the online message boards for these at-home programs. Privitera works out six days a week, taking Sunday off, and spends anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours a day exercising. She has been able to avoid any physical setbacks by training safely and not over-exerting herself. She has continued to use home videos because it keeps her from making excuses to miss workouts. \"I hate being pressed for time,\" she says. \"Working out at home, I get up and get started.\"She has faced a lot of mental road blocks that nearly made her give up. During these times she has had to rely on people like her mother-in-law to tell her that she has what it takes to keep going and accomplish her goals.Her motivators have inspired Privitera to become a motivator for others. Privitera says she has helped other women lose a combined 200 pounds by motivating them on Facebook, Instagram and through online communities like the ones she uses. She also regularly teaches a cardio-kickboxing class at a local community center.About a month ago, she spoke to a class of high school students. She told them that overweight teenagers can make small choices now that will make a world of a difference in their lives. \"One young lady shared that she eats two double cheeseburgers, medium fries, a medium Sprite and three cookies from McDonalds every single night,\" Privitera recalls. \"She had no idea how many calories and how much fat there was in it.\"Her weight loss success has inspired the people closest to her. Privitera's husband has started his own program and lost 35 pounds. She says this experience has brought them closer together. \"My husband sees that I have a real passion,\" she says.Justin says he's mostly surprised by her new attitude. \"She is more positive, upbeat and always looking on the bright side of things,\" he says. \"It inspires me every day to do better. I'm very lucky to have a wife like her.\"Privitera set out to complete 13 races in 2013, including three 10Ks. Her 13th race of the year was in late October and it was a big one: her first half-marathon.She completed the race with her mother-in-law by her side the entire time. Unlike their first race together, this time she wanted to do it and not give up. \"I cried after I finished this half-marathon,\" she says. \"You look for that moment when you cry and think, 'I've done something that some people cannot do.' \" No magic bullet for keeping off the pounds",

        "content": "(CNN)David Bracho became a nurse after nearly two decades in the US Army Reserve.  He's now working in a Covid-19 ward at Rush Medical Center in Chicago -- and he recognizes the parallels.  He was deployed twice, Bracho said, and what he saw in Afghanistan is similar to what he has seen in the Covid-19 unit. \"When the military gets deployed for nine months to a year, we have relief,\" he said. \"There's someone that's gonna relieve us from our duties (so we can) go back home.\" But inside Rush and other hospitals across the country, Bracho said there is no relief. David Bracho is a registered nurse who also completed two tours in Afghanistan.Nurses are working 16-hour shifts -- and picking up more \"just to keep the patients safe and alive.\" Read MoreThe pandemic has brought the kind of emotional trauma Bracho says will last for years. \"There's a huge amount of PTSD ... and these nurses are expected to just work through it,\" he said.   Nationwide, the numbers tell the same story. Ninety-two percent of more than 6,500 critical care nurses responding to an American Association of Critical Care Nurses survey said the pandemic has depleted nurses. About 66% have considered leaving.Rush is supplementing care teams with temporary staff for the first time in 20 years, hospital spokesperson Charlie Jolie told CNN. Since the pandemic started, Jolie said more than 3,800 people have been hospitalized with Covid at Rush. He also said Rush nurses have reported leaving for more money or jobs with less stress. But through a recently launched program, a combat veteran is helping nurses cope with this new burden. Help from another frontlineMark Schimmelpfennig is helping nurses by using the same treatment given to soldiers experiencing grief and PTSD. The program, called Growing Forward, is similar to group therapy. Participants attend six sessions for 30 minutes. They also journal, acknowledge what they feel and learn healthy ways to decompress. \"When I was able to say, 'Hey, you're fighting a war against an enemy that you can't see feel touch, hear or taste and it's kicking our butts,' they got it,\" Schimmelpfennig said. \"The cumulative trauma of dealing with that day after day after day after day, through surge after surge -- there's going to be a cost just like when a combat soldier goes outside the wire.\" Bereavement Support and Educator Coordinator, Kim Sangster, started the initiative on August 21 after seeing a need to care for staff treating Covid patients.  Kim Sangster is the Bereavement Support and Education Coordinator at Rush who started the pilot program.She says one of the six sessions focuses on self-compassion. Sangster said after every session, participants leave with a linking object or something to remind them of the session. \"We choose self-compassion over self-esteem because self-compassion is what we need to be able to create space so that we can feel really tough and complex feelings and deal with tough stuff,\" she said. Self-care won't save us from exhaustion. This other strategy mightAnother exercise with Schimmelpfennig includes telling the nurses to stomp their feet twice and breathe. Schimmelpfennig said that delay, motion and breath can take people from a 10 on the stress scale to a seven. \"Seven is still not very good, but you can get your job done,\" he said. Many of the frontline staff Schimmelpfennig has worked with expressed feeling unworthy of the title \"hero,\" he said. Schimmelpfennig described what they were experiencing as moral injury: failing to do something one believes should have been done or an act violating someone's moral code or values. It's an invisible wound thousands of veterans carry. Mark Schimmelpfennig (left), seen here with nurse David Bracho, is using techniques from the military to help nurses deal with PTSD, grief and trauma.\"Every nurse here is a nurse because they want to help take care of people,\" Schimmelpfennig said. \"And so, when they are in situations where they're not sure if what they're doing is going to work, even though that's the latest and greatest information from the hospital or the CDC, (they question) 'Am I up to this task?'\" There's also anger -- feeling like they are \"getting sick and tired of dealing with unvaccinated people\" and that \"this could have been prevented,\" Schimmelpfennig added.

She said she's worked 26 years at the Chicago hospital and cried more in the last two than her entire career.  Melissa Gerona said she's worked 26 years at Rush and cried more in the last two years than her entire career. \"I've seen more tears shed on this unit -- and I have my own -- than ever before,\" she said. \"I couldn't tell patients that you're going to get better because at that point early on, we didn't know who was going to get better. \"We've been through something now, all of us. And now we are doing more with less. Nurses have left the bedside.\" Despite the tough days and emotional toll, Gerona vows to never quit. She and other healthcare workers are relentless in their pursuit to save lives while fighting an invisible battle. \"My fear is that we're going to have to do this again. Every time there's a surge and I'm putting on my scrubs in the morning, I am always kind of in disbelief,\" Gerona said. \"I do feel like it's a war.

It's outrageous that teachers, school nurses, counselors and more had to endure a week of being locked out by the mayor just to get a commitment from her bargaining team to provide every student with an N95 mask in a pandemic,\" said CTU President Jesse Sharkey in a statement. \"Our members' vote today represents a union's, and a city's, frustration with a mayor that has simmered since the beginning of this pandemic,\" Sharkey said.Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot tweeted a statement Wednesday night saying she and the school district were pleased to come to an agreement with the CTU \"that guarantees predictability and stability for the rest of the school year.\"Read MoreDesperate to fill teacher shortages, school districts ask parents and various staff to become substitutes\"We all agree we must prioritize the health and well-being of everyone in our school communities including our kids, families and staff,\" Lightfoot tweeted. \"The science tells us the safest place for our students is in the classroom.\"In a statement, Lightfoot said in addition to the more than $100 million already spent on Covid-19 mitigation, \"CPS is providing KN95 masks, augmenting its every school-every week testing program & strengthening its contact tracing approach.\"\"CPS principals will continue to work w/their school-based safety teams to make data-informed decisions in the best interests of students & families. We encourage families to get their kids vaccinated and consent to regular testing,\" the mayor tweeted. The new agreement comes nearly two days after the union's House of Delegates voted to suspend its work action, effectively ending the standoff with Chicago Public Schools. The rank-and-file vote was the final hurdle. Teachers in the nation's third-largest school district returned in person to schools Tuesday -- with students returning Wednesday -- after classes were canceled five days in a row amid a dispute between the teachers union and the district over Covid-19 safety protocols. The new deal in Chicago follows agreement among the sides on KN95 masks for students and staff for the rest of the school year; the availability of weekly Covid-19 testing; and parameters for when a school could switch to remote teaching. The dispute highlighted a debate playing out in school districts across the country as they grapple with balancing the advantages of in-person instruction with health concerns during the rapid surge of the Omicron variant. Parents, teachers still concerned about returning to in-person learningTeacher Nicole Riegert returned to her science classroom Wednesday conflicted. \"I'm a biology teacher, so I know a lot about viruses. And this virus is dangerous,\" Riegert told CNN.'This is not a virus to fool around with,' an expert says as the return-to-classroom debate rages on\"I don't think the metric should be: Well, it's not killing people. The metric should be: It's making people sick. And I got Covid over break.\" Riegert still has trouble breathing after her infection over the holiday break, she said. On Wednesday morning, hours before the 4 p.m. CT deadline to vote on the deal, Riegert said she had not yet decided which way to vote. If the rank-and-file union members vote down the tentative agreement, the decision would then go back to the union's House of Delegates. Next steps then might include keeping in-person learning as negotiations resume or a push for remote learning as negotiations continue.In the meantime, 14-year-old Summer Dailey is thrilled to be back in school, she told CNN.\"Not being in school has been like really kind of sad and boring for me,\" the Jones College Preparatory High School freshman said. \"I love going to school, personally. So I just really wanted to go back to school. I'm really excited to be back.\"Xuan-Vu Nguyen, whose 12-year-old son is a student in the district, said she's also relieved schools are reopening. \"My first reaction was, 'Yay!'\" But she added: \"We're anxious about if and when this is going to happen again at no notice whatsoever.\"Chicago Teachers Union and the city reach a tenatative deal about Covid-19 safety measuresParents didn't get a lot of warning of the school closures and her family had to drop everything to accommodate the change, Nguyen said, which left her feeling frustrated. \"I was, as a parent, left with no power -- nowhere to voice my concerns, nowhere to ask questions, really, about when this was going to end.\"Kathryn Rose, a Chicago teacher and parent, said she was eager to get back to school.\"I'm certainly relieved to go back to the classroom and see my students, and my kids are really excited to go back, too,\" she said. \"It's been frustrating to sit at home, healthy, and wanting to be in the classroom.\"Rose always felt safe with the school's mitigation measures and didn't feel a districtwide shutdown was necessary, she said. \"When you shut down schools, you're ignoring the multitude of dangers outside of the classroom, like abuse and hunger and lack of heat and violence,\" she said. \"And these are things that families in Chicago are really struggling with.\"Melanie Lopez, a CPS teacher and the mother of 7-year-old twin girls, said she knows that at this point sending her kids to school is just what she has to do.Melanie Lopez, seen here with her family, says she feels \"in limbo\" about Chicago Public schools returning to in-person learning.\"I trust their teachers are going to do everything possible. ... It's just certain things are out of their control,\" she said. \"I've tried to teach my daughters as best as possible, make sure you're wearing your mask, make sure you're giving personal space.\"Lopez said she still feels uncertainty about how this recent agreement will hold and wants to better plan for what's next. She told CNN she felt \"like this is kind of limbo right now.\" \"We've been through it now twice,\" she said. \"In case there's a surge, in case there's a new variant, what is the plan?\"Increased testing is part of the proposed dealAs part of the deal, Covid-19 testing in schools will ramp up to 10% of students in each school being tested each week, CTU chief of staff Jen Johnson said. Child hospitalizations are surging in this Chicago hospital. Only one of the young patients was fully vaccinated, doctor saysThe mayor's office will work with the teachers union on engaging families to increase testing consents, Mayor Lightfoot said. \"That's a critical part of it,\" she said. \"We want to get to as high a number in testing consents as we possibly can.\"The tentative deal also includes details on contact tracing and new incentives to increase the number of substitutes in the district, the mayor said.The two sides also \"reached an agreement on the metrics for, at a school-based level, for when we needed to convert a classroom or school to go remote. Not surprisingly, the component parts of that depend upon staff and or student absences,\" she said.Voting by the union's rank-and-file members began late Tuesday and is expected to be open for 24 hours, in time for a regularly scheduled CTU House of Delegates meeting Wednesday afternoon, a union official told CNN.The Omicron surge is impacting schools nationwideThe impasse in Chicago began last week when the union voted to begin teaching virtually due to rising Covid-19 cases in the school system. In response, the school district canceled classes during negotiations.Desperate to fill teacher shortages, school districts ask parents and various staff to become substitutesOn January 4 -- the last day students were in classrooms before the temporary shutdown -- Chicago Public Schools reported 422 new Covid-19 cases among students and 271 new cases among adults -- both record highs for the academic year.Nationwide, the vast majority of schools are operating as normal, but there were at least 2,685 schools not offering in-person learning as of Tuesday, according to data company Burbio, which aggregates data based on school calendars and other sources.In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, 66,000 cases of Covid-19 were reported among students and staff as they got back to in-person instruction Tuesday. The district required a Covid-19 test for all students and employees, regardless of vaccination status, before they returned from winter break. Superintendent Megan Reilly said every adult on school campuses and more than 80% of students older than 12 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Nevada's Clark County School District -- the fourth-largest in the US -- is taking a \"five-day pause\" starting Friday to deal with its \"extreme staffing shortages based on the high number of positive Covid-19 cases.\" Students will not have school Friday or on January 18; Monday was already scheduled as a day off for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.From Europe to the US, Covid cases in children are surging. Schools aren't preparedIn Philadelphia, nearly a third of the city's schools have shifted to remote learning because of a combination of the threshold level of positive cases of Covid-19 and a review of staffing data. \"We will continue to make school-by-school decisions based on the most current staffing data, and ask that you prepare for the possibility of virtual learning at any time,\" Superintendent Dr. William Hite said in a statement Tuesday.Cincinnati Public Schools are temporarily going remote because of \"ongoing staff shortages that are the result of increased community spread of Covid-19,\" the district said in a statement Monday.Schools in Santa Fe, New Mexico, will go virtual beginning January 18, with a return to in-person instruction planned for January 24 \"if conditions improve,\" according to a statement from the district. The shift is due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, Superintendent Larry Chavez said. \"SFPS ended last week with 361 cases involving students and staff, the largest ever in one week for our district, with many still being investigated,\" he said. \"Cases could rise to near 600 this week, and we have seen increased spread in classrooms.\"CNN's Adrienne Broaddus and Omar Jimenez reported from Chicago; Elizabeth Stuart and Paul P.

        "content": "(CNN)The conviction of former Minnesota police officer Kim Potter in the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright would not have happened just a few years ago, according to legal experts surprised by the jury's verdict.Potter, who is White, was found guilty Thursday of first- and second-degree manslaughter in her killing of Wright when she said she mistakenly shot the 20-year-old Black man with a gun instead of a Taser. Potter, 49, had pleaded not guilty to the charges. During a police stop on April 11 in Brooklyn Center, near Minneapolis, officers learned Wright had an outstanding warrant and tried to arrest him. As Wright tried to flee the scene, Potter yelled, \"Taser, Taser\" and instead pulled out her gun and fatally shot him.Ex-officer Kim Potter found guilty of two counts of manslaughter for fatally shooting Daunte Wright The case unfolded at a time when the American justice system is under scrutiny over the legal disciplinary measures police officers face when they use force --whether deadly or otherwise -- against people of color, particularly Black Americans.The 12-member jury in Potter's case deliberated for about 27 hours since Monday before reaching the guilty verdict -- which surprised two legal experts who said they either expected a hung jury or mistrial altogether. Read More\"Three to five years ago, this would be a full acquittal, not even a concern over a mistrial. So the fact that we are now seeing more accountability for officers -- the idea they are not above the law, that if they do the crime, they do the time,\" criminal defense attorney Sara Azari said Thursday after the conviction. \"It's definitely not systemic change, but it is definitely a change in trend. And this is not something that would have happened earlier.\" Potter's defense argued at trial that her actions did not rise to the level of a crime and that the use of the Taser was reasonable. Defense attorney Earl Gray argued that Potter had the right to use deadly force -- claiming her actions shouldn't be considered reckless because she \"didn't know she had a gun.\"Video was key in trial of Kimberly Potter, the officer who killed Daunte WrightMeanwhile, the prosecution argued Potter's fatal error was due to recklessness and negligence. Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Erin Eldridge told jurors in closing arguments that there would be no case if Potter \"followed her training ... paid attention ... and considered the risk,\" before shooting Wright. \"Accidents can still be crimes if they occur because of recklessness or culpable negligence. ... It's not a defense to the crimes charged,\" the prosecutor said. \"I think the prosecution did a good job of separating out her behavior, her remorse, and saying we have to hold people responsible when they do something tragic when it's so unbelievably negligent,\" CNN legal analyst and defense attorney Mark O'Mara said. O'Mara echoed Azari's take on the conviction, saying in part, \"We are finally in the days of Floyd,\" referring to George Floyd, a Black man whose murder by a White Minneapolis police officer in May 2020 sparked national and global protests against police brutality. \"We are without question holding cops more responsible for their actions. They do not get a free pass,\" O'Mara told CNN's John Berman on Thursday, adding that Potter's reaction seems to stem from \"implicit bias.\"\"We now need to truly train cops and law enforcement how to rethink their perspective of young Black males,\" he said. \"Not an easy mistake to make\"The jury -- which was deadlocked at times during trial -- had access to a gun and Taser to compare their differences, and O'Mara and Azari both agree that strategy helped the prosecution land the conviction. \"I do believe that the ability to compare the weapons and just see how grossly negligent she (Potter) was or criminally negligent she was given the vast differences between these two weapons,\" Azari said. \"It's not every day an officer with 26 years of training and certification mistakes a gun for a Taser.\" Confusing the two weapons \"was not an easy mistake to make,\" O'Mara noted. \"It is so negligent; it is so unusual to grab a Taser and think it's a gun that that act itself evidences recklessness,\" O'Mara explained. Special agent Sam McGinnis of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension testified there were multiple differences between department-issued stun guns and Potter's gun. McGinnis, a state investigative agent responsible for reviewing police shootings, said his analysis of the two weapons concluded marked differences in weight. Potter's Glock handgun weighed 2.11 pounds, he testified, compared to her Taser which weighed less than a pound.The triggers on both weapons also have different shapes, McGinnis said, as the gun's is curved while the Taser's is flat.The weapons were on opposite sides of Potter's body and accessed differently, according to McGinnis. The gun's holster had a snap retention system to secure the gun in place while the Taser's holster required Potter to push a lever.The family of Daunte Wright celebrate a guilty verdict for Kim Potter outside of the Hennepin County Government Center on  December 23, 2021, in Minneapolis.Family, community celebrate verdictFollowing the highly anticipated verdict, some in the community as well as Wright's family members shared their emotional sentiments. Wright's parents, Aubrey Wright and Katie Bryant, expressed sighs and cries, according to reporters.\"The moment we heard guilty on manslaughter one -- emotions, every single emotion that you can imagine, just running through your body. I kind of let out a yelp because it was built up in the anticipation,\" Bryant told reporters.\"This is just a step forward in the bigger issue with policing and hopefully there has to be no more Dauntes. No more Dauntes and so many more names we chant in our streets,\" she later told CNN. Snippets of Daunte Wright's short life emerge at Kim Potter's trialMoments after the guilty verdict, people outside the courthouse in Minneapolis held portraits of Wright as well as Black Lives Matter signs, celebrating the jury's decision.One woman told CNN's Omar Jimenez the verdict is \"proof that the world can change and do better for us Black people, us minorities in this world.\"\"That's all I want. I have a Black son growing up in this world. You can imagine my fear for him,\" she said. \"We just need change, that's all. It should have never happened. We fought for this.\"Potter's conviction of the manslaughter charges brings \"a degree of accountability\" for Wright's killing, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Thursday. He also addressed law enforcement officers, saying being \"held accountable ... does not diminish you.\"\"Accountability is not justice. Justice is restoration. Justice would be restoring Daunte to life and making the Wright family whole again. Justice is beyond the reach that we have in this life for Daunte. But accountability is an important step, a critical, necessary step on the road to justice for us all,\" Ellison said.

        "content": "Oxford, Michigan (CNN)The terror at Michigan's Oxford High School that left four dead started with gunfire, yelling and an urgent message on a loudspeaker.Then frightened students barricaded doors, phoned for help and picked up anything they could grab in case they needed to fight back.Live updates: At least 4 killed in shooting at Michigan high schoolAiden Page, a senior, was in a classroom when he heard two gunshots Tuesday afternoon -- part of what authorities called a sophomore's \"absolutely cold-hearted, murderous\" rampage that left four students dead and seven other people injured in the deadliest shooting at a US K-12 school since 2018.Just like in the active shooter drills they'd practiced, Page watched his teacher run in and lock the door, then students shoved desks against it, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\"We grabbed calculators, we grabbed scissors just in case the shooter got in and we had to attack them,\" he said, describing how a bullet pierced one of the desks they'd used to block the door.Read MoreIn a sign language class, freshman Mark Kluska heard someone announce a lockdodwn over the school's loudspeakers. His teacher shut the door and fixed it with a metal doorstop.\"I started realizing it was real when I began to hear yelling,\" Kluska told CNN.Later, someone outside the room who claimed to be with the sheriff's office told Kluska and his classmates that all was safe and they could come out, a video the freshman recorded shows. Authorities look for possible motive behind 15-year-old Michigan high school shooting suspect. Here's what we know\"We're not willing to take that risk right now,\" the teacher replies.It's not clear who the person at the door was. But the teacher quickly signaled students to scramble out a first-floor window into the snow, Kluska said. From there, they raced across a courtyard to another part of the building, where a law enforcement officer herded them to safety. Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard confirmed during a news conference Wednesday the suspect never knocked on any doors. More than 100 calls to 911 were made. About two to three minutes after officers arrived, they found a 15-year-old suspect, later identified as Ethan Crumbley, and took him into custody without incident, Bouchard said.Crumbley has been charged as an adult with terrorism causing death and four counts of first-degree murder. He also was charged with seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen D. McDonald said.Ethan CrumbleyThe suspect's lawyer entered a plea of not guilty on his client's behalf at Wednesday's arraignment. The judge scheduled a probable cause hearing for December 13 and a preliminary examination hearing for December 20.During Crumbley's arraignment Wednesday, Lt. Tim Willis said two separate videos were recovered from the suspected shooter's cellphone in which he talked about shooting and killing students the next day at Oxford High School. In addition to the cellphone, a journal was recovered from Crumbley's backpack detailing his \"desire to shoot up the school,\" Willis said. One of the dead was 14 years oldThe four students who died have been identified as Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; and Justin Shilling, 17, authorities said.Justin died Wednesday morning at a hospital; the others died Tuesday, the sheriff's office said. Tate died in a patrol car while a deputy was taking him to a hospital, Bouchard said.Anita's Kitchen, where Shilling worked, shared a statement on social media about him.\"Justin was an exemplary employee, a devoted friend and co-worker, co-captain of his bowling team, and simply a pleasure to be around. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time,\" the statement read.Seven others -- six students and a teacher -- were shot, Bouchard said. Among the wounded were a 14-year-old girl who was on a ventilator following surgery, Bouchard said Tuesday night. On Wednesday, it was announced she had been taken off the ventilator and was in stable condition. A 14-year-old boy had a gunshot wound to the jaw and head. The teacher, a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy were discharged, Bouchard said.Students in senior Aiden Page's class shoved desks against a door after the shooting started, he said.Parents could face chargesThe attack was the deadliest US school shooting since eight students and two teachers were slain in May 2018 at Texas' Santa Fe High School, according to a CNN tally. There have been 48 shootings this year on K-12 campuses, 32 of them since August 1.The suspect was being held at a juvenile detention facility. Bouchard said authorities asked a judge to transfer him from the detention facility to the Oakland County Jail. The judge agreed to the request. Charges of first-degree murder require allegations of premeditation, and evidence in this case indicates the shooting was planned \"well before the incident,\" McDonald said.This shooting was \"absolutely premeditated,\" McDonald told reporters, without elaborating.McDonald's office will consider charges against the suspect's parents, she said.The weapon authorities said was used in the shooting, a 9mm Sig Sauer SP2022 semiautomatic pistol, was purchased by Crumbley's father on Friday, four days before shots rang out at the school, Bouchard said. Authorities are considering charges against both parents, with McDonald saying a decision would be made on that \"swiftly.\" The potential charges stem from the parents owning a gun. McDonald said that means securing it properly, ensuring ammunition is kept separate, among other legal responsibilities. \"We have to hold individuals accountable who don't do that,\" she said.CNN has pressed the prosecutor to speak on whether evidence was recovered to support potential charges and which charges are being considered. The prosecutor declined to go into detail citing the investigation, but reiterated that an announcement would be made as soon as possible regarding whether charges would be brought.CNN has attempted to reach the parents of Ethan Crumbley and are attempting to identify an attorney for them.McDonald told CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday she felt it was tragic how desensitized people were to gun violence, but gun owners should be held accountable for their ownership and possession of a firearm. Suspect and his parents met with school officials hours before shootingBouchard said the 15-year-old had not been on law enforcement radar prior to the shooting. However, authorities did learn after the shooting that the suspect and his parents met with school officials a few hours before the shooting. Officials met with just the suspect the day before and with the suspect and parents the day of the shooting, Bouchard said.\"The day before, it was a meeting with school personnel about some concerning behavior and the meeting the day of was with school personnel and parents about a different issue,\" Bouchard said. The sheriff declined to go into issues on either day.\"Prior to those two meetings there was no contact or nothing in his file by either concerning behavior or discipline,\" he said. McDonald told CNN she was not able to comment on what, specifically, the gunman, parents and school officials discussed during their meeting. \"There's an additional piece of evidence that hasn't been released yet, but I can assure you it was troubling, it was disturbing, and unfortunately he was allowed to go back to class,\" she said.Video shows assailant 'was shooting people at close range,' sheriff saysInvestigators recovered more than 30 shell casings, said the sheriff, who'd earlier said at least a dozen rounds were fired.\"We believe he fired at least 30 shots,\" he said.Bouchard said two 15-round magazines were recovered by investigators and a third was recovered in the overnight hours. Investigators also learned the suspect had 18 rounds left, with seven in his pocket. \"With this much ammunition still with him ... the quick actions of the school and the lockdown as well as the deputies going to the danger, saved lives,\" Bouchard said.Parents walk with their children away from a grocery store parking lot, where many students gathered after the shooting.Video from the school shows the assailant was \"shooting people at close range -- oftentimes toward the head or chest,\" Bouchard told CNN's \"New Day\" earlier Wednesday.\"It's chilling. It's absolutely cold-hearted, murderous,\" Bouchard said.Prosecutors said during Crumbley's arraignment they've seen video from the school surveillance cameras showing Crumbley \"methodically and deliberately\" walking the hallways, aiming a gun at students and firing.\"What is depicted on that video, honestly judge, I don't have the words to describe how horrific that was,\" said prosecutor Marc Keast.Video showed Crumbley with a backpack, and a minute later exiting the bathroom without the backpack and with a gun in hand, authorities said. He started firing right outside the bathroom, Keast said, but after children started running away, he continued to go down the hallway at a \"methodical pace\" and shot inside classrooms and at students who hadn't had the opportunity to escape. This continued for another four or five minutes and he went to another bathroom, Keast said. When deputies arrived, he set down the gun and surrendered.\"A preliminary review of the defendant's social media accounts, his cellphone, as well as other documented evidence recovered on scene showed that this defendant planned this shooting, he deliberately brought the handgun that day with the intent to murder as many students as he could,\" Keast said.Though much of the shooting was at close range, it nevertheless appeared \"random,\" Bouchard told CNN, without elaborating.The assailant \"tried to breach classroom doors,\" the sheriff said.\"He actually fired through a number of the doors that I looked at last night -- through the barricaded doors. ... Some of those barricades were struck by gunfire,\" Bouchard said.Bouchard praised the work of his deputies and other local law enforcement agencies that responded Tuesday, saying their coordination and active shooter training proved invaluable.Deputies were dispatched to the school at 12:52 p.m., and the suspect was in custody within three minutes of their arrival, Bouchard said.As deputies made their way through the school, they encountered the suspect, who then put his hands up, Bouchard said. Deputies took the gun and placed the suspect in custody.\"I believe they literally saved lives, having taken down the suspect with a loaded firearm still in the building,\" the sheriff said. 'We believe we have some writings that contain his thoughts'As for the investigation into a motive: \"We believe we have some writings that contain some of his thoughts,\" Bouchard said, adding he didn't immediately know whether the writings reveal intent.A beloved football player and a senior with college scholarships among Michigan school shooting victimsInvestigators executed a search warrant at the suspect's home and have searched the school, he said. Authorities seized a phone and are examining other seized items.Michigan law prevents police from talking to a juvenile without parental permission, and the parents have refused that permission and requested a lawyer, Bouchard said.\"So, we can't get the motive from the suspect that we have in custody, but we think we've got a path to get a lot of supportive information as to how and why this occurred. We've recovered some evidence that we're now beginning to pore over,\" Bouchard said.Authorities also are investigating pictures of a target and the weapon posted on social media by the suspect, he added.'I'm going to text my family, say I love them'As hundreds of law enforcement officers swarmed the campus Tuesday, students and teachers relied on tactics they'd learned in active shooter drills to protect themselves. \"This district has been very good in training their personnel and their students on active shooters,\" Undersheriff Michael McCabe said.Kluska's teacher, Moises Cortez, jumped into action after a lockdown was announced over the school's loudspeakers, said the student who recorded video of his classmates escaping through a window.\"He shut the door and put, like, a metal doorstopper so no one would be able to kick in the door.\" Kluska told CNN. \"After he turned off the lights, he told us to get to the corner because this might not be a drill and he wants to be safe.\"JUST WATCHEDWatch moment students sheltered in class during shootingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch moment students sheltered in class during shooting 00:55People were injured as they rushed out of the school, Bouchard said. Most were treated and released at a nearby staging area.Zander Cumbey, a junior at the high school, told CNN's Victor Blackwell that he started hearing screams about a minute after he sat down in his classroom. \"I heard screams come from the hallway and then the first gunshot happened, and my teacher, he walked into the classroom, he locked the door and he told us to call 911,\" Zander said. \"And then we heard the rest of the gunshots go off, more screams.\"He said as he was on the phone with dispatchers, he didn't really speak to them. \"I just said kind of said 'Oxford High School, shooter', because I couldn't talk,\" Zander said. He  texted his parents that he loved them, he said, and texted his younger brother who also attends the school to see whether he was safe. Zander told CNN one of the victims -- Tate Myre -- was a close friend who was on the football team with him. Donna Sanders' youngest grandchild was changing classes when he heard gunshots, she told CNN. He and others ran through an exit door and went to a nearby grocery store to escape, he told her.\"He was able to run to safety with others while his brother was trapped inside,\" Sanders said.JUST WATCHEDStudents' quick act once shooting started may have saved their livesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStudents' quick act once shooting started may have saved their lives 01:46Sanders' daughter, Vontysha Pittman, said her oldest son sought safety in a classroom with a teacher and other students.

We need prayers and not just for us but all the families at Oxford,\" Sanders said.Page's classroom was in lockdown for an hour, the senior told CNN. The entire experience as \"insane\" as he contemplated whether he would live through the ordeal.\"The very first thing in my head was, 'Is this actually happening?

        "content": "Kingman, Arizona (CNN)A Christmas tree full of ornaments inside Lt. Brian Zach's office tells you Christmas is his favorite time of year. But the police officer knows presents aren't always perfectly wrapped under the tree.   Zach, 40, met one of life's greatest gifts during a welfare check four years ago in Kingman, Arizona. Brian Zach was responding to a police call when he first saw the girl who'd become his daughter.The town is known as being the \"heart\" of historic Route 66 and most police calls concern theft or drugs or domestic violence. This time Zach was being asked to help on a case of child abuse. Waiting for him was a two-year-old girl named Kaila.  Read More\"My heart felt for this little girl who was covered in bruises. She just had a very strong spirit,\" Zach told CNN. \"She had a skull fracture, brain bleed and a dislocated elbow.\"  Kaila was taken from an abusive situation when she was just two years old.It wasn't the first time Zach had seen a child in need during his work. \"I had a 13-month-old die. That was hard. It is something that is emotionally scarring that I relive every time I talk about it,\" Zach said. \"Look, Kaila  could be that little girl but God had a different plan.\" He made friends with Kaila as they first waited for social workers. And his kindness was remembered when authorities started looking for a foster family.\"The question that changed our life forever was, 'Would you actually consider being a placement home?' And we immediately said, 'Yes.'\" Zach said.Kaila was embraced by the whole Zach family, and now has a big brother and a big sister.Kaila was only supposed to be with Zach and his wife and their two older children, Raina and Trevin, for a short time.  \"They said it would only be a couple weeks to a month until they could find a placement home for her. We played it week by week, month by month, court date by court date not knowing how long we would really have,\" Zach said. Police officer adopts homeless mother's opioid-addicted newborn While waiting, Zach often thought about where Kaila would live long-term. \"If I stopped and thought about it, it would make me sick to my stomach not knowing what this girl's future would be if she left,\" he said, swallowing tears. \"Having seen what happens when children are in the system ... it made me worry a lot more.\"The family started creating memories with Kaila, including trips to Disneyland and Hawaii. Now, four years later, Zach and his wife are her adoptive parents.  Kingman, Arizona, is known as the heart of the historic Route 66.Detective Heath Mosby attended the same high school as Zach and they became closer friends on the force.\"We started out rookies together,\" he said. And though they knew each other well, Mosby had no idea what was coming for Zach. \"I was awestruck! I never heard of any of our officers doing that,\" he said. \"When it came down to adoption, it was like 'Wow!' ... Especially after the journey she went through. Brian Zach and Kaila share a father-daughter moment.Zach is of great value to the Kingman community, Mosby said. He's following in the footsteps of his forebears and mentors -- his father was a state trooper and his grandfather was one of the first motorcycle officers for the same agency where Zach is now a lieutenant. Their badges are displayed on a shelf in Zach's office. \"It is very much in my blood. I feel very fortunate to have the career I've had and help the people that I've helped. You get to see the difference you make, you get to know the people you help and there are very, very kind people here,\" Zach said. Kaila is thriving in her new family.And for those who are on the fence about fostering or adopting, Zach says it's one of the best decisions he and his family have made. \"Just do it. The process isn't as harsh or overburdened as we thought,\"  Zach said.",

        "content": "(CNN)She was a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show -- an Ivy League-educated OB-GYN who often spoke about women's health and holistic medicine. She was a media darling, and in 2013 made Reader's Digest's annual list of 100 most trusted people in America. If you go to Dr. Christiane Northrup's Facebook page, her posts dispensing advice on health and aging to her 558,000 followers seem consistent with that persona of several years ago.But Northrup also uses her Facebook page to direct followers to Telegram, where another side of her is apparent. Here, on this platform with lax moderation, lies a miasma of misinformation and conspiracy theories.  \"Best Explanation I've Seen About Why the Covid Jabs Are Killer Shots,\" reads one post that she shared.  Dr. Christiane Northrup speaks at a New York City event.\"Me realising I don't have to take revenge on my enemies as they've all had the jab,\" says a meme she posted in late August that shows a sly-faced Morticia from the Addams Family. Read More\"Another hero emerges,\" Northrup writes of a doctor who refused to see vaccinated patients.  Northrup is among a small group of doctors who have emerged as a huge source of misinformation -- whether as social-media influencers or family doctors meeting with patients in person -- about Covid-19 vaccines, which have thus far proven the most effective weapon against the deadliest pandemic in 100 years. The physicians are fueling the fire at a time when Covid-19 deaths in the United States have surpassed 724,000, and as the casualties increasingly come from the ranks of the unvaccinated.  For the most part, they do so with impunity.  In late July, the board of directors at the Federation of State Medical Boards released a statement notifying physicians that promoting dangerous falsehoods about the Covid-19 vaccines could put their medical licenses at risk. But while several state medical boards told CNN that complaints about misinformation are piling up, only a handful of low-profile doctors have been formally punished to date. And the high-profile doctors spreading misinformation to millions of followers have faced no such regulatory scrutiny.  \"These doctors are taking advantage of the trust in them,\" said David Lazer, a political science and computer sciences professor at Northeastern University. He cites a monthly survey by the Covid States Project showing how, when it comes to trusted professions and groups, doctors rank at the very top for Democrats and Republicans alike. \"They are using the prestige of that term 'doctor' to convey misinformation,\" said Lazer, who co-leads the Covid States Project.   'The best thing that could happen is you get Covid' Dr. Rashid Buttar often appears on his promotional materials donning scrubs or a white coat. The bio in his 2010 book, \"The 9 Steps to Keep the Doctor Away\" -- which landed on USA Today's best-seller list -- is a three-page compendium of credentials: double major in biology and theology from the prestigious Washington University in St. Louis; doctor-of-osteopathic-medicine degree at the University of Osteopathic Medicine and Health Sciences, College of Medicine and Surgery in Iowa; visiting scientist and nutritional scientist at North Carolina State University. His website adds another: \"MOST CENSORED Doctor.\" Buttar has shared all manner of outrageous claims and misleading statements about the pandemic: Most people who took the vaccine will be dead by 2025. It's all part of a \"depopulation plan.\" Covid-19, he wrote on Twitter -- where he has 88,000 followers -- was a \"planned operation.\" In a recent interview with CNN's Drew Griffin, Buttar stood by it all. \"I've told people the best thing that could happen is you get Covid,\" he said. \"The best thing that can happen is get Covid?\" Griffin asked. \"Of course,\" Buttar replied. \"You're going to build your own innate immune system and then you don't have to worry about it anymore.\"  He later said, falsely: \"More people are dying from the Covid vaccine than from Covid.\" Northrup and Buttar are sowing doubt about the Covid-19 vaccines at a time when roughly a third of eligible Americans -- a large share of whom are Trump Republicans -- are not yet fully vaccinated.   CNN recently interviewed Dr. Rashid Buttar.Other high-profile doctors in this milieu include Dr. Joseph Mercola, an osteopathic physician who has turned his supplement business into a booming enterprise and has been warned by the FDA for selling phony Covid cures; Dr. Simone Gold, a former emergency room physician who has referred to the Covid vaccines as an \"experimental biological agent whose harms are well-documented\" and faces charges for entering the US Capitol during the riot on January 6 (she's pleaded not guilty); and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who gained infamy this summer when she testified to Ohio state legislators that the Covid-19 vaccines cause magnetism, meaning metal objects such as keys and silverware would stick to people's foreheads.    CNN approached Mercola and Gold for recent stories about the doctors who spread Covid-19 misinformation; both refused to comment, though Mercola later sent a statement. \"I report the truth as I read and reference peer reviewed literature and reports and encourage individuals educate themselves from a variety of sources and to protect freedom of speech,\" he said in the August statement.  Mercola has also told The New York Times that he believes he is being targeted for political reasons.Tenpenny stood by her testimony in an interview with The Washington Post and added, \"People should have a choice on what gets injected to their bodies because once you have injected it you can't uninject it.\" Northrup has said in a Facebook video that she is \"doing God's work on the earth plane at this now particular moment, facing down evil. What's in it for us? Our souls. That's what's in it for us.\" JUST WATCHEDCNN tracked down a super-spreader of Covid-19 misinformation.

The report, called the \"Disinformation Dozen,\" prompted President Joe Biden to chastise the social-media influencers for putting out information that is \"killing people.\"   Buttar, who has made light of his inclusion on the \"disinformation dozen,\" suggests the vaccine is part of a plot by elites to commit mass genocide.   He likens Dr. Anthony Fauci -- presidential adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- to Adolf Hitler, saying the number of deaths caused by Fauci will exceed those of the Holocaust.  \"Dr. Fauci is not an innocent bystander,\" Buttar told CNN in an interview filled with vague insinuations that the pandemic was somehow planned or enabled by shadowy elites. \"He's very well aware of what he's doing.\" To date, there have been just three confirmed cases of deaths caused by a Covid-19 vaccine -- each died of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after taking the vaccine by Johnson & Johnson, said Martha Sharan, a spokesperson with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, some 8,600 deaths have been reported to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, often referred to as VAERS. None of those deaths has been confirmed (outside the three), and all need to be fully reviewed and verified, Sharan said. Even if all were confirmed as being tied to a Covid-19 vaccine, it would be out of 390 million doses administered. That amounts to .0021 percent, or about 2 deaths for every 100,000 doses. (The mortality from Covid-19 in the United States currently stands at about 220 deaths for every 100,000 people, according to a tracker by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.) JUST WATCHEDTapper and Gupta react to doctor's unhinged vaccine claimReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTapper and Gupta react to doctor's unhinged vaccine claim 02:43Buttar, 55, has long been popular among anti-vaxxers and parents of children with autism. He has reportedly drawn patients from most US states and more than 40 countries. (Buttar puts the country count at 94.) In an especially high-profile case in 2009, then-celebrity couple Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey -- both noted vaccine skeptics -- referred a woman who said that she'd been sickened by a flu vaccine to Buttar for his unorthodox treatments, according to the 2013 book, \"Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine,\" by vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit. Buttar is a believer that environmental toxins such as mercury and lead are at the root of many chronic maladies, from autism to heart disease to cancer. He has treated patients -- hundreds of them children with autism -- with a patented cream that he claims removes poisonous metals from the body, according to Offit's book.  Buttar has twice been reprimanded by the North Carolina Medical Board, in 2010 and 2019. The first ding from the board stemmed from Buttar's treatment of several cancer patients with substances like hydrogen peroxide, ozone or glutathione, and his treatment of a child with autism using a skin application as part of a metal-extraction procedure known as chelation therapy. One researcher has referred to these kinds of applications for autism as a \"modern-day scam.\" The North Carolina board said, \"Dr. Buttar's treatment modalities have not been proven effective by randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\" The second reprimand pertained to an accusation from another physician that Buttar's treatment of a patient was adding to their \"pain and suffering\"; the board concluded that Buttar's documentation for treating the patient failed to conform to industry standards.  \"He deals in the industry of false hope, capitalizing on the fear we all have that our environment is a toxic hell,\" Offit told CNN. \"He is the lowest level of charlatan, taking advantage of parents who are desperate.\" Buttar scoffed at this claim.  \"That's just an absurd statement,\" he told CNN. \"People go where they're going to get results.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nImran Ahmed, founder and CEO of CCDH, said while he was pleased to see some social media accounts of the \"disinformation dozen\" get banished, too many of them -- such as Buttar -- are still allowed to spread pseudoscience and conspiracy content on mainstream platforms like Twitter.  \"What you've got to do is reduce the transmission rate of misinformation,\" Ahmed told CNN. \"And the way you do that is stop giving them the world's biggest megaphone in the history of communications -- social media -- where they can transmit to billions of people for zero cost.\" CCDH said the dozen were responsible for 65% of all anti-vaccine content on Facebook or Twitter. Facebook countered that the dozen were responsible for only a small fraction of a percent of its vaccine-related content. In any case, mainstream social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have made efforts to crack down on Covid-19 misinformation. Facebook, for example, said in August it took down more than three dozen pages, groups and Facebook or Instagram accounts associated with the so-called disinformation dozen.  In the wake of the spring release of CCDH's report, Buttar was booted from Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. In March, just before its release, he boasted a combined following of more than 1.2 million people, according to CCDH. He now just has the Twitter account with about 88,000 followers. After CNN flagged some tweets from Dr. Rashid Buttar that contained coronavirus misinformation, Twitter required Buttar to delete those tweets in order to regain access to his account, the company said on Monday. Buttar's account remains active.A company spokesperson said Twitter is focused on improving the enforcement of its Covid-19 misinformation policy and has suspended about 2,000 accounts for violations. The company permanently suspended three members of the disinformation dozen for spreading Covid-19 misinformation, the spokesperson said, although only one -- Tenpenny -- is a medical doctor.Still, false claims continue to flourish on the platforms. And when users stumble across the page of a misinformationist, algorithms on Twitter and Instagram continue to serve up others. The resulting repetition has a way of hardening people in their positions, said Joan Donovan, research director of Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. \"It's not the case that you take action on some single piece of information that has floated by your screen at any point,\" Donovan said. \"There's something about the rabbit hole ... that is very persuasive.\" A Montana doctor claims Covid threat 'exaggerated' But while celebrity doctors are broadcasting bunk vaccine information to mass audiences on social media, other physicians are spreading misinformation at the local level the old-fashioned way: face-to-face. Across the country, complaints to state medical boards about doctors misinforming patients about Covid-19 are on the rise, said Dr. Humayun Chaudhry, president of the Federation of State Medical Boards. He told CNN that at least a dozen directors of state medical boards have told him that they're receiving \"a lot\" of complaints about physicians sharing coronavirus misinformation. But few have led to disciplinary action, he acknowledged. \"The system has been set up as a complaint-based system,\" Chaudhry said. \"These state boards simply do not have the resources ... to monitor what's happening on the internet or what's going on even in an individual patient encounter.\" A case in point is Dr. Annie Bukacek, a Montana fixture who believes the response to the pandemic has been an orchestrated attempt by elites to control the masses.  Bukacek, 63, is not only a practicing physician; she also occupies a seat on the Flathead City-County Health Board, which is the local authority on how to manage public health outbreaks like Covid-19. Dr. Annie Bukacek is seen in a photo taken from her Facebook page. \"Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be threatened to take it -- for a disease so deadly you have to be tested to know you have it!!\" said a message she posted last month on Facebook. A folksy physician with a down-to-earth delivery, Bukacek, who often goes by \"Dr. Annie,\" lives and works in Flathead County, a deeply conservative county of about 104,000 people where just over a third of the residents are fully vaccinated. The death toll in Montana recently surpassed 2,000, and Montana is among just a handful of states where Covid-19 case counts were on the rise earlier this month. \"So you can have a vaccinated man, sleep with an unvaccinated woman..and she will become INFERTILE,\" said a February post by Bukacek on Facebook, which flagged the claim as false.   \"If Covid is so dangerous, we'd be seeing people die left and right,\" Bukacek said at a school board meeting that same month. \"It's widely accepted Covid-19 danger was exaggerated,\" she told a sympathetic local audience in March. CNN caught up with Bukacek in late September at a weekly \"Freedom Rally\" held every Friday night by anti-vaxxers and anti-maskers in the town of Kalispell, where she runs a Christian provider named Hosanna Healthcare.  Standing with others on a sidewalk near a park beside the courthouse and holding up a placard that read \"The only thing mutating is the Covid lie,\" Bukacek was among dozens who lined up alongside a thoroughfare to chant slogans and shout or wave at passing motorists.  A large pickup truck thundered up and down the block, its Trump and American flags flapping in the wind.  When CNN approached Bukacek and asked why she -- a doctor -- was anti-vaccine, she bristled. \"I'm not anti-vaccine,\" Bukacek said. \"Nice talking to you.\" Asked if she felt any responsibility towards the more than 2,000 Montanans who have died of Covid-19, she turned to her friends and asked, \"Could you take a photo of these CNN guys?\" Dr. Annie Bukacek attends a \"Freedom Rally\" in Kalispell, Montana.Several Montana doctors reached by CNN declined to discuss Bukacek, in part because they feared the blowback from her followers. But Dr. Peter Heyboer, a primary care physician -- and a fellow member of the health board -- said she has intentionally undermined the work of the board on which she serves. \"Physicians who use their authority in their position as a trusted adviser to spread misinformation ... they share part of the responsibility for the level of illness and death we are experiencing,\" he told CNN.  Dr. Cory Short, a hospitalist at Logan Health in Kalispell -- Bukacek's hometown -- said he has seen the ravages of Covid-19 firsthand. He said by the time Covid-19 patients get to his hospital, they've often \"reached that point where they are having a very difficult time breathing,\" he told CNN. \"When they come in, they're scared.\" In December, about 50 Montana residents signed on to a complaint submitted to Montana's medical compliance unit against Bukacek. \"She states that Covid-19 death certificates are manipulated, she discredits PCR testing, and by the nature of her medical profession and health board status is leading na\u00efve members of the community in promoting and participating in anti-masking propaganda that is endangering our citizens,\" states the complaint, which CNN has obtained. Ten months after the letter was received by the compliance unit, the state medical board's website shows no disciplinary action has been taken against Bukacek, who is popular locally. She was appointed to her public post by Flathead's county commission, and a petition to kick her off the board was met with an even larger petition to keep her on.  A spokesperson for Montana's Department of Labor and Industry told CNN that no cause has been found on any complaint filed against Bukacek. Across the country, there are exceptions to the rule of impunity. CNN contacted medical boards in all 50 states; half of them responded. Only two -- Rhode Island and Oregon -- said they had disciplined doctors for coronavirus misinformation or related violations.  In Rhode Island, Dr. Mark Brody, who describes himself as an \"Integrated Medicine\" physician specializing in adult and child psychiatry, sent a letter advising patients \"not to accept the coronavirus vaccine\" and warned of \"the possibility of sterilizing all females in the population who receive the vaccination,\" according to a consent order. (Studies have found no link between the vaccines and fertility problems.) Brody, whose practice incorporates homeopathy, agreed to pay $1,100 and pass a medical ethics course, but in July his license was suspended for five years for violating rules related to patient care and medical records. Brody did not respond to CNN's requests by email and phone for comment. In Oregon, Dr. Steven LaTulippe had his license suspended in December for counseling patients that masks are ineffective for reducing the spread of coronavirus and that Covid-19 is less dangerous than influenza, according to medical board documents. His license was revoked in September. The board stated that LaTulippe refused to abide by Covid-19 protocols and was negligent in other aspects of medical practice.An attorney for LaTulippe, Kristina Heuser, said in an email to CNN that her client \"had an unblemished record until he dared to express a professional opinion that differs from that of the medical establishment\" and that he is challenging the medical board's decision in court. 'I will not take the vaccination' For the high-profile Northrup, the threat of a lost license carries no weight -- she voluntarily withdrew hers in 2015 without explanation, a representative of the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine told CNN in an email.  But she and other celebrity doctors have a brand that flourishes independent of licensure. Credentials are a big part of that brand, though, and Northrup often touts her degree from Dartmouth College as well as her OB-GYN bona fides. For many years, those sterling credentials were bolstered by mainstream appeal.  While it's true Northrup -- who did not respond to CNN's multiple calls and emails seeking comment -- occasionally came under scrutiny in the media in the years before the pandemic, in general she was a media darling whose best-selling books on women's health led to flattering portrayals in outlets such as NBC News, Today, Vogue and, yes, CNN.   What will happen when Texas' ban on Covid-19 vaccine mandates conflicts with the federal vaccine requirement\"Having recently spent (20? 50? 80?) hours with it, I've come to believe that 'The Wisdom of Menopause' is a masterwork,\" raved a contributor for The Atlantic about Northrup's book in 2011. In 2018, Northrup -- a former abortion provider -- went on a women's health and wellness podcast and spoke not only about the importance of keeping abortion legal, but also about how the patriarchy for centuries has been mining \"women's ovaries for the benefit of the patriarchal system.\" In the talk with podcaster Sara Avant Stover, Northrup sympathized with \"our Black and brown sisters\" who have complained that White women have aligned themselves with \"White male power structures.\" As recently as August 2020, Northrup was featured on the podcast of The Oprah Winfrey Show, which serves up interviews from the archives. The episode appears to have since been removed. Fast forward to this summer.  \"I just saved a bunch of money on my taxes -- by switching my citizenship status to illegal immigrant,\" reads a meme she posted on Telegram in August. \"AND it comes with free health insurance!\" In late July, Northrup emceed for a traveling show geared toward Trump Republicans called \"Arise USA: The Resurrection Tour,\" organized by Robert David Steele, a former CIA spy turned conspiracy theorist who blamed \"elite Zionist Jews\" for the Holocaust and was an early promoter of the QAnon conspiracy that Trump has been secretly fighting a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles. At the event in her home state of Maine, Northrup made a quip when introducing Kevin Jenkins, a Black anti-vaccine activist who tries to dissuade the Black community, which has also shown to be vaccine-hesitant, from getting the shots.   \"Kevin and I know each other from the disinformation dozen, which Joe Biden personally has said is responsible for the deaths of so many,\" she said, to a rousing applause.  That night she also introduced Steele, who has claimed to be the first person to call Covid-19 a hoax. Donning a cowboy hat, Steele, who had given shout-outs to Mercola and Northrup on Twitter, hugged Northrup and put a red ball cap on her head as she exited the stage.   \"The big three problems that I've been talking about are election fraud, Wall Street treason and crime and then Satanic pedophilia,\" he told the crowd of about 150 people in the city of Belfast. About a month later, Steele, 69, died of Covid-19.  \"I will not take the vaccination,\" he wrote in his final blog post. His death did nothing to interrupt the steady stream of Covid-19 misinformation on Northrup's Telegram account. On September 1, just days after Steele's death was publicly confirmed, Northrup posted a 10-minute audio recording of herself advising her Telegram followers on how to \"peacefully\" resist masking and vaccination mandates.  In it, she made the baseless claim that people who are getting booster shots are experiencing troubling neurological symptoms.  \"People are getting disoriented -- kind of starting to lose it cognitively,\" she said.  Northrup went on to tell a story of an unvaccinated couple who were asked in a public setting whether they had gotten the shots.  \"Her husband goes, 'oh, of course -- yes. We've had both of them,'\" Northrup said. \"That's peaceful non-compliance.\" Correction: This story has been updated to note that Dr. Mercola previously responded to CNN's request for comment.CNN's Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Audrey Ash and Benjamin Naughton contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)It was a blockbuster story. A respected Chinese virologist appeared on Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News in mid-September to share the results of her just-completed report. The conclusion: The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 was likely engineered in a Chinese lab. On Carlson's show, she claimed it was intentionally released into the world. Then, its validity began to unravel. The publication of the paper by lead author Li-Meng Yan -- an expatriate from China seeking asylum in the US -- was quickly linked to former White House adviser Steve Bannon, long a strident critic of China's government. The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security -- a leading authority on the pandemic --\u202fcriticized the science behind the report, and pointed out that Yan and her co-authors \"cite multiple papers in their reference section that have weaknesses or flaws.\" A CNN review of Yan's research found it was also built on what appears to be the same theories, similar passages and identical charts presented by an anonymous blogger whose writings were posted on a website linked to Bannon months earlier. Additionally, a source told CNN the three co-authors of Yan's paper used pseudonyms instead of their real names, a practice frowned upon in scientific and academic work.Yet, even after Facebook slapped a \"false information\" flag on Carlson's September 15 interview with Yan and Twitter suspended Yan's account, Carlson, Bannon and Yan have pressed forward. \"You'd think that our media would want to get to the bottom of this pandemic,\" Carlson said on his October 6 show, \"but instead they ignored her claims.\" Read MoreYan -- who is back on Twitter -- published a second report on October 8 titled \"SARS-CoV-2 is an Unrestricted Bioweapon,\" which doubled down on the theory that the virus sweeping the globe was manmade and added that its \"unleashing\" was intentional. That study also included material seemingly copied from the anonymous blogger. Both of Yan's controversial papers link to Bannon. Prominently featured on both -- just beneath the title and authors, in a manner that resembles how university affiliations and funding sources are often listed -- are the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation. The twin non-profit ventures were announced in November 2018 by Bannon and billionaire Guo Wengui, aka Miles Guo, a Chinese exile and fierce critic of the current regime in China. Bannon was arrested on Guo's yacht this summer for the unrelated allegation that he defrauded donors who contributed to his crowdfunding campaign to support President Donald Trump's border wall.Steve Bannon's arrest is the perfect symbol of the Trump eraThe two men have repeatedly advanced the theory that the coronavirus came out of a Chinese bioweapons program -- a claim that has been widely panned as groundless -- using as their primary platforms a podcast hosted by Bannon and a website called G News, which publishes their content.  Their names are prominently displayed in the top banner of the site's home page.This month, while praising Yan's work on Bannon's podcast, Bannon and Guo went as far as to suggest that China deliberately infected President Trump with the coronavirus.  That podcast -- called \"War Room: Pandemic\" -- was recorded the day after Trump was hospitalized for Covid-19. Bannon credited Guo for saying from the beginning that the virus not only purposefully emerged from the labs, but that \"a target is Donald J. Trump.\"Bannon asked Guo: \"Do you believe that a super-spreader or somebody, was actually sent and somehow has been focused on the White House or focused on President --\" \"100 percent,\" Guo said. SATURDAY 10AM ET: Heroic #whistleblower virologist @DrLiMengYAN1 joins #SteveBannon for a very special #WarRoomPandemic'America Confronts #CCP Bioweapon Virus'Read Dr. #LiMengYan's \ud83d\udca3 report on the #CCPVirus \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/WxX2nmOpwKTUNE IN \ud83d\udc49https://t.co/AUokEMwJIL pic.twitter.com/ld0p2xF0xo\u2014 Steve Bannon's War Room (@WarRoomPandemic) October 9, 2020\n\nBannon himself appeared on Carlson's show on September 17 -- two days after Carlson's interview with Yan -- where he touted Yan's \"amazing paper\" and blasted social-media outlets for slowing its spread without revealing his own connection to the study. Carlson included a disclaimer in a later interview with Yan on October 6, saying, \"we are not endorsing your findings.\" But a Fox News spokesperson declined to address CNN's question of why Carlson hasn't disclosed Bannon's involvement with Yan's paper when discussing her research on several shows. Bannon did not respond to CNN's request for comment; Yan declined a request to be interviewed and did not answer repeated requests for responses to specific questions.Flawed citations, copied passages, mysterious co-authors It was precisely the megaphone provided by Carlson and Bannon online and on TV that prompted the researchers at Johns Hopkins to issue a rebuttal, according to two of the Johns Hopkins authors, who spoke with CNN.  \"It was clear on social media that the paper was getting more and more attention,\" said Nancy D. Connell, a microbial geneticist and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins. \"We talked carefully and thought for a long time whether to do it.\" \n\n\n\nView note\n\n\"On the one hand we don't want to give credence to just so much garbage,\" added Gigi Kwik Gronvall, an immunologist who is also a senior scholar at the institution. \"On the other hand, because it's getting taken seriously, it's important to point out that this is not science ... It's infuriating, because everybody has better things to do.\" The Johns Hopkins response to Yan's paper takes issue with the science, launching into a point-by-point rebuttal. It also includes a section pointing out \"weaknesses or flaws\" in the paper's citations.One footnote, for instance, leads to an essay by an entrepreneur that only appears on his LinkedIn page after it was rejected by a scientific journal. Billy Zhang, a sole-proprietor consultant in Massachusetts who works with investors and governments in China, told CNN he was surprised to learn that his critique was cited in Yan's report. LinkedIn initially removed his post, but later decided to reinstate it. Another footnote is attributed to an article authored by a writer and editor for an anti-genetically modified food website. Another still traces to an author CNN could not locate, who says he runs a company that appears not to exist. The paper of that author, Dean Bengston, links to a page listing him as the CEO of a Las Vegas company called Meandering Path. But a search of the business name on the Nevada Secretary of State website\u202f-- as well as registries for surrounding states and other business databases --\u202fturned up no matching results.Equally troubling for a scholarly paper was CNN's discovery that Yan's papers bear a strong resemblance to blogs first published on G News. Yan's papers contain paragraph after paragraph of identical theories and similar phrasing to the blogs, with some lines lifted nearly word for word. What's more, Yan's three co-authors in both papers -- Shu Kang, Jie Guan and Shanchang Hu -- are pseudonyms, a source told CNN. It's a practice that is highly unusual in such research and generally discouraged due to the resulting lack of accountability and transparency, experts told CNN. The source didn't know why the use of pseudonyms wasn't disclosed in the papers.  \"They are all Chinese but based here in the US,\" the source said. \"They did not want their real names out there for fear of their families back in China.\" Dr. Daniel Lucey, an infectious-disease epidemics expert at Georgetown University, said he can't think of another case of authors using pseudonyms in a scientific paper.\"If you used a fake name, then it would start calling into question, under normal circumstances -- if they weren't honest about their name, then what else are they not honest about?\" he said. But Lucey said the authors' concerns in this case might have merit.  \"I would also think that the four coauthors would be worried about themselves in terms of ever going back to the mainland or Hong Kong,\" he said. \"It's a real thing.\"As part of its review, CNN spoke with a half-dozen experts from multiple institutions, and all of them found Yan's methodology to be flawed. They described her report as \"junk science,\" \"leaps of logic\" and \"window dressing.\"  Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said she believes Yan's report set out to deceive for the purpose of spreading \"political propaganda.\" \"This paper is very deceptive to somebody without a scientific background, because it's written in very technical language, using a lot of jargon that makes it sound as though it is a legitimate scientific paper,\" she told CNN. \"But anybody with an actual background in virology or molecular biology who reads this paper will realize that much of it is actually nonsense.\" Last I checked, just accusing an entire global community of scientists who rely on evidence to assess data is not itself evidence of said worldwide conspiracy to deliberately cause a pandemic and cover it up. It does, however, fit neatly into a \"Blame China\" agenda.\u2014 Dr. Angela Rasmussen (@angie_rasmussen) October 8, 2020\n\nAnna Mapp, an associate dean and research professor at the University of Michigan, agreed. \"I was really disturbed to see such a shoddy piece of work that I would not accept if turned in to me by one of my own students receiving such attention and being treated as a valid scientific paper,\" she told CNN.  (It was Mapp's graduate student, Amanda Peiffer -- who's working toward a PhD in chemical biology -- who first alerted CNN to issues with the citations at the end of Yan's paper.)Lucey of Georgetown told CNN that he met with Yan in person to discuss her paper on September 6 -- eight days before it was published.  His criticism was more muted than that of the other scientists who spoke with CNN; Lucey said he found some of what Yan had to say noteworthy. Ultimately, though, he said he disagrees with Yan's conclusion and told her he couldn't vouch for her science because he's not a molecular virologist.  Former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (L) greets fugitive Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui before introducing him at a news conference on November 20, 2018 in New York.Lucey said at one point, after much back and forth, he asked Yan a big-picture question: Why would China release a government-engineered virus in Wuhan? Lucey said Yan couldn't provide an answer that he considered plausible.  Lucey said he believes the virus originated in nature. But he disagrees with the much-publicized theory that it jumped from an animal to a human at a seafood market in December. \"Based on what I know about how epidemics have started, I think that it was at least several months earlier,\" he said. \"It could have been out there for more than a year (before December). It's possible.\" To be sure, there is no scientific consensus on where the novel coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2 -- originated. Most of the scientific community -- including Anthony Fauci, the United States' top infectious disease expert -- believes it was not manmade. Other credible scientists \u202ffloated the possibility the virus may have leaked from a Wuhan lab, although some contend that an article in Nature Medicine has debunked the notion.\u202f Yan's first paper claims to refute that widely cited Nature Medicine article, published in mid-March, which concluded that SARS-CoV-2 most likely came from nature and not \"purposeful manipulation.\" Neither of Yan's papers are peer-reviewed, which by itself is not a disqualifier. Researchers often publish early drafts of their work on what are known as scientific preprint servers to quickly share findings that could benefit the public -- a practice that has accelerated in the urgent age of the coronavirus.\u202f Yan says she's in hidingMany experts who read Yan's research said they found it hard to reconcile the work with her seemingly impressive pedigree, which includes a stint at the University of Hong Kong's public health laboratory -- a World Health Organization collaborating facility. She has been published in Nature and The Lancet -- two prestigious academic journals -- and says she was among the first researchers in the world to become privy to the dangers of SARS-CoV-2.  \"Dr. Yan's history and training is excellent,\" Rasmussen said. \"I'd really like to hear from her why she decided to do this, because effectively, it has ruined her credibility as a virologist and it would be a career ending mistake to make.\" Yan says she fled to the United States in April, according to a Fox News story. In that July piece, she went public with an allegation: Yan claimed that the Chinese government and the WHO had kept mum about their knowledge of the person-to-person transmission of the virus for weeks, even after Yan herself had said she raised the issue with her superiors in late December or early January.  \"The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of COVID,\" Yan, saying she feared for her life, told the network from an undisclosed location in the US. \n\n\n\nView note\nThe Chinese government, WHO and the University of Hong Kong have vehemently denied her July accusation of a coverup. In her October 6 interview with Carlson, Yan said her mother was arrested by Chinese authorities for making allegations against China on her prior appearances on Fox News. The Chinese government didn't respond to a detailed list of questions from CNN about this and other allegations by Yan.  It's unclear where Yan is staying in the US -- and the extent to which she knows Bannon and Guo. But a photo that circulated on Twitter last month and was posted on G News appeared to capture the reflection of a smiling Yan in the mirror behind the two men in the foreground: Wang DingGang, board chair of the Rule of Law Society, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bannon's image can also be seen in the photo.This photo appears to capture the reflection of virologist Li-Meng Yan in the mirror behind the two men in the foreground: Wang DingGang, board chair of the Rule of Law Society, and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Bannon's image can also be seen in the photo.Although Bannon and Guo's Rule of Law Society and Rule of Law Foundation are listed under the titles of Yan's reports, neither paper mentions Bannon or Guo, or elaborates on the role the organizations have played in their creation.Guo responded to CNN's questions about the link with a statement that said Yan's publications were researched and written independently. \"I have repeatedly stated since as early as January of this year that the COVID-19 pandemic was created by the Chinese Communist Party with the worst of intentions. I stand by these statements,\" Guo said. \"I proudly support Dr. Yan in her efforts to stand up against the CCP mafia and tell the world the truth about COVID-19. Dr. Yan is a hero for her whistleblowing against the CCP and should be commended for her work and personal sacrifice.\"  Bannon has played up the nonprofits' early and persistent promotion of the lab-origin story.\u202f \"I want to thank Miles Guo because it was Miles Guo and the whistleblower movement, Miles Guo and the Rule of Law Society, the Rule of Law Foundation, that back in early January really got us to start to focus on this,\" Bannon said on his podcast on October 3. The two also discussed Yan in that episode, with Guo suggesting she could help prove that the virus was made in a lab. But they made no mention of their connection to her report.\u202fHow did coronavirus break out? Theories abound as researchers race to solve genetic detective storyYan herself has appeared several times on Bannon's podcast. In August, she said the communist regime does \"evil things\" and discussed its history of persecuting its own people.The Rule of Law Foundation and Rule of Law Society responded to questions from CNN with two identical statements, signed by their respective board chairs, Hao Haidong and Wang DingGang. Each statement expresses support for Dr. Yan \"and any other Chinese asylee who seeks to tell the world the truth about the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) corruption, atrocious human rights record, and its role in the spread of COVID-19. \"Dr. Yan has independently researched COVID-19 and we respect her findings and desire to speak the truth about COVID-19 to the public,\" the statement says.  \"Our support of Dr. Yan has never included influencing, altering, or editing her scientific research and findings.\" The statement said her reference to the organizations in the report \"was solely done as an appreciation of our support in helping her flee Hong Kong and avoid arrest for her COVID-19 whistleblowing.\" Rasmussen of Columbia University says the possibility of an accidental lab release or even of an engineered virus can't be ruled out, but said either scenario is extremely unlikely -- and Yan's reports provide no credible evidence.The \"extraordinary claim,\" she said, shouldn't be made without \"extraordinary evidence.\" \"As much as I hate to think of the idea of competent scientists using their work for political propaganda, to me, that's what this seems to be,\" she said. \"And certainly the affiliation with Steve Bannon and Miles Guo and the Society for the Rule of Law does nothing to dispel that suspicion.\"CNN's Yahya Abou-Ghazala and Benjamin Naughton contributed to this report.",

He's not going to help you now,\" one of the officers struggling to cuff him says. \"Just relax.\"\"Please help me,\" the man says, in between screams. \"Please.\"\"Relax!\" an officer says. \"Stop resisting.\"Read MoreThe man's shrieks and utterances become groans. His body goes limp, he falls silent, and vomits. Moments later in the bodycam footage, an officer can be heard saying, \"He's dead.\" Muhammad Muhaymin Jr. died in the custody of Phoenix police on January 4, 2017.The man at the bottom of the pile was Muhammad Muhaymin Jr. His death in police custody on January 4, 2017, has notable similarities with the case of George Floyd, who died on Memorial Day after Minneapolis police officers were atop him for nearly nine minutes \u2014 one with a knee on his neck. The incident \u2014 which has drawn some local but little national coverage \u2014 is getting a second look against the backdrop of Floyd's death, which galvanized a movement and has changed the tenor of the national conversation around race and policing.\"We have heard the mayor of Phoenix and the police chief of Phoenix police talk about what happened in Minneapolis, say that they are ashamed, condemn the people involved as if it were something separate from us,\" said Viri Hernandez, executive director of Poder in Action, a Phoenix advocacy group. \"They never acknowledge that what happened to George Floyd, their police officers did here, to Muhammad Muhaymin.\" Officers involved in the death are still on the force The incident in Phoenix began with a trip to a public restroom. When the 43-year-old Muhaymin \u2014 who struggled with mental illness and intermittent homelessness \u2014 tried to carry his emotional support dog, a Chihuahua named Chiquita, into the restroom of a community service center, the manager physically blocked him from entering the men's room and asked him to leave the dog outside. An argument ensued, and the manager instructed an employee to call 911.  This triggered a response by a handful of Phoenix police officers who in the bodycam footage initially appear to defuse the situation by allowing Muhaymin to use the men's room. But during their fateful six-minute wait for Muhaymin to exit, officers conducted a background search and discovered a warrant on his record for failure to appear in court over a charge stemming from misdemeanor possession of a marijuana pipe. (That confiscation was the result of a 2016 stop by a police officer for jaywalking in nearby Mesa, Arizona.)      When Muhaymin emerged from the restroom, the situation swiftly spiraled out of control. Officers tried to arrest him, and ultimately Muhaymin wound up facedown on the pavement just outside the facility with at least four officers on top of him struggling to put his hands in cuffs. Within eight minutes, Muhaymin was dead. His dog has not been seen since. The Muhaymin family is suing the city for $10 million in a wrongful death suit that names 10 Phoenix police officers as defendants and is expected to go to jury trial early next year. \"In general, sending out armed police officers with guns to deal with somebody who's having a mental breakdown \u2014 it's a recipe for disaster,\" said the family's attorney, David Chami.   Muhaymin's emotional support dog, a Chihuahua named ChiquitaAlthough the circumstances of the Floyd and Muhaymin cases share uncanny similarities, the impact they've had in terms of public awareness and consequences to the officers involved are a world apart. In the case of Floyd, all four officers involved were terminated and are now facing criminal charges. In the case of Muhaymin, none of the officers who responded to the call faced any discipline. All of them remain on the force; one is now a detective. The Phoenix Police Department \u2014 one of the largest in the United States without civilian oversight \u2014 conducted its own investigation and found the officers committed no wrongdoing, according to Chami. (In response to a public records request, the police department has declined to provide CNN with the results of its investigation. The department said none of the officers' actions on that day was found to be \"out of policy.\")\"The department is investigating itself here,\" Chami said. \"There's an incentive to find no wrongdoing.\"       The Maricopa County Attorney's Office reviewed the Phoenix Police Department's internal probe and determined that the officers \"did not commit any act that warrants criminal prosecution,\" according to a letter dated February 22, 2018, provided to CNN.  Why medical experts disagree on the cause of deathA Maricopa County medical examiner, Dr. Amanda Maskovyak, has labeled Muhaymin's death a homicide \u2014 a technical term meaning somebody died at the hands of another.  Maskovyak listed the primary cause of death to be cardiac arrest, aggravated by \"coronary artery disease, psychiatric disease, acute methamphetamine intoxication and physical exertion during law enforcement subdual.\" The family's expert witness, Dr. Bennet Omalu, disagrees. \"Asphyxiation due to compression of his trunk and body\" \u2014 not underlying conditions or drug use \u2014 was the cause of death, said Omalu, a forensic pathologist known for his research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) injuries in football players, and who was portrayed by Will Smith in the 2015 film \"Concussion.\"By the time Muhaymin vomited, his body had been compressed under the weight of the officers for eight minutes, Omalu wrote in a report for the family's attorney. This \"high-scale traumatic stressor\" caused Muhaymin to vomit, which entered and blocked his air passageways, cutting off oxygen to his brain and leading to \"sudden death,\" Omalu's report says.\n\n\n\nView note\nThe report, exclusively obtained by CNN, concludes: \"If Muhammad did not encounter the police on Jan. 4, 2017, he would not have died.\"A spokesperson with the Phoenix Police Department said they are constrained by litigation from commenting extensively about the Muhaymin case. \"The Phoenix Police Department is committed to the safety and security of each person in our community,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. \"It is our goal to be accountable and transparent with our community while providing information related to critical incidents.\"   Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego declined to comment for this story.     The city of Phoenix has been wrestling with accusations of police brutality for the past several years. In 2018, it led the nation in fatal officer-involved shootings, with 23 deaths, according to a report by the National Police Foundation. The City Council voted this past February to establish a police oversight agency, which will launch next year.  The raw, unedited footage obtained by CNN includes bodycam videos supplied to Muhaymin's family through litigation. It brings to light several revealing moments that are not included in bodycam footage already released by the city, including how the officers speak about Muhaymin and his dog while he is in the restroom, out of earshot.  The footage also shows that the officers suspected that Muhaymin had mental health issues. And the footage, unlike what has been released by the city, provides the clearest visual yet of an officer pinning Muhaymin against the pavement with a knee shortly before he dies.An image taken from an officer's bodycam video shows Muhaymin pressed to the pavement by the officers.In legal filings, the city says Muhaymin \"assaulted a government employee,\" even though the manager can be seen in the bodycam footage saying he wasn't assaulted. The court document also invokes qualified immunity, a controversial defense that grants special protection to officers accused of violating the Constitution. It argues that the dog was unleashed and \"out of control\" when Muhaymin was arrested, and that the force used against Muhaymin was \"both reasonable and necessary, given his behavior.\"The city in the document says Muhaymin \"tensed up, thrashed about, pushed and kicked at officers.\"Although Muhaymin appears in the videos to at times resist being cuffed \u2014 tensing up his arms or refusing to offer up his hands, for instance \u2014 none of the footage shows him kicking or punching any officers. Officers stated that Muhaymin \"did not attempt to kick, bite, slap or otherwise harm the officers but that he was 'passive aggressive' and resisting arrest,\" according to the medical examiner's report.      Nor do the recordings show officers kicking or punching Muhaymin, though at one point an officer's elbow strikes his shoulder. But the videos show several officers putting their weight on Muhaymin for several minutes at a time as he screams and groans.\"There's no reason why he should have lost his life at the hands of police in the way he did,\" said Carlos Garcia, a Phoenix city councilman. \"Screaming out for his dog, screaming out for help.\"What happened during Muhaymin's final hourYears ago, Muhaymin \u2014 the father of a grown son and teenaged daughter \u2014 had been a garbage-truck driver in Phoenix. In the early 1990s, he traveled as a backup dancer with his sister Tonya Davis, a rapper who performed under the name \"Overweight Pooch,\" the Arizona Republic reported.He was close with his namesake father, and when his father died in 2006, Muhaymin's mental health began to deteriorate \u2014 to the point where, shortly before his death, he fell into homelessness, another of his three sisters, Mussallina Muhaymin, told CNN.  Phoenix police shot and killed a man in a parked car, sparking renewed protestsMuhaymin died on a typical sunny winter morning in Maryvale, a neighborhood or \"urban village\" of Phoenix with a history of crime issues. A few years ago, the area drew some bizarre headlines for reports of roving packs of wild Chihuahuas, a claim that has been challenged by the local press.   Around 9:30 a.m. on January 4, 2017, Muhaymin walked into the Maryvale Community Center, where Phoenix residents come to play basketball, take classes or check out books from the nearby library, among other things. He was carrying his Chihuahua. Muhaymin \u2014 who suffered from schizophrenia and anxiety, according to mental health documents obtained by CNN \u2014 lived outside in a makeshift encampment with a handful of other homeless people near the center, Chami said. All of his sisters lived nearby.\n\n\n\nView note\nA security guard at a nearby hospital in Maryvale \u2014 which has since shuttered \u2014 told police Muhaymin had occasionally showed up to wash himself and his dog in the restroom, and had behaved erratically, such as by practicing martial arts in the lobby, sometimes with a long stick. Muhaymin \u2014 a 5-foot, 7-inch man who wore dreadlocks \u2014 was also familiar to employees at the community center, where he'd taken his dog before. This time, an employee dialed 911.\"He's been here many times before and refused to leave,\" the employee tells the dispatcher in the call. The employee describes Muhaymin as \"confrontational,\" adding that Muhaymin was \"shoving\" her supervisor \u2014 the manager \u2014 and \"yelling\" at him. Four officers \u2014 Oswald Grenier, Jason Hobel, Ronaldo Canilao and David Head \u2014 arrived to find Muhaymin and the manager by the door of the restroom, arguing animatedly about the unleashed dog in Muhaymin's arms. The bodycam footage shows Hobel interrupting the argument to ask the manager if he'd been assaulted by Muhaymin. Muhaymin looks taken aback. \"Who said anything about assault?\" he asks. \"I'm asking the question,\" Hobel answers, raising his voice. \"You're ranting and raving getting nowhere, and I'm asking a question: Did he assault you, sir?\"In a key moment, the manager answers: \"No. He was trying to get in and I didn't let him in. So, we bumped into each other.\" (The manager later told officers that Muhaymin pushed him, and that he returned the shove, according to police reports.)An officer says he and his colleagues were responding to a reported assault, and that after Muhaymin used the restroom, they would leave. But that didn't happen. In the footage, when Muhaymin is in the restroom, Grenier tells other officers that he'd \"dealt with\" Muhaymin before. He adds: \"The dog is not a service dog.\" (CNN has obtained documentation from Muhaymin's case manager that references his dog for \"emotional support.\")\n\n\n\nView note\nGrenier runs the background check and discovers the warrant out of Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix. An officer asks the others what to do with the \"rat dog.\"  Another responds, \"Throw him in the back of my car and we'll drive him down to the shelter. In an indication that they think Muhaymin is troubled, Hobel, who previously had responded to calls involving him, remarks that \"he is a little 918\" \u2014 police code for mentally ill.  Why Muhaymin wouldn't let go of his dogMuhaymin eventually emerges from the bathroom and walks past the officers and through the lobby. They follow. One of them makes small talk, asking about the name of his dog. But when Muhaymin exits the building, the dynamic changes. Grenier orders Muhaymin to stop and informs him of the warrant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\"A warrant?\" Muhaymin asks, in apparent confusion. \"Hold on.\"The officers surround him and order him to let go of the dog.\"If that dog bites me, it's going to be a bad day,\" an officer warns. They push him up against the glass wall of the basketball court in attempt to grab his hands, which are tucked in front of his body while still holding the dog, according to the police incident report. The officers pry the dog loose from his hands; the Chihuahua lands on her feet and runs off. Muhaymin cries out. The dog barks. The officers try to wrestle Muhaymin to the ground.Bodycam footage shows an officer holding Muhaymin down with a knee to the head as the dog watches. For a moment, as officers walk a handcuffed Muhaymin to a police cruiser, it seems as though the worst is over. \"That's my child, officer,\" Muhaymin pleads, referring to his dog running loose. How a disastrous sequence of events played out   But as they proceed to the police vehicle, Hobel says he thinks Muhaymin could have a knife and so instead of putting him inside, they decide to search him against the vehicle's hood, according to the police incident report. A disastrous sequence of events follows. In a move that Chami believes caused serious injury, Muhaymin's cuffed hands are raised over his head from behind his back. Muhaymin screams.      \"Unless you're a contortionist, you're not going to be able to do that,\" Chami said.Muhaymin cries out: \"I cannot believe this.\"An officer says, \"fking relax, dumbass.\" The officers wrestle Muhaymin to the pavement on his side. The dog barks. Again, an officer pins Muhaymin's head to the pavement with a knee, while three others apply weight on Muhaymin's waist and shoulders. Muhaymin can be heard yelling, \"I can't breathe\" at least four times. He screams. Additional officers arrive. The officers uncuff him. An officer places a restraint around Muhaymin's feet, according to police reports. The officers put the handcuffs back on and connect the cuffs to the ankle restraint with a strap, according to the medical examiner.Tim Scott says he's moved back to the 'drawing board' on police reform Muhaymin vomits and goes limp. The officers move Muhaymin away from the vomit, remove the rope and restraints, call for medics and \u2014 when they see he is not breathing \u2014 administer chest compressions, according to the medical examiner.  Omalu's report says Muhaymin stopped breathing and \"no pulse was detected\" at 10:04 a.m. \"There were at least six officers who were on top of Muhammad or pressed (Muhammad) prone on the sidewalk,\" Omalu's report says. Muhaymin was transported by ambulance to nearby Maryvale Hospital, which has since closed and reopened under new ownership. There, at 10:39 a.m. \u2014 a little more than an hour after he'd walked into the community center to use the restroom \u2014 he was pronounced dead.Police summoned animal control. An officer from the pound arrived and took the dog. But instead of impounding her, the officer gave the Chihuahua to a man at the scene who called himself a friend of Muhaymin's, according to a police report. Chami said a witness told him the man is homeless. In any case, Chami said, the family hasn't seen the dog since the incident.  Police say Muhaymin committed 'assault'Even though police and witnesses later said Muhaymin did not become physically violent during the encounter, the authorities initially told local media outlets that Muhaymin had committed \"assault\" against an officer and an employee.\"When did they ever retract those statements?\" Chami said, referring to the police. \"They never did.\"Chami said he would like to see the criminal investigation reopened, as was done recently in Colorado, where the governor in late June ordered a new examination into the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died from a heart attack shortly after police put him in a chokehold.An attorney representing the officers in Muhaymin's case declined to comment.Mussallina Muhaymin, Muhammad's sister, said the police department never apologized to her family. She added that the police sent flowers to his funeral \u2014 a gesture that struck lher as hollow.\"In taking his life, flowers actually, absolutely serve no purpose, other than add salt to the wound,\" she said. \"Simply because, you know, I would prefer that my brother were standing there, and I was able to hug him and have a conversation with him.\"Mussallina lamented the current lack of independent police oversight in Phoenix. \"The police was judge, jury and executioner,\" she said. \"And just because he wanted to use a public bathroom.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Public health experts, including members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, have argued accurate Covid-19 antibody tests can support efforts to get Americans back to work by determining who may have overcome the virus.But the rollout of millions of antibody tests in the US has created frustration and division among state health departments due to a mix of questionable tests, shifting federal rules and a hodgepodge of different methods for tracking results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched a strategy to use antibody tests for surveys that study the spread of the virus in different locations and populations, the federal government has not coordinated an effort to track the raw data of antibody tests performed in all states. Instead, the Trump administration has instructed states to develop their own testing plans, and now states are split on what to do with antibody tests.Trump administration rejects CDC guidance on reopening US amid coronavirusAntibody tests can be used to detect whether people have previously been exposed to coronavirus and developed antibodies against it, though it's still not clear whether the presence of antibodies means someone is immune to the virus. Read MoreThe current calculation of people who have been infected with coronavirus in the US -- 1.25 million, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally -- is almost certainly an undercount, said Dr. Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\"The problem is we don't know if that real number is 10 times more or 20 times more and by having widespread antibody testing that would give us a better idea,\" Hotez said. Yet out of 41 states that responded to an inquiry from CNN, only 22 states said they are currently tracking or collecting data on antibody testing in some way. Some of those states, including New York, Louisiana and California, now require labs to report results of antibody tests, while others have launched limited surveys to study antibody prevalence. Mirimus, Inc. lab scientists work to validate rapid IgM/IgG antibody tests of COVID-19 samples from recovered patients on April 10, 2020 in New York. Further complicating matters, some state health departments have expressed concerns about the reliability of available antibody tests, many of which initially came on the market without undergoing review by the Food and Drug Administration. Sorting through how to approach antibody testing is one of the latest hurdles for the US health system's coronavirus response, which initially lagged on testing to diagnose coronavirus cases, public health experts have argued, due to a series of policy and procedural decisions.  States concerned by accuracy of antibody testsAntibody test data \"are of dubious reliability; we are not tracking or analyzing them,\" a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority said.A working group in Vermont researching antibody tests for the state's health commissioner \"found the currently available tests are not accurate or reliable enough to make decisions or recommendations to change individual or population-level behaviors,\" according to a spokesperson for Vermont's health operations center.The search for a coronavirus vaccine continues as states keep reopening without meeting guidelinesAt the federal level, the CDC has begun using \"seroprevalence surveys\" to track the virus, which use blood-based testing to calculate the percentage of people who have antibodies to the virus at different points in time. Those surveys may perform testing on blood samples that were originally collected for other purposes, such as routine cholesterol tests. A CDC spokesperson said the agency does not have estimates on how many antibody tests have been done or information on all of the results of these tests. But the spokesperson also said the CDC is working with states that are doing antibody testing as well as some commercial companies to get test results. Dozens more children hospitalized in New York with rare symptoms that could be linked to coronavirusThe differing approaches to antibody testing, also known as serology tests, come on the heels of a policy issued by the Food and Drug Administration in March that allowed companies to sell the tests without providing evidence to show they worked. Researchers have argued that that policy, which sought to boost early access to the tests, enabled inaccurate antibody tests to enter the market.On Monday, the FDA shifted its policy to require that commercial antibody-test manufacturers submit requests for emergency-use authorization, or EUA, and validation data within 10 business days. Despite criticism of the agency's initial policy, an FDA spokesperson told CNN, \"Without the more flexible policy, we would not be as far along in our ability to use antibody tests. Now that FDA has authorized several tests and the National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with us and others, is performing evaluations of antibody tests, we can and have changed our policy to require all commercial manufacturer tests be authorized by FDA to remain or come on the US market.\"The FDA spokesperson added that the agency has ongoing conversations with states to provide technical assistance. Progress has been patchyAt least 12 serology tests have already received EUA, and major medical device companies have ramped up production. Abbott Laboratories, for example, told CNN it has shipped about 5 million antibody tests to customers across the US as of this week. Abbott says its antibody test is accurate and reliable. FDA Commissioner Hahn tweeted last month that serology tests can play a critical role in fighting the disease \"by helping health care professionals identify people who may have overcome #COVID19 & developed an immune response.\"How the 'hinge event' of Covid will change everythingStill, some state health officials say the current utility of the antibody tests is limited. Massachusetts State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine Brown told CNN her state's health department has begun receiving results from tests that detect antibodies, but she said the numbers are small and not geographically distributed enough to draw conclusions about infection prevalence. L.A. County Department of Public Health employees perform antibody testing.Aside from questions about accuracy of tests that have not received FDA authorization, she said the correlation between the presence of antibodies and an individual's immunity to the disease remains unclear. The World Health Organization has said, \"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\"Brown also said there's limited knowledge about the timing of development and duration of different types of antibodies relative to when someone was infected. \"For the moment, outside of using serologic testing to find out how many people in a community were exposed to the virus, it should be used sparingly and with a solid understanding of its limitations,\" Brown said. Experts warn against drawing conclusions from released dataSome states have publicly released data on antibody tests.Arizona's Department of Health Services, for example, reports that 14,652 serology tests have been completed, with a positive rate of 3.7%. Though the department also notes, \"it is difficult right now to draw conclusions\" from the data and warns \"an antibody test may be falsely positive for Covid-19 because the test may have detected the presence of antibodies to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.\"JUST WATCHEDScientists hopeful for monoclonal antibody treatmentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHScientists hopeful for monoclonal antibody treatment 02:26Other states, including Alabama, Idaho and Utah, told CNN they are receiving results or information from antibody tests but have not yet implemented processes to analyze the data.Kelly Wroblewski, the director of infectious diseases for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents state and local public health laboratories, told CNN she has heard from epidemiologists in states currently collecting such data from various labs who are at a loss with what do with the data due to the varying quality of different tests.

To bring more clarity to the situation, Wroblewski's organization APHL and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists released a guidance document on antibody testing Thursday. The document says scientists need more data on test performance and human-immune response to coronavirus for antibody test methods to be used effectively, but also says public health officials can use antibody tests to conduct surveys to estimate the prevalence of past infection. Another potential application listed is identifying people with antibodies to serve as plasma donors for coronavirus patients.

Gina Raimondo announced Wednesday that 5,000 residents in her state will be chosen at random to receive tests that can diagnose the virus as well as antibody tests for Covid-19 so the state can have a more accurate portrait of how many people have been exposed to the virus. New York City, in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services and CDC, will offer antibody tests for 140,000 healthcare workers and first responders starting next week, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.   Trump's 'Testing Blueprint' leaves states on their ownThe Trump administration's \"Testing Blueprint\" for reopening the nation highlighted the importance of antibody testing, especially within critical groups such as first responders and vulnerable populations. But the document called on states to develop their own individual testing plans. JUST WATCHEDThis is what an antibody test could mean for the pandemicReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThis is what an antibody test could mean for the pandemic 03:40Senate Democrats, in a letter to President Trump on Tuesday, criticized what they called \"the lack of detail and strategy\" in the blueprint. They called on the administration to develop specific plans to implement antibody testing programs.Heather Pierce, the senior director for science policy and regulatory counsel at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said she's not surprised states have developed different approaches to antibody testing. \"States have been told to make their own plans, and there are not strict guidelines on testing at all, let alone on serology tests,\" Pierce said.Pierce said that states should acknowledge the limitations of antibody tests but begin building databanks that track antibody test results and types of tests used, so that when more information becomes available about the relationship between coronavirus antibodies and immunity, states have that data ready.\"It's making sure that the states collect on the front end the information that will ultimately be useful,\" said Pierce, who added states should ideally use \"the same vocabulary\" in their datasets, so that they can be compared. Caroline Buckee, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said knowing more about who has had the virus will reveal more about \"where we are on the epidemic curve.\" \"And that has really important implications for policies, like whether we're going to go back to work and whether we're going to reopen schools,\" Buckee said.",

All spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing fear of retribution for speaking critically of the government's response. The sources said emergency workers who came face-to-face with quarantined potential victims while wearing inadequate protective gear later went into heavily populated areas, including gas stations, restaurants, coffee shops and even tourist attractions such as Alcatraz.Read More\"They're spraying down streets with bleach in China,\" one of the sources said. \"We would go straight from quarantine to Starbucks.\"Send us your stories about coronavirus testingIn an after-action report filed with the US Department of Health and Human Services one of the workers stated that when he complained about the lack of proper protective equipment, a supervisor told him: \"If you don't feel comfortable, we'll find another job for you.\"None of the sources has shown any signs of having contracted coronavirus. Nor are they aware of any fellow emergency workers who have.The narrative shared by the three workers largely mirrors allegations in a whistleblower complaint filed last month by an unnamed official with HHS. The complaint alleged that more than a dozen workers dispatched to greet Americans returning from Wuhan, China, where the virus originated, were \"not properly trained or equipped to operate in a public health emergency situation,\" according to The Washington Post, which obtained a copy of the filing. The complaint stated, among other things, that workers were not trained in wearing personal protective equipment even though they had face-to-face contact with returning passengers, according to The Post. In response to the whistleblower complaint, HHS said none of the employees involved in the repatriating process described in the complaint were exposed to any individuals who tested positive for the virus and that \"therefore, testing for the virus is not medically necessary.\" It added, however, the agency will test any deployed employees who request it \"to allay any employee anxiety.\" Evacuees from Wuhan, China arriving at Travis Air Force BaseHHS said in a statement to CNN this week that it has launched an investigation into complaints at both Travis and March Air Force bases in California to include \"... what protocols and procedures were followed at both facilities.\"Caroline Buckee, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard's school of public health, said much is still unknown about the basic parameters of the virus.\"One of the biggest uncertainties for this epidemic is whether people who never showed symptoms can actually spread the disease to other people,\" Buckee said in an interview with CNN. \"And we think that at least some people never show infection at all, never show symptoms of the infection, but they can spread the disease to others.\"JUST WATCHEDBanks prepare coronavirus contingency plansReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBanks prepare coronavirus contingency plans 01:31She said people who have ended up in the hospital as a result of the virus \"represent the tip of the iceberg\" and called for rapid, widespread testing.\"Otherwise we don't know what we're dealing with,\" she said.Fresh questions were raised last week about the screening process when HHS officials revealed that a screener at Los Angeles International Airport had tested positive for the virus. The agency said in a statement that the contract medical screener is believed to have worn the proper protective gear at all times while examining passengers. The agency said there have been no coronavirus detections among LAX screened travelers and that it is unclear how the employee contracted the virus. The employee reported experiencing mild symptoms and was under self-quarantine at home.Last month, California health officials disclosed that a resident of Solano County, where Travis Air Force Base is located 40 miles southwest of Sacramento, was the first suspected case of coronavirus from community exposure. Officials were continuing to investigate precisely how and when the woman came into contact with the virus.The sources who spoke to CNN about the operation at Travis said that, in addition to workers interacting with potential victims without adequate protective gear, including surgical gowns, there was no system in place for sanitizing potentially contaminated clothing. As a result, the sources said, workers would leave the quarantine area wearing the same clothes they'd worn while performing such close-contact tasks as taking potential victims' temperatures.One of the sources said he was stunned when given a bag of baby wipes to clean tables and chairs where patients had been examined.\"It's nuts,\" the source said. \"These are not disinfecting wipes. They're skin wipes.\"These are the countries where novel coronavirus cases have been confirmed worldwideThe same source said he watched a nurse from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tell a worker to take off the highly protective N95 respirator mask he was wearing and replace it with a paper dust mask, because that's all he was authorized to wear.Complicating matters, the source said, was the fact that some team members were mortuary workers unaccustomed to dealing with infectious diseases. They had no independent knowledge of the type of equipment required for the scenario at hand and relied on the advice of CDC supervisors.\"They just went along with it like sheep,\" the source said.Two of the sources deployed to Travis told CNN they felt the leaders of the operation had failed them.\"There was zero operational security or control,\" one said. \"They didn't protect us.\"Dr. Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at NYU's school of medicine, said the alleged missteps at Travis appeared to fall under the heading of what she called a \"systems error.\"\"We have them in the hospital where sometimes we know a mistake was made but no one was harmed,\" Gounder said.\"It's possible we got lucky,\" she said of issues raised by the workers at Travis. \"What you do with those situations is you analyze, and you figure out, okay, how do we do better next time?\"CNN's Jon Passantino and Lucy Kafanov contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Worried that a trove of White House records that had been brought to Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate contained classified material, a top official in the former President's orbit warned his aides last fall: Do not touch those boxes. The senior official in Trump's inner circle did not want to risk exposing sensitive materials to aides who may have lacked the appropriate security clearances, according to a person familiar with the matter. The boxes, which were being stored at the time in Trump's Florida club, had landed on the National Archives and Records Administration's radar after officials there noticed that several items were missing from their catalog of Trump White House records.In May 2021, the realization that important items from Trump's time in office -- including some of his correspondence with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un and infamous Sharpie-altered map of Hurricane Dorian -- were not transferred to the Archives at the end of his presidency prompted NARA officials to contact Trump's team.Longtime Archives lawyer Gary Stern first reached out to a person from the White House counsel's office who had been designated as the President Records Act point of contact about the record-keeping issue, hoping to locate the missing items and initiate their swift transfer back to NARA, said multiple sources familiar with the matter. The person had served as one of Trump's impeachment defense attorneys months earlier and, as deputy counsel, was among the White House officials typically involved in ensuring records were properly preserved during the transfer of power and Trump's departure from office. But after an extended back and forth over several months and after multiple steps taken by Trump's team to resolve the issue, Stern sought the intervention of another Trump attorney last fall as his frustration mounted over the pace of the document turnover. A spokesperson for Trump did not return a request for comment. Read MoreIn a statement on Thursday, Trump claimed the boxes that had been brought to Mar-a-Lago \"contained letters, records, newspapers, magazines and various articles\" that are to be featured in his presidential library \"someday.\" \"The papers were given easily and without conflict and on a very friendly basis,\" he said.One source familiar with the situation says the document turnover has \"not been fully resolved\" and says Trump is still in possession of documents the Archives wants. The Archives hinted at this in a statement earlier this week. \"Former President Trump's representatives have informed NARA that they are continuing to search for additional Presidential records that belong to the National Archives,\" the Archives said in a statement. In a series of interviews with CNN, a half-dozen people familiar with the matter described a tense situation that took nearly eight months to resolve -- beginning with NARA's outreach in May and ending with its retrieval of the boxes from Mar-a-Lago last month. Gary Stern, general counsel for National Archives, speaks on the panel, \"Preserving Presidential Papers and Archives\" in January 2021.In the end, it may have been a threat that ended the impasse. At one point, the Archives notified a member of Trump's team that it planned to alert Congress and the Department of Justice of the matter if it wasn't quickly resolved, according to a person familiar with the warning. According to a person familiar with the matter, the Archives have since asked the Justice Department to investigate. It is unclear whether the Justice Department has started an investigation. The House Oversight Committee chairwoman, Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York, has also vowed to initiate a probe of the records' removal from Trump's Palm Beach resort, which she called \"deeply troubling\" in a statement on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN, the Archives said, \"We do not comment on potential or ongoing investigations.\"One source, who has worked with Stern on other issues, described the Archives lawyer as \"persnickety\" about securing the presidential records, noting that Trump's haphazard and chaotic preservation of records likely frustrated Stern beyond measure. He \"must have lost his mind,\" this person said, describing Stern as an extremely meticulous individual who is known for writing letters that start off polite and gradually became more lawyerly and agitated. The same source said the archivists at NARA are very serious about presidential records, and that their review process involves first reviewing materials that are turned over in a secure room to determine if anything is classified and then working with the former President's designated Presidential Records Act points of contact to sort everything out. Two people familiar with the process said that NARA customarily wants to see all records that a president touched or viewed during his time in office, which would have included letters from foreign leaders or predecessors like the kind that were recovered from Mar-a-Lago in Florida. A former White House official says Trump would often bring documents from the White House into his residence at Mar-a-Lago, but it could not be learned where the documents were kept after his presidency. A pattern of haphazard record-keeping The issues that have arisen with Trump's presidential records since he left office follow a pattern of behavior that began long before he ever stepped foot inside the Oval Office and then continued -- much to the shock and frustration of aides -- during his four-year term. Running afoul of normal preservation procedures, then-President Trump would often tear up documents, drafts and memos after reading them and is said to have also periodically flushed papers down the toilet in the White House residence -- only to be discovered later on when repairmen were summoned to fix the clogged toilets. The revelation of Trump's toilet-flushing habit was first revealed Thursday by Maggie Haberman, a New York Times journalist and author of the forthcoming book \"Confidence Man\" about Trump. Haberman is a CNN contributor. In a statement on Thursday, Trump denied the allegations as categorically untrue. On one occasion during a mid-flight visit to the press cabin aboard Air Force One, Trump brought along a copy of a speech that he had just delivered and asked if anyone wanted to put it up for auction on eBay, recalled a person who witnessed the exchange. Though Trump appeared to be joking and nobody took him up on his offer, the episode further underscores the former President's seeming casual attitude toward record preservation. Then-President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un stand on North Korean soil while walking to South Korea in the Demilitarized Zone in June 2019. Some records involving correspondence with Kim were among those sought by the Archives.Other times, the former President would task aides with carrying boxes of unread memos, articles and tweet drafts aboard the presidential aircraft for him to review and then tear to shreds. A former senior Trump administration official said a deputy from the Office of Staff Secretary would usually come in after Trump left a room to pull things out of the trash and take them off his desk. Even by the end of his term, Trump had clearly not learned, \"this is the bag you put things in that we are keeping and that you have to archive,\" the official said. The concern among aides extended beyond just the Presidential Records Act. One former White House official described angst Trump's habit would lead to, at the very least, the perception that he was obstructing justice during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Some of the documents handed over to Mueller's team had to be taped back together after they were torn, though one source says they were less consequential documents, such as newspaper clippings. Another person familiar with the matter said Mueller's team asked at least two White House aides about whether Trump tore up documents, and they replied yes. While document preservation was a key responsibility of the staff secretary, the rest of Trump's senior staffers did not seem to have any sense of their obligation to maintain records of papers that moved through the West Wing, the same official recalled. \"Those who knew the rules did their best to scramble ... and make sure to do the best they could following retention requirements, but they very often were not followed,\" the official said. Making some of his aides' efforts to preserve records even more difficult was the sheer volume of papers that constantly surrounded Trump, who has long preferred handwritten notes and printed documents to email correspondence, and his habit of adding things to his calendar without notifying the proper channels. For instance, anytime Trump would conduct an interview at the White House or tape a video to share on social media, he was supposed to have a stenographer and representative from the White House Communications Agency nearby to record what was said, according to the same official.  But there were moments when he did not have a trained transcriptionist near him because of a rogue last-minute addition he had made to his daily schedule, the official said.  \"They would do their best to keep track of his calendar but his was very fluid,\" said the former senior administration official, adding that sometimes the White House Communications Agency and White House stenographers would have to \"race over\" to an event that Trump had added at the last minute. President Donald Trump references a map during a briefing from officials about Hurricane Dorian in the the White House in September 2019. The National Archives said the map was not transfered to them at the end of Trump's presidency.Former White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster on Friday told CNN that National Security Council staffers put into a place a \"foolproof\" system for their own record keeping, but acknowledged that the system could have been ignored after he left the White House in March 2018. \"We put in a system that was, I think, was kind of foolproof in that connection, with what came from the National Security Council staff. If the staff is running it well, everything that goes into the Oval Office ... is logged in and everything the President sees should be logged in,\" McMaster said.\"I can't speak about what happened after I left,\" he added. \"I was one of many national security advisers, so I'm not sure what happened after that.\" 'Everything was just hastily put into moving trucks' In the immediate aftermath of Trump's November election loss, the White House Counsel's Office made clear what the obligations were for preserving records in accordance with longstanding legal guidelines and staffers started going through the White House and collecting documents for the archives. But in the final days of the administration, as Trump desperately tried to hang onto power, things went off the rails, multiple sources say. They describe chaos and empty hallways with no one to oversee a proper move out, which would have normally included instructions on where dozens and dozens of records should be transported to. \"Everything was just hastily put into the moving trucks in order to make the quick turnaround,\" said a former Trump campaign aide. Aides to the former President, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, claimed that the sloppy preservation of records in the waning days of Trump's presidency was exacerbated by issues with the General Services Administration. The GSA typically handles the packing and moving of the West Wing while US Secret Service and residence staff oversee other parts of the executive complex move out. Due to strict coronavirus protocols at the time and heightened security in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, Trump aides said there was a shortage of trained movers and staff available to help with the process. \"There were major pandemic staffing issues,\" said one Trump adviser.  GSA press secretary Christina Wilkes said in a statement to CNN on Sunday that the agency only helps with moving \"government owned furniture within the complex,\" adding that the White House chief usher coordinates the first family's move out of the East and West Wings.  Trump's handling of records both inside the White House and after his presidency could come under intense legal scrutiny in the coming months as congressional investigators look into the records transfer initiated by NARA, but experts don't believe he will face criminal charges. More potentially could come to light in a spate of books about the Trump White House that are due for release this year by former White House aides and journalists who closely covered the administration.If the boxes the Archives retrieved from Mar-a-Lago contained sensitive or classified materials, as The Washington Post first reported late Thursday and Trump's own aides worried about, the former President could find himself under even greater legal pressure. This story has been updated to remove a specific reference as to where boxes were stored in Mar-a-Lago. The previous location mentioned was where documents were kept during his presidency, and the current location is not known. The story has also been updated Sunday to include a statement from the GSA.",

Ted Budd to depict him as unserious about foreign policy.\"While Ukrainians bled and died, Congressman Budd excused their killer,\" McCrory, a former one-term governor, says in the new spot. Interspersed in McCrory's voiceover are two separate remarks from Budd just days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February. In one clip from Fox News, Budd assesses that Putin had \"strategic reasons\" for wanting to \"protect his southern and western flank.\" In another, during an interview with a local TV station, Budd calls Putin a \"very intelligent actor.\" While the McCrory ad does not include Budd's additional remark in the interview that Putin is \"evil,\" the comment echoes former President Donald Trump's earlier praise of the \"genius\" of the Russian leader's moves just before the invasion.Read MoreTrump has endorsed Budd in the competitive North Carolina GOP Senate primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Trump remains undecided on whether he should endorse in Ohio's crowded GOP Senate primary\"These are serious times and we need serious senators,\" McCrory says in the ad. \"I'm Pat McCrory. I don't compliment our enemies.\"In the ad, McCrory also criticizes Budd for voting against sanctions on Russia. Budd has voted against sanctioning Russia in the past but announced his support this week for a bill banning Russian oil imports.The Budd campaign shot back at McCrory in a statement to CNN.\"Ted Budd presented the sort of level-headed assessment of a foreign crisis you would expect from a US Senator because he knows these are serious times that require strength and substance, not the empty soundbites preferred by career politicians like Biden and McCrory,\" said Jonathan Felts, a senior adviser to Budd.While Trump has driven GOP political messaging on a host of issues for years, the former President has found himself out of step with the vast majority of Republican voters on the Russia question. Putin's toxicity is evident in recent polling, with a February survey from Fox showing just 9% of US voters holding a favorable view of the Russian leader, while 82% said they viewed him unfavorably. Among Republicans, 81% had an unfavorable view of Putin -- including 59% who said they had a strongly unfavorable opinion.The overwhelming opposition to Putin across the political spectrum has not been lost on Republican leaders with an eye to the midterm elections. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, looking to lead the GOP to a majority this November, told CNN's Manu Raju on Wednesday that he disagreed with Trump's Putin assessment.\"I do not think anything savvy or genius about Putin. I think Putin is evil, I think he's a dictator, and I think he's murdering people right now,\" McCarthy said, without mentioning the former President by name.And when asked last week about Trump's comments on Russia, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell called Putin a \"ruthless thug.\"Pence condemns Republican Putin 'apologists' in speech to RNC donorsRepublican leaders in Washington, from the anti-Trump Rep. Liz Cheney to populists like Sen. Josh Hawley, have been sharply critical of Putin. Several GOP candidates in key races have expressed similar sentiments about Putin and the Russian invasion, though many also criticize the Biden administration's response as ineffective.  \"Talking and acting tough on Russia and foreign policy crises have been terra firma for Republicans for generations,\" said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist.The relative unity within the GOP over Putin is a notable aberration from the party's shift on foreign policy under Trump, who made ending \"endless wars\" a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign for the presidency and promoted a doctrine of \"America First\" while in office.As part of his approach, the former President repeatedly praised Putin, while criticizing the NATO alliance as \"obsolete.\" Some conservative allies of Trump in the media embraced Putin as an opponent of the decadence and political priorities of Western elites. Cheney recently labeled those allies as the \"Putin wing of the GOP.\"But amid Russia's aggression toward Ukraine, the relatively few Republican candidates who have aligned themselves with Trump's posture have found themselves on a political island. In Ohio, for instance, Senate candidate J.D. Vance said in a podcast interview he didn't \"really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\" He followed that up days later with a statement calling Russia's assault on Ukraine \"unquestionably a tragedy\" and referring to Putin as \"an evil man,\" while blasting foreign policy \"elites\" and arguing against \"military intervention from American or NATO troops.\"For his part, Trump has sought to pivot away from his initial praise of Putin's moves, issuing a statement last week calling the conflict in Ukraine a \"terrible war\" while insisting the aggression \"would have never happened\" if he were in the White House.In the minds of GOP primary voters, Putin's invasion has clarified things, says Republican pollster Glen Bolger.\"To me, I don't think voters see it as a partisan issue. They're rooting against a dictator,\" Bolger said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Republican candidate Vernon Jones announced Monday he was ending his bid for Georgia governor and would instead run for Congress in 2022.In announcing his decision, Jones threw his support behind former US Sen. David Perdue, whom former President Donald Trump has backed against incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in the GOP primary.\"After much prayer & consideration I have decided that I can best serve the people of Georgia in the Congress of the United States,\" Jones said in a statement released on Twitter. \"I believe that strong conservative voices need to be heard as we lead America into the future.\" \"Because of this decision I am officially withdrawing my candidacy for Governor effective today and will be supporting David Perdue for Governor,\" he wrote, calling Perdue a \"good man who loves our state and loves our Country.\" Jones, a former Georgia state lawmaker, had entered the gubernatorial race last April, but he trailed Perdue and Kemp in the polls. Read MoreTrump had endorsed Perdue over Kemp, whom he has publicly derided for not challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election. In an effort to bolster Perdue's chances, Trump offered Jones his endorsement in a congressional contest if Jones agreed to exit the GOP primary for governor, CNN reported last week.Trump had invited Jones to Mar-a-Lago last month to discuss switching to campaigning for a US House seat in either the 6th or 10th Congressional District, and told Jones he is prepared to endorse him in either primary as quickly as he switches, CNN previously reported. In his Monday announcement, Jones did not say which congressional seat he plans to run for.Georgia Democratic Party spokesman Max Flugrath said Jones' move \"at the behest of Donald Trump and support David Perdue will only amplify the chaos and lack of unity among the Georgia GOP.\"\"Jones' decision sets the stage for a slugfest between Kemp and Perdue, all to the detriment of Georgia voters, who deserve to hear from candidates on issues like access to affordable healthcare, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening public education,\" he added.Jones is a former Democratic state House representative who switched parties in January 2021 after his term in office ended. He made waves by endorsing Trump for reelection in 2020 and speaking at the 2020 Republican National Convention while he was still a registered Democrat.Jones has run unsuccessfully for Congress before, seeking a Senate seat in 2008 and a House seat in 2010.",

        "content": "(CNN)Matthew Dowd, a former strategist for George W. Bush's presidential reelection campaign, announced Wednesday he would launch a campaign as a Democrat against Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in next year's midterm election.Although Dowd hasn't identified as a Republican in years, his candidacy is the latest proxy fight in the larger nationwide battle over Republicans who have attached themselves to former President Donald Trump and his brand of politics versus moderate, establishment figures such as Dowd.In a two-and-a-half minute announcement video, Dowd, who publicly split with Bush and the GOP in 2007, criticized Republican politicians in Texas, singling out Patrick as \"cruel and craven.\"In particular, Dowd criticized Patrick's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Texas, saying the No. 2 official in the state \"didn't respond to it based on science and prevented local officials from doing the things they needed to do to keep their community safe.\"He slammed Patrick for pushing a bill that allows Texans to openly carry a gun in public without a permit, criticized his response to the Texas power grid failure earlier this year, and accused him of attacking voting rights and waging \"a culture war, decimating Roe v. Wade and attacking the diversity of our state.\"Read More\"We need more officials to tell the truth, who believe in public service and common sense with common decency for the common good and the idea of servant leadership,\" Dowd says in his video, adding, \"Dan Patrick believes in none of those, and that is why I'm running for the powerful office of lieutenant governor.\"Dowd, however, faces tough odds to become the next lieutenant governor in a traditionally red state in which Republicans control the governor's mansion and both chambers of the legislature, though shifting demographics in suburbs have given Democrats hope in statewide elections in recent years.First elected to the seat in 2014, Patrick won a second term in 2018 by more than 51% of the vote, beating Democratic challenger Mike Collier by less than five percentage points. Collier, an accountant and former senior adviser to Joe Biden's campaign in Texas, is considering a rematch against Patrick by launching an exploratory committee for lieutenant governor.In response to Dowd's announcement, Collier's campaign knocked Dowd's previous affiliation with the Republican Party and prior work promoting Bush's policies.\"After 20 years working to elect Republicans across the country, we welcome Matthew Dowd back to the Democratic Party. Mr. Dowd\u2014you may notice things have changed a lot since you were working for Republicans,\" Collier's deputy campaign manager, Ali S. Zaidi, said in a statement Wednesday. \"Democratic voters will be interested to hear how selling a false war, ensuring the deciding Supreme Court vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, and leading the charge to pass numerous anti-marriage equality ballot measures have shaped your current views.\"Dowd made his national name in politics as Bush's chief campaign strategist for the Republican incumbent's 2004 campaign. A lifelong Democrat, he left the party in 1999 over his disillusionment with Bill Clinton and switched to the GOP, seeing Bush as a someone who could bridge divides, according to The New York Times. But Dowd broke with Bush and the Republican Party in 2007 over the Iraq War, the Times reported, and identified as an independent.He also previously worked for Texas Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who was the last Democrat to win the office of lieutenant governor in the Lone Star State and served throughout the 90s. Dowd, a former political analyst for ABC News who stepped away from the role in January, has often criticized Trump and the GOP's politics, while Patrick, who is seeking his third term in office, was endorsed by Trump in May. Trump carried Texas in 2020 by more than 52% of the vote. This story has been updated with additional background information.CNN's Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Virginia Senate voted Wednesday to censure state Sen. Amanda Chase, a Republican who is a candidate for governor, following her comments earlier this month referring to the rioters who stormed the US Capitol as \"patriots.\"The censure vote passed 24-9 with bipartisan support.Chase had addressed the January 6 rally in Washington prior to the insurrection but did not march on the Capitol. She had said she was driving home when the storming of the building took place. In a floor speech after the episode, according to The Washington Post, Chase defended then-President Donald Trump's role in inciting the riot and said the violent mob wasn't a group of \"rioters and looters.\"\"These were patriots who loved their country and do not want to see our great republic turned into a socialist country,\" she said. \"I was there with the people. I know.\"Read MoreWednesday's censure vote is the latest in a string of controversies involving Chase. She drew scrutiny when she openly carried a firearm on her hip during Senate sessions and when she got into a verbal altercation with a Virginia Capitol police officer over a parking spot.A statement from Republican members of the state Senate said they \"were guided by their consciences\" on the censure vote but were \"united in their disappointment in Senator Chase and their disdain for her actions.\"\"Senator Chase's selfishness and constant need for media attention, with which the Senate Republican Caucus is keenly familiar, brought us to the situation in which the Senate found itself today,\" the statement said.\"While we remain hopeful today's action discourages the frequent disruptions and distractions fomented by Senator Chase, the experience of our caucus suggests otherwise. We sincerely hope this is the exceptional circumstance where Senator Chase exceeds our expectations.\"Chase, meanwhile, said in a tweet Wednesday morning that the censure \"is nothing more than a politically driven attack.\"\"The establishment elite is desperate to take me out of the running, but they will not succeed! This is nothing more than a failed attempt to tarnish my good name, reputation, and solid conservative record,\" she said in an email to constituents later.At least 150 people have been charged by federal prosecutors in connection with the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, according to a CNN review of court records and Justice Department announcements, and a top prosecutor said charges of sedition are not out of the question.Many of the defendants CNN has identified have been charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority and violent entry and disorderly conduct in the Capitol. The more serious charges have ranged from theft of government property, conspiracy and interstate threats to assault on law enforcement.",

        "content": "(CNN)As impeachment hearings play out on Capitol Hill, Iowans on both sides of the political spectrum see the inquiry as a boost to their party's chances of winning the general election next November, according to a new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll.That sentiment is stronger among registered Republicans who do not plan to attend the Democratic caucuses, with 60% saying the impeachment inquiry is more likely to make it easier than harder (26%) for President Donald Trump to win re-election. Among likely Democratic caucusgoers, 45% say the inquiry would make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win in 2020 compared to 24% who believe it will make it harder. The share of those who say they are not sure what impact the inquiry will have is roughly the same across both voter groups.For their part, likely Democratic caucusgoers are more likely to report following the impeachment proceedings than are registered Republicans. Nearly seven-in-10 likely Democratic caucusgoers say they are following the proceedings, including 46% indicating they were following them very closely. Of those following very or fairly closely, 52% say the proceedings will make it easier for the Democratic nominee to win the general election. That compares to just 36% of those who are following the inquiry somewhat closely or not at all who feel it will make it easier.More on the first impeachment hearingWhat the first public impeachment hearing tells us about the path forwardQuick timeline of Trump-Ukraine events that led to impeachment hearingsImpeachment hearing testimony further connects President to Ukraine pressureAfter one day of TV hearings, the impeachment battle lines remain the sameTakeaways from the first day of public impeachment hearingsThe findings come on the heels of the first week of public testimony in the inquiry with another eight witnesses slated to testify in open hearings this week. The poll was largely conducted before public hearings began.When it comes to registered Republicans, 30% say they're following the inquiry very closely, with another 25% saying they're following them fairly closely. Among those Republicans following the proceedings very or fairly closely, 72% say they'll make it easier for Trump to win re-election, while just 46% of those who are tracking it somewhat closely or not at all say that's the case.Read MoreAn overwhelming majority of these registered Republicans (72%) say the President did not use his office improperly to gain a political advantage against a potential 2020 opponent. Just 14% think he did -- but nearly half of those who say they would consider or definitely vote for someone other than the President in the general election (47%) say he used his office improperly.Trump's sky high GOP supportThe President's standing among this group of Iowa Republicans is as strong as ever, with 85% approving of his job performance, gaining four points since March. Separately, 83% say they have a favorable view of Trump. Views of the President are roughly even across different age groups, but there is a gender divide, with more men (88%) holding a more favorable view of Trump than women (79%).As strong as the President's job performance rates with Republicans, they like his handling of the economy even more -- with 89% voicing approval. He also receives high marks on his handling of immigration (76%), trade with China (75%) and foreign policy (74%). One weaker spot for Trump is ethanol, with a slight majority (53%) approving of his handling of that issue.Vice President Mike Pence is as popular among these Republicans as the President, with 82% saying they have a favorable view of him.GOP critics of the President -- including two primary challengers -- don't fare as well. Sen. Mitt Romney's favorable rating is now upside-down, with 46% viewing him unfavorably and 36% seeing him favorably. The Utah senator had a favorable rating of 65% in December 2018. Then, just 21% viewed him unfavorably.A pair of the President's primary opponents, former Gov. Bill Weld and former Rep. Joe Walsh, receive more negative than positive marks, though both are largely unknown among these Republicans. Walsh's favorable rating is 8% compared to 12% unfavorable. It's 4% favorable and 11% unfavorable for Weld.Overall, 76% say they definitely plan to vote to re-elect the President, up nine percentage points since March, with clear majorities across nearly every demographic group. The only exception is moderates, with 47% saying they plan to vote for Trump.These registered Republicans are also optimistic about Trump's chances against the top four Democratic challengers with clear majorities saying they think the President is almost certain to win each potential matchup. Confidence is highest about defeating Bernie Sanders, with 62% saying they are almost certain the President will defeat the Vermont senator. That's compared to 59% who say that about Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 58% for former Vice President Joe Biden and 56% for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.There is slightly more uncertainty among registered Republicans about the outcome of a potential Trump -- Buttigieg matchup, with 15% saying they are not sure what would happen in such a contest. For the other three Democrats tested that number is in the single-digits.Loyalty testThere is about an even split on the question of whether Iowa registered Republicans feel more allegiance to the GOP or Trump, with 43% choosing the Republican Party and 41% naming the President.Those siding with the GOP include Republicans under the age of 35 (49% to 36%, respectively), those with a college degree (51% to 37%) and self-described moderates (55% to 31%).The groups with the strongest allegiance to Trump include those who call themselves very conservative (52% side with Trump versus 34% who side with the party), evangelicals (46% to 41%) and those who live in rural areas (47% to 37%).While some states look to cancel nominating contests to benefit Trump, nearly three-in-four of these Republicans (72%) approve of the Iowa GOP's decision to hold a caucus with a vote for a nominee in 2020. However, interest is fairly low, with just 30% of registered Republicans saying they will definitely or probably attend the GOP caucuses.The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, November 8 through 13 among a random sample of 500 likely Democratic caucusgoers and 502 registered Republicans not planning to participate in the Democratic caucuses reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. Results for the full samples of likely caucusgoers and of registered Republicans each have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)There is a lot up for grabs Tuesday.All 435 House races are on the ballot, with Democrats feeling optimistic about winning control of the chamber.In the Senate, 35 seats are at stake, with Republicans positioned to hold -- and possibly expand -- the party's slim majority.\n\n\n\n    2018 Key Races tracker\n    \n\nAnd 36 gubernatorial contests will be decided, with Democrats looking to put a dent in the current 17-seat advantage for Republicans.That doesn't count the 6,066 state legislative races across 46 states and 158 ballot measures in 37 states.Read MoreWith so much at stake, we here at CNN have identified 10 races that help explain the story of the 2018 midterms -- and might offer hints about how things are likely to shake out on Election Night.Kentucky's 6th District: The Early IndicatorDemocratic congressional candidate Amy McGrath This Lexington-area district will be one of the first places we see votes on Election Night and could offer an early clue at just how energized Democrats are this year. Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, has given GOP Rep. Andy Barr a run for his money in a district President Donald Trump carried by 16 points. If Democrats are winning in places like eastern Kentucky, then Republicans could be in for a long night on Tuesday.Virginia's 7th District: Tea Party vs. The ResistanceAbigail Spanberger, Democratic U.S. Representative candidate from VirginiaTwo-term Rep. Dave Brat stunned the political world in 2014 when he defeated House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a GOP primary. Four years later, Brat could find himself on the losing end of another upset, facing a strong challenge from Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer. She is not running as a progressive firebrand, but just as Brat rode the Tea Party wave against Cantor, Spanberger could capitalize on the suburban backlash to the President in a traditionally Republican district.New Jersey's 7th District: The Trump Drag Rep. Leonard Lance, R-N.J., Can a moderate Republican survive in a swing district where disapproval with the President is creating significant headwinds? That is the question confronting several GOP incumbents, including New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance. The five-term incumbent broke with his party and voted against the Republican tax bill and the GOP's 2017 effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Despite those moves, Lance might not be able to escape the shadow cast by Trump and the GOP agenda. He faces a well-funded challenge from Democrat Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official, in a district Hillary Clinton carried by a single point.California's 45th District: Welcome to the O.C.Rep. Mimi Walters, R-Calif.There are seven GOP-held seats in California that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. They include the 45th District which is based entirely in Orange County and is a longtime Republican stronghold that's become increasingly diverse. Mitt Romney won the district by 12 points, but it went for Clinton by five. GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is running against Democrat Katie Porter, a consumer protection lawyer and Elizabeth Warren prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. A victory here by Porter, a progressive favorite who has endorsed single-payer health care, would send a signal of how far the politics of this area have moved.Iowa's 3rd District: Obama-Trump TurfCindy Axne, democratic candidate for the U.S. House in Iowa's 3rd districtThere's been a lot of attention paid to the 25 GOP seats Clinton carried in 2016 -- and rightfully so -- but Democrats are also on offense in many of the dozen districts that swung from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump four years later. Iowa's 3rd District is a prime example. Obama twice won this southwestern Iowa district, home to the capital city of Des Moines, on his way to capturing the Hawkeye State during both of his presidential runs. Trump carried the district by three points as part of his nine-point victory in the state. Do voters in Iowa and other spots on the Obama-Trump map swing back to the Democrats? This contest features a matchup between two-term GOP Rep. David Young and Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner and first-time candidate.Texas' 7th District: The Swanky Suburbs Rep. John Culberson, R-TexasFor Democrats, gaining the 23 seats needed to win control of the House will likely mean flipping several upscale suburban districts with large numbers of college graduates. Texas' 7th District, home to the west Houston suburbs, fits that mold. This once solid Republican seat sent George H.W. Bush to Congress in 1966. But the changing demographics of the district -- which became majority-minority after redistricting in 2011 -- have turned it into one of the most competitive House races in the Lone Star State. Trump lost the district by a single point to Clinton, 48% to 47%, after Romney carried the district 60% to 39% four years earlier. Nearly $18 million has been spent on TV ads in the race between nine-term GOP Rep. John Culberson and Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, an attorney.Georgia's 6th District: The Wave MakerLucy McBath, the Democratic candidate in Georgia's 6th District.For decades, Georgia's 6th District has been solid Republican turf -- electing Newt Gingrich and Tom Price to Congress -- and voting for GOP presidential candidates such as Romney and John McCain by wide margins. Then Trump entered the picture. In 2016, Trump won the suburban Atlanta district by a single point. GOP Rep. Karen Handel scored a four-point victory in a fiercely-contested 2017 special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Now she faces a challenge from gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was shot and killed in 2012 after a dispute over loud music. If Democrats are winning districts like this one in Georgia, then the party should be in the majority come January with some room to spare.Missouri Senate: A Red State Toss-UpThe Senate story this cycle has centered on the favorable map for Republicans with 10 Democratic incumbents running in states Trump won in 2016 -- five of them by double digits. Democrats hold a very narrow path to the majority -- one that almost certainly closes if Sen. Claire McCaskill is unable to hold on in Missouri. The two-term Democrat won her first race in 2006, a strong year for the party, and benefitted from a weak opponent in 2012. Polls in the Show Me State show the race is deadlocked. If McCaskill is able to defeat Republican Josh Hawley, the state's attorney general, that would be a positive sign for other Red State Democrats such as Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Jon Tester in Montana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia.Nevada Senate: A Test of the Health Care ArgumentHealth care has been the dominant message for Democrats this cycle -- mentioned in more than half the party's TV ads. In Nevada, Democrats have made every effort to ensure voters in the Silver State remember GOP Sen. Dean Heller's shifting stances on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Heller initially opposed GOP proposals to dismantle Obamacare, only to vote in favor of the so-called \"skinny repeal\" measure that failed in the Senate. The campaign of Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen has run TV ads featuring a clip of the President pressing Heller on health care to suggest the senator bowed to political pressure when he voted for the GOP plan. A recent CNN poll found health care was the top issue for 28% of likely voters in Nevada, followed closely by immigration at 26%. But it was the number one issue for 49% of likely Democratic voters. For Democrats such as Rosen who are in razor-thin races, the potency of the health care argument could be crucial to their chances.Florida Governor: The 2020 TeaserThe race for governor in the Sunshine State is one of the marquee races of the cycle. In the short-term, it's a battle of political bases with progressive Democrat Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, facing off against former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who won the GOP primary by aligning himself closely with President Trump. That's reason enough to keep a close eye on this race. But there are massive implications for 2020, with Democrats in the midst of a debate between the progressive and moderate wings of the party. A Gillum victory in the biggest presidential battleground prize would give the progressive wing an added jolt as the early 2020 jockeying begins in earnest.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez is in a surprising dead heat with his Republican challenger in New Jersey's Senate race, a new poll finds. The poll of likely voters, released on Monday by Stockton University, found that Menendez, whose federal corruption trial ended in a mistrial last year, holds a two-point advantage over businessman Bob Hugin -- 45% to 43% -- a split that is within the poll's margin of error.The poll is the most recent to show a tight race in New Jersey. A Quinnipiac University poll released in late August found Menendez held a six-point lead. The closer-than-expected margin in recent polls -- combined with Menendez's struggles to emerge from the ethical cloud following last year's federal corruption trial and Hugin's willingness to spend millions of his own money -- moves the race in CNN's ratings from Likely Democratic to Lean Democratic.If Menendez loses, Democrats would have an even more difficult path towards controlling the Senate starting in 2019. Read More\"With a two-point lead falling within the poll's margin of error, the Senate race at this point is up for grabs,\" said Michael W. Klein, interim executive director of the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University.Much of the race to date has focused on ethics, with Hugin slamming Menendez for a federal corruption trial that has dogged the senator for years. The Department of Justice, after investigating Menendez for nearly five years, charged the senator with conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud related to allegedly abusing the power of his office.But after a New Jersey jury was deadlocked in 2017, the case ended in a mistrial. And in early 2018, the Department of Justice filed to dismiss the charges against Menendez, a decision that was seen as a win for the senator's re-election chances.According to the poll, the corruption charges against Menendez still hang over his campaign, with 59% of voters saying the charges are \"extremely important\" or \"significant factor\" in how they will vote in November.Hugin touted the poll as validation on Monday.\"Whether you're a Democrat, Republican, or Independent, voters want a Senator who will put New Jersey first and represent them with honor and integrity,\" Hugin said in a statement.Democrats largely dismissed the poll and conveyed confidence, arguing that it under sampled young people and Latino voters and noting that they expected the race to get close given Hugin, a millionaire chair of a pharmaceutical company, has spent close to $10 million on television ads, according to Kantar Media/CMAG tracking data.Joel Benenson, Menendez's pollster, tweeted that the poll \"only had 24 people aged 18-29 and 24 Latinos in sample of 578, both key Dem constituencies that are too small to weigh properly.\"\"We knew this would be a competitive race given the millions greedy drug company CEO Bob Hugin spent on TV he made off the backs of cancer victims and their families, but we are confident Senator Menendez will prevail on Election Day,\" the Menendez campaign said in a statement.Democrats are keeping an eye on New Jersey, however. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, after the Quinnipiac poll showed a tight race, made a six-figure coordinated ad buy on Menendez's behalf in late August, according to a committee aide.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The battle for control of the US House is coming into sharper focus with November's midterm elections now less than 70 days away.For Democrats, the path to the majority appears to run in large part through suburban, well-educated districts where disapproval of President Donald Trump's job performance could be hobbling GOP candidates. The party's prospects have improved as Democratic candidates continue to overperform in special election contests, with the latest example being last month's slim defeat in a reliably Republican central Ohio district. The result was further proof the party has a significant enthusiasm edge this cycle.Despite those headwinds, there remain a few bright spots for the GOP. The party has a handful of incumbents who are running strong races in districts that would be tough in any environment, let alone one where the President's approval rating is stuck in the high 30s or low to mid-40s. The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, released Friday, showed the President at 36% approval and 60% disapproval.Ten weeks might not seem like a long time, but in politics it is a lifetime. The national dynamics can change in an instant, as we saw with the recent legal bombshells involving Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. Then there was the stunning indictment of a sitting GOP member of Congress for allegedly misusing campaign funds, prompting Democrats to reprise their \"culture of corruption\" line of attack, which the party successfully deployed against Republicans in 2006.In all, CNN is moving 14 seats -- 11 toward Democrats and three in the direction of Republicans. There are currently 11 seats held or vacated by Republicans that CNN rates as Lean Democratic or better, which would get the party almost halfway to the 23 it needs to gain in order to win control of the House. Of the 30 districts now rated as Toss-Ups, 28 belong to Republicans -- and Hillary Clinton won 12 of them in 2016. Read MoreTo the ratings:CA-45: This district is one of seven GOP-held seats in districts that Clinton won in the Golden State, carrying it 49% to 44%. In 2012, it went 55% to 43% for Mitt Romney. Based entirely in Orange County, the 45th District is diverse -- 22% Asian and 19% Latino -- and highly educated -- a majority of residents hold at least a four-year college degree. Two-term GOP Rep. Mimi Walters is running against UC Irvine consumer law professor Katie Porter. With Republicans facing long odds in California's gubernatorial contest and shut out of the Senate race, the party is hoping an effort to repeal the state's gas tax will boost GOP turnout this fall to the benefit of some congressional candidates locked in tough battles. Porter recently released an ad saying she opposes higher gas taxes, a move to try and neutralize attacks from Walters and outside groups. Republicans are trying to cast Porter as too liberal for the district, highlighting the Democrat's support of \"Medicare-for-all.\" Democrats, meanwhile, are likely to seize on Walters' vote in favor of the GOP tax plan, which included a cap on state and local tax deductions -- claimed by 46% of households in the 45th District in 2014, according to the Tax Policy Center. Both candidates should have plenty of resources for the fall campaign. Porter outraised Walters by $1 million to $704,000 in the second quarter, but the GOP incumbent held a $1.5 million to $780,000 lead in cash on hand at the end of June. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpCA-50: The indictment of GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter on charges he and his wife misused $250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses not only places the five-term incumbent in legal jeopardy, it also adds a degree of difficulty to his political challenge this cycle. The charges detailed in the 47-page indictment include spending campaign money on an Italian vacation, in-cabin flights for the family's pet bunny and tequila shots at a DC bachelor party. Hunter's Democratic opponent, Ammar Campa-Najjar, has turned the indictment into a new TV ad that calls Hunter an \"embarrassment.\" Even with the charges, the district remains an uphill climb for Democrats. Trump won it by 15 points with 54% of the vote in 2016. Romney carried it by an even wider 22-point margin in 2012, 60% to 38%. Campa-Najjar is running a progressive campaign on some of California's most conservative terrain. That could make it difficult for the Democrat to fully capitalize on any Republican voters in the district who sour on Hunter because of the charges. Hunter has struggled to raise money amid the federal investigation into his campaign spending, which seems unlikely to change following the indictment. Campa-Najjar nearly doubled Hunter in the second quarter, $362,000 to $183,000. Races moves from Solid Republican to Likely RepublicanIA-04: Eight-term GOP Rep. Steve King remains a heavy favorite to prevail in November, but he's got some competition in the form of Democrat J.D. Scholten, a former professional baseball player barnstorming the northwest Iowa district in a red, white and blue Winnebago emblazoned with his name. Part of the challenge for Democrats in the 4th District is the GOP's commanding registration advantage. Republicans make up 39% of registered voters, while Democrats are just 25%. Another 35% don't have a party affiliation. Scholten will have to tap into that vote if he's going to fare better than previous challengers to King. The conservative firebrand's previous low-water mark came in 2012, when he defeated former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack by 8 points, 53% to 45%. One area that might be of concern for King is money. Scholten outraised King by $342,000 to $140,000 in the second quarter of 2018 -- which marks the third consecutive quarter he's hauled in more funds than the GOP incumbent. At last check Scholten leads $254,000 to $117,000 in cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely RepublicanKS-02: Democrat Paul Davis lost his 2014 bid for governor against Sam Brownback by 4 points, but he carried the 2nd District by 6 points. This year the former Kansas House minority leader will face off with Army veteran Steve Watkins, who won a competitive seven-way GOP primary with 26% of the vote. Watkins benefited from roughly $300,000 in television advertising from a PAC founded and funded by his father, support that Democrats might try to turn into a political liability. Still, that kind of outside spending could help Watkins close the fundraising gap with Davis, who had a $942,000 to $125,000 advantage in cash on hand as of mid-July. Watkins is also getting an assist from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House GOP super PAC, which is targeting Davis with ads saying he'll \"rubber-stamp\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's \"liberal tax and spend agenda.\" Davis has vowed to vote against Pelosi for Democratic leader if he's elected. Another figure who could be a factor in the race is Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the GOP nominee for governor. Kobach, a vocal proponent of strict voter identification laws and hardline immigration policies, could be a potential drag on House GOP candidates in the Sunflower State. Republicans there were already facing headwinds stirred up by Brownback, the unpopular former governor, who resigned earlier this year to take a job in the Trump administration. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpKS-03: Staying in Kansas, the potential Kobach and Brownback drag also applies to the 3rd District, where GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder is facing a challenge from Democrat Sharice Davids, a former mixed martial-arts fighter and White House fellow who emerged from a competitive six-person primary. This mostly suburban district surrounding Kansas City has a large share of college graduates. In 2016, Clinton narrowly won the district, 47% to 46%. Romney carried it by 10 points four years earlier. Yoder received less than 70% of the GOP primary vote, which could be a warning sign for the four-term incumbent. He also was called out by the Kansas City Star editorial board for primary night comments that Davids and one of her Democratic rivals didn't \"know Kansas\" and \"don't know our values.\" Davids would be the first openly lesbian congresswoman from Kansas and one of the first Native American women elected to Congress along with Deb Haaland, who is running for a solidly blue House seat in New Mexico. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpKY-06: Just how far will the Democratic Party's enthusiasm edge carry it in 2018? Kentucky's 6th District, home to Lexington, is one race to watch for an answer. Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine Corps fighter pilot, is challenging three-term GOP Rep. Andy Barr in a state Trump carried by 16 points. McGrath's candidacy -- fueled in part by sharply produced television ads highlighting her military background -- has turned this into a top Democratic target this cycle. Barr recently sought to compare his political experience to McGrath's military service, telling The New York Times they \"both served our country\" -- adding he did so \"in a position where ideas matter\" and McGrath \"where execution matters.\" His campaign also has attacked her as a \"radical progressive\" and a \"feminist\" in an effort to cast her as \"too liberal for Kentucky.\" McGrath has been a strong fundraiser, pulling in $1.2 million in the second quarter, compared with $913,000 for Barr. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpNJ-03: This New Jersey swing district features two-term GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur and Democratic challenger Andy Kim, a former White House national security official. A recent Monmouth University poll of the 3rd District showed a tight race: 41% for MacArthur, 40% for Kim and 15% undecided. Trump's approval among voters in the 3rd District stands at 46%, while 49% disapprove. In 2016, Trump carried the district 51% to 45% -- a swing from four years earlier, when Obama won it 52% to 48%. Kim has proven to be a strong fundraiser, hauling in more than $1 million in the second quarter and leading in cash on hand $1.6 million to $1 million -- though MacArthur could help his cause by leaning on his personal wealth. Democrats have made health care a centerpiece of their midterm messaging. That is especially true in the 3rd District, where Kim has seized on MacArthur's role in the House GOP's effort to repeal Obamacare last year. MacArthur was also the only New Jersey representative from either party to back the GOP tax cut plan that limited the popular deduction for state and local taxes. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpOH-01: GOP Rep. Steve Chabot was swept into office amid the 1994 Republican revolution. He lost his seat in 2008 during a strong year for Democrats, only to gain it back two years later in the GOP wave of 2010. Can the 11-term incumbent withstand the political headwinds facing his party this time around? He's facing a serious challenge from 35-year-old Hamilton County Clerk of Courts Aftab Pureval, who has significantly outraised Chabot the last two quarters. The back-to-back hauls have Pureval closing in on Chabot's cash on hand, $1.5 million to $1.3 million. The 1st District is a blend of urban and suburban areas with a sizable share of college graduates and where 30% of residents are nonwhite. In particular, the President's struggles with college-educated women could pose trouble for Chabot. In an election where offering \"change\" could be an asset and the power of incumbency somewhat diminished, the contrast between Pureval and Chabot has the potential to sway some voters toward the Democratic challenger. Race moves from Lean Republican to Toss-UpOH-12: For Democrats, the August special election was likely the party's best opportunity at flipping this long-held GOP seat in central Ohio. Republican Troy Balderson eked out a win, defeating Democrat Danny O'Connor in a district Trump carried by 11 points in 2016 and that had been represented by Republicans for more than three decades. Balderson and O'Connor will face off again in November, but the rematch isn't expected to draw the same level of national attention and money as their initial encounter. Given the Republican DNA of this district, Balderson starts Round 2 with an advantage. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean RepublicanOH-14: Three-term GOP Rep. Dave Joyce is running a television ad touting his opposition to his party's efforts to take away health insurance protections for pre-existing conditions while also trumpeting that he \"stood up\" to Trump on funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. The move to stress his independence reflects the balance Joyce must strike in this suburban Northeast Ohio district that Trump carried by double digits but for a long time was held by the late Rep. Steve LaTourette, a moderate Republican who advocated for pragmatism over partisanship. Democrat Betsy Rader has accused Joyce of \"running away from his record\" -- noting his previous support for repealing the Affordable Care Act. Rader's experience as a senior counsel at the Cleveland Clinic and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could help her more effectively litigate the health care argument in the race. Before Trump's 11-point win in the 14th District, Obama narrowly lost it twice -- by 3 points in 2012 and by less than a point in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean RepublicanPA-01: On paper, this suburban Philadelphia district should be locked in the Toss-Up column from now until Nov. 6. But first-term GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick has cultivated a moderate brand, voting against the House GOP's Obamacare repeal plan while also picking up endorsements from organized labor and Giffords, the gun control advocacy group founded by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords. The Democratic nominee is Scott Wallace, a multimillionaire philanthropist and grandson of one of Franklin Roosevelt's vice presidents. Republicans have sought to cast Wallace as a wealthy outsider and seized on donations made by his charitable foundation, including those to groups protesting Israel. Wallace's campaign blasted the attacks from \"special interests\" and charged Fitzpatrick with being \"in the pocket of Donald Trump.\" A June poll from Monmouth University found 53% of the voters in the district had a favorable impression of Fitzpatrick, compared with just 22% who had an unfavorable view, signaling the challenge Wallace faces in trying to redefine his opponent while also defending himself from political attacks. Wallace holds a slight edge in terms of cash on hand -- $1.7 to $1.65 million -- and can lean on his personal wealth to fuel his effort. But the GOP cavalry is prepared to boost Fitzpatrick with roughly $7 million in TV ads between now and Election Day, per Kantar Media/CMAG. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean RepublicanPA-10: The redistricting scramble in Pennsylvania earlier this year put the 10th District within reach for Democrats. The redrawn lines, which included adding parts of Harrisburg favorable to Democrats, shifted the district from one Trump carried by 21 points to one he would have won by 9 points. The party also landed a candidate, George Scott, whose background as a retired Army lieutenant colonel and Lutheran pastor could appeal in the district. The incumbent, GOP Rep. Scott Perry, is an Iraq War veteran and assistant adjutant general in the Pennsylvania National Guard. Scott outraised Perry in the second quarter, but the Republican holds a $553,000 to $207,000 advantage in cash on hand. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently added Scott to its \"Red to Blue\" program, which should help bolster his fundraising for the final stretch of the campaign. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean RepublicanTX-23: GOP Rep. Will Hurd, a former CIA officer, is no stranger to close campaigns. He won his first race in 2014 by 2 points and was re-elected by an even slimmer margin. He's also established a moderate political brand -- and managed to preserve it in the era of the Trump GOP. Hurd voted against the House GOP Obamacare repeal bill -- the only Texas Republican to do so -- and has criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, including building a wall along the border with Mexico -- more than 800 miles of which are in the 23rd District. Following the Helsinki summit in July, Hurd faulted the President over his \"failure to defend the United States intelligence community's unanimous conclusions of Russian meddling in the 2016 election\" and suggested Trump was being \"manipulated\" by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The challenge for Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force intelligence officer, is to convince voters in the district that Hurd's centrist credentials are disingenuous. Jones is well-funded -- raising $1.2 million in the second quarter -- but still trails Hurd in cash on hand $2 million to $1.1 million. Between now and November, Hurd and his GOP allies plan to spend about $5.3 million on television, compared with $1.7 million by Jones and Democratic groups, according to Kantar Media/CMAG. And while many prime Democratic targets this year are found in the suburbs, the 23rd District spans two time zones, stretching from San Antonio to El Paso, totaling more than 58,000 square miles. Clinton won it by 4 points; Romney by 3. Jones is a credible challenger who should keep the race close, but heading into the final stretch it appears Hurd has the edge. Race moves from Toss-Up to Lean RepublicanWA-03: GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler placed first in the 3rd District's top-two primary in August, but the four-term incumbent received only 42% of the vote. Democrat Carolyn Long, a professor at Washington State University Vancouver, was second with 35%. The overall primary vote was split 51% to 49% in favor of Republican candidates. Trump carried the district by 7 points -- but with just 48% of the vote in 2016. Romney won it 50% to 48% in 2012. Herrera Beutler had more than $1 million in the bank as of mid-July, compared with $111,000 for Long. That's a significant gap to make up given the late primary in the Evergreen State.

        "content": "(CNN)Ukrainians have been leaving the country in huge numbers following the Russian invasion that began on Thursday, but many are being forced to wait more than 60 hours in long queues to cross into neighboring Poland. A CNN team on the ground joined the queue but only moved just under half a mile (0.8 kilometers) in 70 minutes, a rate that meant it would have taken them more than 60 hours to cross the border. Of course, the wait times can vary.About 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border, some Ukrainians got out of their cars and began a long walk to the village of Medyka in southeast Poland. Ukrainians waiting in a queue of cars to cross the border into Poland, February 26, 2022.Among them, two young girls skipped along happily, blissfully unaware that they were about to embark on a 30-mile walk. The Polish Border Guard tweeted on Saturday that 45,200 people had entered the country from Ukraine that day alone, as of 3 p.m. local time. More than 121,000 people had entered since the start of the invasion, the guard said.Read MoreFleeing Russia's advancing troops means some Ukrainians are leaving husbands, sons and brothers behind \"It's nice to cross but also it's very sad to leave my country in such despair,\" one woman said after crossing into Medyka in the early hours of Saturday. She said she had taken some belongings of sentimental value from her flat in Kyiv \"just to remember it if anything happens.\"On the M13 highway toward another point along the border, CNN's team encountered at least five checkpoints set up at entrances to the towns they passed through. Concrete chicanes, or serpentine curves, had been put in place to slow traffic, and next to newly installed concrete barriers at some checkpoints, piles of tires were being gathered with the intention of setting them alight and rolling them into the road in the case of Russian forces trying to enter the towns. Ukrainian refugees crossing the border into Medyka, Poland, February 26, 2022.On Saturday, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees, Kelly Clements, told CNN's Michael Holmes that more than 120,000 people had left the country and 850,000 were internally displaced.\"We would say that up to 4 million people could actually cross borders, if things continue to deteriorate, which they have until now,\" Holmes added, saying Ukrainians were having to make \"life or death\" decisions.  CNN's team said the Ukrainians walking to the border were largely women and children, and were \"resigned\" to the journey, having accepted it as \"the only option they had.\" Men between the ages of 18 and 60 are not permitted to leave the country, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky imposed martial law in the aftermath of the Russian invasion.Ukrainian citizens arrive at a border control checkpoint between Poland and Ukraine, during the early hours of February 26.At a gas station not far from the border, CNN spoke to a woman who had waited \"days\" to cross into Poland with her husband and two young children but was now going back home to the Ukrainian city of Lviv.Ukraine's outgunned forces slow Russian invasion in number of citiesThe family had tried to make the journey together, and were in the queue to leave when martial law was imposed. As the woman's husband had a permit to work in Poland, they attempted the crossing -- but her husband was turned away. Faced with the choice to split up or stay together, they decided to remain in Ukraine as a family.However, men who are non-Ukrainian nationals are allowed to leave and have been seen waiting to cross at the border or at the train station among crowds largely composed of women and children. Many are students or hospitality and service workers.Some Ukrainian men have had better luck than others, convincing border guards to allow them to leave. Sergei Zalankov was one of them, and left on a train to the Polish town of Przemysl with his wife and children.Ukrainian refugees at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, February 26, 2022.\"Most people, they just didn't have the tickets. So they just stormed the train... I mean, it was almost like a stampede,\" Zalankov told CNN. \"People were trying to get inside no matter what.\"At the train station, volunteers handed out food and linked up people with places to stay, including guest homes and a school gymnasium. People bundled up and tried to stay warm, and children slept on cots in the hallway. Several people held up signs offering new arrivals rides to various locations around Poland. \"It was chaos, it was a lot of people pushing around,\" Zalankov said of the train, saying nobody was checking tickets. \"But I mean, people run to escape. People run for their lives, so I don't blame them.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A hate crime investigation is underway in the Texas city of Colleyville, where worshipers were held hostage in a synagogue last month, after anti-Semitic and White separatist flyers sealed in clear sandwich bags were left in driveways, authorities said.Police, in a Facebook post on Sunday, pointed out that similar flyers have appeared in cities including San Francisco, Miami and Denver and said the department was in communication with the FBI. \"In what appears to be a coordinated effort in cities across the country, anti-Semitic and other racist materials were distributed in clear sandwich bags to parts of our city overnight,\" Colleyville Mayor Richard Newton said in a written statement Sunday. \"The City unequivocally denounces hate in any form -- it has no place in our city.\" In late January, hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers were distributed to homes in South Florida, authorities said. The Anti-Defamation League said at the time that similar flyers were distributed in five other states: Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, California and Maryland.A copy of one flyer obtained in January by CNN showed an image of the Star of David along with a list of top government health officials, pharmaceutical company leaders, and heads of investment management companies, which the flyer incorrectly stated were all Jewish, along with other Jewish hate speech on the back.Read MoreA spokesperson for the FBI told CNN on Tuesday that the bureau was coordinating with local authorities to determine whether any federal violations exist. 'It is really dizzying for our community': Growing anti-Semitism forcing Jewish Americans to be more vigilantOn January 15, the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville endured a terrifying ordeal when a man took four members hostage during a nearly 11-hour stand-off with authorities. Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was shot and killed by FBI agents after the four hostages escaped. Investigators have said they believe that Akram, a British national, was partially motivated a desire to see the release of convicted extremist Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year federal prison sentence in Fort Worth. She was not involved in the Colleyville standoff, her attorney said.The FBI has said it's investigating that incident as a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, who escaped the hostage situation, said earlier this month that nonprofits and religious institutions need additional federal security funding. The \"gap between the need and funding is profound,\" he told a House Homeland Security panel, noting specific needs of small congregations.Anti-Semitic attacks, including assaults, vandalism and harassment, are on the rise in US, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL documented 2,024 incidents of anti-Semitism in 2020, according to its annual audit. It was the third highest number of incidents since the organization began tracking in 1979, it said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Months after he was convicted of murder, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to civil rights charges related to the death of George Floyd.Chauvin also pleaded guilty in a separate federal case in which he was accused of depriving the rights of a 14-year-old in Minneapolis in 2017 for allegedly kneeling on the back and neck of a handcuffed, non-resisting teenager.As part of the plea agreement, Chauvin faces a sentence of between 20 and 25 years in prison. Prosecutors requested that he be sentenced to 25 years in prison to be served concurrently with his current 22 and a half year sentence on state murder charges.\"Defendant Chauvin has pleaded guilty to two federal civil rights violations, one of which led to the tragic loss of George Floyd's life,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"While recognizing that nothing can repair the harm caused by such acts, the Justice Department is committed to holding accountable those who violate the Constitution, and to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans.\"Former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin pleads not guilty to federal charges The guilty plea came nearly 18 months after the former officer held his knee on Floyd's neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while the 46-year-old Black man, handcuffed and lying prone in the street, gasped for air and told Chauvin and other officers, \"I can't breathe.\" Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, sparked protests nationwide against police brutality and racial injustice.Read MoreIn April, Chauvin was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for Floyd's death and was sentenced to 22 and a half years in state prison. Under Minnesota law, Chauvin will have to serve two-thirds of his sentence, or 15 years, and then will be eligible for supervised release for the remaining seven and a half years.Separate from his state murder case, Chauvin was charged in two federal indictments related to his policing. He had pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in September.But on Wednesday, Chauvin appeared in federal court in St. Paul, Minnesota, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, and admitted guilt. The hearing was not captured on video because cameras are not allowed in federal court.Assistant US Attorney Allen Slaughter asked Chauvin to confirm details included in the plea agreement, specifically whether Chauvin held Floyd down on the ground even after Floyd became unresponsive.\"Correct,\" Chauvin said to each question asked by the prosecutor.US District Court Judge Paul Magnuson has not yet set a date for Chauvin's sentencing. Members of the Floyd family were present in the courtroom, as was the unidentified juvenile Chauvin admitted to assaulting in 2017. According to the pool reporter inside court, Floyd's brother Philonise Floyd turned to the juvenile after the hearing and said, \"It's a good day for justice.\"A first time admitting guiltAt his state murder trial in April, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin chose not to testify.The guilty plea represents the first time Chauvin has publicly admitted his role in Floyd's death, after he had pleaded not guilty to the state murder charges and exercised his right not to testify at trial.Speaking outside of court, Philonese Floyd told CNN of the importance of Chauvin's guilty plea.\"To me, this is big, because a blue wall fell, and it never falls,\" he said. \"It makes me feel better knowing that he is going be held accountable for what is going on.\"Other family members said they believed Chauvin pleaded guilty only because he had no other choice.\"I'm still feeling the same pain (and) anger I felt in the beginning, because he could have did this last year, started this on that day,\" said Rodney Floyd, another one of Floyd's brothers. \"So today is the same pain.\"Terrence Floyd, another brother, said hearing the guilty plea \"made me feel like, finally, you took accountability.\" Derek Chauvin found guilty of all three charges for killing George Floyd\"When he was pleading guilty, I know he knows why,\" he said. \"The fact still remains that he's actually going to be in prison and he's going to do time for what he did, so that's good enough for me.\"The family's civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, Antonio Romanucci and Jeff Storms said the guilty plea was part of a historic day.\"While in many ways today is a victory for the interest of justice, we will never forget its cost,\" they said.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who led the murder case against Chauvin, issued a statement on the importance of the guilty plea.\"Today, Derek Chauvin took responsibility and admitted his guilt in open court, under penalty of perjury, for depriving George Floyd and a boy, then just 14 years old, of their civil rights. This is important and historic. His admissions mark another important moment of accountability and another step on the road to justice,\" he said.He also thanked the US Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota and the Department of Justice for bringing the case.\"George Floyd's life mattered. That young man's life matters. Nobody is above the law, and nobody is beneath it. While Floyd's life is lost to his family and all of us, I hope Chauvin's change of plea will mark a new beginning for equal justice under the law, respectful treatment for every person in our society, and greater trust in our system of justice,\" Ellison said.What the federal indictments allegedThe two federal indictments, unsealed in May, cover two separate incidents in which Chauvin knelt on a person who was handcuffed and lying prone on their stomach. At Chauvin's murder trial, medical experts testified that this position limits a person's ability to breathe in what's known as positional asphyxia.In the first federal indictment, Chauvin was accused of two counts connected to Floyd's death, including depriving Floyd of his right to be free from \"unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.\"Why Minneapolis voters rejected policing overhaul ballot measure prompted by George Floyd's murderThe indictment also charges Chauvin and former officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane with deprivation of rights under color of law for allegedly failing to give Floyd medical aid, the indictment states. Thao and Kueng are also accused of failing to intervene in Chauvin's use of unreasonable force, according to the federal indictment.In addition, the second indictment relates to a similar incident in September 2017 in which Chauvin knelt on a 14-year-old in Minneapolis. The indictment stated that Chauvin held the teenager by the throat, struck him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the neck and upper back of the teenager even after the teen was lying prone, handcuffed and unresisting.Thao, Kueng and Lane pleaded not guilty to the federal charges in September.They have also pleaded not guilty to state charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. That trial is currently set for March 2022.Correction: A previous version of this story gave the wrong amount of time that Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck and back. It was 9 minutes, 29 seconds.CNN's Evan Perez and Adrienne Broaddus contributed to this report.",

Nicole Loudermilk, who gave no other details. More information would be available Friday afternoon, Loudermilk said.Inglewood police had said a man was assaulted outside the stadium and later placed in a medically induced coma. At the time of the apparent assault, San Francisco was facing off against the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game at the stadium ahead of Super Bowl LVI. The assaulted man -- a resident of Oakland, California -- was rushed to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center by paramedics after they received a 911 call around 4 p.m. reporting an injured man in the parking lot, Inglewood police Lt. Geoffrey Meeks told CNN on Wednesday. Feds prepare 'extensive' Super Bowl security, no 'credible, specific' threats, coordinator says \"Based on (the paramedic's) initial medical assessment, they rushed that victim to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for emergency medical care,\" Meeks said, where he \"quickly underwent surgery.\"Read MorePolice obtained surveillance video of the assault, Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr. told reporters Thursday.  Video shows \"it was a very quick altercation,\" he said, but the video is blurry and individual faces cannot be distinguished. After the victim and another man wearing what is believed to be a Rams jersey shove one another, Butts said, the victim is struck by a punch in the face and falls backward to the ground, where paramedics later found him.Authorities have identified a vehicle that may be associated with the suspected attacker and are working to locate its owner, Butts said. Police were not initially made aware of the incident, Meeks said Wednesday, but were later called by hospital staff who reported that the victim had \"injuries consistent with someone who had been physically assaulted.\"Inglewood detectives were dispatched to the hospital but were unable to interview the victim as he had already been placed in a medically induced coma, Meeks said.

        "content": "Los Angeles (CNN)Federal agents and a Southern California sheriff's department engaged in \"highway robberies\" after seizing more than a million dollars in cash from vehicles transporting funds from marijuana dispensaries to financial institutions during a series of traffic stops last year, a new lawsuit claims. In the civil suit filed in federal district court, lawyers for Empyreal, a Pennsylvania-based company that transports money on behalf of institutions that include cannabis dispensaries, accuse the FBI and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department of scheming to illegally pull over company vehicles and seize money from its clients.  The lawsuit claims that Empyreal vehicles have been stopped by local law enforcement five times between Kansas and California since May 2021, twice resulting in the seizure of cash totaling more than a million dollars, which was then turned over to the FBI.  \"These repeated, ongoing stops, searches, and seizures are costly to Empyreal and extremely disruptive to its business. Empyreal has been forced to suspend business operations in the largest county in the United States, San Bernardino County, and has stopped driving through Kansas,\" the lawsuit says, adding the company has lost customers because of these incidents, and hasn't rolled out new services in multiple states because of similar concerns.Cannabis advocates to governors: Our businesses are 'essential'\"If these incidents continue to occur -- and there is every indication they will -- it will threaten Empyreal's business model and its ability to continue providing financial infrastructure for the state-legal medical cannabis industry by safely moving cash from business premises into the legal banking system for greater transparency.\"Read MoreThe company claims in its lawsuit that \"Empyreal and its clients operate in full compliance with applicable state cannabis laws and all applicable federal and state money laundering compliance requirements,\" yet it remains unclear what violations federal agents were asserting in order to allegedly seize money from the company. Speaking on behalf of the federal defendants in the suit, an FBI spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.  However, in a written response to the lawsuit filed in court, the Justice Department insisted Empyreal lacked legal standing in the lawsuit, as the company merely served as a transport service for money owned by the cannabis dispensaries.New York isn't the only state trying to legalize marijuanaIn response to an initial report on the lawsuit by the Los Angeles Times, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus tweeted a statement in which he said \"over 80% of marijuana at dispensaries was grown illegally,\" adding that \"illegal cultivation sites have created quality-of-life issues for many of our county's residents.\"Dicus stands by his deputies, saying, \"I am confident when these claims make it to court, they will collide with the facts.\"In an attempt to bolster its claim that the company vehicles were initially pulled over for dubious reasons, the lawsuit alleges \"not a single traffic citation was issued to an Empyreal driver during any of the traffic stops discussed in this complaint.\" The lawsuit further claims, \"Defendants know that Empyreal vehicles are transporting the cash proceeds of state-legal cannabis businesses and want to seize that money and forfeit it using civil forfeiture.\" Central to the lawsuit are traffic stops the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department allegedly made in November and December 2021.  In the November incident, Empyreal's lawyers claim, deputies covered up security cameras on the vehicle while executing the traffic stop, and seized \"approximately $700,000 in legal currency from one of Empyreal's vehicles, seized the vehicle itself, and seized the driver's business and personal cellphones,\" according to the complaint.The company said the cash being transported was \"entirely from state-licensed cannabis businesses in good standing, operating lawfully under California law,\" the complaint states.Analysis: Why Biden's marijuana stance is 10 years behind the curveIn a similar traffic stop in December, the company alleges in the complaint that deputies seized approximately $350,000 belonging to state-licensed cannabis businesses operating legally under California state law.  As part of the lawsuit, Empyreal sought a temporary restraining order allowing it to resume operations without fear of continued law enforcement intervention. That request was denied by Judge John W. Holcomb, who noted in his response that the company did not give sufficient notice to the government prior to filing the order.The showdown between Empyreal and federal authorities is only the latest example of the often legally convoluted system of federal versus state marijuana law enforcement.Although the US Justice Department prides itself on independently enforcing federal criminal law, attorneys general have also historically received guidance from new presidential administrations on what particular criminal justice issues should be prioritized by federal prosecutors. Thus far, President Joe Biden has not issued public guidance to the Justice Department on how potential conflicts between federal and state marijuana laws should be handled. As CNN previously reported, a spokesperson for then-candidate Biden in 2019 said he supported the decriminalization of marijuana, adding Biden \"would allow states to continue to make their own choices regarding legalization and would seek to make it easier to conduct research on marijuana's positive and negative health impacts by rescheduling it as a schedule 2 drug.\"CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.CNN's Arlette Saenz contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A 16-year-old was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder for selling a fentanyl-laced pill to a child who died of a drug overdose, California prosecutors said. The 12-year-old girl who ingested most of the pill was the youngest person to overdose and die in 2020 in Santa Clara County, the district attorney's office said in a news release. The child, who was not identified, bought and consumed a pill with a label consistent with the painkiller oxycodone. She was declared dead after she was rushed to a hospital. \"After thousands of deaths, everyone should know that fentanyl is a deadly poison,\" District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in the statement.The 12-year-old, along with two teens, contacted the suspect on November 14, 2020, and bought an \"M-30\" pill, according to statement from the district attorney's office.Read More\"The group videoed her lining up the crushed pill for ingestion,\" the statement said. Afterward, the girl passed out and began snoring, which is a sign of fentanyl overdose, the statement said.Fentanyl is a synthetic drug that can be up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, and it's commonly used to resemble prescription drugs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is often added to other drugs by dealers \"because of its extreme potency, which makes drugs cheaper, more powerful, more addictive, and more dangerous,\" the CDC said.Drug overdose deaths top 100,000 annually for the first time, driven by fentanyl, CDC data showOverall, opioids continue to be the driving cause of fatal drug overdoses in the United States.  Last year saw a record high of drug overdose deaths, with more than 100,000 people dying from April 2020 to April 2021, according to provisional data published in November by the CDC.It was a 28.5% spike compared to the same period a year earlier and nearly doubling over the past five years.Synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, also caused nearly two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths in the same 12-month timeframe period, according to the data. Prosecutors around the nation have signaled a greater willingness to bring the serious charge of murder against dealers who supply buyers with potent drugs that can easily kill.\"These dealers are essentially handing a loaded gun to unsuspecting victims knowing that they will probably die and they don't care,\" said Orange County California District Attorney Todd Spitzer late last year in announcing a more aggressive prosecution effort by his office.",

He added US officials are also working with their international counterparts in various countries to learn more about the suspect's background. The man who authorities say took the four hostages Saturday, died from multiple gunshot wounds, according to medical examiner records released Friday.Malik Faisal Akram's manner of death was ruled a homicide, a forensic classification which indicates a death was caused by another person. The time of death was 9:22 p.m. Saturday, Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office records show.2 men arrested in the UK as part of the investigation into the Texas synagogue standoff, police say Akram, a 44-year-old British national, held four people hostage at Congregation Beth Israel in an 11-hour standoff, the FBI said. An FBI team killed Akram after one hostage was released and three escaped from the synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth, officials said.Read MoreThe three hostages escaped at the same time hostage rescue agents approached the building in what DeSarno described as \"two near-simultaneous plans of action.\"He said he made the decision to send tactical agents in \"confidently\" on Saturday night, and felt he had \"good situational awareness\" because of the help authorities were receiving from inside the synagogue and the \"visibility into what was happening\" he got from the negotiation team.DeSarno said he authorized agents to attempt the rescue after negotiations with Akram took an unproductive turn, with him becoming less communicative, more combative and issuing ultimatums and deadlines to the FBI. As officials made their assessment, the hostages came to a similar conclusion, DeSarno said.After encountering the hostages running from one exit of the synagogue, the agents continued into the building, DeSarno said, adding \"Akram's death was a result of the deadly force employed by the FBI.\"The preliminary information released by the medical examiner indicated an autopsy report for Akram had not yet been finalized. The office has up to 90 days to complete its findings, a spokesperson for the office said. FBI treating this as hate crime and terrorismThe FBI is treating the standoff as \"both a hate crime and an act of terrorism,\" DeSarno said Friday, adding Akram committed a federal hate crime \"when he forcibly kidnapped four hostages while they exercised their right to worship.\" \"This was not some random occurrence. It was intentional. It was symbolic, and we're not going to tolerate anti-Semitism in this country,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday at a virtual event hosted by the Anti-Defamation League. \"We recognize that the Jewish community in particular has suffered violence and faces very real threats from, really, across the hate spectrum.\"Investigators believe Akram was motivated in part by a desire to see the release of convicted extremist Aafia Siddiqui, who is serving an 86-year federal prison sentence in Fort Worth, they've said. She was not involved in the Colleyville standoff, her attorney said.DeSarno said Friday he believes Congregation Beth Israel was targeted because it is the closest synagogue to where the suspect believed the convicted extremist was being housed.   When the suspect demanded the release of a convicted extremist, his actions \"clearly met the definition of terrorism,\" DeSarno said. UK counterterrorism investigators are helping US authorities look into the incident. Two men were arrested in the British cities of Birmingham and Manchester on Thursday morning as part of the investigation, and were held for questioning, Greater Manchester Police said without elaborating.Akram arrived in the United States in late December via New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.Akram had been known to UK security services and had been the subject of a brief investigation in 2020, a UK official told CNN on Tuesday. The investigation was closed when authorities determined Akram to no longer be a threat.The incident has put Jewish communities across the United States on edge. Attacks on Jewish people have been on the rise, the Anti-Defamation League warns. And while the majority of anti-Semitic incidents involve harassment and vandalism, assaults have also happened, with at least six turning deadly since 2016, including at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue in 2018.Akram didn't initially exhibit suspicious behavior, rabbi saysAkram took the hostages at Congregation Beth Israel on Saturday morning, when people had gathered to participate in a Sabbath service.Akram did not exhibit suspicious behavior when he first knocked on the door, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said Thursday at the ADL virtual event where Wray also spoke. What it was like inside the Colleyville, Texas, synagogue during the 11-hour hostage standoffCytron-Walker, who was one of four congregation members taken hostage, said Akram told him he had been out walking in the cold weather and inquired whether the synagogue had a night shelter. \"He looked like he was telling the truth,\" Cytron-Walker said. \"There were no initial red flags. So, we opened the door.\"Cytron-Walker has said he and three others were taken hostage at gunpoint after the rabbi started leading prayers. The first demand made by the suspect was to speak with a prominent rabbi in New York, Cytron-Walker said Thursday. The hostage-taker spoke with the New York rabbi, demanding that person's assistance in securing Siddiqui's release, two officials briefed on the investigation previously told CNN.Cytron-Walker said the hostage-taker targeted his congregation because he believed the anti-Semitic \"notion that Jews are more important in his mind than everyone else, and that America would do more to save Jews than it would for anyone else.\"And that's why he specifically targeted a synagogue,\" Cytron-Walker said Thursday.Akram \"said point-blank he chose the synagogue because 'Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks,'\" Jeffrey Cohen, one of the hostages and vice president of the synagogue's board of trustees, told CNN previously.In addition to crediting security training he received before the incident, Cytron-Walker told audience members at Thursday's ADL event establishing relationships with local law enforcement is key to handling a crisis. \"I was literally texting and emailing in small moments when I could with the Colleyville police chief, because I had his cell phone, because those relationships were there,\" he said.Cytron-Walker, one of the final three hostages remaining after one was released, has said he eventually threw a chair at Akram after telling the two others to run. The three hostages escaped; an FBI team moved in, and Akram was killed, authorities said.CNN's Rob Picheta, Leslie Perrot, Sharon Braithwaite, Amir Vera and Travis Caldwell contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Federal prosecutors have charged a Delaware man with carjacking Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania and using a firearm during a crime of violence, the Justice Department announced Thursday. Josiah Brown, 19, of Wilmington, Delaware, was arrested Wednesday by federal agents and Delaware State Police troopers. CNN is attempting to locate attorney information for Brown. Scanlon was physically unharmed during the incident.According to the federal criminal complaint, Brown and other unidentified accomplices were in Philadelphia on Wednesday. At least one of them saw and approached Scanlon, identified as \"M.S.\" in court records, pointed a gun at her and demanded her car keys, the complaint said. The group then drove to Delaware, where the vehicle was later located, and Brown was arrested. During an interview after his arrest, Brown \"provided a written apology to the victim, indicating that he was sorry for stealing the car and for pointing a gun at her,\" according to the criminal complaint.Read More\"My family car was stolen from me at gunpoint in broad daylight, in a busy public park. Obviously, it was a scary thing to have happen, but I'm extremely grateful that no one was hurt,\" Scanlon said Thursday during a news conference in her first known public comments since the incident. Authorities have not said whether Scanlon was targeted as a member of Congress, but an FBI official indicated that the victim was a \"total stranger\" to the suspects in the Justice Department statement. Court records do not indicate Brown is being charged with assaulting a federal official.\"The investigation into this incident is in its very initial stages, and we are continuing to investigate and evaluate charging decisions,\" said US Attorney Jennifer Arbittier Williams.Carjackings in Philadelphia have more than doubled in the last two years, Philadelphia Police Department chief inspector Frank Vanore said at a news conference Thursday. \"The increase is pretty profound,\" he said, adding that of the 700 cars that have been stolen this year, more than 500 were reportedly taken by gun-wielding carjackers.Brown appeared before a magistrate judge on Thursday, according to prosecutors, and remains in federal custody. Authorities also took four other suspects into custody in connection with the incident, who have been charged with receiving stolen property, Senior Cpl. Jason Hatchell of the Delaware State Police told CNN Wednesday night. Scanlon has served in the House since 2018. Her district includes part of Philadelphia and its suburbs. She sits on the House Judiciary Committee as well as the House Rules and Administration committees.Asked by CNN on Thursday if she plans to reach out to her Republican Senate colleagues to share her experience and ask for their support for long-languishing gun control legislation, Scanlon said, \"I'd be happy to do so.\"\"There's a lot that the American public broadly agree upon. And you know, maybe the Senate hasn't gotten the message yet,\" Scanlon said of gun control bills, some of which have already passed the House but do not have the 60 votes needed to pass in the Senate.This story has been updated with additional information Thursday.CNN's Claudia Dominguez, Paul LeBlanc, Kristin Wilson and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

A judge on Thursday signed the warrant which states that Baldwin, along with his attorney, were asked to turn over the phone, and the detective was told to \"acquire a warrant.\" Alec Baldwin: 'I would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger, never'Officials are looking to obtain messages, call logs, digital photos and videos, as well as any private messages sent on social media platforms in relation to the production of \"Rust,\" the warrant said. It also looks to obtain any deleted videos, photos and messages on the phone that have to do with the movie.Hutchins was fatally shot October 21 during a rehearsal for a scene in a church at Bonanza Creek Ranch. Director Joel Souza was also injured in the shooting.The scene was going to show Baldwin cocking the gun, and he and Hutchins were going over how she wanted to position his hand right before the gun went off, the actor told ABC's George Stephanopoulos this month.Read More\"And I cock the gun, I go, 'Can you see that? Can you see that? Can you see that?' And she says ... and then I let go of the hammer of the gun, and the gun goes off. I let go of the hammer of the gun, the gun goes off,\" Baldwin recalled.Baldwin was aiming the gun just off to the side of the camera, as Hutchins was instructing him to, in her direction, he said.\"I'm holding the gun where she told me to hold it, which ended up being aimed right below her armpit, was what I was told,\" Baldwin said.When asked why he pointed the gun at Hutchins and pulled the trigger when that wasn't in the script, Baldwin said, \"I would never point a gun at anyone and then pull the trigger. Never.\"Baldwin's civil attorney responded Thursday night.\"We are confident that the evidence will show that Mr. Baldwin is not responsible civilly or criminally for what occurred on October 21, and he continues to cooperate with authorities,\" Aaron Dyer said in a statement, as reported by ABC News. \"We proactively requested that the authorities obtain a warrant so that we could take steps to protect Mr. Baldwin's family and personal information that is clearly unrelated to the investigation.\"A phone contains a person's entire life, and personal information needs to be protected. While they evaluate the phone information, we hope that the authorities continue to focus on how the live rounds got on the set in the first place,\" Dyer added.CNN continues to reach out to Dyer.Armorer says she loaded gun with 6 dummy roundsHannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer on the set, told investigators she took the guns out the morning of October 21, the warrant said. Her coworker helped her with morning tasks, and after they retrieved the guns, they took them to set, Gutierrez Reed said. While on set, Gutierrez Reed \"dummied the guns up with dummy rounds,\" she told deputies.Gutierrez Reed and her coworker got to the set around 7:30 a.m. but didn't dummy the gun up until a short time before lunch, she told deputies.An aerial photo shows the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on October 23.Gutierrez Reed loaded the gun with five dummy rounds before lunch, she said. There was one round that wouldn't go in, so after lunch she took the cleaner, cleaned it out and put another round in, which means there were six dummy rounds in the gun, she said. \"We had the gun the whole time before that, and nothing happened, and I wasn't in there, and they weren't even supposed to be pulling the hammer back,\" Gutierrez Reed said, according to the warrant. After the shooting, Gutierrez Reed checked the gun cartridge and the first round she pulled out didn't have \"that,\" referring to the projectile end of a bullet, she told investigators. She checked the other rounds and they were all dummies, the warrant said. The box of dummies may have had some \"wonky\" rounds, she said.

        "content": "(CNN)A Minnesota state investigator outlined differences between Kim Potter's service weapon and a Taser on Monday, a distinction that is central to her case as jurors will decide whether the former police officer mistook her Taser for a gun when she fatally shot Daunte Wright. Video from the scene on April 11 shows that officers had pulled over Wright and moved to arrest him when he attempted to get back in his vehicle and flee. Potter pulled out her firearm and shot him -- later admitting she meant to use her Taser instead. \"I grabbed the wrong f*ing gun and I shot him,\" she said afterward.Potter is charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter for killing Wright, a 20-year-old Black man. Potter has pleaded not guilty and is expected to testify in her own defense.On Monday, Special agent Sam McGinnis of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension described the Taser and gun differences in appearance, weight and positioning on Potter's utility belt. McGinnis is a state investigative agent responsible for reviewing police shootings.Special agent Sam McGinnis of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension explains the differences between Kim Potter's service weapon and a Taser.Read More\"The Taser is yellow; the firearm is black,\" McGinnis said during questioning by the prosecution. \"The Taser has a stocky body to it compared to the Glock handgun. The grip of the Taser is shorter and wider than the Glock.\"McGinnis' analysis of the two weapons revealed marked differences in weight. Potter's Glock handgun weighed 2.11 pounds, McGinnis said, compared to her Taser that weighed less than a pound. McGinnis said this meant the Glock with the ammo weighed over twice as much as the taser.The state investigator also described differences in the ways the two weapons are fired. \"The Glock trigger is curved,\" McGinnis told the jury. \"The Taser trigger is flat with some serrations cut into it. The Taser has an external, I guess, 'on' (and) 'off' switch safety. The Glock does not.\"McGinnis also testified that he took photos of Potter after the shooting, which showed she kept her firearm and Taser on opposite sides of her body.A taser is shown on the left and a Glock to the right.\"Her firearm was on her dominant side, which you'd have to use your right hand to draw,\" he said, noting her holster had a snap retention system to keep the gun in its holster. The Taser, in contrast, was holstered on her left side, and required her to push a lever with her left hand to pull it from the holster. Prosecutors have argued Potter was negligent and acted recklessly in the fatal mixup. Her defense has characterized the killing as an accident but argued she was within her rights to use deadly force to protect another officer.Wright died from single gunshot wound to the chest, medical examiner saysPotter killed Wright by firing a single bullet to his chest, said Dr. Lorren Jackson, assistant medical examiner at the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office.Jackson said Monday the gunshot wound was the sole cause of death for Wright and his manner of death was homicide.\"Was this a survivable injury?\" the prosecutor asked Jackson. Kim Potter's former supervisor says she had the right to use deadly force against Daunte WrightNo, he responded. Survival times for such an injury would be just seconds to minutes, he told the jury.The bullet did not leave Wright's body, he said, but \"made a hole in the skin\" otherwise known as a partial exit wound. He said he could feel the bullet directly below the skin.Immediately after the shooting, Wright's car veered across traffic and crashed into an occupied vehicle.Wright had superficial, blunt force injuries to his face, including abrasions and lacerations to the lip, Jackson testified Monday. Yet he affirmed that the gunshot wound, which struck Wright's heart, was the sole cause of death.\"Far and away the gunshot wound to the chest was the most significant injury,\" he said.Daunte Wright's girlfriend tried to stop his bleeding with a belt as he gasped for air, she testified at ex-officer Kim Potter's manslaughter trialTwo other people were injured in the car crash after Wright was shot. Alayna Albrecht-Payton, who was in the passenger seat of Wright's car, testified last week she suffered lacerations to her face and lip as well as a broken jaw and concussion.In addition, Patricia Lundgren, 84, testified last week her 86-year-old husband was injured in the crash, and their daughter testified that her father's mental state had deteriorated since then. He is now in hospice care, the family said.In cross-examination of Jackson, the medical examiner indicated that Wright had a high level of THC in his system at the time of death consistent with marijuana use. Jackson said the use of marijuana had no bearing on Wright's cause of death.",

What happened next would end Wright's life, change Potter's forever and cast fresh doubt on the way some police officers in America are trained to handle stressful encounters.\"Oh, no!\" a fellow officer cries out.  Potter is then heard on tape saying, \"Holy sh*t! I just shot him.\"  Here's what we know about Kim Potter, the officer who fatally shot Daunte WrightWright, a Black motorist who was initially stopped by police for expired vehicle registration and later determined to have had an outstanding warrant, died shortly afterward from the round Potter fired from her semi-automatic service weapon.Read MoreLocal prosecutors have charged the veteran officer in Wright's death with first- and second-degree manslaughter. Her trial is set to begin in Minnesota on Wednesday. Potter has pleaded not guilty, and, if convicted, could face up to 15 years in prison.  Fatal 'accidental discharge'  \"The officer had the intention to deploy their Taser,\" the city's police chief said after the incident, \"but instead shot Mr. Wright with a single bullet\" in what the chief described as an \"accidental discharge.\"Daunte Wright's mother says 'justice isn't even a word to me' as ex-officer makes court appearance  The claim that the shooting was the result of Potter accidentally mixing up her service weapon with her department-issued stun gun appears to be corroborated on the police body camera footage released from the incident.Just prior to the shooting, Potter is heard telling Wright, \"I'll tase you,\" followed by \"Taser, Taser, Taser,\" before she fires her department-issued Glock 9mm handgun.The Potter case is not the only recent instance in which an officer has been accused of mistaking a gun for a Taser.In 2018, a Kansas officer said she meant to use a Taser on a man fighting with her partner but accidentally fired her gun instead. The suspect survived and the officer's criminal case was dismissed.In 2015, Eric Harris ran from Oklahoma police after an alleged gun sale when volunteer reserve deputy Robert Bates tried to use a Taser on him, but shot him dead. Bates received four years in prison for manslaughter. Different by designTo understand how an officer could possibly mistake a firearm for a Taser -- and for insight into how some police departments are trying to prevent similar incidents -- CNN went inside the Los Angeles Police Department's training academy.In a classroom decorated to resemble a city street, recruits and seasoned officers alike routinely take part in role-playing and computer simulations geared toward testing a student's judgment during stressful scenarios.LAPD Officer Allison Ashnault shows CNN's Josh Campbell the firing of a Taser.But even before officers face their first simulated suspect, they are provided with rigorous training on the mechanics of the Taser, how and when to deploy it, and where they are required to carry it on their uniform.\"My weapon is on my right side, my primary side,\" Officer Allison Ashnault, a senior instructor, says as she points to her service weapon at our demonstration. She is right-handed and thus carries her pistol on her right hip. \"It's part of our policy that we have to carry our Taser on the opposite side.\"Other key differences are purposefully part of the design of the new Taser model carried by LAPD officers.For example, a Glock service weapon -- with its metal barrel and ammunition -- is considerably larger and heavier than the plastic Taser. And while the pistol is jet black, the Taser, by contrast, is neon green.New Tasers carried by LAPD officers are made to look and feel different from service weapons.Ashnault explains that the inherent design of each weapon, as well as separating the location where each device is worn on an officer's body, are \"intended to prevent weapon confusion.\"In addition to an overview of the Taser, the LAPD provides recruits with intense instruction in the type of force allowed in a particular situation. When are LAPD officers permitted to deploy a Taser?  \"It's going to really be with somebody who is violent, that's posing an immediate threat to maybe ourselves or to another citizen,\" says Ashnault. Capt. Jon Pinto, commanding officer of the LAPD's training division, says that added component of the department's new Taser policy -- requiring the existence of a threat prior to use of stun guns -- is why the city witnessed a 63% reduction in the number of officer Taser deployments between 2017 and 2020.\"That is also what the community is asking from us,\" Pinto says. \"They're asking us to de-escalate. We're only going to use that Taser when a suspect's actions are violent.\"LAPD Capt. Jon Pinto tells CNN's Josh Campbell officers are trained to use \"the least amount of force as possible.\"Preservation of life  With opening statements in Potter's manslaughter trial set to begin Wednesday, one key question will be whether the jury finds that the charged cop is criminally liable even in an accidental shooting.Defense attorney Paul Engh said during jury selection that Potter will testify. And in a filing last month, Potter's attorneys said they might assert that her gun use was an innocent mistake, and that the use of the Taser was reasonable. But law enforcement experts have raised serious questions about her intent to use a Taser in the first place against Wright, who was behind the wheel of a vehicle when the shooting occurred.\"If it does work, his body locks up. I don't know how that helps,\" said Sean Hendrickson, who teaches use of force in Washington state. \"If you look at video and how close, she's right inside the open door, at the edge, and those probes won't spread far enough to achieve neuromuscular incapacitation and that's the goal. If you achieved it, he'd be locked up in that seat. It's hard to manipulate him. It's confusing, tactically, what the end goal was with the Taser.\"While LAPD officials would not comment on the pending trial in Minnesota, Pinto said the department continually instructs its recruits on the importance of preserving life.\"Even if it's a suspect, we want to use the least amount of force as possible,\" he said. \"We want to make sure that we give them every opportunity, if it's practically safe, to not use lethal force, less lethal force or any force at all. There are times that we are able to do that, and there are times, obviously, depending on the circumstance, that the suspect's actions dictate us to use some force to get them into custody.\"CNN's Peter Nickeas contributed to this report.",

But, like a grim deja vu, hospital beds are filled with Covid-19 patients again, most unvaccinated. This time, those numbers are compounded by more non-Covid-19 patients, who doctors say may have been delaying their surgeries and treatments or staying at home during earlier surges.New York state sees record daily high of new Covid-19 casesIn this hospital, and hospitals across the country, staff numbers are down because of resignations, widespread burnout after more than a year of battling the virus on the front line and, in some cases, a fear of contracting the illness. To help supplement hospital staffing, the Department of Defense sent nearly two dozen US Army members to help fill in the holes and care for the roughly 500 patients the facility is treating these days. Throughout the pandemic, the military has dispatched members to assist with coronavirus response in hospitals in states like New York, Texas, and Louisiana that were stretched thin after an influx of patients. Read MoreAbout 130 of the Dearborn hospital's patients have been diagnosed with Covid, said David Claeys, president of Beaumont, Dearborn and Farmington Hills hospitals. Across the Beaumont Hospital system, there are nearly 600 Covid-19 patients.Staff members say they really need the help.\"Our (emergency rooms) have never been fuller, our (intensive care units) have never been fuller,\" Shamoon said. \"The Department of Defense coming has really been a breath of fresh air.\"Zafar Shamoon\nHospitals across the US face a triple whammy: Staff shortages, an influx of non-Covid-19 patients and dangerous variants of the virus taking off again.  Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine this week deployed more than 1,000 National Guard members to hospitals across the state. In Oregon, officials warned that a surge fueled by the new Omicron variant could overwhelm hospitals and surpass patient numbers that the Delta surge created earlier this year. California health officials said Friday they were seeing hospitalization numbers begin to trend upward, stressing the need for vaccinations and booster vaccines. In New York, officials said this week they're seeing the highest hospitalization rate they've recorded in months, with Gov. Kathy Hochul noting that the staff shortages will weigh into potential new restrictions. \"Sometimes I go home and I'm wondering how my staff will deal with this the next day, but we do it,\" said Shamoon. \"There's so many heroic, untold stories that happen in the walls of this hospital on a daily basis, too many to count actually. That's what brings me back.\"Unvaccinated patients wish they'd gotten the shotIn Michigan, health officials said Friday the state's hospitals are \"overburdened\" with Covid-19 patients, most of whom are not vaccinated. Lt. Col. Theresa Nowak, an Army Nurse Corps Officer, said the team's mission is to embed into hospital departments that need help so that patients can get the care they need and be discharged quicker. Michigan sets hospitalization record, leads nation in new coronavirus cases per capitaAcross the Beaumont system, of the 583 patients being treated for the virus, 443 had not received their shots, and of the 74 in an ICU, 55 were unvaccinated, according to data from the hospital system. \"Our patients that are not vaccinated, that are at the hospital for the most part will tell you, 'I wish now that I was vaccinated. This isn't worth it,' \" said Lissa Maddox, who has been a registered nurse for nearly two years. \"Our patients are sick, they're very sick and 100% of them will tell you that they wish they would have gotten the vaccine.\"It's disheartening,\" Maddox added, \"But, you know, everybody has a choice.\"Sara Pristavu, a 25-year-old Covid-19 patient in the hospital who did not share her vaccination status with CNN, said she was thankful for the staff. Getting the vaccine, Pristavu told CNN, should be a personal choice but urged Americans to be cautious of the virus. Sara Pristavu\"To each their own,\" she said. \"Whatever you feel is right, that's what you feel and if you decide to do it, great. If you decide that's not for you, great.\"Pristavu said her father, who is in his 60s, is in the same hospital with the virus.'Round after round'Across the country, roughly 68,900 Americans are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. More than 20% of all ICU beds in use are occupied with Covid-19 patients, the data shows.'Like drinking from a fire hose': Health care workers traumatized by pandemicAfter several surges of the virus across the country, and now more than 800,000 Americans dead, many in the healthcare profession retired. Others, severely burned out and traumatized, left.\"In the beginning, we had the help. And after we were going round after round of Covid we began to lose more and more staff,\" said Crystal Kopriva, an assistant clinical manager at the hospital's current Covid Unit.The military personnel that have been working within the hospital for roughly two weeks include critical care nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists and a command and control team. Lt. Colonel Don Dendy told CNN that before being stationed in this facility, he was helping in a hospital in Mississippi. \"Before Covid, in the army, I never really saw missions like this, where we went out and filled in in hospitals in the states,\" he said. Crystal KoprivaBut Dendy added he's glad that the military can help because he understands the strain faced by healthcare workers, who in pre-pandemic times were already confronted with staff shortages, are now facing. \"People are just like, I can't do this many shifts and keep working overtime,\" Dendy said.The hospital healthcare workers said all they can do is treat patients as best as they can and continue to encourage vaccinations. \"Will I break in three months? will I break in a year? will I break in 10? I don't have that answer for you right now,\" Maddox said. \"I'm battling this with my patients and I don't see a stop anytime soon.\"",

An honors student, he was already planning to apply to Rutgers University in his home state of New Jersey. But that was before the pandemic.When students were sent home and everyone switched to virtual learning, he tried to make do as best as he could.\"I did my schoolwork on my phone for two or three months,\" he told CNN.\"That was horrible -- having to navigate from Google Classroom to the Google documents back to Google Classroom.\" He would display documents on his TV screen to see them before going back to tapping on his phone.Echevarria's work suffered. \"My grades went down tremendously, all across the board,\" he said.Read MoreRising high school senior Lewis Echevarria says virtual learning got much better over the months, but nothing compares to being in the classroom.His school district in Camden got him a laptop for his junior year, but he struggled with motivation.\"I didn't think I was going to be able to pass this year because my grades went down. It was hard for me to focus. It was hard for me to even want to get up from my bed, just to go sit in front of a computer,\" he said.\"There were many times where I felt like calling quits on education.\"Echevarria's problems were recognized by his teachers at the Creative Arts Morgan Village Academy, who reached out to get him back on track.But he is far from alone, and many students may not be able to bounce back so strongly.Katrina McCombs, superintendent of the Camden City Schools District, rues that the local dynamic of graduations versus dropouts had been going in the right direction before last year. Now, the disruption of the pandemic can start to be measured.\"Just like the rest of the students across the state of New Jersey, we're looking at about a 30 percentage point drop in performance, focused on mastering standards,\" she said.\"And we know it's important for students to master skills in their grade levels, as they're matriculating up, to set them up to be able to successfully graduate later.\"The district plans to use extra funding from the federal rescue plan as well as the state to have more teachers spending time with students who need the help.Baltimore City Schools won't hold back students with failing grades\"The key is teamwork,\" said Nicole Harrigan, principal of the K-8 H.B. Wilson Family School, also in Camden. \"It has to be the students, the parents, the administration, the teachers, all of us working together to do this work, to get them where they need to be. As long as we all work together, it's possible to help them. Now they may not be where they should be, but they can get closer to where they need to be.\"Schools in Camden, one of the poorer areas of New Jersey, were closed for more than a year while in other parts of the country classes got back sooner. And that could impact students.\"What we anticipate is the longer students have been out, the longer they've been faced with virtual instruction, the more severe the impact is likely to be,\" said Sandy Addis, Chairman of the National Dropout Prevention Center.\"The long-term impact of this pandemic shutdown is going to be much more than one year. Students across all grade levels have experienced learning loss. And it's not just the learning loss for this current year. Many of them have lost ground developmentally, particularly younger kids,\" he warned.How will school closures affect children in the long run? Wars, disease and natural disasters offer cluesWhile the academic loss may show up in grades, Addis said solutions were not as simple as teaching our way out of the problems. Children have also lost emotional and social skills and, for some, school may have been the best and safest part of their day. Losing that will have taken a toll.Addis stressed it was important to keep children with the rest of their peers rather than retaining them to repeat a grade, calling retention the \"kiss of death for graduation.\"Students who are a year older than the rest of their classmates feel out of place, and are at far more risk of dropping out in higher grades, he said. And that could keep the impact of the pandemic affecting children years after they have returned to the classroom.Echevarria, the New Jersey teen, is again looking at graduating on time as part of his high school's Class of 2022. He says he's now more confident having got past the challenges of virtual learning.But he wants his senior year to be in the classroom and sounds almost wistful about the school building he's been out of since March 2020.\"Walking through those hallways sets your mind that you're in school, you're here to learn,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)The American clean energy industry is primed for a boom. The only question is whether Washington can help juice the transition.In both red and blue states, the revolution has already begun. But even as private industry invests in the future, the speed and scale of its efforts is in the hands of Congress, where Republicans and centrist Democrats are locked in negotiations with the Biden administration over President Joe Biden's ambitious infrastructure plan.The uncertainly can be frustrating for some on the front lines, but there is still hope -- and a recognition that even talk of action on Capitol Hill has been a boon to clean energy businesses, with potential partners and customers all eager to get a piece of the new federal investment.RELATED: Biden wants millions of clean-energy jobs. Can it happen?Plans to harness and transport solar and wind energy are multiplying in the Midwest despite a regulatory backup, including one new, high-profile project seeking to connect a line from Mason City, Iowa, to the Chicago area. And in West Virginia, an electric vehicle company has been inundated with inquiries from both ordinary US commuters seeking cheaper alternatives and foreign governments looking to grow fleets of lean, clean motor bikes.Read More\"The future is now, and now is the time to build out a national electric grid that can deliver clean energy to the cities and towns that need it,\" Direct Connect CEO Trey Ward told CNN. \"It will be the largest infrastructure project of our lifetime and it will be good for our children.\"Direct Connect is planning to break ground in the next year or so on a high-voltage direct current transmission line that will bring wind and solar energy across the Upper Midwest. The $2.5 billion \"SOO Green\" project has succeeded thus far where others have failed for two key reasons: It will run underground -- meaning no eyesore overhead wiring -- and it will be placed along the preexisting Canadian Pacific Railway, largely sidestepping eminent domain disputes with landowners.As part of the package put forward in his American Jobs Plan, Biden called on Congress to dedicate $100 billion to beefing up the country's electric power grid. The administration believes it can supercharge the process by offering tax credits to prospective builders, making clean energy projects even more appealing to private industry. In many cases, companies have already begun to pivot from fossil fuels toward green projects.  'Let us choose it'Brian Meyer grows corn and soybeans in Monona, Iowa, on a massive plot of farmland his father began working nearly seven decades ago. Meyer supports the construction of the SOO Green line, which will run under parts of his land. But his message to Washington, when it comes to the Biden administration's climate and infrastructure agenda, is one of caution.Farmer Brian Meyer looks over his 2000 acres in Monona, Iowa where he grows corn and soy beans.  SOO Green is paying him to bury transmission lines along a rail line on is property that will bring renewable energy to Chicago. \"I'd say slow down. Take it easy; take it one step at a time,\" Meyer said. \"From the speed on his approach ... to all this -- electric cars and electric trucks. There's gonna be a lot of bumps in the road to make that happen.  Just slow down; don't shove it down our throat. Let us choose it.\" Biden's clean energy planPresident Biden wants millions of clean-energy related jobs. Can it happen?Here's how Biden's zero-carbon revolution would broaden the energy mapBiden's climate push promises 'jobs, jobs, jobs.' Here's what that might look likeThe White House wants to hire workers to clean up the relics of the nation's fossil fuels past. This is how Biden's plan could create a jobs boom  Agreeing to permit construction of a piece of the SOO Green line, Meyer added, offered that kind of choice -- and allowed him to overcome the skepticism he still harbors about Biden's proposal.\"I believe in progress,\" he said. \"I believe in making things better.\"Ward, too, was hesitant to tie the potential of the project -- which he said would create more than 2,000 union jobs in addition to some 4,000 more upstream with the building of feeder wind and solar farms -- to any federal legislation, though companies like his would benefit from the tax credits in Biden's plan. The SOO Green transmission line was in the works before the President took office and Democrats took control of the Senate this year, and its construction timeline could outlast the current administration. But he echoed Biden's message on the intersection of clean energy and the economy.\"Large infrastructure projects like this have economic benefits that ripple throughout the economy,\" Ward said. \"It's good for landowners. It's good for farmers. It's good for the environment and it creates jobs. And it also gets low-cost renewable energy to the cities and towns that need it.\"JUST WATCHEDThese were Biden's campaign promises on the climate crisisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThese were Biden's campaign promises on the climate crisis 01:34 The political fault lines that are stalling negotiations in Washington are blurrier in Iowa, even among conservative elected officials in the state. Republican state Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, an avowed conservative and \"staunch supporter\" of former President Donald Trump, said he's \"fully onboard\" with the SOO Green plan, in large part because of its approach --  which has been more sensitive than past efforts to locals' land rights.  But Kaufmann also described the project, simply, as good business. \"I see it as a long-term market,\" he said. \"As a farmer, we look for markets for our corn, for our soybeans, for our meat. And this is just a market to be able to ship energy that we're creating here in Iowa through the wind, out to customers over in the East Coast and on beyond.\"Iowa State Representative Bobby Kaufmann, a conservative Republican and also a farmer, supports the SOO Green project because the transmission lines will be buried underground. Asked whether his bullishness extended to the legislation being proposed by the Biden administration, Kaufmann said he would wait and see how the process unfolded -- and whether Republicans were, to his mind, sufficiently brought in on any deal. \"Both parties have green infrastructure support systems that could be in a final bill, so I'm not going to sit here and say that I am completely for the Republican plan or opposed to the Biden plan,\" Kaufmann told CNN. \"I just think that the best plan is what we do here in Iowa, which is when everybody has some input and everybody gets on board.\" 'That's where the sales are'Often to the frustration of more liberal lawmakers in his own party, Biden has sought to forge a bipartisan compromise with Republicans in the Senate. But that outreach has not yet yielded much movement from the GOP bloc that is, at a minimum, willing to talk. One round of talks broke down on Tuesday; another began shortly thereafter.There is significant and well-founded skepticism among Democrats of all stripes over whether the administration can find the 10 Republicans it needs to avert a filibuster and pass even a stripped-down version of Biden's initial offering. Why West Virginia is central to Biden's climate crisis plans Meanwhile, leftist lawmakers in the House are beginning to hint that a compromise that shrinks the package too much would be a nonstarter -- a state of play that leaves the administration a very narrow, closing window of opportunity.In West Virginia, home to Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who has insisted the end product have bipartisan support, there is among some clean energy-reliant business owners a similar mix of excitement over the possibility of a leg up from Washington and doubt over the scope of the Democratic agenda.Darus Zehrbach, president of Z Electric Vehicle, said some of the discussion around the infrastructure bill suggests a disconnect from where he and others in his industry see an opportunity to grow the market. \"If the fleets in the United States government and state governments shifted to electric you'd see a major rush to be buying the electrics,\" Zehrbach said. \"Don't sharpen the stick; get a bigger carrot.\"Darus Zehrbach is a small business owner in Westover, West Virginia.  His company, ZEV, builds electric motorcycles and other small vehicles.One-off sales, Zehrbach argued, were a trickier proposition for the government than seeking out municipalities or businesses that might be looking to buy clean energy vehicles in bulk, in part because they cost less to fuel and maintain. Talk of installing charging stations at gas stations, he added, ignores that even for individuals who use electric vehicles, the more common practice is to charge them at home for regular travel, like commuting to work, over short distances. (The Biden administration has acknowledged this, but argued in an April statement that \"public charging infrastructure will provide a key role for people without off-street parking and for longer trips.\")But like with so much else in American politics now, the challenges facing proponents of bold new clean infrastructure legislation are as much about complicated realities as head-spinning distortions. Zehrbach described some of the critical \"talk that's out there\" in Morgantown, where his business is based, as focusing on threats -- all false -- of coming government seizures of old vehicles and artificial increases to gasolines prices.ZEV - Z Electric Vehicle -  builds electric motorcycles and small vehicles in this garage in Westover, West Virginia. So what is the right way for the administration to sell the plan, with that kind of misinformation hanging in the air?\"If you talk about phasing in to electric and the fact that they are, at least, looking at it and trying to figure out how to do it -- I think that's the big positive,\" Zehrbach said. But, he added: \"Until I see an actual bill, I don't know.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Ma'Khia Bryant and two other young women argued over a messy house and unmade bed before a fight that ended with the fatal police shooting shooting of the Black teenager, the woman who cared for Ma'Khia in foster care said Thursday. Angela Moore said two of her former foster children had come to her Columbus, Ohio, home Tuesday to celebrate her birthday when the young women and Ma'Khia bickered over housekeeping.\"It was over keeping the house clean,\" Moore said. \"The older one told them to clean up the house because 'Mom doesn't like the house dirty,'\" Moore recalled being told after she arrived home from work. \"So that's how it all started.\" Officials in Columbus have released body camera video of Tuesday's shooting -- during which Ma'Khia lunges at another young woman with a knife outside the house -- and urged residents to await the facts in the investigation. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Read MoreMa'Khia Bryant enjoyed music and cooking, her mother said.Moore relayed for CNN the story she said she was told by one of the girls in the house at the time.\"You're not the guardian of me,\" Bryant replied, according to the story Moore said she was told.\"They argue all the time,\" Moore recalled, \"but I never thought it would escalate like that.\"    Moore said she received a frantic call from one of the former foster children, who is seen in police body camera footage wearing pink and recoiling as Ma'Khia lunges at her with a shimmering knife.\"Mom, get home. Where are you? They're going crazy,\" Moore said the young woman told her. \"She said they shot Ma'Kiah and I said, 'Huh?' It was just crazy.\"Moore said she started praying. Soon she started getting text messages from people saying, \"I'm sorry.\" When she got home, a police officer told her Ma'Khia had died.  \"I never in my worst nightmare would have thought it would ever come to this,\" she said.Outside Moore's home on Legion Lane, votive candles stretched onto the sidewalk Thursday. Balloons and flowers draped the side of a tree. Mourners paid their respects to Ma'Kiah, who, according to Moore, had been living at the house for only a couple of months.   \"She was fun,\" Moore said of her young charge. \"She liked to dance. She did chores around the house.\"Ma'Khia's mother says 'beautiful baby' has been 'taken from me' Ma'Khia's cousins remembered her as \"a good student, a good person\" whose life was unnecessarily cut short by \"disproportionate and unjustified use of force.\" \"As a family we are all saddened by the tragic and unnecessary death of Ma'Khia,\" cousins Don Bryant and Deja Torrence said in a public appeal for justice. \"She was loved by many. ... We want to remind everyone Ma'Khia was only a 16 year old teenage girl.\"Ma'Khia's mother, Paula, in an interview Thursday said her \"beautiful baby\" has been \"taken from me.\"\"I love God and I'm just going to put it in God's hands right now,\" Bryant said when asked about accountability for her daughter's death at the hands of police. \"That's all I know how to do.\"Bryant recalled a loving, funny and humble child who enjoyed music, cooking and seeing others laugh. She had recently made honor roll in high school, her mother told CNN on Thursday, and Ma'Khia's TikTok videos on makeup and styling hair were widely shared.  \"I want the world to know that Ma'Khia was beautiful,\" Bryant said.\"She had a sweet little voice. Oh my gosh, she was just so talented. She was ... on the path to going many places, definitely.\"The shooting occurred Tuesday afternoon, about 30 minutes before a guilty verdict was delivered in the killing of George Floyd. A jury found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges against him.   LeBron James deleted a tweet about Ma'Khia Bryant's killing but repeats call for accountability\"As we breathed a collective sigh of relief today, a community in Columbus felt the sting of another police shooting,\" Floyd family attorney Ben Crump tweeted.The Columbus Board of Education, in a statement, lamented the deaths of Ma'Khia and Tre Von Dickson, a public school student killed by gun violence on Tuesday. \"While the outcome of the Derek Chauvin trial is now one demonstration that the 'system' can be held accountable, it certainly does not demonstrate that the system has been corrected or that there is true justice,\" board members said in a statement.Ma'Khia enrolled at Independence High School in February. Franklin County Children's Services said she was a foster child in the county's care.\"We are tired of hearing about our students who are losing their lives because of community violence and these tragedies that seem like they're never ending,\" Columbus City Schools Superintendent Talisa Dixon said. Officer who fired fatal shots identifiedCity and police officials almost immediately released video footage of the controversial shooting at a time when police use of force is under national scrutiny. In February, former Columbus police officer Adam Coy was indicted on charges related to the fatal shooting of  Andre Hill, a 47-year-old Black man. Police body camera video shows Ma'Khia Bryant charging a young woman with a knife Tuesday before she was shot.\"We don't yet have all of the facts but we do know that a 16-year-old girl, a child of this community, tragically died last night,\" Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther told reporters on Wednesday.\"Bottom line: Did Ma'Khia Bryant need to die yesterday?\" he added. \"How did we get here? This is a failure on the part of our community. Some are guilty but all of us are responsible.\"Ginther said state investigators will determine \"if the officer involved was wrong, and if he was we will hold him accountable.\"Police identified the officer who fired the shots as Nicholas Reardon, who was hired in December 2019. The officer is off street duty pending an investigation. Reardon served in the Ohio National Guard since August 2015, according to records. He is a staff sergeant assigned to the 121st Security Forces Squadron, Ohio Air National Guard, which is part of the 121st Air Refueling Wing.Ma'Khia enrolled at Independence High School in February.Police attempt to revive teen after shooting In a series of clips from police body camera video, Ma'Khia is seen holding a knife during a tussle with a young woman. An officer arrived at the scene and opened fire when the girl appeared to attempt to stab a second young woman.  \"She's a ---- kid,\" a man at the scene tells the officer after four shots were fired. \"Damn, are you stupid?\"Ohio's Republican governor announces police reform billMa'Khia fell to the ground, the knife by her side. \"She came at her with a knife,\" the officer who fired his weapon is heard saying. The situation unfolded rapidly, according to clips from the body cameras of three officers on the street. Ma'Khia was holding a knife in her right hand and charged the young woman dressed in pink -- who turned to her side as the teen appeared to attempt to stab her. That's when the shots were fired.Officers attempted lifesaving measures \"almost immediately,\" said interim Police Chief Michael Woods, who said the first medic was on scene in six minutes.In the video, one officer asked, \"Where is she hit?\" The officer started lifesaving measures. \"Stay with us,\" he told the girl and asked bystanders her name. \"Stay with us, Ma'Khia,\" he implored.Bureau of Criminal Investigation looking into shootingOfficials urged the community to wait for all the facts to come out.  If an officer is \"faced with someone employing deadly force, deadly force can be the response,\" Woods told reporters.   Ginther said the Bureau of Criminal Investigation will look into the actions of the officer. \"I understand the outrage and the emotion about this incident,\" Department of Public Safety Ned Pettus Jr. said at a news conference. \"The video shows there is more to this. It requires us to pause.\"Ohio officials release more bodycam video of fatal police shooting of Black teen and urge community to await the factsA pair of CNN law enforcement analysts defended the officer's use of force as reasonable.\"(If) you don't shoot, the one young lady -- she stabs the other one and she dies,\" Charles Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner, said of the officer's actions. \"But he had no other alternative, in my mind, other than to take some action because of what was going on. The young lady who was shot was clearly the aggressor in this case.\"Anthony Barksdale, a former Baltimore City deputy police commissioner, told CNN the officer used lethal force when another person \"was in clear and imminent danger of being stabbed.\"\"The officer used his service weapon to stop the threat,\" he said. \"This unfortunate tragic incident was justified from a policing perspective. ... I am saying that, per training, the officer did his job and we need to start looking at each incident as its own incident.\"Head of police union offers condolencesThe president of the police union offered condolences to Ma'Khia's family.\"It's traumatic on everyone and we understand that,\" Keith Ferrell, president of the Capitol City Lodge number 9, said in a video, according to CNN affiliate WSYX.Black officers say Columbus, Ohio, police prejudice isn't limited to civilians: They're battling it, too\"We have all seen the videos that have been released by the city now in the act of full transparency and we support that.\"Black children are 6 times more likely to be shot to death by police, study findsFerrell added, \"What we've seen in a lot of circumstances and heard from the call, the 911 calls, we can see what we think has unfolded. But there is more to look at. There will be an independent investigation done that will get those answers. But we can speak on what we know now that has been released by the City of Columbus. We can certainly see that lives were at stake.\"Ferrell said officers must make split-second decisions to save lives. \"We have a duty to protect the public and ourselves, certainly, the public,\" he said. \"These are the kind of decisions officers are forced to make every day, and with this transparency, the public can see that. As unfortunate as it is, we do not know potentially how many lives could have been lost in addition or people seriously injured.\"Republican Gov. Mike DeWine called Ma'Khia's death a \"horrible, horrible tragedy\" and praised Ginther for releasing videos of the incident.  \"We should have enough compassion to worry about every child who is shot in our cities,\" DeWine said at a briefing. \"And we should not accept it.\"CNN's Francesca Hoffman, Evan Simko-Bednarski, Amir Vera, Artemis Moshtaghian, Anna Sturla, Rob Frehse, Elizabeth Joseph, Kristina Sgueglia, Melissa Alonso, Madeline Holcombe and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)USA Gymnastics is proposing a $425 million settlement with sexual abuse victims as part of a reorganization plan submitted jointly with a court-appointed Committee of Sexual Abuse survivors amid bankruptcy proceedings. USAG filed for bankruptcy in 2018 as the organization struggled to recover from the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal. The plan filed Tuesday in US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana details the suggested amount of money to be paid by insurers for USAG and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee as well as by the insurer for former owners of the Karolyi Ranch.Read More Marta and Bela Karolyi ran the now-closed gymnastic training location in Texas, one location where authorities say Nassar assaulted his young victims as they would train for major competitions including the Olympics. The Karolyis have not been criminally charged. Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics physician, was sentenced in January to 40 to 175 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual misconduct and is in a federal prison, not eligible for release until 2069.Larry Nassar sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for decades of sexual abuseInsurers will have to accept this settlement for it to go forward as a full settlement. Once agreed upon, a trust would be formed for the settlement money, according to court paperwork. Victims who do not join the settlement have the option to pursue litigation on their own, the document stipulates. Objections to the settlement are due by September 29. The next hearing is on October 4.  CNN has reached out to USAG and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee for comment. CNN has also reached out to a lawyer who represents hundreds of Nassar victims. Any settlement agreement is not an admission of liability by USAG, USOPC or the Karolyis, the document states.",

        "content": "(CNN)Newly released video obtained by CNN shows correctional officers allegedly abusing inmates at a soon-to-be shuttered women's correctional facility in New Jersey.The edited footage shows correctional officers extracting inmates from their cells, physically restraining inmates, punching inmates, and deploying pepper spray into cells with closed doors. The footage was first made public through open records requests made by the Associated Press and other parties. Gov. Phil Murphy announced in June that he was closing the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women (EMCF), which was New Jersey's only women's prison, after an independent report he commissioned detailed the allegations of abuse against inmates.\"I've just made a decision. Enough. We're turning the page,\" Murphy said on June 7. \"This is a multi-year process. You just can't flip a light switch. I think New York City is in the middle of an eight-year process on Rikers Island. Please God, we get this done a lot faster than that.\"Corrections officers at EMCF were accused in the report of abusing inmates on the night of January 11 when inmates were removed from cells after they allegedly \"splashed\" corrections officers with bodily fluids and other unidentified fluids. The governor said in light of the report's findings, the \"only path forward is to responsibly close the facility.\" Read MoreThe New Jersey Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the newly released footage Monday. In June, a spokesperson told CNN that the department took the allegations seriously.\"From first learning of the January 11 incident at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women, the Department took swift action to suspend 34 staff members and immediately sought the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General and the Prosecutor's Office to investigate the conduct for potential criminal prosecution,\" DOC spokeswoman Liz Velez told CNN last month.What the video showsIn a 95-minute edited video obtained by CNN, multiple officers in riot gear are seen walking into the cell of a woman, whose face is blurred. They spray her with pepper spray and one begins punching her and yelling at her as she appears to try to cover her head and face.The video appears to be from a body-worn camera and security cameras.The woman is coughing during the encounter and yelling. She can be heard at one point saying, \"Are you done punching me in my face like this?\" and \"You like this?\"Five officers are seen pulling her from her cell into a hallway filled with other officers, and one officer is heard saying, \"You're going to walk like a normal human being, you understand?\"They take her to a medical area where she tells a woman who is not visible, \"They busted my lip. They punched me in my face. They punched me in my chest. They punched me for no reason. I don't know why I was just assaulted. I was sleeping; they ... came in my room and assaulted me.\"The video also shows other inmates being pepper-sprayed and punched before being taken from their cells. One inmate's arm was broken, the report said.Officers charged in incidentSeveral correctional officers are accused of submitting false reports about what happened that night, including one who said the victim was throwing punches toward his torso, a claim that's not supported by video evidence at the scene, according to the attorney general's office.In all, 10 correctional officers are facing various charges ranging from records tampering and official misconduct to aggravated assault, State Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal announced last month. He said at the time that one inmate was punched about 28 times and another was punched while she was in handcuffs.The incident is just one of many reported at the facility. Last April, the Department of Justice wrote in a notice after a two-year investigation that there is \"reasonable cause to believe\" that conditions at EMCF violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" due to \"the sexual abuse of prisoners by the facility's staff\" and that \"these violations are pursuant to a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights protected by the Eighth Amendment.\"The DOJ wrote that the facility \"fails to protect victims who report excuse abuse from retaliation,\" subjects those who do report sexual abuse to \"hard and isolating conditions,\" and that officials at the facility knew about the abuse and disregarded it, among other findings.Earlier this year, a transgender woman was placed in a men's prison after filing a lawsuit alleging abuse at the facility. She has been moved to an out-of-state women's facility, according to her lawyer.The woman had filed a lawsuit in March, alleging she was one of several inmates attacked by corrections officers at the facility earlier this year, including the January 11 incident.The early January incident triggered a joint investigation by the Attorney General's Office of Public Integrity and Accountability and the Hunterdon County Prosecutor's Office, according to the attorney general's office. Murphy said he was \"sickened by the horrific reports,\" and he ordered a full independent investigation by the state's former comptroller.",

        "content": "(CNN)\"I can't breathe,\" George Floyd said to Minneapolis Police officers on Memorial Day while in custody, with an officer's knee pressing on his neck. Minutes later the 46-year-old Black man was unresponsive, pronounced dead later that afternoon. Video of the incident then went viral.Five years earlier and over a thousand miles away in Baltimore, Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, uttered those same words, \"I can't breathe,\" while in police custody, according to trial testimony. Gray died from his injuries one week later.Many legal experts, including the Hennepin County attorney who prosecutes cases in Minneapolis, drew the comparison between the Gray case and the Floyd case. At the most basic level, in both cases, a Black man was arrested for a minor offense and became unresponsive while in custody. Their encounters both turned out to be fatal. Freddie Gray and George Floyd had fatal encounters with police about five years apart.Protesters demanding justice filled streets across the country for days, and within ten days of their deaths the officers involved were arrested.The Gray case turned out to be a failed prosecution: None of the six Baltimore officers arrested were convicted.Read MoreThe trial for the four now former Minneapolis police officers, Derek Chauvin, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng, is scheduled for March 8, 2021. While none of the officers have entered formal pleas, Lane's attorney has entered a motion to dismiss the case against his client and Kueng's attorney says his client intends to plead not guilty.As discovery will now begin with legal motions filed and responded to from both sides, CNN asked two attorneys who have already walked this road in Baltimore and other legal experts to offer lessons learned and words of caution.  'That power of justice is what everyone is screaming for'In May 2015 Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced criminal charges would be filed against Baltimore police officers in the death of Freddie Gray.On April 12, 2015, Gray was arrested for illegal possession of a switchblade and loaded into a police van that drove him around the city for roughly 40 minutes before arriving at a Baltimore police station. When police went to take him out of the van, he was unresponsive.Doctors determined Gray's neck had been broken in a severe spinal cord injury. He died seven days later.'People go to protests to be heard': Reflections on the '60s and todayGray's death became a symbol of the Baltimore community's mistrust of police: They blamed the six police officers responsible for his care, custody and control. On the day of Gray's funeral on April 27, after several days of peaceful protests, unrest erupted around the city. One week after the protests broke out, Marilyn Mosby, Baltimore City State's Attorney, charged the six officers with felonies that, if convicted, could have put some of the officers behind bars for decades.  In defending her office's actions, Mosby told CNN last month what the message was then: The same as it is now.\"That power of justice is what everyone is screaming for,\" Mosby said. \"Treat police the same way you would treat anyone else regardless of race, sex and religion, and that's your obligation.\" Every case 'has its own set of circumstances'Defense attorney Michael Belsky, who represented the highest ranking officer charged in Baltimore, Lt. Brian Rice, tells CNN it was \"inconceivable that an investigation of this magnitude could be conducted so quickly in a careful and prudent manner.\" Three days after Floyd's last breath, under immense pressure to charge the Minneapolis officers involved, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman was of the same mindset, saying prosecutors in Minnesota did not want to make the mistake that Baltimore did by charging too quickly.This haunting song features the last words of unarmed black men\"I will just point to you the comparison to what happened in Baltimore and the Gray case,\" Freeman told reporters at a press conference. \"There was a rush to charge, it was a rush to justice. . . I will not rush to justice. I'm going to do this right.\" The next day, Freeman would announce Chauvin's arrest, but Mosby took issue with his take. \"Saying that there was a 'rush to charge, a rush to justice' in the Freddie Gray case is demonstrably false,\" Mosby said in a statement.While there are similarities, legal experts point to one obvious difference between the Floyd case and the Gray case which they say could lead to the conviction of at least one of the former Minneapolis police officers: the dramatic video.Cell phone video captured then-Officer Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck while Floyd was on the ground outside a police vehicle. Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe and was pronounced dead at a hospital.JUST WATCHEDMaryland governor shares lessons from Freddie Gray's deathReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMaryland governor shares lessons from Freddie Gray's death 01:57\"The video is a tremendous difference obviously because we can all look at the video and make reasonable assumptions,\" Belsky said. \"The biggest difference between the Minneapolis case and the Freddie Gray case is that in the Freddie Gray case there was no video, which led people to speculate both ways.\"But from experience Belsky issues a word of caution: The Floyd case is not a slam dunk.\"Every use of force case is different,\" Belsky said. \"They are not monolithic cases. Every one is different and has its own set of circumstances.\"Rush for judgment?Protesters march in Minneapolis on May 26 after the killing of George Floyd.Each of the six officers arrested in the Gray case faced at least three charges at trial. All of them pleaded not guilty to every charge.  Belsky's client, Rice, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office.When she announced the arrests, Mosby stood on the courthouse steps, telling the community \"no one is above the law.\" Peter Moskos, former Baltimore Police officer and associate professor in the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, believes Mosby \"heard the cry for justice\" five years ago and arrested the officers \"to placate the protesters and rioters.\"Moskos says the prosecutor \"never showed crime happened.\"\"It was a tragedy but it was a civil issue,\" he said.New police body camera footage reveals George Floyd's last words were 'I can't breathe'In Minneapolis, ex-officer Chauvin was arrested the day after prosecutor Freeman's news conference and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In the days after Chauvin's arrest, protests ramped up as the probe continued into the three other officers.Five days after Chauvin's initial arrest, those officers were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. And Chauvin was additionally charged with second-degree murder.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had been tapped by the governor to be lead prosecutor, told the Minneapolis community, \"I did not allow public pressure to impact our decision making process.\" \"We made these decisions based on the facts that we gathered...and made these changes based on the law that we think applies,\" Ellison said. 'The lesson learned is that facts matter'  Because of the lack of video inside the police van there was always a mystery as to what actually happened to Gray's neck and spinal cord.Crime is surging in US cities. Some say defunding the police will actually make it fallProsecutors asserted it was because Officer Caesar Goodson was driving the van erratically at a reckless speed. But defense attorney Catherine Flynn, who represented Officer Garrett Miller, says the evidence never supported the prosecution's theory \"that he was killed because of a rough ride. There was never a shred of evidence to support that theory throughout all of the litigation.\"  That opened up the door for the defense to claim that by intentionally thrusting his head on the van's walls and by standing up in a moving vehicle Gray himself caused his fatal injuries.As far as lessons learned from Baltimore, Belsky says Minneapolis prosecutors need to make sure they have a rock solid case.\"The Chauvin case may well be the case where it is more than warranted to charge and secure a conviction. But on the flip side there are cases like the one we had in Baltimore that do not deserve to be charged and where the facts do not support a conviction ...The lesson learned is that facts matter and each case is different.\"The evidence just wasn't there, judge saidThe presiding judge for all of the Baltimore officer trials was Barry Williams, a former prosecutor who investigated police misconduct cases for the US Justice Department.In three separate bench trials, Judge Williams acquitted Rice and Officers Goodson and Edward Nero on all charges, stating as part of the record that the prosecution had \"failed to meet its burden to show that the actions of the defendant rose above mere civil negligence.\"Flynn agreed with the judge's legal determination.\"The judge was extremely thorough and the state's legal theory simply didn't hold water,\" Flynn said. \"They were just wrong.\"A protester walks through tear gas on April 28, 2015, as police enforce a curfew after the funeral of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.Officer William Porter's trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors announced they would re-try his case but then decided to drop all charges against Porter and the two other officers, Miller and Sgt. Alicia White. \"You don't charge people just to charge them. You charge because you believe a crime has been committed,\" said Belsky, Rice's lawyer. \"You want to make sure you do a thorough investigation so that ultimately you can get a conviction.\"Mosby told CNN prosecutors were hindered because Baltimore police \"were working against us,\" and that \"search and seizure warrants weren't executed.\" Baltimore Police have not responded to her claims.Taking 'Black Lives Matter' from slogan to reality Mosby said that regardless of the outcome of the criminal cases in Baltimore, much good came from the prosecutions.\"We have tangible reforms that have come about as a result of those charges,\" Mosby said. \"Police officers are mandated to seat belt all prisoners. They're mandated to call a medic when requested. There is an affirmative duty and responsibility for colleagues if someone crossed the line, for them to go and inform folks about that.\" And as far as advice to the Minnesota defense attorneys who are beginning their journey as the Baltimore attorneys did five years ago, Belsky says: \"You have to recognize that there is a community that is legitimately hurt and distrustful of the police and you have to understand that and appreciate that.\"Don't try to change a community's perception based on a case. Worry about the facts of the case.\"",

In the complaint filed last week, the family of Elizabeth Wiles said she was a longtime housekeeping and laundry employee at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, a long-term care facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, who died from Covid-19 \"after exposure and infection\" while working at the facility. They allege misconduct by the facility allowed the virus to \"spread through the Brighton unchecked, infecting and killing numerous residents and workers at the facility, including plaintiff's decedent Elizabeth Wiles.\"  CNN has confirmed that Wiles was an employee of another defendant in the case, Healthcare Services Group, but she was assigned to work at Brighton. Healthcare Services Group (HCSG) \"has delivered exceptional housekeeping/laundry and dining/nutrition services to an ever-changing healthcare industry\" according to its website. The company did not respond to CNN's multiple requests for comment. Wiles died on May 10, according to court paperwork. Dr. Wayne Ross, a forensic pathologist who was hired by the family, told CNN he conducted blood studies to determine the Covid-19 diagnosis.  Read MoreIn a statement to CNN Wednesday, Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center said, \"Ms. Wiles was not an employee of our facility, nor did we supervise her or set her schedule. Further, we do not yet know whether Ms. Wiles acquired COVID-19 at all, let alone at our facility.\" The statement went on to say, \"As for the unfounded allegations, we will not tolerate litigation through slander and are working with counsel to determine the appropriate legal response.\" The company said, \"it is scientifically recognized by OSHA and Workers' Compensation Boards that where and how exactly an individual contracted this virus cannot be determined.\"Wiles received treatment for breast cancer in 2014, and returned to work in 2015 while undergoing radiation, her family said in the filing, alleging the defendants should have known about her pre-existing condition. Nevertheless, the family alleges Wiles advised her employer of underlying health conditions. The family also said in its lawsuit that Wiles did not receive appropriate PPE. The facility faced scrutiny from state authorities during the coronavirus pandemic and in previous years.In May, the state health department appointed an independent, temporary manager at the facility to \"assist with the safe operations of the facility and provide information directly to the department regarding the health of residents and the needs of patients and staff,\" according to a press release. The Pennsylvania National Guard was also on hand for a week to assist with patient care. A civil support team was added to the effort on May 11 to train and assist employees in sterilizing the facility.Additionally, the facility has over 30 public health citations in the last five years according to CNN's review of public records. Some of the public health citations include lack of infection control, abuse and neglect, non-sufficient nursing services and food sanitation, among others.As of July 7, the facility reported 332 resident cases, 111 staff cases and 73 deaths among residents, according to data from the state health department.The plaintiffs are asking for a jury trial and damages, \"in an amount in excess of the thirty-five thousand dollars compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, and allowable costs of suit and brings this action to recover the same,\" the lawsuit says.",

But what exactly does that mean? A number of people have been pulled into the unfolding story of the prosecutor's death. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating a deadly 1994 terror attack, alleged that the country's President, foreign minister and other political leaders covered up Iranian involvement in the attack. The government told Iran it would back off in exchange for a favorable trade deal, Nisman alleged. He filed his report, but one day before his scheduled testimony before lawmakers on the allegations, he was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. There were initial reports of suicide, but many had their doubts. Sure enough, suspicions appeared to be confirmed when no gunpowder residue was found on Nisman's hands, which would have been expected if he had shot himself. Read MoreSince then, a number of strange things have happened in Argentina, all seemingly related to Nisman's death. Here's a look at the people, events and places that form part of a web that continues to unspool:Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, or AMIAJUST WATCHEDArgentina's Jewish community in despairReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHArgentina's Jewish community in despair 02:16The Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, or AMIA, was the target of the July 18, 1994, terror attack that killed 85 people and injured hundreds in Buenos Aires. The attack on the Jewish community center is the worst terror attack in Argentina's history. A suicide attacker drove an explosive-laden vehicle into the building. Argentina has the largest Jewish community in Latin America.Alberto NismanHe was the prosecutor who accused Argentina's President and other top leaders of covering up Iran's alleged role in the Jewish center bombing. Nisman was found dead after filing a report with his allegations in court, and one day before he was slated to testify on his accusations in front of Congress. JUST WATCHEDControversy surrounds prosecutor's mysterious deathReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHControversy surrounds prosecutor's mysterious death 08:05His death remains a mystery. A gun and shell casing by his side made it look like a suicide, but an initial test found no gunpowder residue on his hands. Almost immediately, suspicions arose that Nisman's death was linked to his allegations against the President, foreign minister and other political elites. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called it a suicide, then quickly changed her tune. The government denies it had a role in the prosecutor's death. Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor on the AMIA bombing in 2005 by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband. Iranian suspectsEven before Nisman became the lead investigator, previous Argentine prosecutors suspected Iran's involvement in the terrorist attack. In 2004, Argentina issued arrest warrants for 12 Iranians and requested that Interpol issue red notices for these suspects. But allegations of misconduct by Argentine investigators resulted in the case falling apart. Nisman was appointed after this mess to sort it out. JUST WATCHED'Nisman is here': Argentine prosecutor laid to restReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Nisman is here': Argentine prosecutor laid to rest 01:31Nisman's own investigation also pointed at Iran, and in 2007, Argentina issued new arrest warrants and went back to Interpol. This time six red notices were issued. The Iranian suspects are Imad Fayez Moughnieh, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi and Mohsen Rezai. The most prominent of these suspects is Vahidi, who for a time was Iran's defense minister. Argentina also asked for red notices for three others --  former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Hadi Soleimanpour, the former ambassador of Iran in Buenos Aires. Interpol did not issue red notices for them. None of the Iranian suspects are in custody and Iran has not made them available to Argentine prosecutors. Joint Argentina-Iran commissionIn 2013, Argentina's Congress approved the creation of a joint commission to investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing. The five-member \"truth commission\" would include Argentine and Iranian investigators who would work together to get to the bottom of the terror attack. Argentine lawmakers deliberated for more than 14 hours before passing the measure by a 131-113 vote. Later, Nisman would call this agreement the public face of the alleged cover-up. Fernandez's government heralded the agreement as a way for prosecutors to finally interrogate the Iranian suspects. But there was much opposition, including from Jewish groups. They were worried the commission's verdict would be nonbinding and distrusted Iran. JUST WATCHEDDid Argentina make a secret deal with Iran?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDid Argentina make a secret deal with Iran? 02:49Cristina Fernandez de KirchnerFernandez was elected President of Argentina in 2007. She succeeded her husband, Nestor Kirchner, who was President from 2003-2007 and who died in 2010. Fernandez was re-elected in December 2011 to a new four-year term. As President, she has often been combative, accusing opponents of undermining her ability to govern. When Nisman was found dead, she made a statement calling it a suicide, followed by a second statement saying she didn't believe he took his own life.In the wake of the Nisman scandal, Fernandez traveled to China on a business trip, where she made headlines for a tweet mocking the Chinese accent. Hector TimermanHector Timerman, Argentina's foreign minister, is among those accused of conspiring to cover up Iran's involvement in the Jewish center bombing. After Nisman's death, Timerman told CNN the allegations of a cover-up were baseless.Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman says allegations of a cover-up are \"baseless.\"Fernandez's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing, Timerman said.\"I am Jewish,\" he said. \"And to think that a person of my religion, the Jewish religion, can make a deal not to prosecute the death of 85 people, most of them Jewish in Argentina ... I have to tell you, it's not easy to live with.\"He has said that he never asked to have the red notices for the Iranian suspects removed. His reputation has taken a hit. Timerman signed the agreement with the Iranians to investigate the bombing jointly, a move criticized by Argentina's Jewish community. At the time, he said: \"I negotiated this memorandum with who I had to, not with who I wanted to. At each step, I kept in mind that us Argentinians learned with lots of pain that we have to seek justice and not condemnations, to seek the truth and not vengeance.\"Diego Lagomarsino Diego Lagomarsino was an assistant to Nisman. He also is the only person charged in connection with the prosecutor's death, charged with illegally letting Nisman borrow a gun. Lagomarsino faces up to six years in prison if convicted.The IT expert broke his silence at a news conference, saying he committed no crime and that he let Nisman borrow the gun at the prosecutor's insistence.Nisman feared for his safety after he filed his report in court and didn't trust his own security guards, Lagomarsino said.According to Lagomarsino, Nisman was so fearful that he didn't go out to buy his own groceries and feared for his daughters. Nisman told Lagomarsino not to worry, that he wasn't going to use the gun. But when Lagomarsino texted later to check on Nisman, the prosecutor never answered. Viviana FeinViviana Fein is a federal prosecutor who leads the investigation into Nisman's death. It's not unusual for her, or those she interviews, to be swarmed by television news cameras outside her office. Fein's approach to the investigation has been careful and transparent.

When the Clarin newspaper reported that Nisman had drafted an arrest warrant affidavit for Fernandez, Timerman and others, Fein was quoted saying it was not true. The government also denied it. The next day, Fein said her comments were misunderstood. She confirmed that Nisman had indeed contemplated seeking the arrests of the President and others. The draft documents were found in trash can in Nisman's apartment, she said. SI, or ex-SIDEThe Secretariat of Intelligence, or SI, is the country's domestic intelligence service. Locally, it is also known as ex-SIDE, referring to the agency's previous name, the Intelligence Secretariat of the State (SIDE by its Spanish initials). In the wake of Nisman's death, the government has suggested that rogue intelligence agents fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and then killed him after he filed the accusations in court. \"They used him while he was alive, and then they needed him dead,\" the President said in a statement days after Nisman's body was found. Fernandez then sent a bill to Congress that would abolish the SI and replace it with a new agency, to be called the Federal Intelligence Agency. The SI has \"not served the interests of the country,\" Fernandez said. Lawmakers are debating the proposal.

Fein has since said she is confident he will testify soon. Damian PachterDamian Pachter is a journalist for the English-language Buenos Aires Herald. A dual citizen of Argentina and Israel, he broke the news of Nisman's death, reporting it via Twitter. After the scoop, Pachter dropped off the radar, with some saying he fled Argentina fearing for his safety. In a strange response, the Argentine government published a copy of Pachter's travel records, saying they showed he simply went to Uruguay and had purchased a return ticket. But Pachter didn't return. He announced on Twitter a few days later that he was in Israel, in exile.

The final resting place for the youths -- all in their 20s -- is the place where their family originated. But this small community, administered by the larger border city of Matamoros, merely provides bookends to the lives these three Americans had north of the Rio Grande. The siblings were born in the United States, grew up in Progreso, Texas, and continued to make their lives there. They disappeared on October 13 -- kidnapped, witnesses say -- as they returned to Texas from a trip to visit their father in El Control. JUST WATCHEDMother grieves over kids killed in MexicoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMother grieves over kids killed in Mexico 01:27Their bodies were found last week. Each was bound at their hands and feet, the Tamaulipas State Attorney General's Office said, and each had a gunshot wound to the head. A fourth victim, Jose Castaneda, met the same fate. Castaneda was Erica's boyfriend, her family said. All four were killed the same day they disappeared, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's Office said, without elaborating. Some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as \"Grupo Hercules,\" State Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta told reporters. Grupo Hercules was created one month before the disappearance of the youths. It is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of Matamoros, 37-year-old Leticia Salazar. In parts of Mexico like this stretch of border, where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement, things aren't always what they seem. Drug gangs have been known to pose as cops. Cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls. Cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences.  But what troubles Pedro and Raquel Alvarado is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and Castaneda were killed. No one has accused the Alvarado siblings of being involved in criminal activity. And while nine members of Grupo Hercules were interrogated by investigators, no arrests have been made. Salazar, the Matamoros mayor, has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces -- at least publicly. Contacted by CNN, Salazar referred questions to the city's public affairs team, which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against Grupo Hercules  and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size. In a news release announcing the group's unveiling, Grupo Hercules is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and high-risk operations. Members of the Grupo Hercules security force are shown in September, when the force was created. Some witnesses say they were the armed men who kidnapped three Americans in Mexico. A week ago, the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning, but that has not happened. \"I don't know why they took them,\" Pedro Alvarado said. \"They didn't start trouble with anyone. They were quiet, not aggressive.\"If her children were mixed up in something criminal, there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them, but those are nonexistent, Raquel Alvarado said. \"If I knew they were doing something wrong, I would have recognized it as their mother,\" she said. \"And until someone proves otherwise, I will continue defending them.\"Pedro, Raquel's former husband, was the one to identify the remains of his children, which were in an advanced state of decomposition, the State Attorney General's Office said. He identified them by their clothing, shoes and some tattoos. The U.S. Consulate in Matamoros has been assisting the family.\"We have been in contact with Mexican officials both in Washington and in Mexico to find out further details of the case, and will take appropriate action (if necessary) once more is known about the circumstances,\" a State Department official said. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is assisting Mexican officials with any part of the investigation on the U.S. side of the border. Three livesThe final Facebook post that Erica Alvarado shared -- at least publicly -- is a fitting, if unplanned, goodbye. It is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words \"I love you.\"She was born in Florida, and like her siblings, grew up in Progreso, a Texas town on the border and about as close as you can get to El Control on the U.S. side of the boundary. She was a dedicated mother, Pedro Alvarado said, and was planning to enroll in a nursing program. Her brother Alex loved his Chevy Tahoe, his father said. Alex's social media postings reflect that: photos of the Tahoe muddied, photos after a paint job, the Tahoe as a profile picture. The same armed men who took his children took the Tahoe, Pedro Alvarado said.  The 22-year-old had a prominent tattoo on his left arm -- an image of St. Jude, the saint of lost causes -- the father said. By now, Alex and his brother, Jose Angel, should have been in Missouri, doing seasonal agricultural work, Pedro Alvarado said. Jose Angel was born in Houston, and Alex in Harlingen, during Pedro's own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the United States, their father said. Routine visitThe siblings visited their father in El Control each week, Pedro Alvarado said.On their short drive back to Texas, the Alvarado siblings stopped at \"La Curva Texas,\" a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the Los Indios International Bridge, Pedro Alvarado said. They arrived separately, Raquel Alvarado said. According to what witnesses have told her, Alex and Jose Angel arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend. The brothers intervened, and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away, the mother said. It was there, he said, that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later. Raquel Alvarado said she and Pedro have told all this to authorities, but she accuses investigators of moving slowly. The facts that are known, she said, are thanks to the investigative work of Pedro, who tracked down witnesses. There was an outpouring of support at the funeral, Raquel Alvarado said. Family from across Texas and Mexico attended, and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground, they found that the crowd wouldn't fit in the cemetery. On Monday, the mother was back in Progreso, hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning, frustration and media spotlight. \"I hope when I wake up I will learn this was all a nightmare,\" she said. \"But I know it isn't.\"Mexican mayor, wife arrested in case of missing students",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe Senate's immigration bill calls for doubling the size of the border patrolThe House is debating a strong security component to its bill, tooThose who live on the border have a nuanced view of securityMany want work permits for undocumented immigrantsJoe Metz, a straight-talking Texas rancher on the U.S.-Mexico border, awoke recently to find 50 cows roaming freely in his front yard. Undocumented immigrants, he says, left a gate open as they crossed his land, which abuts the Rio Grande. For years, he's witnessed migrants and drug smugglers touch American soil for the first time on his property. \"We deal with this every day,\" he said.But as a rancher in Hidalgo County, he also knows firsthand the need for labor to keep producers in the Rio Grande Valley operating. The traffic through his land frustrates him -- particularly the potentially dangerous drug traffic -- but he acknowledges that most crossers are looking for opportunity. It is an open secret that many of these undocumented immigrants will indeed find jobs in the local economy. More than 1,700 miles away, U.S. lawmakers are engaged in their own debate over how to balance security concerns and immigrant labor needs. The Senate has proposed one solution in the form of a sweeping immigration bill that the chamber passed last month. Border security figures prominently in that bill, and is also a priority for members of the House, where the debate has moved. Five reasons immigration reform isn't close Those who live and work on the border say there is a disconnect between the debate in Washington and the realities on the ground. Voices of the border communitiesMiles of border fencing built by the federal government -- actually a levy that was cut in half and reinforced with concrete to form a wall -- run across Metz's property near Mission, Texas. Two 40-foot gaps exist in the barrier so that workers can access all parts of the ranch, but there are no gates, creating a funnel for migrants and traffickers to cross.  Metz's experiences make him hawkish on beefing up the border, but he doesn't just want more border patrol agents. He wants to see work permits granted the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.Map: Texas-Mexico border townsThe agriculture industry in the Rio Grande Valley depends on immigrant labor, he said.  \"They (the government) just need to face up to the situation and give all these people work permits,\" Metz said. Opinion: Immigrants are driving the housing recoveryMigrants will keep coming across the border as long as there is work and a chance to make money, the rancher said. \"Farmers need the help, no doubt about that, because nobody wants to do the work,\" said Jimmie Steidinger, a farmer and agricultural producer, in Donna, Texas. How immigration reform would affect 3 familiesFor those whose lands are traversed by migrants, the biggest concern is drug traffickers, more so than economic migrants, he said.

For others, securing the border is not about how many boots are on the ground. Border security means that people on both sides of the boundary feel safe, said Michael Seifert, coordinator of the Rio Grande Valley Equal Voice Network. That is not the case, he said. The Equal Voice Network represents 11 community-based organizations focused on the area's poorest residents. To many of these residents, the border patrol is something threatening, Seifert said. Reports of heavy-handedness by border agents -- including use of force -- has bred mistrust among some border residents. In one case in Arizona last year, a border patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border. The border patrol confirmed that agents were being assaulted with rocks and that after verbal warnings to stop, one agent fired his service weapon. Many in the community hear the stories of alleged beatings or use of stun guns by border agents and have become wary of their presence. \"We have a completely different perception\" than outsiders, Seifert said.  The fears of the community are compounded by the fact that many families live in mixed-status households, where some members are living in the country legally and others aren't, creating fear of separation. Seifert said a further buildup along the border would be bad both for businesses and the welfare of the communities. The view from WashingtonThe Senate immigration overhaul bill passed only after being amended to include tough border security measures: Doubling the number of border patrol agents on the southern border to nearly 40,000, increasing fencing to 700 miles and deploying more technology. In the Republican-controlled House, border security is being touted as a prerequisite before any undocumented immigrants are placed on a potential path to citizenship.

John Carter, R-Texas, a member of the bipartisan House group working on a bill. But some who study the border say the boundary with Mexico is as safe as it's ever been, and it doesn't make sense to flood the place with border agents. \"It sounds good and it looks good politically,\" to add more agents, said Maureen Meyer, Senior Associate for Mexico and Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, or WOLA. \"Calls for border security don't always reflect reality.\"Opinion: Should U.S. be more like Mexico?Currently, the border patrol is already double the size it was in 2005. As the agency grew, the number of illegal crossers apprehended decreased. In 2005, each border agent -- on average -- apprehended 118 undocumented immigrants that year, according to data extrapolated by WOLA. Last year, that number fell to 19 apprehensions per agent.If the border patrol is doubled in size again, how much further would that number fall? Would there be a lot of agents standing on the border doing nothing?Not just a border issue About 70 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley lies Brooks County, a community that has seen the cost of illegal immigration up close, even though it is not located on the border. The county includes the town of Falfurrias, the site of the last border patrol checkpoint on Highway 281. Make it past the checkpoint, and a smuggler or migrant could be home free. Most migrants try to avoid the checkpoint altogether, choosing instead to go around it by hiking deep into the vast tracts of ranch land. Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez in his private office in the  town of Falfurrias, Texas. \nBut too often they become lost, or succumb to the unforgiving heat and die. In 2012, 129 bodies of migrants were found in Brooks County. At least 42 have been found so far this year -- 11 in the past two weeks.It can cost the county nearly $2,000 to pick up a body, transport it, and perform an autopsy. The county is also burdened with the costs of sending its deputies to these scenes instead of patrolling the community. The counties that are right on the border have access to federal funds to offset law enforcement and other costs, but Brooks County does not. KSAT: Immigrants survive wild ride in U-Haul truckThe border \"isn't secure, and I don't think they will ever secure it,\" Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez said. Still, Ramirez says that doubling the border patrol and prioritizing border security before immigration reform is not the answer. \"I think they don't get it. I don't think that's the solution,\" he said. More agents will not stop determined migrants, but will simply drive up the price that a smuggler charges, he said. It also raises the likelihood that smugglers will choose riskier routes, meaning that even more people may die from exposure, he said. What Ramirez would like to see is a deployment of current border agents to high-crossing areas, and a focus on catching drug traffickers. What do border agents want? The border patrol would appear to have the most to gain from an immigration bill with a tough security component. It would mean more money and more manpower. But Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents border agents, the National Border Patrol Council, says that is not the case.  The graves of dozens of migrants who died trying to illegally cross the border are in Falfurrias, Texas. \nRather than spending millions hiring and training 20,000 new agents, it makes more sense to properly fund the existing force to bring the border patrol up to 100% staffing for current agents, he said. That alone would be the equivalent of 5,000 new agents.  Calls for increased technology, from sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles are nice, but they are just tools, Moran said. It takes an agent to make an arrest, he said. \"We appreciate the sentiment, but we think (the immigration bill) has to be tweaked a bit,\" he said.",

Etta James. The Temptations. Just what you would expect to be playing at a 1960s prom. Yet the song that drew the most bodies to the dance floor was \"The Wobble.\" Until this hip-hop song emptied the chairs, it felt as if the auditorium had been transported back 50 years. But it's 2013, and despite the full-court nostalgia for the 1960s, that decade was one of the most difficult times in Birmingham's history.Societal tensions over race were so high in 1963 that the city canceled senior prom for five of the city's segregated high schools for blacks. Today, a half century has passed since the seminal civil rights protests that changed Birmingham and plotted a path for the nation away from segregation and toward equal rights.

Lavender was a fitting color, she said, not just because it is her favorite, but because it was the school color at Parker High School. It was a day of celebration that she and her classmates were denied in 1963. Segregation in Birmingham permeated everything, down to the Bibles that judges used to swear witnesses in -- there was one holy book for white witnesses and another for black witnesses. Yet members of the class of 1963 recall having the same struggles as any other teenagers, then and today -- parents' rules, scrounging enough money for dates, finding reliable transportation. As often is the case when people witness a historic period, many black high school students in Birmingham in 1963 did not recognize the moment that was upon them. Years of advocacy by civil rights leaders had successfully chipped away at segregation, and students pushed the boundaries -- as much out of teenage rebellion as a sense of justice.

But when whites began boarding the bus, they stood, rather than sit behind the black teens. The teens also noticed that white riders refused to sit next to black riders, so instead of sitting two to a seat, they spread out individually to occupy the seats, leaving other passengers no choice but to sit next to them. Again, the white riders chose to stand. \"It was a tension-filled city,\" May said.  It was against this backdrop that the seniors at the black high schools began preparing for graduation. Each May, in Thomas' neighborhood, the graduating seniors would parade down the street. And in 1963, it would be her turn. There was also prom, an American rite of passage. Thomas can still picture her long dress, a blue and green neon attention-grabber that showed different colors in the light as she moved. A neighbor had bought it for her in December. \"Even though it was a winter dress, I was going to wear it to the prom,\" Thomas said. \"But in one fell swoop, that was wiped away.\"Civil rights come to BirminghamThere is disagreement over why prom was canceled for those five black high schools in 1963.The civil rights movement was in full swing that year, but the high school students, to an extent, were kept at a distance from it. This would change on May 2, 1963, when hundreds of children, some as young as 6, left school to march in Birmingham in opposition to segregation. Images like this one on the streets of Birmingham, Alabama, in May 1963 triggered national outrage.CNN Photo Blog: Birmingham's civil rights crusadeThousands of arrests were made at the so-called Children's March, and when the marches persisted for several days, authorities responded with fire hoses and dogs. \"This was a very controversial thing,\" said Glenn T. Eskew, a history professor at Georgia State University who has written a book about Birmingham during this period. \"There were those who did not believe that schoolchildren should be engaging in civil rights protests. Not only was it dangerous, but they were youth and it was a very confrontational thing.\"The images of children being hosed and intimidated by police dogs renewed a level of outrage at the national level that had been flagging. \"It changed the dynamic of the protest dramatically,\" Eskew said. \"It encouraged other youth to participate on one hand, and on the other it ratcheted up the pressure on the forces of white supremacy.\"50 years since MLK's Letter from a Birmingham jailOnly a fraction of students from the black high schools participated. Many were told by their parents not to participate, for fear of losing a job or other retribution. Thomas didn't march because her grandfather expressed concerns that he might be fired if someone saw her protesting. But everyone would be affected by the protests, whether they marched or not. Days after the marches, the school board announced that all end-of-the-year activities were canceled for the class of 1963. No prom, no graduation, no yearbook. The stated reason for the cancellations was security concerns; that in such a tense racial atmosphere, a gathering such as a graduation ceremony or prom could become the target of an attack. Yet many believe that the events were taken away as a punishment for their participation in the marches. If the authorities were truly concerned about the safety of the black students, they would not have met them with fire hoses and snarling dogs, said Bishop Calvin Woods, director of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It was Woods, who was a father with children at the schools, who sued to have graduation reinstated. A court eventually ordered graduation must go on, and it did, though delayed. But prom never happened. Shirley Holmes Sims had her copper-colored dress ready to go when she left school to participate in the Children's March. And copper-colored shoes to match. They would go unworn, and be lost decades later in a tornado.  \"We marched down that street and we were singing 'We Shall Overcome,'\" Sims said. \"You think back to it today, and it was truly worth it.\"Righting a wrongEthel Arms has a line she uses when the topic of high school rites of passage and prom comes up: \"We didn't have a prom because of the civil rights movement.\"It puts the memory of 1963 in perspective and justifies the sacrifice. Ethel and Eugene Arms pose for a prom photo.Yet it doesn't change the fact that inside, she has always lamented that she never had that night. Sure, there were more important things going on in Birmingham at the time, but she was just a teenager and wanted those experiences. This time, Arms was on the \"prom committee\" that organized Friday's event. The small group gathered in a hotel room before the dance, laughing and reminiscing about the prom they never had. There would be no prom king and queen elected this time, but the theme of the dance summed up what the night was all about: \"Finally, the Prom We Never Had.\"Sims ironed her purple and gold dress as the women placed corsages on their wrists and waited for the limousines that would take them to the prom. Amid the celebratory atmosphere, there were moments of reflection, and thoughts of those classmates who had passed away. In a way, this party was a celebration of what they had endured and survived over the last 50 years, Thomas said.\"As we get older, everything behind us looks greater,\" she said.   The prom committee held hands and said a prayer before walking out of the room. This would be their night. The prom was especially meaningful for Ethel Arms, as she and her high school sweetheart, Eugene, had been negotiating with their parents for permission to attend the prom when it was canceled in 1963. They had been trying to figure out where to find transportation to the dance, and how to earn the money to rent formal wear or buy a dress. They later married, and when it came time for their children to attend proms, the couple put extra effort into making them special nights. It wasn't until Friday night, though, in Birmingham's Boutwell Auditorium, that Eugene Arms was finally able to take his own sweetheart to the prom. \"It's really a much more pleasant event because we can afford the attire, we have no problem getting back and forth,\" Eugene Arms said. \"It makes you appreciate everything when we were children,\" he continued. \"The sacrifices people made.\"Eugene Arms had attended rallies during the civil rights movement, but out of deference to his parents, he did not participate in the Children's March. The students that did participate in the march faced dogs and water and arrests, he said. \"All we did was give up prom,\" he said. Opinion:  Historic milestone for African-American voters in 2012",

        "content": "Story highlightsNew alternatives to reduce prison sentences in Brazil have emergedIn one city, inmates can pedal bikes that produce clean energyAt federal level, prisoners can read books to shorten jail timePrograms address prison overcrowding and help inmatesFor hours at a time, Ronaldo Marcelo Wanderlei da Silva pedals on a stationary bike for a cause. But it is not an ordinary bike, nor an ordinary cause. Da Silva is an inmate at the prison in Santa Rita do Sapucai,Brazil, near Sao Paulo. He is among a small group of inmates who have been given the chance to lower their sentences by exercising on customized stationary bikes attached to car batteries that charge as they pedal. The batteries are in turn used to power street lights in the local plaza. The program exists only at this one prison, but is not the only recent effort at out-of-the-box thinking in Brazil's penal system. Jose Henrique Mallmann, a judge in Santa Rita do Sapucai, came up with the idea for the pedaling program while doing internet searches for cost-free, clean energy sources. It was a personal curiosity, he said, and it led him to a story about an American gym that is partly powered by its patrons' bicycle workouts. In his small city, it was easy to adapt the idea and put it in practice with the local prison, he said. The program provides a type of poetic justice, he said. Most inmates at some point deprived a sense of security from their victims. Now, by providing clean energy that powers the city's plaza at night, they are providing a sense of security. \"This has been very well received. We are very satisfied with the public reaction,\" Mallmann said. Brazil's prisons, by and large, are overcrowded and unpleasant places. According to the ministry of justice, Brazil's prisons are at 167% of capacity, as of December 2011. The prison population has more than doubled since 2001. But new initiatives are finding creative ways to address these issues while helping inmates and society at the same time. Another recent program -- this one at the federal level -- allows inmates to reduce their sentence for reading books. The idea is to help inmates be better prepared for success when they reintegrate with the outside world. Inmates can shave four days off their sentence through each book they read, up to 48 days per year, the new law states. The \"Redemption Through Reading\" program, as it's known, requires the inmates to write a book report. The law goes as far as to specify that these reports must be written neatly and must not stray from the topic of the book. The books available to inmates will include literary classics and scientific and philosophical tomes, among others. \"There is very alarming crisis in the penal system,\" said Leonardo Schmitt de Bem, a Brazilian professor and expert on criminal law. \"Proposals like this, which reduce sentences and give a social and cultural foundation to people are very interesting.\"The reading program addresses the overcrowding problem and gives inmates a cultural foundation, he said. Reading is an important tool because a large percentage of Brazilian prisoners come from poor backgrounds and have little education. Nearly half of Brazilian inmates -- 46% -- have not completed more than nine years of basic education, according to the ministry of justice. More than 26,000 prisoners (5%) are illiterate. The new law gives inmates something to do, and better prepares them for then they reintegrate with society, de Bem said. \"It is a necessary measure given the prison crisis in Brazil,\" he said. The program has existed for several years, but was codified into the law just last month. It is a \"pioneering\" initiative, de Bem said, but would have much greater impact if it were imposed on all prisons, not just the federal ones, which hold just a fraction of the country's inmates. In Santa Rita do Sapucai, Mallmann says he has bigger dreams than having inmates powering street lamps. He envisions a system where the battery power is converted into electricity that can be used to power houses. In the short term, the goal is to power the city's entire plaza with clean energy produced by the prisoners. Currently, there are four bicycles that require 10 hours of pedaling to fully charge one battery. The energy is enough to power 10 street lamps, out of 34 lamps that provide light for the plaza. Authorities hope to expand the number of bikes to 10 in the near future, Mallmann said. For every 16 hours of pedaling, inmates have their sentences reduced by one day, with no maximum on how much they can bike, he said. Da Silva, the inmate at the Santa Rita do Sapucai prison, said at first the prison population didn't know what to make of the stationary bicycles, but estimates that now, some 80% of prisoners want to participate. \"I started to learn more about the project and only then I understood how important it is for the city,\" he said. For now, there are two teams of four inmates who were chosen to participate, based on their good behavior. \"The project is very good for the prisoners, it shows the good they can do,\" he said. Da Silva is serving a five-and-a-half year sentence for assault, and has erased 20 days off his punishment since he began pedaling two months ago, he said. The 36-year-old said that the time on the bike also gives him time to reflect on his situation. While he's pedaling, \"I think about my imprisonment, about my freedom, my wife, my kids,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Peru was one of the first nations in the Americas to take strict preventative coronavirus measures, like stay-at-home orders, curfews and border closings. So how did it become one of the hardest hit?As of Monday, Peru had more than 123,900 confirmed coronavirus cases and 3,600 deaths -- putting it second only to Brazil both in number of cases and deaths in South America. The two countries had handled the epidemic entirely differently: While Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed the dangers posed by the coronavirus, Peru's President Martin Vizcarra declared on March 15 a nationwide state of emergency that included mandatory self-quarantine, and shuttered the country's borders. But the virus surged all the same. A priest conducts a ceremony after the funeral of Covid-19 victims at El Angel cemetery, in Lima on May 21.About 85% of Peru's ICU beds with ventilators are currently occupied, according to government figures, and overcrowding at hospitals is feared. Read More\"This situation is not just a health emergency, but a health catastrophe, defined as a situation where the pandemic has overtaken the response capacity of the health sector,\" Dr. Alfredo Celis of the Medical College of Peru told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. How did a country that responded assertively and seriously to the pandemic end up like this? Needs vs. quarantine measures The deep inequality in Peru is one reason, according to Dr. Elmer Huerta, a Peruvian doctor and contributor to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \"What I have learned is that this virus lays bare the socio-economic conditions of a place,\" he said. Many of Peru's poor have no choice but to venture outside their homes for work, food or even banking transactions. Brazil faces dark week as Covid-19 toll risesFor example, only 49% of Peruvian households own a refrigerator or freezer (61% in urban areas), according to the country's 2017 Census. This translates to a need for many to visit markets daily for food because they can't stock up, Huerta said. \"You're supposed to avoid human contact in a society where one can't stay at home,\" Huerta said. On April 14 -- about a month after Peru enacted its mandatory stay-at-home policy and implemented a curfew -- CNN affiliate TV Peru showed images outside of a market on the outskirts of Lima. Shoppers waited in line for hours and a large mass of people milled about. Most wore masks, but social distancing seemed impossible. \"We must endure (the crowds) because there is no other way,\" one woman standing in line told TV Peru. \"If not, we will not have food. We have nothing to eat, that's why we have come here.\" On that day, the tally of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country was 10,303. Today, it is 10 times higher. Unintended consequences People have also ended up crowding at banks as they attempted to access coronavirus relief funds.The government's stimulus package to help millions of Peru's most vulnerable families was a good idea, but its distribution was poorly designed, said Kristian Lopez Vargas, a Peruvian economist and assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In a report last year, the agency that regulates Peru's banks reported that only about 38% of adults have a bank account. The lack of access to the financial system means a majority of aid recipients have to go in person to the banks to obtain their money. \"It was not hard to anticipate people's behavior in their attempt to access this aid,\" Lopez Vargas told CNN. \"Instead, these policies caused unnecessary harm by inducing people to gather in large crowds in banks.\"Many Peruvians also live and work in ways that simply can't be reconciled with social distancing, he pointed out. According to Lopez Vargas, more than 30% of households in Peru live in overcrowded conditions, with four or more people sleeping in the same room.And more than 72% work in the informal economy, according to Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information. For those living day-to-day in the informal sector, earning an income oftentimes depends on going out to work and not self-isolating. This, combined with the needs of millions to obtain food and other items from crowded markets, \"was an explosive mix,\" Lopez Vargas said. What now?On Friday, President Vizcarra extended the state of emergency until June 30, keeping in place the mandatory self-quarantine and curfews across the country. It was the fifth time the emergency measures have been extended. But this time, the extension was paired with authorization for certain businesses to re-open, including services like salons, food delivery and dentistry.  Peru's priorities for enforcing health guidelines also appear to have evolved since the state of emergency was first declared. In early April, Vizcarra reported that during the first weeks of the stay-at-home mandate, as many as 3,000 people were detained for disobeying the measures on some days. On Monday, he announced that the priority will be on enforcing health protocols at the country's markets. One lesson learned from the pandemic response is that people must change certain \"social behaviors that have done much damage,\" he added.\"This kind of behavior is individualistic, selfish...ignoring what's happening around us, and precisely what has brought this situation upon us, not just in Peru, but the whole world,\" said Vizcarra. But Huerta, the doctor, and Lopez Vargas, the economist, caution against placing too much blame on the people. The underlying problems that the pandemic has laid bare are not new. \"While it may seem like a mystery to some, it's not,\" Lopez Vargas said.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Peru has the second highest number of cases and deaths in South America.CNN en Espa\u00f1ol's Andy Ortiz contributed to this report",

Video of the scene showed a cloud of tear gas that sent people running and screaming, including families with young children.A migrant family runs from tear gas released by US border patrol agents near the fence between Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego.US Customs and Border Protection said the migrants threw projectiles that struck several agents. \"Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas to dispel the group because of the risk to agents' safety,\" the agency said on Twitter.The incident marked an escalation of tensions that have been mounting since groups of Central American migrants began arriving in Tijuana a few weeks ago on their journey to attempt entry into the United States. The migrants' presence has drawn demonstrators -- for and against them -- and threats from Trump to close the US-Mexico border. Meanwhile, Tijuana's mayor has called on the Mexican government and the international community for help.The melee closed one of the world's busiest international crossings, San Ysidro Port of Entry, to vehicle and pedestrian traffic for several hours. By Sunday afternoon, CBP reopened crossing lanes in both directions to pedestrians and vehicles. How the incident beganMore than 5,600 migrants have taken shelter in Tijuana's Benito Juarez Sports Complex, Mexico's Social Development Secretariat (SEDESOL) said. The rough tally includes 3,598 men, 1,041 women and 993 children, SEDESOL Director Mario Figueroa said.A peaceful march was planned for Sunday, starting at the sports complex and continuing to the border. In response, CBP deployed additional personnel to San Ysidro in expectation of demonstrations on both sides of the border.Inside the journey of Central American migrants bound for the USAs migrants reached the border area, some protesters split off toward multiple locations, CBP said. Some attempted to enter through San Ysidro and were turned away, the agency said. Others tried to enter \"directly east and west of the border crossing.\" After they were prevented from entering the port of entry, some of the migrants \"attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement. \"DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons. We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our front-line operators, or violates our nation's sovereignty,\" Nielsen said.

Arrona, 35, is \"a citizen of Mexico illegally residing in the United States\" and has an outstanding warrant for homicide charges in Mexico, ICE said in a statement. His wife, Maria del Carmen Venegas, 32, says the charges are \"a misunderstanding\" in Mexico. His detention took place Wednesday, when Arrona was driving to the 10 a.m. appointment and decided to stop for gas. In an interview with CNN on Saturday, Venegas said people who \"looked like security\" knocked on her window. \"I never imagined they were from ICE,\" Venegas said, adding that the officers didn't identify themselves as ICE and that she was unaware of their presence before they came knocking. Read MoreICE agents took Joel Arrona into custody while he was trying to take his pregnant wife to the hospital. The officers then asked for identification from both Arrona and his wife. Venegas says she is undocumented, but was able to provide a driver's license. Arrona, however, had left home \"in a hurry,\" according to his attorney, Emilio Amaya Garc\u00eda, so he was unable to present ID. Venegas said she began pleading with officers because the couple was three blocks from their home and were on the way to the hospital. She started worrying when the officers cuffed her husband. \"I was going crazy,\" she said. The agent reassured her not to worry and that her husband would be able to join her at the hospital in two hours and gave her a business card. That's when she realized it was ICE, she said.  The encounter was captured on the gas station's security camera. Maria del Carmen Venegas was left to drive herself and two of her children to the hospital after her husband was detained by ICE. Venegas waited at the gas station for a while, she said. Then she decided to leave, and pick up and drop off her children with someone, before heading to the hospital around 5 p.m.She had her baby boy, the couple's fifth child, on Friday, Garc\u00eda said. The couple has five children, three of whom were born in the US. She said she went back home Saturday night. \"I'm well healthwise, but emotionally bad,\" she said. The whole ordeal for her has been a nightmare, she said. \"I had wanted it to be a dream.\"ICE said in a statement that Arrona is in custody pending removal proceedings with the Executive Office for Immigration Review. \"ICE conducts targeted immigration enforcement in compliance with federal law and agency policy,\" the statement said. \"ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. All of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.\"NYC pizza delivery man released from ICE detentionSaturday was the first day Venegas spoke with her husband since his detention. Both she and her husband are from Guanajuato, Mexico, she said. They knew each other as kids and got married in Mexico. Her husband came to the US 12 years ago, and she followed him two years later.",

It was the first major election since July's controversial and deadly vote for a constituent assembly, and is also the country's first contested election since December of 2015.With 95.8% of the votes counted, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said that M\u00e1duro's party was favored in 17 states and the opposition coalition Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica (MUD) in five. The outcome in the remaining state was not yet clear, it said in a statement.M\u00e1duro called Sunday's vote \"a success for Venezuela and the revolutionary democracy, for the socialist democracy.\"But opposition politician Gerardo Blyde early Monday demanded a complete audit on all of Sunday's results.Read MoreBlyde, a campaign coordinator of the opposition coalition MUD, has called for street protests later Monday.Before the vote, government loyalists held all but three governorships, but observers had said there was a chance for the opposition to make gains.\"If the vote were to be completely free and fair, the (opposition) would likely win between 18 and 21 states,\" according to a pre-election analysis by the Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm.Vzlans hit the polls to elect State governors amid chaos on candidates, voting centres.. flier tells u exactly what to cross #ThisIsVzla pic.twitter.com/dDf8LzbIBI\u2014 stefano pozzebon (@StePozzebon) October 15, 2017\nIn the lead-up to election day, the opposition accused electoral authorities of making the ballots confusing and moving polling locations in opposition strongholds in an effort to boost pro-government candidates. The US State Department condemned Venezuela's National Electoral Council last week, saying its actions call into question \"the fairness of the electoral process.\"The Venezuelan Electoral Council called the US statement an \"aggression perpetrated against our sovereignty,\" and said changes were made for security reasons.    My day so far.. #regionales2017 #ThisIsVzla #newToys A post shared by Stefano Pozzebon (@stepozzebon) on Oct 15, 2017 at 7:42am PDT Concerns that the Electoral Council's changes would sow confusion appeared to have come to fruition Sunday, with many voters unsure about where they were supposed to vote. Long, slow-moving lines greeted voters at polling stations. Ludmilla Velez Lascar said she was determined to cast her ballot despite her polling location being changed. \"Maybe they don't want my vote,\" Velez Lascar said. \"But we have to vote. We have to elect ... our governors.\"Last election erupted in violenceVenezuelans headed to the polls Sunday less than three months since the last major vote, when violent clashes erupted between protesters and police, leaving at least six people dead. More than 120 people were killed in months of protest leading up to that vote, the Venezuelan attorney general's office said.

The father was dead, but the son survived and is being treated at a hospital, family members said. Ninety people are now confirmed dead in the quake that struck off Mexico's southern coast. It was the most powerful to hit the country in a century and was felt as far as Mexico City and Guatemala City by an estimated 50 million people.Many were asleep when the quake struck. The USGS reported multiple aftershocks, including at least six with tremors measuring above 5.0 in magnitude.JUST WATCHEDEarthquake shakes buildings in MexicoReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEarthquake shakes buildings in Mexico 01:01The majority of the deaths were in Oaxaca state, where homes and buildings collapsed. Oaxaca's governor said Saturday that 71 people had died in his state, Oaxaca's Civil Protection agency said via Twitter.Read MoreRelief and rescue efforts continued throughout the weekend.In the city of Juchitan, rescuers used floodlights to illuminate a giant pile of debris. \"Can anyone hear me?\" they shouted as they searched for survivors among the debris, using dogs to help in the search. In other parts of Juchitan, operators used heavy machinery to clear roads. Soldiers tapped to help with relief efforts worked with shovels to move smaller debris out of the way. Mexico's interior ministry has also reported 15 deaths in the state of Chiapas and four in the state of Tabasco.Chiapas and Oaxaca, home to about 9 million people, are two of the most impoverished areas in Mexico. The quake's epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean, some 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southeast of Mexico's capital and 74 miles (120 kilometers) off the coast.A tsunami was confirmed in Mexico, with one wave coming in at 5.8 feet (1.75 meter), according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Tsunami warnings were issued as far away as New Zealand and Vanuatu.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said Mexico's army, marines and federal police had been mobilized to respond.     The quake struck as the effects of Hurricane Katia were starting to be felt in eastern Mexico.Eduardo Mendoza, general manager of Direct Relief Mexico, told CNN on Friday that the storm could complicate relief efforts and contribute to water-borne illnesses. Large trucks were having a difficult time reaching affected areas, he said, so individuals were bringing in supplies in their personal cars.Mendoza said Direct Relief coordinates the delivery of supplies from companies in Mexico and the United States.\"What they really need right now are basic medical supplies for wound care and other trauma care,\" he said.Also needing help are people who fled their residences and left their medications behind.Mendoza said he felt the earthquake in his Mexico City residence.\"I could see my wall moving half a foot,\" he said. He ran outside but the building kept shaking 30 or 40 more seconds, he said.",

        "content": "Story highlightsQuake was relatively shallow, which means more intense shaking\"High casualties and extensive damage are probable,\" USGS reports (CNN)At least 61 people have died after the most powerful earthquake to hit Mexico in a century struck off the southern coast.The magnitude 8.1 quake, which was felt as far as Mexico City and Guatemala City, was registered off Mexico's southern coast just as heavy rains from Hurricane Katia lashed the east. The epicenter was in the Pacific Ocean, some 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southeast of the capital and 74 miles (120 kilometers) off the coast.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said the temblor -- felt by about 50 million people across the country -- was the strongest earthquake Mexico has experienced in 100 years. In September 1985, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake killed an estimated 9,500 people in and around Mexico City.This one hit late Thursday, when many people were asleep. The states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, home to about 9 million people, are located closest to the earthquake's epicenter. They are two of the most impoverished areas in Mexico, and were likely hit the hardest. At least 45 people were killed in Oaxaca state, Civil Protection National Coordinator Luis Felipe Puente said on Twitter. Ten others died in Chiapas state and three were killed in Tabasco, he said.     Read MoreLatest updates-- A red alert was issued by the US Geological Survey (USGS) PAGER system, which predicts economic and human loss after earthquakes. \"High casualties and extensive damage are probable and the disaster is likely widespread. Past red alerts have required a national or international response,\" it said.-- The USGS reported multiple aftershocks, including at least six with tremors measuring above 5.0 in magnitude.-- The quake had a depth of 69.7 kilometers (43 miles), according to the USGS, which makes it particularly shallow, said Jana Pursely, a staff geophysicist. That means more intense shaking.-- A tsunami was confirmed in Mexico, with one wave coming in at 3 feet (1 meter), according to a tweet from the National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. Tsunami waves taller than 10 feet (3 meters) could hit the coast of Mexico, while 3-foot waves could reach as far as Ecuador, New Zealand and Vanuatu, it said.-- Mexico's army, marines and federal police were mobilized to respond, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. -- About 1.85 million homes lost electricity, but 74% of them have had service returned, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. Some people lack water service, and it may take 36 to 48 hours to get it back up and running.-- Toppled buildings could be seen on video shared on social media from the city of Juchitan in Oaxaca state, where a local councilwoman said co-workers were trapped in the municipal building. A hospital there collapsed, and patients were seen on another video receiving treatment in an open field.      -- Four people may be trapped inside a collapsed hotel in Oaxaca, Oaxaca Civil Protection Director Amado Bohorquez told CNN.

Heavy rains from the storm could also contribute to water-borne illnesses, he said.Large trucks are having a difficult time reaching affected areas, he said, so individuals are now bringing in supplies in their personal cars.Mendoza said Direct Relief coordinates the delivery of supplies from companies in Mexico and the United States.\"What they really need right now are basic medical supplies for wound care and other trauma care,\" he said. Also needing help are people who fled their residences and left their medications behind. Mendoza said he felt the earthquake in his Mexico City residence.\"I could see my wall moving half a foot,\" he said. He ran outside but the building kept shaking 30 or 40 more seconds, he said.Chiapas hit hardGonazalo Segundo was awakened by the shaking.\"I was already in bed. I was in my place, so we were expecting to have a tranquil night but suddenly ... everything breaks apart, glasses, furniture and everything,\" he told CNN by phone from Chiapas.First responders survey the scene after the quake. \"We have experienced earthquakes before, but not like this. It was so intense,\" Segundo said. \"We are alive, that's the important thing.\"Pursely, of the USGS, told CNN she expects damage along the coast, meaning a costly cleanup could be on the way, adding that these types of shallow quakes have the potential to be very dangerous.In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state, Roberto Cardenas said he was watching television late Thursday when the house began shaking violently. \"The shaking lasted more than three minutes,\" he said. \"I felt desperate and we got my family out of the house. We got outside and the ground was still shaking.\"Cardenas said he remained outside for hours with family members and neighbors. They feared strong aftershocks but were forced back home by heavy rains about 5 a.m. Many older structures in the state capital were damaged but his home escaped largely unscathed, Cardenas said.  Chiapas Gov. Manuel Velasco told Foro TV that there have been reports of damage, including hospitals that have lost power and buildings with collapsed roofs.

        "content": "Story highlightsTerror cell behind two attacks \"completely dismantled,\" official saysClues sought in rubble of house where terror cell suspected of making bombsAlcanar, Spain (CNN)An international manhunt was underway Saturday for the driver of a van that killed 13 people in Barcelona as police probed the wreckage of a suspected bomb factory for clues to the cell behind this week's two terror attacks in Spain.The flattened ruins of a house in the village of Alcanar have become the center of a massive police investigation into the terror cell suspected of using the house to make bombs.When an explosion destroyed the house Wednesday night, killing one person and seriously injuring another, it set in train a series of events culminating in the deaths in Barcelona and one more in a second attack in the town of Cambrils.      A manhunt has been ongoing since a van plowed into pedestrians Thursday afternoon on Las Ramblas in the heart of Barcelona, killing 13 and injuring 120.Early Friday, a group of five attackers wearing fake suicide belts drove into pedestrians in Cambrils, killing one and injuring six. Police shot all five assailants dead but said late Friday it was \"increasingly unlikely\" that the Barcelona driver was among them, Reuters reported. Read MoreA Catalan police spokesman on Saturday confirmed the names of three of the five suspects killed in Cambrils as Moussa Oukabir, Said Aallaa and Mohamed Hychami. He also said that Younes Abouyaaqoub, who's wanted in connection with the Barcelona attack, remains on the run. Spanish media report that Abouyaaqoub is a 22-year-old Moroccan national.Police released images of four suspects. Three are dead, but Younes Abouyaaqoub remains on the run.Authorities said the terror cell involved in the attacks -- believed to number about 12 members -- has been \"completely dismantled,\" Spanish Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoida said Saturday.Eight of the 12 lived in Ripoll, a city north of Barcelona. Three were arrested, one is unaccounted for, and another is one of the dead suspects, Oukabir. Another arrest was made in the village of Alcanar. CNN reporters went to Oukabir's apartment in Ripoll. A neighbor, Raimon Garcia, said Oukabir was one of four siblings -- two brothers and two sisters. Oukabir's brother, Driss, was among those arrested. He turned himself into police when his identification was found in the Barcelona van, telling authorities he wasn't involved in the attack. A man who claimed to be a cousin of the brothers said Moussa Oukabir was \"brainwashed.\"A woman who lives next to a mosque in the neighborhood told CNN that she had witnessed the Oukabir brothers attending the place of worship \"every day for many years.\" Bulldozer clears rubble in AlcanarThe debris of a house in the village of Alcanar may hold clues about the terror cell's plans.The ruins of the house in Alcanar, a quiet beach town about 125 miles (201 kilometers) south of Barcelona, may hold the key to unraveling the plans and methods of the terror cell.Police suspect the property was being used as a base to make explosives that could have caused even more devastating attacks in Barcelona, Cambrils and possibly elsewhere had they not blown up prematurely.Explosives experts brought in a bulldozer Saturday to clear rubble before conducting a number of controlled explosions at the site in Alcanar's Montecarlo area.Bulldozer arrives #Alcanar to replace machine damaged yesterday in unexpected explosion at bomb-making factory connected to Barcelona attack pic.twitter.com/OUK8RBo71y\u2014 Sarah Tilotta (@stilotta) August 19, 2017\nThe city's vice mayor, Jordi Bort, told CNN the house belonged to a bank and the group had been squatting there illegally without its knowledge.The town is home to a mix of yearlong residents and others who just spend holidays or weekends here, he said. Neighbors said they did not suspect any wrongdoing at the property.The septic tank of the house, which had only one floor, was used as storage for the tanks and explosives, Bort said.Police said Friday there were other \"biological remains\" found at the site, but it is unclear whether they belong to someone other than the person confirmed dead there.Source: Traces of TATP foundWednesday's explosion meant the attackers were unable to use material they were planning to deploy in the attacks, Catalan police Chief Josep Lluis Trapero said Friday. The attack in Barcelona, capital of the Spanish region of Catalonia, was therefore \"more rudimentary than they originally planned,\" Trapero said. Trapero said the suspects in Alcanar had been trying to \"make explosives out of butane gas among other things.\" Source: Early assessment finds TATP at Barcelona attackers' bomb factoryA source briefed on the investigation said a preliminary assessment indicated there were traces of the powerful explosive TATP in the rubble.TATP is made by adding an acid to a mixture of acetone and hydrogen peroxide solution and can easily result in accidental detonation if mistakes occur in the preparation.TATP was used in the November 2015 Paris attacks, the March 2016 Brussels bombings and the May bombing in Manchester, England. Many of those who have successfully made TATP received some form of terrorist training.ISIS issued a formal claim of responsibility for the two attacks Saturday. However, the extremist group did not provide any proof it carried out the attack or provide the names of the attackers or the number of them. There are also inconsistencies between ISIS' statement and the police version of events.Inspector Albert Oliva, a spokesman for Catalan police, told CNN that investigators are still trying to determine what materials were in the home.\"We need to analyze carefully what caused the explosion, the elements that were inside the house,\" Oliva said. Crowds show defiance, solidarityIn Barcelona, crowds returned Saturday to Las Ramblas, a thoroughfare that's a popular tourist destination, and street vendors were once again selling drinks and ice cream from kiosks on the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, close to where Thursday's attack began. Candles, flowers, toys and messages of solidarity are left at a makeshift memorial on Las Ramblas.Residents and visitors paid tribute to the victims of the attack at makeshift memorials, where flowers, candles, toys and messages of support continue to pile up. Catalan resident Marina Balius told CNN: \"The people of Barcelona have united, they have no fear. The Catalans have an expression, 'Your people are our people,' and that has been demonstrated in the aftermath of the attack.\"Muslim women denounce terrorism at a memorial Saturday on Las Ramblas in Barcelona.King Felipe VI, the Spanish head of state, visited wounded survivors of the attack in two hospitals Saturday.The Catalonia region's president, Carles Puigdemont, called for residents to gather at a \"No Fear\" rally on August 26, according to his Twitter account. Using the hashtag #NoTincPor, meaning I am not afraid, Puigdemont said in his tweet the event would be \"a collective manifestation against terror.\" Catalan authorities said 34 nationalities are among the victims in Barcelona, with an American, a Canadian and three Italians named so far among the dead.Security measures are being enhanced in areas where large crowds gather, said Zoida, the interior minister, adding that there does not appear to be an immediate threat of another attack.Spain's threat level will remain at Level 4 following the terror attacks, one down from the maximum, Zoida said.CNN's Isa Soares reported from Alcanar and Mariano Castillo from Atlanta, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

The national ID card also is used for voting.Deguis filed a series of complaints that made it to the country's highest court. In 2013, the court ruled that not only was Deguis not a citizen because of her parents' immigration status, but that all Dominicans born to immigrants parents were not entitled to citizenship.On Friday, human rights promoter Noemi Mendez told the IACHR commissioners that the process to restore citizenship was such a mess that thousands of eligible voters do not have the proper national ID to vote.Plea to human rights commissionThe allegation against the Dominican government is that officials are violating the Inter-American Democratic Charter by holding an election where a segment of the citizens will not be able to participate.The IACHR is a branch of the Organization of American States.\"This segment is the victim of systemic discrimination,\" Mendez said. She accused the government of perpetuating the discrimination and inequality faced by those of Haitian descent.Another witness, Ana Maria Belique, told the story of one candidate for elected office -- a Dominican of Haitian descent -- who was not allowed to run because his papers were not in order.The one thing commissioners want to see: evidence and data to support the claim that Dominicans of Haitian descent stand to become disenfranchised voters, or that all complaints have been resolved.Government: No human rights violationsAt Friday's hearing, which was strictly kept within a one-hour time limit, representatives for the Dominican government said that all citizens of voting age can participate in the upcoming elections, including those of Haitian descent.\"The government's position is that everyone can exercise their political rights, no matter their race or background,\" government representative Mayelin Cordero testified.A Dominican boy of Haitian descent rides his bike in Esperanza, Dominican Republic, in July 2015. Dominicans in this segment of the population are fighting for equal rights.Cordero objected to the civil rights representatives' claim that tens of thousands of Dominicans are still in limbo regarding their nationality.\"All complaints that arose during the legalization process have been resolved,\" Cordero said.She said that the government \"categorically denies that hundreds of thousands of people are stateless.\"Because of time constraints, the commissioners asked questions, but requested that the replies be submitted in writing later.Friday was the final day of week of hearings before the commission. During these sessions, people or groups could present their grievances, though the testimonies are part of specific cases on the issue.These hearings serve to inform the opinions of the commissioners and to provide updates on long-running conflicts. The commission will not directly address the validity of May's election in the Dominican Republic.",

        "content": "Kyiv and Moscow (CNN)Fierce fighting for control of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson left dozens dead as Russia's onslaught against multiple Ukrainian cities intensified Wednesday and fears over the civilian toll mounted.More than 800,000 civilians have fled since the invasion began a week ago, with fears of further casualties increasing as Russian strikes hit built-up areas. Ukraine's State Emergency Service reported \"massive shelling and bombing\" of the central part of Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, on Wednesday morning.In other developments:Sounds of air raid sirens and a new explosion in Kyiv as night falls.Fighting continues in the southern city of Mariupol, with residents reporting heavy shelling overnight.Russian forces moving towards Kyiv, including a large Russian military convoy, \"remain stalled,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Wednesday.Western sanctions are dealing \"serious blows\" to Russia's economy, the Kremlin said. Read MoreOn Wednesday night, CNN teams on the ground heard air raid sirens in Ukraine's third-largest city Odessa and the town of Uman, Ukraine. Meanwhile, in the capital of Kyiv, a major heating pipeline was damaged as a result of a missile strike to the area of the Central Railway station in the evening, the country's interior ministry said. The sound of the blast could be heard across the city, according to a CNN team, though the target of the strike was not clear.  Kyiv's mayor Vitaly Klitschko said preliminary reports suggested there were no casualties in a blast, adding: \"We are clarifying the details.\" Klitschko said in a Telegram post that despite shelling in a number of Kyiv suburbs Wednesday, \"Thank God, there are no casualties.\" \"The enemy was trying to breakthrough to our city, but Ukrainian defenders are repulsing the occupiers and defending our capital.\" It's unclear what caused the blast near the station. An Interior Ministry adviser said the damage was caused by the falling wreckage of a cruise missile after it had been intercepted by Ukrainian air defense systems.Kherson mayor indicates city has fallen  The mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said that the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of \"armed people who came to the city's administration\" -- indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.The announcement on the mayor's Facebook page late Wednesday follows several days of pressure on Kherson by Russian forces who had surrounded the city. Kherson City Council said earlier in the day that least 36 people had been killed in an ongoing battle for control of the area.Kherson is a strategically important city on an inlet from the Black Sea with a population of nearly 300,000. If Kherson is now under Russian control, it would be a significant turning point for the invading military -- the first major city seized. Earlier Wednesday, Ukraine disputed Russian claims of control saying Ukrainians forces were still fighting in parts of the city. The new post said Ukrainian forces had left. The mayor also told the New York Times in an interview that a group of about 10 armed Russian officers, including the commander of forces attacking the city, entered the city hall building Wednesday. He said he was informed by the Russian officers that they were planning to set up a new administration similar to those in two Russian-backed separatist statelets in eastern Ukraine, according to the NY Times interview.Late Wednesday, Hennady Lahuta, the head of Kherson regional administration, issued a message saying: \"I ask everyone who is not at home now, or who is planning to go outside, not to do so. The occupiers are in all areas of the city and are very dangerous.\"'He has decided to destroy the whole world': Six global voices on Putin's invasion of UkraineMayor Kolykhaiev did not explicitly say that the Russians controlled the city, but that \"there were armed visitors in the city executive committee today.\"Strikes in KharkivIn Kharkiv, a Wednesday morning strike on the regional police department and Kharkiv National University left the buildings engulfed by fire, according to Ukraine's State Emergency Service and videos geolocated by CNN. Four people were killed and nine injured, the State Emergency Service said Wednesday, while rescuers pulled 10 people from the rubble.New videos posted to social media early Wednesday and verified by CNN showed badly damaged buildings in western Kharkiv in an area with markets, stores and residential buildings.In Kharkiv's northern neighborhood of Saltivka, a school was the latest site of Russian military strikes on Wednesday, according to a video and photo posted to social media. CNN geolocated and confirmed the authenticity of the video and photo. The school has been the site of repeated strikes in recent days.  Video from the scene shows a large hole in the wall of a school, rubble strewn across a courtyard and broken glass. \"School number 17 of Kharkiv city,\" a voice says in the video.  \"It flew right here, everything is in ruins, everything is fallen out, shell fragments everywhere, everything is in smoke.\" Fighting took place overnight between Russian and Ukrainian forces near a Kharkiv military hospital, the head of the local police told Ukraine's public broadcaster, Suspilne News.\n\nIt's unclear how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war. The UN on Tuesday reported at least 136 civilian deaths since Russia's invasion started, but cautioned the toll is likely \"much higher.\" CNN could not independently verify this figure. Earlier today, Ukraine's State Emergency Service issued a statement claiming more than 2,000 civilians had been killed, before removing it. The Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure.Police officers remove the body Wednesday of a passerby killed in an airstrike that hit Kyiv's main television tower.While the US and NATO allies have aided Ukraine by sharing arms, military equipment and intelligence, as well as imposing severe economic sanctions on Russia, the alliance has thus far made clear it has no plans to send soldiers into Ukrainian territory.Ukraine, which is not a NATO member, has mounted a fierce resistance, but in a rare interview from a Kyiv bunker Tuesday, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that his country -- which has a much smaller military than Russia -- needs more help to prevent the crisis from spreading across Europe. \"I've spoken to Biden many times,\" Zelensky told CNN. \"And I've told them many times that Ukraine will resist and fight stronger than anyone else but on our own against Russia we won't manage it.\"A woman cries outside houses damaged by a Russian airstrike, according to locals, in Gorenka, outside Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, on Wednesday.Onslaught in UkraineAs Russia continued to strike key cities on Wednesday, the humanitarian cost of the invasion is steadily increasing.The International Criminal Court said on Wednesday that it has opened an investigation into alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement that 39 of the court's member states had requested for the investigation to proceed.\"Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced,\" Khan said, noting the investigation will cover incidents in Ukraine from 2013 to the present.Khan said his office \"had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.\" Meanwhile, the number of people fleeing the country continues to rise. The UN said Wednesday it had recorded the arrival of 835,928 refugees from Ukraine since the invasion began on February 24. Of those, more than 450,000 have entered Poland.\"We are looking at what could become Europe's largest refugee crisis this century,\" UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said a day earlier.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update Wednesday that Russia's overall gains had been limited in the past 24 hours, adding this was probably due to \"ongoing logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.\"Russia has continued to target built-up areas with air strikes and heavy artillery, it added, focusing mainly on Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv.A boy sits at an underground metro station used as bomb shelter in Kyiv on March 2, 2022. Russian forces moving towards Kyiv in the northern part of Ukraine, including a 40-mile Russian convoy of tanks, armored vehicles and towed artillery, \"remain stalled,\" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said during a Wednesday briefing.\"They haven't from our best estimates made any appreciable progress in the last 24-36 hours,\" Kirby said of the Russian forces moving towards Kyiv. \"Nothing very significant.\"Kirby said the stall is likely due to a number of factors including Russian forces deliberately \"regrouping themselves and reassessing the progress that they have not made and how to make up the lost time,\" \"logistics and sustainment challenges,\" and \"resistance from the Ukrainians,\" Kirby said.JUST WATCHEDThese maps explain why Putin is invading UkraineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThese maps explain why Putin is invading Ukraine 02:46In Kyiv, sick children are being treated in a hospital's underground bomb shelters. A missile hit a private maternity clinic near the capital on Tuesday, leaving the clinic damaged but still standing, according to the clinic's chief. Separately, a military strike tore through two apartment blocks in a town west of Kyiv.Russian forces also fired rockets that hit near a TV tower. In a statement Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry acknowledged carrying out long-range strikes on communications infrastructure in Ukraine.Russia says its economy is taking 'serious blows' as isolation growsRussian and Ukrainian delegations were set to meet later Wednesday for a new round of talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a call with foreign journalists. He gave no details about the location or format of the discussions.Peskov also acknowledged in the call that the Russian economy was taking \"serious blows\" as a result of sanctions imposed by the West, but said there was a \"certain margin of safety\" and that the economy \"will stay on its feet.\" A Ukrainian presidential aide told CNN the two delegations were expected to comprise the same representatives as in the first round of talks on Monday, held in Belarus near the Ukrainian border. The two sides discussed a potential ceasefire, according to a Ukrainian presidential adviser, but no concrete result emerged.In a Facebook post published Wednesday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia's claims were unchanged during Monday's talks. \"We are ready for talks, we are ready for diplomacy, but we are not in any way ready to accept any Russian ultimatums,\" he added.Anti-tank traps are seen on the outskirts of Odesa, Ukraine, on Tuesday, March 1, 2022. Meanwhile, the international community is stepping up pressure on Putin, leaving Russia increasingly isolated.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that the UK would \"continue to tighten the noose around Putin's regime,\" adding that its use of munitions in civilian areas \"in my view already fully qualifies as a war crime.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe has been \"shaken\" by the war in Ukraine in an address to the nation on Wednesday. \"Our continent, like many aspects of our daily lives, has been shaken by this war and will experience great changes in the months that come,\" Macron said.\"Hundreds and thousands of refugees have been and will be welcomed on the continent of Europe,\" he said, adding that France will \"play its role\" in making sure that the children of Ukrainians who stay in the country to fight will be looked after.Zelensky has urged the international community to do more, calling on the US and NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine or put boots on the ground. But Polish President Andrzej Duda said Tuesday that his country would not send fighter jets to Ukraine \"because that would open military inference in the Ukrainian conflict.\"In his speech Tuesday, Biden reiterated that US would not deploy troops to Ukraine. Instead, American troops were in Europe to \"defend our NATO allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west,\" Biden said.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Natalie Gall\u00f3n, Paul P.

        "content": "(CNN)Explosions have been seen and heard in parts of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, as the fight by Ukrainian forces to hold back a Russian advance on the capital intensifies in the early hours of Saturday morning, amid warnings the city could fall within days and as officials handed out weapons to reservists.\"This night will be very difficult, and the enemy will use all available forces to break the resistance of Ukrainians,\" President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a late-night video message Friday. \"This night we have to stand ground. The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.\"Earlier Saturday, videos from eyewitnesses showed explosions taking place in an area north-west of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. There is a military base in the area.CNN teams in the capital also reported hearing loud explosions to the west and south of the city Saturday. Shortly afterward, Ukraine's State Service of Special Communications said clashes are underway in an eastern suburb as well -- as Russian forces close in on the capital from multiple sides.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian armed forces reported heavy fighting around the city of Vasylkiv, some 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv. Read More\"Heavy fighting is currently underway in the town of Vasylkiv in the Kyiv region, where the occupiers are trying to land a landing party,\" the armed forces said.Russian forces are close to Kyiv, Zelensky confirmed in his message Friday, advancing on the capital from the north and east after seizing control Thursday of an airbase just north of the city. But \"Ukrainians resist the Russian aggression heroically,\" he said. Russia's military claimed earlier Friday its forces had staged a \"successful landing operation\" to capture Hostomel airfield, viewed as strategically important, on Kyiv's outskirts. Zelensky's comments came hours after a video was posted on his Facebook page, showing him with a group of men, saying, \"We are here. We are in Kyiv. We are defending Ukraine.\" Before dawn Friday, explosions lit up the sky above the capital as Russia targeted the city with missile strikes, according to a Ukrainian government adviser. A CNN team reported hearing two large blasts in central Kyiv and a third loud explosion in the distance, followed by at least three more explosions to the south-west of the city a few hours later.\"Strikes on Kyiv with cruise or ballistic missiles continued,\" Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine told reporters via text message Friday. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said Russian reconnaissance troops had entered the Obolon district of northern Kyiv, just a few miles from the city center. Videos from the area showed chaotic scenes as civilians tried to hide from small arms fire. LIVE UPDATES ON INVASIONUkrainian military vehicles move past Independence Square in central Kyiv on February 24, 2022.A tweet from the ministry asked citizens of the district to report any suspicious movements, adding: \"Make Molotov cocktails and take down the occupier.\"CNN witnessed a group of Ukrainian security forces leave the city police headquarters with weapons and ammunition -- apparently heading towards Obolon. Meanwhile, 92 people working at the Chernobyl power plant, the site of the world's worst-ever nuclear disaster, have been taken hostage, the Ukrainian ambassador to the US said Friday. Russian forces took control of the site on Thursday, sparking fears that the fighting could interfere with the operation of nuclear waste facilities.  As Russian troops advance, US intelligence officials are concerned that Kyiv could fall under Russian control within days, according to two sources familiar with the latest intelligence.However, the latest British defense intelligence assessment said Russia had made \"limited progress\" Friday in its attack.\"Fighting continues in key locations. Russia has made limited progress so far today and Ukraine retains control of key cities. Ukrainian MOD reports that Russian forces have arrived in the suburbs of Kyiv,\" the UK Ministry of Defence tweeted.A senior US defense official told reporters that the Russians have \"about a third of their combat power\" in Ukraine out of the total combat power they have amassed on the country's borders right now, but \"that does not mean that they will not commit more.\"The Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier said that airborne assault troops blew up a bridge over the Teteriv River at Ivankiv, about 30 miles north of Kyiv, successfully preventing a Russian column of forces from advancing towards the capital, which has a population of close to 3 million. A Ukrainian firefighter walks between fragments of a downed aircraft in Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, February 25, 2022. It was unclear what aircraft crashed and what brought it down.For now, Ukraine's democratically elected government remains intact but President Volodymr Zelensky warned in a video address late Thursday that \"enemy sabotage groups\" had entered this city and he is their No. 1 target. \"They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state,\" he said. \"Russian forces continued to launch missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine. They say that they are only targeting military facilities, but these are lies. In fact, they do not distinguish in which areas they operate,\" he said. \"Such attacks on our capital haven't occurred since 1941.\"In an address Friday morning, Zelensky said Ukrainians were \"showing their true heroism\" but that they were defending their country \"alone.\" The sanctions imposed on Russia by Western powers are \"not enough to get these foreign troops off our soil,\" he said.A few hours later, Zelensky released a message in which he again called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold direct talks. \"There is fighting all over Ukraine now. Let's sit down at the negotiation table to stop the people's deaths,\" he said, speaking in Russian.Shortly afterward, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was ready to send a delegation to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, for talks with Ukraine, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported.\"As you know, today the President of Ukraine Zelensky announced his readiness to discuss the neutral status of Ukraine,\" Peskov said, according to RIA. The talks would concern \"neutral status,\" he suggested. Peskov said later Friday that the Ukrainian side had countered with a proposal to meet in Warsaw and then dropped contact. Zelensky has not directly proposed neutral status but has signaled a willingness to discuss it, while insisting his country be provided security guarantees. \"Ukraine has been and remains ready to talk about a ceasefire and peace. This is our constant position,\" Sergii Nykyforov, a spokesperson for Zelensky, said late Friday. He also denied what he called \"claims that we have refused to negotiate.\" Ukraine and Russia's militaries are David and Goliath. Here's how they compareMeanwhile, Putin called on Ukraine's armed forces to overthrow their government in remarks to his security council Friday. \"Do not let Banderites (Ukrainian nationalists) and neo-Nazis use your children, wives and old people as human shields,\" Putin said in remarks aired on Russian state television. \"Take power into your own hands, it looks like it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis that has settled in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.\"Putin frequently repeats the baseless and inaccurate claim that the democratically elected Ukrainian government is a \"Nazi\" or \"fascist\" regime. The language has been roundly condemned internationally, especially considering that Zelensky is Jewish. Asked by CNN at a news conference Friday what Moscow's plans were for the leadership of Ukraine as Russian forces advance on Kyiv, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov replied: \"Nobody is going to attack the people of Ukraine.\"In an interview with CNN on the streets of Kyiv, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko accused Putin of being \"simply crazy\" in wanting to \"come here to kill Ukrainians\" -- and vowed they would resist. \"We demonstrate a unique quality that we can stand against Russian aggression,\" he said.A photograph taken on February 24, 2022 shows an Ukrainian infantry combat vehicle standing guard on the outskirts of Kyiv.Homes damagedThe advance on Kyiv comes only a day after Russian forces entered Ukraine from three sides, by land, sea and air, prompting a barrage of international condemnation and sanctions -- and questions about Putin's wider ambitions for the country and its capital.It's unclear how long Ukrainian forces can resist the advance of Russian forces who are much better equipped and have superior air power.Two residential buildings in Kyiv suffered damage in the early hours of Friday, but it's not clear if they were intentionally struck or hit by debris, or if anyone was injured. Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin told CNN a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet was shot down over Kyiv. Photos tweeted by the emergency forces appear to show a fire at a two-story private house with debris from what looks to be a plane nearby. It is unclear if the house was hit by remnants of the jet.Separately, images showed firefighters working to put out a blaze at an apartment building on the left bank of the city.

        "content": "Kiev, Ukraine and Minsk, Belarus (CNN)Security forces shattered the early morning calm of the lakeside Soviet-era resort outside the Belarusian capital of Minsk, bursting in to arrest 32 Russian mercenaries. It was less than two weeks before Belarus' presidential election last year, and authorities suspected that the outsiders had been sent from Russia to interfere.  The men were indeed part of a mission. But the target was not Belarus, and they were not under orders from any Russian entity.  They were being set up. The 32, along with one other man detained in southern Belarus, were the target of an elaborate intelligence sting by Ukraine, with the knowledge and alleged support of the United States.Video released by the Belarusian KGB, State TV and Radio Company of Belarus showed Russian men being detained.Three former high-ranking Ukrainian military intelligence officials described exclusively to CNN how they orchestrated the extraordinary operation aimed at luring suspected war criminals out of Russia to face prosecution for atrocities committed in eastern Ukraine where separatists backed by Moscow have been fighting for years.Read MoreFirst, the Ukrainian agents posed as a Russian private military company, recruiting for security jobs that paid above the going rate, offering a lucrative $5,000 a month contract to protect Venezuelan oil facilities, CNN was told by the men, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the sensitive operation.That bait was taken by hundreds of would-be Russian contractors who applied for work, the sources said, giving Ukrainian intelligence an unprecedented opportunity to begin to identify and reel in those suspected of war crimes.\"We started to call them and say, 'Hey, man, OK, tell me something about yourself. Maybe you are not really a fighter, maybe you are a plumber or something like that,'\" one of the former military intelligence officers told CNN of the vetting calls to applicants.     \"And then they started to reveal things about themselves, sending us documents, military IDs and proof of where they'd fought. And we are, like, 'bingo, we can use that,'\" the source added.   In other words, according to the intelligence officers, the targets themselves started to send in evidence of who they were, their military experience and even the particular battles and incidents in which they had been involved, including IDs, and potentially incriminating photos and videos of their exploits in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere.   Remnants of a downed Ukrainian army aircraft lie near Luhansk, Ukraine, in June 2014. Ukrainian officials said it was shot down by pro-Russian separatists, killing all 49 service personnel on board.One video, shared with CNN by the former military intelligence sources, captures a group of rebel fighters in eastern Ukraine holding up the wreckage of a military aircraft that the sources said had just been shot down, a crime designated as terrorism in Ukraine.     Other applicants linked themselves to the attack on MH17, the Malaysian Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down in July 2014 over Ukrainian territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. All 298 people aboard the aircraft died. A Dutch-led team of international prosecutors said the plane was downed by a missile brought in from Russia and fired from a village controlled by separatists. Russia has denied any involvement.The reconstructed wreckage of Flight MH17 is seen behind presiding judge Hendrik Steenhuis, one of a team of judges and lawyers who assessed the evidence around the tragedy.\"There were two who were present when the missile that downed MH17 was launched. Four others were members of a group responsible for shooting down our military aircraft and killing at least 70 of our best men,\" a second former Ukrainian military intelligence source told CNN.  \"Identifying and punishing these people was of high interest to us,\" he added.      It was apparently of interest to US intelligence too, although US officials deny having a direct role. According to the Ukrainian intelligence officials, the Ukrainian-led operation got US cash, technical assistance and advice from the CIA on how to draw the Russian mercenaries in.      A senior US official told CNN those claims are \"false.\"     He indicated US intelligence was aware of the operation but denied any involvement. The official, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, suggested efforts to implicate US agencies may be an attempt to share, or even pass, blame for what was a high-risk Ukrainian operation that went wrong. CNN spent weeks in Ukraine, verifying and reviewing accounts of the operation and speaking to the men who were on the inside.  Posing as a private military company made sense -- military contractors linked to the Kremlin, have become a well-known aspect of life for Russian veterans.  JUST WATCHEDMeet 'Oleg,' the chain-smoking former Wagner mercenaryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet 'Oleg,' the chain-smoking former Wagner mercenary 04:19CNN has previously tracked Russian mercenaries operating in Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria and Mozambique among other countries. Often the soldiers-for-hire work for Wagner, a major private military company that's allegedly linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though Prigozhin denies the connections. The announcement of the arrests at the Minsk resort by Belarusian authorities said the detained men worked for Wagner.With their website recruitment ruse going undetected, Ukrainian intelligence officials simply picked those men with the closest and most controversial links to Ukraine and offered them the fake Venezuela contracts, the sources said.     They picked 28 Russians allegedly linked to illegal acts in Ukraine and five more without connections to allay any suspicions, they said.   The Russians were told they would be flown to Turkey for a flight connection to Caracas. The real plan was to get them to Ukraine where they could be arrested, the sources told CNN.  Belarus was seeing tense protests and clashes ahead of the presidential election when the Russians arrived in Minsk.The coronavirus pandemic threw an unexpected wrench in the plan when Russia closed its borders to stop the spread of Covid-19. Moscow did, however, continue to permit travel to its neighbor and ally Belarus. According to the Ukrainian sources, the unwitting recruits were transported overland to Minsk by bus, from where they thought they would soon depart for Venezuela.   But once in Minsk, there was a delay. The recruits were told it would be a few days before they could leave and were moved to the Belorusochka Sanatorium, a discreet Soviet-era health resort set on a tranquil reservoir 15 minutes outside the capital, where, the sources said, it was hoped they could remain undetected.  The Russian mercenaries traveled to the Belorusochka resort to wait out a delay, the sources told CNN.The burly mercenaries at the spa that promises \"comfort and coziness\" amid the \"absence of city fuss and everyday worries\" seemed incongruous if not suspicious, one staffer remembered.  \"Yes, I remember, I met them,\" a security guard told CNN last month. \"They spent a couple of days here. They didn't do anything to disturb us,\" he said, adding that the arrests were a surprise. \"People come here because there's a beautiful reservoir on the other side of the sanatorium,\" he said.  The lakeside Belorusochka resort is only a short drive from the heart of the Belarusian capital.The delay was long enough for the Belarusian security services to act, just hours before the group was due to fly out, according to CNN's sources.At the time, some suspected Russian involvement. In dramatic scenes, broadcast on Belarusian state TV, the arrested men were paraded on screen, and their identification documents shown as evidence of their Russian military backgrounds.  \"We got confirmed intel these Russians had real combat experience, and actually took part in armed conflicts,\" an unnamed, heavily disguised Belarusian police commander revealed on state TV.      Belarusian authorities first believed the arrest of the Russians prevented them interfering in the country's presidential elections.A former presidential adviser in Belarus told CNN on the condition of anonymity that Belarusian authorities initially did believe the group had been sent to Belarus by the Russians to destabilize the country ahead of upcoming elections.He told CNN there was confusion in Minsk over what seemed to be aggression from their Russian allies.  The Kremlin seemed caught off guard too, with its spokesman telling Russian media they \"did not have complete information\" about the incident. The Kremlin later denied they had sent the men to interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky got involved too, calling for the extradition of the men to Ukraine during a telephone conversation with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko just days after the arrests. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, center, attends an urgent security meeting after the arrest of the mercenaries.\"I hope that all suspects in terrorist activities on the territory of Ukraine will be transferred to us for prosecution in accordance with the current international legal documents,\" Zelensky said, according to a readout of the call.  A couple of days later, Lukashenko rejected that request. He spoke to Putin and both leaders \"expressed confidence that the situation would be resolved,\" a Kremlin statement said.  A week on from that call, Russia announced the return of the 32 Russians arrested at the sanatorium. The 33rd man, who was a dual national of Belarus and Russia, stayed in Belarus.President Zelensky of Ukraine has publicly denied there was a Ukrainian operation, telling Ukrainian TV in June 2021 that his country had been \"dragged into\" the issue.  \"I understand that the idea of this operation was the idea of, let's say, other countries, definitely not Ukraine,\" he said.    Ukrainian officials did not respond to CNN's request for a comment for this story.The arrests brought a premature end to the planned sting, Ukrainian officials told CNN.But according to CNN's Ukrainian sources, the failure was a serious blow to Ukrainian intelligence who they say had worked on hooking the Russian suspects for close to 18 months.  \"If these people would have ended up here in Ukraine, the details of their criminal acts would have become known around the world,\" one of the sources told CNN.\"Ukraine could have brought them to justice and shown that our fight with Russia is serious and that we won't raise our hands in surrender,\" the source added.

So they are forecast to get about two-thirds of a month of rainfall throughout this event,\" he said.",

        "content": "(CNN)A second wave of Covid-19 is ripping through Brazil, pushing hospitals and ICUs toward collapse and claiming record numbers of daily deaths.While a new variant of the coronavirus spreads throughout the country, many Brazilians continue to defy mask mandates mobility restrictions following the example of President Jair Bolsonaro, who recently said people need to \"stop being sissies\" and \"whining\" about the virus.The consequences of that combination are deadly, experts say. \"We are going through the worst-case scenario since the beginning of the pandemic. You just have to look at the trends in the average number of deaths,\" Gonzalo Vecina Neto, a Sao Paulo University professor of Public Health, recently told Reuters television. \"This could have been avoided and the most important factor is gatherings.\"Brazil has broken its own record three times this month for number of deaths in a 24-hour period. On Wednesday, Brazil's Health Ministry registered a devastating new high -- 2,286 lives lost to the virus. In total, more than 270,000 people are known to have died due to Covid-19, making Brazil's the second-highest national death toll after the United States. A healthcare worker arrives in an ambulance bringing a patient to HRAN Hospital in Brasilia, Brazil on March 8.In 22 of Brazil's 26 states, ICU occupancy has surpassed 80%. In the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, hospital patients must line up to wait for beds as occupancy rates in intensive care units soar past 103%. The neighboring state of Santa Catarina has already surpassed 99% occupancy and is on the verge of collapsing, as cases surge throughout the state.Read MoreOne hospital in Santa Catarina's capital, Florianopolis, is already beyond capacity. David Molin, the hospital's head nurse, tells CNN his team is exhausted and overwhelmed.\"I was here during the first wave and it wasn't like this. We are completely overwhelmed, with our occupancy rate at over 100%. Many of those patients who are waiting for an ICU don't make it,\" Molina told CNN during a telephone interview.Health workers blame gatheringsMolina and other health care workers blame the recent surge of Covid-19 cases on larges parties and gatherings that began around New Year's Eve and continued through the pre-Lent carnival holiday and into today. Many of these were held in defiance of local city and state restrictions.Last week, Rio de Janeiro's Mayor Eduardo Paes announced a new curfew for bars and restaurants throughout the city, limiting hours of operation from 6:00 am to 5:00 pm. But hundreds of people stayed out anyway -- 230 curfew-related fines and closures were issued from Friday to Saturday alone, according to the city government. At one bar, more than 200 mostly-maskless partygoers were found at a party that had been going for seven hours, reported CNN affiliate CNN Brasil.Many municipal and state health officials and lawmakers blame Bolsonaro's government for undermining their efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus. And the country's National Council of Health Secretaries (CONASS) has asked the federal government to adopt stricter measures to support hospitals and enforce social distancing.A health worker cares for a COVID-19 patient at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Ronaldo Gazolla Public Municipal Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on March 5, 2021.\"The health system in Brazil is on the verge of collapse,\" Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria told CNN's Becky Anderson during a recent interview. \"There is no national coordination to combat the pandemic in Brazil. It would be important for the President and the governors to send the same message to the population, but this unfortunately, doesn't happen in Brazil.The issue of social distancing measures and lockdowns has become a political football in Brazil. While Doria ordered nonessential businesses to close for two weeks in his state last weekend, Bolsonaro claims that such restrictions sink Brazil's economy and lead to an increase of suicides and depression. He has made disobeying health guidance a point of pride, congratulating agricultural workers at an event last week for not staying home \"like cowards.\"\"We have to face our problems. Stop being sissies, enough whining, how long are they going to keep on crying? We have to confront the problems, respecting the elderly, those with illnesses, chronic conditions. But where is Brazil going to end up if we all stop?\" he said.This week, Bolsonaro declared that he had the \"power\" to declare a national lockdown -- but would never do so. \"My army is not going to force the people to stay at home,\" he said.Fears over new variantWith Brazilian hospitals overloaded and government officials divided over lockdown measures, the country has few defenses against a coronavirus variant that may be even more contagious.A preprint of a new modelling study by researchers in Brazil and the UK suggests the variant first detected in the northern city of Manaus late last year, known as P.1, may be up to 2.2 times more transmissible.The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, suggests that even people who have already had the coronavirus could be vulnerable. The same study showed that the P.1 variant could evade immunity from previous Covid-19 infection by up to 61%.That variant is now prevalent in Covid-19 patients across at least six Brazilian states, according to a study earlier this month released by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), a Brazilian Ministry of Health research institution. P.1 has also been detected in the United States, United Kingdom and neighboring Venezuela.\"The emergence of new variants, which combine both the potential to be more transmissible and the absence of broad and articulated mitigation and suppression measures, are highly worrisome,\" the study's authors wrote, urging Brazil to encourage behaviors that limit the viral spread.\"The data showing the prevalence of this variant in several states and its ample spread throughout the country, as well as the challenges presented due to its high level of transmission, reinforce the immediate need to adopt non-pharmaceutical measures in order to reduce the speed or its spread and the increases in cases.\"Traveling to Brazil during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goFelipe Naveca, virologist and researcher at Fiocruz Amazonia and one of the main authors of the study, told CNN that the Covid-19 virus and the different variants and strains are likely to get stronger if not stopped.\"This is what viruses do: They evolve, they get stronger. The only way to stop it is to contain its spread, which  is why we need restrictive measures --  there is no other solution. Even if the Government decrees a national lockdown, we need the population to adhere. The action of each one of us will impact everyone as a whole,\" Naveca said.   VaccinationHope could be on its way, in the form of vaccines. But Brazil's vaccination rollout was slow in comparison to other countries, including others in the region, like Chile and Mexico.In January, health regulator Anvisa authorized emergency use of vaccines by Sinovac and Oxford/AstraZeneca. Since then, roughly 4% of Brazil's 211 million citizens have received at least one vaccine dose, according to data from the Brazilian Health Ministry, and 2.3 million have had two doses.According to the Health Ministry, Brazil is in negotiation to buy Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen, Sputinik and Covaxin vaccines as well, though only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine among those has been granted authorization from Anvisa.   Bolsonaro had long promoted the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine as the only one he would back, dismissing and discrediting many of the other vaccines on the market, including Pfizer's. Brazil's health minister Eduardo Pazuello even turned down an August offer from Pfizer to purchase up to 70 million doses of its vaccine.\"Pfizer says this very clearly on the contract, 'we are not responsible for any collateral side effects' - if you turn into an alligator it's your problem,\" Bolsonaro said in December. \"If you become Superman, or grow a beard as a woman, or a man's voice becomes high pitched, they say they have nothing to do with that.\"Former Brazilian President Lula attacks Bolsonaro as his path to a political comeback clearsBut a New England Journal of Medicine study now suggests that the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine could \"efficiently\" neutralize the P.1 variant. The news came as Bolsonaro held a virtual meeting Monday with Pfizer Global CEO Albert Bourla and other executives to negotiate the purchase of 100 million vaccines.\"I thank you for this meeting and we recognize Pfizer as a great world company,\" Bolsonaro said, during an excerpt of the meeting posted to his official Twitter account. \"We would like to close these deals with you, even more given the aggressiveness of this virus in Brazil.\" For now, Brazil's failure to contain the virus is increasingly a cautionary tale for the world. Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program, said at a briefing last week that he worried the country's surge in cases could be repeated elsewhere.\"The story in Brazil can be and will be repeated elsewhere if we stop implementing the measures as we need to implement them,\" he said. \"Countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we're not careful.\"For Molina, the exhausted Santa Catarina nurse, Brazil's future seems bleaker than ever.\"Unfortunately, I don't think we've learned our lesson,\" Molina said. \"We [health workers] are tired, exhausted and are getting sick. We feel powerless. We need a more coordinated action if we're going to keep this from happening again.Journalist Marcia Reverdosa reported from Sao Paulo and CNN's Flora Charner reported from Atlanta.",

        "content": "(CNN)A Brazilian court blocked government's move to revoke key regulations protecting the country's tropical mangroves after the move was fiercely criticized by environmental and climate groups.  The decision by the court came just a day after Brazil's National Environment Council, known as Conama, voted to overturn the measures that had defined the ecosystems along Brazil's coastline as \"permanent preservation areas\" and restricted commercial development projects. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles defended the move and said the changes provided greater \"balance\" in order to protect the environment. \"This government is concerned with the environment, with people and with sustainable economic development,\" Salles told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil during an interview Monday. \"You can't create legislation that is so excessive that it asphyxiates the economic sector completely.\"Federal judge Maria Amelia Almeida Senos de Carvalho overturned the decision Tuesday, saying the repeal of violated the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced environment. \"Considering the evident risk of irretrievable damage to the environment, I defer the anticipation of the effects of the protection to suspend the effects of the revocation,\" she said in the judgment.  Tens of thousands of fires are pushing the Amazon to a tipping pointMangroves are trees and shrubs that grow along tropical coastlines. They are rooted underwater in salty sediments, thriving in conditions few other plants can withstand. They tend to have large root systems that protect coastal areas from erosion and act as a bridge between the ocean and land. They are a home to numerous species of sea birds and are considered \"nursery habitats\" because they provide safe haven for young fish, crabs and shrimp. Read MoreCrucially, mangroves are also some of the world's most effective carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide per area than rainforests. By removing the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere, mangroves are playing an important part in climate change mitigation. According to the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, mangroves, sea grasses and other marine living organisms capture more than half of the world's biological carbon. The commission estimates that these ecosystems absorb the equivalent of more than half of the emissions from the entire global transport sector each year.Mangroves are very effective at storing carbon.Critics said removing the protections by Brazil would endanger an essential part of the global fight against climate change and the preservation of Brazil's Atlantic coastline. Greenpeace said the decision was an example of \"calculated environmental destruction\" in Brazil.Carlos Bocuhy, the president of the Brazilian Institute of Environmental Protection (PROAM), called it the \"worst attack\" carried out by the Federal Government against the environment.\"As the world witnesses the exponential burning of the Amazon and the Pantanal region, two of the world's richest and most important biomes, in shock -- Conama now opens the door to eliminate the rules that protect the mangroves and vegetation of our country's coastline,\" Bocuhy wrote in an op-ed.Bocuhy, who had previously been a member of the National Environment Council, was removed last year when the government reduced the seats from 96 members to 23.Bocuhy and others said the reducation was done, partially, in order for the federal government to have ultimate majority over the Council that is a key voice in the country's environmental regulations.Is the Amazon safe in Bolsonaro's hands?The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for its approach to environmental regulations. In May, a video of a governmental meeting showed Salles, the environment minister, saying that the government should take advantage of the media's focus on the Covid-19 pandemic to loosen the environmental restrictions. The video from April 22 was disclosed during an investigation by the Supreme Court into allegations that Bolsonaro was trying to interfere with the Federal Police.The quote from Salles caught the media's attention. \"There is a need to have an effort on our side here, while we are at this moment of tranquility in terms of press coverage, because it only talks about Covid, and let the cattle herd run and change all the rules and simplifying standards,\" he said.Mangroves growing in the south of Brazil's Boipeba island have extensive root systems.Later, in an exclusive interview with CNN Brasil, Salles defended his stance saying it was aimed at reducing bureaucracy. \"What I defended in the meeting were regulations that do not need to go through Congress [to be approved],\" he said. Bolsonaro has also rejected criticism of his government's environmental policy, even as data from his own agency shows a growing problem, especially in the Amazon and the Pantanal.Coronavirus and deforestation rip through Brazil's people and the world's lungs In 2019, his first year in office, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) counted 126,089 fires in the Amazon -- a rise of nearly 40% over the year before he took office. And despite a government ban on fires in the Amazon imposed in mid-July, INPE reported more fires in August and September than in the same period a year ago. INPE data also showed fires raging in the Pantanal, home to alligators, jaguars and many other animals. By mid-September, it had registered 16,119 heat spots in Pantanal in 2020, the most since 1998, when the institute started keeping record.Yet Bolsonaro has remained defiant.  Addressing UN member states in a pre-recorded address last week, Bolsonaro accused foreign actors of a \"brutal disinformation campaign\" about the supposed degradation of the Amazon as well as Brazil's Pantanal wetlands.",

        "content": "(CNN)Brazil has now reported more than 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus and 48,954 deaths, marking a grim milestone for the South American country. The health ministry on Friday reported 54,771 new cases, a record daily spike that brought the nationwide total to 1,032,913.The Covid-19 pandemic is quickly spreading with no sign of slowing down, as major cities lift social distancing measures and begin reopening restaurants, shops and other nonessential businesses. Many experts believe the number of cases could surpass the United States and that Brazil may soon become the country worst hit by the virus.Despite this, President Jair Bolsonaro continues to downplay the threat by questioning global medical authorities and accusing opponents of trying to discredit his leadership. Read MoreBolsonaro's false sense of immunity At first, Brazil seemed impervious to the virus as it spread through countries such as China, Italy and the United States. Bolsonaro only grudgingly agreed to repatriate Brazilian citizens from the then-epicenter, Hubei province, reportedly worrying that they would put the rest of the country at risk.The first case was confirmed on February 26, when it was believed to be an isolated case of a man who flew back from Italy to Sao Paulo with the virus. A month later, coronavirus cases in Brazil had already risen to close to 3,000 and the death toll was at 77. Brazilian care home creates 'hug tunnel' so loved ones can embrace elderly relativesIt was around this time when Bolsonaro first compared the virus to a \"little flu\" and falsely implied that Brazilians were immune to the virus. \"Brazilians don't catch anything ... they already have the antibodies to keep it from spreading,\" the President said.He said again that Brazilians are likely to be immune to the coronavirus during a March 26 press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. \"Brazilians should be studied, we don't catch anything. You see people jumping in sewage, diving in it and nothing happens to them,\" Bolsonaro said.During the same press conference, Bolsonaro said he believed many Brazilians had already been infected but that those people already had \"the antibodies that would help [coronavirus] not spread.\"Bolsonaro vs. Social Distancing Cases began to quickly spread across the country and it became clear that Brazil would soon become a new hot spot for the virus. By April 8, Brazil had confirmed more than 15,000 cases and 800 deaths. Despite warnings from health experts, images of Bolsonaro hugging supporters at a local bakery in Brasilia and posing without a mask emerged the following day. Bolsonaro believed the social distancing and quarantine measures imposed by officials in major cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, would cause more harm than the virus itself and lead Brazil to a crippling recession.  JUST WATCHEDImages show how coronavirus is overrunning Rio's hospitalsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHImages show how coronavirus is overrunning Rio's hospitals 02:14\"The issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can't let the side-effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,\" Bolsonaro said.Bolsonaro frequently butted heads with mayors and governors of some of the hardest hit places by Covid-19 and ultimately fired Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on April 16 after he expressed his support for shutting down businesses and schools. The following weekend, Bolsonaro attended an anti-lockdown rally in Brasilia without a mask where he coughed several times and shook hands with supporters. Opposition leaders considered the protests \"anti-democratic,\" after signs were seen calling for dissolving the Congress and Supreme Court and for the return of the dictatorship.  Military in the Health MinistryHealth Minister Mandetta's successor, Nelson Teich, lasted less than a month in office before resigning. One of his major disagreements with Bolsonaro was over authorizing the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. Eduardo Pazuello, an army general with no health experience, was named as the interim Health Minister following Teich's resignation. A few days after he assumed the role, he began replacing key positions within the ministry with other military brass. At least nine people were named within the first few weeks that he took office, to positions within the ministry dealing with planning, budget and public health issues. A woman walks amid symbolic graves on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach. They were dug by activists protesting the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Pazuello also issued new guidance authorizing the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for all patients displaying Covid-19 symptoms.\"After two Health Ministers refused to do so and chose to resign instead of signing the document, it was up to General Eduardo Pazuello, who has assumed the ministry on an interim basis, to authorize the use of chloroquine for all Covid-19 patients,\" Pazuello wrote on his personal Twitter account last month.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked permissions this week for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. That same day, Brazil's Health Ministry expanded its guidance on the use of the drugs to include pregnant women and children. The Health Ministry said the studies referenced by the FDA cannot be used as an example for the rest of the world because the \"quality of the methodology is terrible\" and claimed cases of Covid-19 were going down in areas where the drugs were being used, without presenting any proof.  The recommendation to use the drugs to treat children came despite guidance from the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, saying there isn't enough data to prove the drugs' effectiveness in minors and that it should only be prescribed during clinical trials and with parental consent. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that it is still reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in its Solidarity Trial, a multi-country clinical study of Covid-19 treatment options. The organization had temporarily paused the trial in May due to concerns surrounding the drug's safety and in order to review its own data but resumed the program earlier this month.Bolsonaro threatens to withdraw from WHO Earlier this month, WHO called on nations to encourage the public to wear fabric masks in public. \"WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing on June 5. WHO's updated guidance recommends masks be used as part of a \"comprehensive package\" to help curb the spread of Covid-19, which includes physical distancing, frequent hand washing, people who are sick self-isolating at home, suspected cases getting tested, and their contacts being traced.Bolsonaro accused threatened to pull Brazil from the WHO that same evening and accused the organization of \"ideological bias.\"Investigations launched after Bolsonaro tells Brazilians to inspect hospitals themselves\"The United States left the WHO. We are considering that that also. Either the organization works without ideological bias, or we leave it too,\" Bolsonaro told reporters. \"We don't need foreign people having a say in our health here.\" Bolsonaro doubled-down on his attacks on the organization recently, after he accused it of trying to drive Brazil towards an economic recession. \"The so-called World Health Organization, wants us to follow them blindly. First, they say that asymptomatic people cannot transmit the virus then they go back on their comment. It seems like there is something more serious behind all that, they want our countries to go broke,\" Bolsonaro said during a press conference outside the Alvorada residence last Wednesday, referencing a WHO admission that asymptomatic transmission was a \"major unknown.\"\"The amount of economic problems this is going to cause will be huge, to the point of leaving Brazil broke,\" he said, repeating his oft-mentioned worry that the economic impact of the virus will be worse than the death toll.Triage vs. shutdownInstead of enforcing social distancing measures, his health minister General Pazuello has advocated for setting up more health triage centers across the country. There is no such thing as \"100% isolation,\" he recently told CNN Brasil.Cities across Brazil began gradually reopening last week. In major metropolitan areas, like Sao Paulo, malls and outdoor bazaars reopened for the first time in three months. Large crowds and traffic were reported in the bustling city center over the weekend by local media outlets. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro greets supporters upon arrival at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, on May 24.Officials insist the decision is based on improving conditions, like increasing availability of intensive care beds and a flattening infection curve in some places. But experts say the conditions to reopen are far from ideal and worry the rush could lead to more transmissions and postpone a real recovery.  \"You need to tackle the transportation issue. If everyone continues to take crowded buses and metro, which is what is happening, it won't work,\" said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.Shortly after Sao Paulo began reopening, Mayor Bruno Covas was diagnosed with coronavirus last Saturday. Covas, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment for lymphoma, displayed no symptoms, according to a statement from the mayor's office. The statement also said Covas will be working from home and remain under observation. Invading hospitals and Covid-19 warsRecent studies conducted by the non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies found that the country could run out of health professionals and intensive care unit (ICU) beds soon. More than 60% of Brazil's population depends on the country's public health care system and at least 10% of Brazilians live in areas where there are no ICU beds available, according to the Institute. \"The response to the pandemic could not have been any worse,\" Miguel Lago, a lecturer at Columbia University and executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, told CNN. \"This was not Sierra Leone before the Ebola crisis, Brazil had a solid public health care system that could have been put to better use at the beginning of the pandemic.\"  Nurse leader accuses Brazil of sacrificing medics to coronavirusA CNN team recently visited hospitals in the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus where health professionals shared horror stories of overcrowded ICU units and doctors and nurses treating patients at high risk of exposure and death. \"It's not a flu. It's the worst thing we have ever faced in our professional lives,\" Dr. Jacques Sztajnbok from Sao Paulo's Emilio Ribas Infectious Disease Institute told CNN. Yet, Bolsonaro continues to question the claims that more is needed and that ICUs and hospitals are overcrowded, recently encouraging his supporters to go into the facilities to gather some video proof.  \"There are field hospitals and public hospitals near you, find a way to get in and film in there,\" Bolsonaro said last Thursday during a Facebook live event. \"We need more people to go in there and show if these beds are actually full. That helps us and all that material gathered from social media will then be sent to the Federal Police.\" Several instances of pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers and supporters trying to gain access to coronavirus treatment wards have recently been registered in the states of Sao Paulo, Espirito Santo and the Federal District, where the capital Brasilia is located. \"This type of behavior is unacceptable at a time when the state of Espirito Santo, the country and the world face this serious crisis,\" the state health secretariat said in a written statement. \"What's worse is that this behavior was encouraged by an irresponsible statement from the leader of this nation.\" Brazil's Attorney General Augusto Aras said he will call on state prosecutors offices to investigate the incidents, including claims of medical professionals being threatened and assaulted, according to a statement released by his office Monday. \"This behavior endangers the physical integrity of the brave professionals who dedicate themselves to reversing a health crisis unprecedented in the country's history,\" Aras said in the press release. Brazil inches towards highest virus death tollBrazil could overtake the US and become the country with the highest number of coronavirus deaths as early as August 1, according to a tracking model by the University of Washington. The model also predicts deaths will more than double to 100,000 in less than a month. \"I think we will pass the United States I think we will be the major victim of Covid-19 and this is directly linked to the fact that we don't have a national plan,\" Lago told CNN. Brazil's cases have been increasing by roughly 30,000 cases a day and deaths around 1,200 per day.  Earlier this month, an official Covid-19 tracker from the Brazilian Health Ministry began showing only data on new cases and deaths recorded in the past 24 hours, eliminating running cumulative totals of virus deaths and cases that had previously appeared on the same page. Bolsonaro tweeted at the time that \"cumulative data, in addition to not showing that the large part [of patients] no longer has the illness, does not depict the moment of the country. Other actions are in the works to improve case notifications and diagnostic confirmations.\"The move led to immediate backlash over lack of transparency. The Supreme Court later ruled the ministry must provide comprehensive data.During a recent interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil, Pazuello said the Health Ministry had taken down the numbers because it was changing the way Brazil tallied its coronavirus data. \"The first thing we need to understand is that whatever methodology we use to tally the cases will not alter the number of obits,\" Pazuello said. \"There is no way to manipulate the data, because they are all registered. It would be absurd for us in the Health Ministry to have registered data and to then say it doesn't exist.\"JUST WATCHEDWHO warns Latin American countries not to reopen too quicklyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWHO warns Latin American countries not to reopen too quickly 01:22Brazil's previous health ministers predicted the height of the pandemic would be May through July. Under the current leadership, there is no sense of when the peak will be or when it will plateau. Several tests and vaccine trials are being conducted in Brazil. Two thousand Brazilians participated in tests of a vaccine against Covid-19 this month developed by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical, the Federal University of Sao Paulo (Unifesp) said in a statement.The country is the first site of these vaccination tests outside the United Kingdom.The Brazilian Butantan Institute, one of the country's top biomedical research centers, announced an agreement with Chinese laboratory Sinovac Biotech to conduct Phase III of a clinical coronavirus vaccine trial on approximately 9,000 volunteers in Brazil in the first week of July.The vaccine went through the first two phases of testing in China, where it was tested on 744 volunteers. The Chinese lab started human clinical trials with the experimental vaccine on April 17. However, the real test will be whether or not Bolsonaro is able lead Brazil out of this crisis as he faces a pandemic, crippling recession, political upheaval and a probe into allegations he interfered with police investigations. Back in April, when Brazil's death toll reached 5,000,  Bolsonaro's answer to the pandemic was a simple one. \"So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?\" Bolsonaro said on April 29, outside the presidential residence in Brasilia. \"I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)That Brazil saw warning signs would be a dramatic understatement. As Covid-19 raced across Europe, knocked the UK Prime Minister flat, and throttled New York City earlier this year, Brazil had plenty of notice that a catastrophe was on its way. But was some of the danger drowned out by the megaphone of its bombastic President Jair Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly dismissed the virus as a \"little flu\"? Brazil has now claimed the grim title of most Covid-19 cases globally after the US. More than 25,000 people in Brazil have died, and some experts say the death toll could quintuple by August. Hospitals and graveyards alike are being stretched to their limits.Around the world, citizens are asking their governments how local outbreaks spiraled out of control. But in Brazil, where the acting Health Minister is a military general with no health background, and the President personally attends anti-lockdown rallies, it's not clear who in the federal government might even deign to answer the question. \"What do you want me to do?\" Bolsonaro asked reporters last month. \"I'm not a miracle worker.\"Bolsonaro believes the economic slowdown will hurt more than the virus. Read MoreA handful of casesIt wasn't always this way. When the lethal virus first began to spread in China in February, Bolsonaro showed clear concern about its threat: He only grudgingly agreed to repatriate Brazilian citizens from the then-epicenter, Hubei province, reportedly worrying that they would put the rest of the country at risk.Bolsonaro calls coronavirus a 'little flu.' Inside Brazil's hospitals, doctors know the horrifying realityBrazil's domestic saga with the virus officially began on March 5, with an announcement by the Health Ministry that \"the national scenario has changed.\" A total of eight cases in Sao Paulo reported over 10 days had shown that the virus was no longer an import -- community spread was underway. The next week, state governors began to act to contain the spread, shutting down non-essential businesses and activities in Rio, Goias, Sao Paulo and the Federal District. But their precautions raised a red flag for Bolsonaro.\"When you ban football and other things, you fall into hysteria. Banning this and that isn't going to contain the spread,\" he told CNN Brasil on March 15. \"We should take steps, the virus could turn into a fairly serious issue. But the economy has to function because we can't have a wave of unemployment.\"This would become the argument that the outspoken business-first President has consistently repeated, even as the coronavirus crisis radically evolved around him: that the economy cannot be sacrificed for the sake of public health.JUST WATCHEDSee landing of last resort in virus hotbed ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee landing of last resort in virus hotbed  03:04The first deathUnder Brazil's federal system, state and city officials wield the power to implement regional measures, while the national government oversees broader issues.In March, Bolsonaro's government did its part to stave off the coronavirus: It closed Brazil to the outside world by closing most land borders and barring foreigners from entry via international flights. Finance Minister Paulo Guedes also announced a major stimulus measure to fund social assistance programs and cushion the fall for people losing their jobs due to shutdowns. But the virus was already spreading internally. On March 17, health officials in Sao Paulo confirmed the country's first coronavirus death, a 62-year-old man who had traveled to Italy.  Peru seemed to do everything right. So how did it become a Covid-19 hotspot?Local governments' efforts to stamp out the virus were met with criticism from the top, as Bolsonaro derided unpopular quarantine and shelter-in-place measures. \"Our life has to go on. Jobs should be maintained,\" Bolsonaro said in a March 24 speech broadcast on national television and radio. Bolsonaro also tweeted videos of himself visiting shopping districts in Brasilia, encouraging people to continue work and boosting the unproven drug chloroquine as a cure. On March 29, Twitter took the extraordinary action of removing the posts.Meanwhile, horror stories about the coronavirus were emerging elsewhere on the continent. In Ecuador, the city of Guayaquil saw its struggle with the virus laid bare online in early April, with social media videos and photos revealing dead bodies lying on sidewalks and abandoned in front of hospitals. 1,000 deathsAs cold weather began to set in for Brazil's autumn, Bolsonaro again took steps to reinforce the economy and the public healthcare system.He boosted funds for severance payments to laid-off workers, and signed a law to provide three months of emergency funds to the country's poor and informal workers. The health ministry also announced that it would register 5 million healthcare professionals to relocate to the worst-hit states to bolster public healthcare systems.But his personal words and actions continued to belie his government's work. On April 9, images showed the President barefaced at a local bakery, hugging supporters and posing with people in defiance of social distancing advice. Crowds could also be heard in the background booing and yelling out their windows from surrounding buildings. The country passed 1,000 deaths on April 10.

The outgoing minister had been one of Brazil's biggest proponents of social isolation, supporting governors' decisions to shut down schools and businesses.In a press conference after Mandetta's departure, Bolsonaro praised his work, but insisted the economy and health at this moment should be treated like two illnesses. \"You can't treat one and ignore the other,\" he said, adding that he had already discussed the need to \"gradually open up\" with incoming minister Nelson Teich.On April 28, Bolsonaro expanded the definition of essential businesses, adding retail, food services, transportation, auto repair shops, and storage businesses to the list. \"We were clearly in opposite sides,\" Mandetta would tell CNN's Christiane Amanpour weeks later. \"They thought that wouldn't be more than a thousand (cases). And I think that we are going to be way over this. I think that Brazil can become one of the highest number of cases in the world,\" he added.  Brazilian mayor launches furious attack on 'stupid' Bolsonaro over coronavirus responseBy April 29, more than 5,000 people had died. Questioned by reporters outside of the presidential residence in Brasilia, the President uttered the infamous words, \"So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?\" He later added, \"I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow.\"10,000 deathsThe rate of infection only accelerated in May.On May 7, Bolsonaro and Guedes issued a statement insisting that quarantine measures needed to be relaxed or the economy could collapse. Two days later, Brazil's coronavirus death toll crossed 10,000.The next week, Bolsonaro again pried open the notion of essential services, this time adding beauty salons, barber shops and gyms.\"This story about lockdown, closing everything, that is not the path. ...That is the path to failure, to breaking Brazil,\" he told journalists on May 14 -- the same day that he signed a decree exempting public officials from liability for their responses to the pandemic unless an action had an \"elevated degree of negligence, imprudence or malpractice.\"The next day, the new Health Minister Nelson Teich resigned. An oncologist by training, Teich had been in the role for less than a month, and had reportedly clashed over promotion of chloroquine as a treatment. Much later, in an interview with Globo News, Teich would also appear to criticize Brazil's ever-widening definition of essential businesses. \"Healthcare is absolutely essential. Obviously,\" he told the Brazilian publication on May 24. \"Is beauty essential? I don't know.\"Bolsonaro and Nelson Teich (left), who disagreed with the President and resigned. 15,000 deathsAfter having two medical experts at the top of the health ministry and no end to the crisis in sight, Bolsonaro changed tack. He chose Eduardo Pazuello -- a military general with no background in medicine or public health -- to lead the nation's fight against the coronavirus as the interim minister.Brazil's death toll surpassed 15,000 on May 16. That day, Bolsonaro joined another rally outside his official residence in Brasilia. Video streamed to Bolsonaro's YouTube page showed him wearing a face mask, shaking hands and even carrying several children. The next day, Brazil surpassed the UK to become the country with the third highest number of cases in the world.20,000 deathsWithin days, Brazil rose again in the grim rankings, overtaking hard-hit Russia with more confirmed coronavirus cases than any country in the world, except the US.By May 21, 20,000 people had died.That night, when Bolsonaro stopped at a hot dog cart in Brasilia his entourage attracted a mix of supporters and angry protestors.\"Killer!\" one woman could be heard shouting in the video, captured by local media.Bolsonaro was met with angry protestors when eating a hotdog in Brasilia.25,000 deathsOn Wednesday, the Health Ministry raised Brazil's national death toll to 25,598.Throughout recent months, the federal government's focus on protecting the economy first has largely been borne out with measures to relieve businesses and inject cash into the economy. But while the Health Ministry has also supported state health systems, the President undermined local leaders tasked with governing behavior that spreads the virus. \"With the example of the president of Brazil, everything is more difficult for us,\" Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria told CNN's Isa Soares on Tuesday. \"He goes to the streets without masks. A wrong behavior and wrong indication. This is very sad for Brazil and makes everything more difficult for the governors in the states of Brazil.\"The populist leader's strategy seemed to have been to leave unpopular decisions to others, while attempting to rake in credit from supporters to whom he plays the everyman -- promoting unproven coronavirus \"cures\" and daring them to break lockdown restrictions on social media. But the citizens following his example may be putting themselves into harm's way. Tens of thousands of new cases are being diagnosed each day, yet adherence to social distancing rules appears to be waning. In Sao Paulo, for example, more than 60% of the population initially followed the shelter-at-home guidelines according to city officials. Last week, less than half stayed at home.Bolsonaro has recently begun calling the fight against the virus a \"war,\" though he continues to insist that economic stagnation will hurt Brazil more than the virus itself. As the total of known cases approaches half a million, it's not clear if any number of graves could reverse that calculus for him.Reporting by Taylor Barnes, Flora Charner, Claudia Dominguez, Helena DeMoura, Maija Ehlinger, Jonny Hallam and Jennifer Hauser in Atlanta.

        "content": "(CNN)The coronavirus pandemic has slowed the global economy, but deforestation in the Amazon is speeding up. While most of Brazil's major businesses remain shuttered under lockdowns and quarantine measures, many believe illegal loggers and miners continue to operate in the area with little to no regulation.Deforestation in the Brazilian rainforest increased by nearly 64% in April this year, compared to the same month last year, shows data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE). Last month alone, more than 156 square miles (405.6 square kilometers) of rainforest were destroyed -- a vast swath more than double the size of Washington, DC.The first trimester of 2020 had already seen a more than 50% increase in deforestation compared to last year, according to INPE data.More than 3,000 soldiers from the Brazilian Armed Forces have been deployed to the Amazon, along with environmental officials, to help curb illegal logging and other criminal activities that could impact the rainforest, according to the Defense Ministry.While the wealthy self-isolate, the poor can't afford to stay put in Sao PauloPresident Jair Bolsonaro has previously faced global criticism and condemnation for the deforestation occurring under his watch. The far-right and pro-business president has vowed to explore the rainforest's economic potential. Read MoreLast year, after mass fires consumed large swaths of the rainforest, Bolsonaro was accused of incentivizing the activity of illegal ranchers, miners and loggers, many of whom use fire as a quick way to cut down trees to clear room for crops and cattle grazing. By November 2019, the deforestation rate in the Amazon had risen to its highest level in more than a decade.\"We are well on track for another record year for deforestation and fires in the Amazon,\" Adriana Charoux, an Amazon campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil said in a recent press statement. \"In the midst of the pandemic, Bolsonaro is doubling down on actions that would effectively disintegrate indigenous territories and lead to more deforestation for meat production.One of the measures Bolsonaro is pushing for now is Provisional Measure 910 (MP 910),  a law which could allow so-called \"land grabbers\" who illegally invaded public land from 2011 to 2018 to establish legal ownership. The measure was scheduled to be voted in Congress on Wednesday, but didn't have a quorum.The Amazon's gateway city is struggling to battle the coronavirusThe hashtag #NoMP910 trended in Brazil Wednesday, with environmentalists and Brazilians in general protesting the vote. \"It's our land, territory, place. Our environment is not a political-electoral bargaining chip,\" indigenous activist Mayal\u00fa Txucarram\u00e3e Tweeted on her personal account. \"Stop the genocide and ecocide.\"Bolsonaro has frequently criticized the amount of Amazon land officially demarcated as indigenous territory as excessive. During an event at Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia last February, Bolsonaro said it was \"abusive\" for such a large portion of territory to be occupied by the regional tribes leaving \"its goods hidden forever.\"Coronavirus deaths among Brazil's indigenous peopleAbout 13% of Brazil is indigenous land, mostly in the Amazon. That land is officially reserved for the country's 900,000 indigenous people, which represents less than 0.5% of the country's population.Activists worry that increasing commercial activity in the Amazon also carries a higher risk that outsiders will carry contagious diseases into indigenous communities -- including the coronavirus.\"The indigenous people in the Amazon don't have the antibodies for the diseases that come from outside of the rainforest,\" Brazilian activist and photographer Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado told CNN's Christiane Amanpour during a recent interview. \"There is a huge danger that the coronavirus could come inside indigenous territory and become a real genocide.\"Salgado, who currently lives in Paris, has spent several decades photographing Brazil's indigenous communities. He told Amanpour that when he has photographed in the Amazon in the past, he had to undergo a 10-day quarantine but said he fears that now \"the door is open\" for anyone to trespass on indigenous land potentially exposing them to diseases like coronavirus.A boy from a remote Amazonian tribe has died, raising concerns about Covid-19's impact on indigenous peopleAt least 277 cases and 19 deaths linked to the coronavirus have been confirmed so far among Brazil's indigenous tribes, according to SESAI, a specialized branch of the Brazilian Health Ministry that deals with health issues among indigenous populations. Many of these have been registered in the Alto Rio Solim\u00f5es, in the state of Amazonas. SESAI said it has sent hundreds of N95 masks, gloves and disposable goggle to dozens of tribes throughout the country. It has also launched a vaccination campaign against influenza and information campaign about Covid-19, according to a recent report.But environmental groups like Survival International believe the only way to help the indigenous people -- especially uncontacted groups -- is to keep illegal loggers and miners out of their territory.\"If their lands are properly protected from outsiders, uncontacted tribes should be relatively safe from the coronavirus pandemic. But many of their territories are being invaded and stolen for logging, mining and agribusiness, with the encouragement of President Bolsonaro,\" Survival International's Uncontacted Tribes campaigner Sarah Shenker said in a recent press statement.\"Where invaders are present, coronavirus could wipe out whole peoples. It's a matter of life and death.\"This story has been updated to correct the relative size of the rainforest destroyed last month.",

        "content": "(CNN)Brazil's coronavirus cases have spiked to 135,106 including 9,146 deaths, according to numbers released Wednesday by the Brazilian Health Ministry. This surge comes as President Jair Bolsonaro's spokesman, Gen. Otavio Santana do Rego Barros, confirmed he tested positive for Covid-19.  Yet Bolsonaro said earlier this week he believed \"the worst had passed\" for the coronavirus pandemic, during a press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. But as the number of cases and deaths continue to climb, many health experts fear the worst is yet to come.Since Bolsonaro made the comment in Brasilia on Tuesday, there have been more than 20,000 new cases of coronavirus and the country registered 610 deaths on Thursday, nearly the highest toll yet in a 24-hour period, according to the Health Ministry.Health Minister Nelson Teich said Thursday that stricter lockdowns may be needed in some of the hardest-hit regions, during a video conference with members of the lower house of Congress. Former Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said \"the toughest months\" are likely to be May and June, during an interview with TV Globo last month, four days before he was fired by Bolsonaro over disagreements on the country's coronavirus strategy.Read MoreWarnings of a 'total collapse'Meanwhile, Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat coronavirus presents to the country's 209 million citizens, repeatedly saying he believes the effects of preventive measures, such as quarantines and lockdowns, could have a worse impact on Brazil's economy. During a speech at the Supreme Court on Thursday, Bolsonaro and Finance Minister Paulo Guedes said the economy could suffer a \"total collapse\" if the country doesn't reopen.An aerial view of Vila Formosa cemetery in Sao Paulo, during an April burial.\"The issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can't let the side-effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,\" Bolsonaro said.On March 24, Bolsonaro compared the coronavirus to a \"little flu\" in an address to the nation. Less than two months after that comment, there have been more than 132,000 new cases of Covid-19.  It was followed by a series of controversial statements about the virus by Bolsonaro. \"Brazilians don't catch anything ... they already have the antibodies to keep it from spreading,\" the President has said.He added again that Brazilians are likely to be immune to the coronavirus during a March 26 press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. \"Brazilians should be studied, we don't catch anything. You see people jumping in sewage, diving in it and nothing happens to them,\" Bolsonaro said.The Amazon's gateway city is struggling to battle the coronavirusDuring the same press conference, Bolsonaro said he believed many Brazilians had already been infected but that those people already had \"the antibodies that would help [coronavirus] not spread.\"The comments were made two weeks after Bolsonaro's press secretary Fabio Wajngarten and other Cabinet members tested positive for coronavirus, after traveling to the US and meeting with President Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago.The World Health Organization said last month there was no evidence that people who have had Covid-19 will not get it a second time.Bolsonaro says he has been tested twice for coronavirus and both tests came back negative, according to posts on his personal Twitter and Facebook pages. Congressional leaders and a Federal judge are now asking the President to show evidence that the test came back negative, after he recently implied he may have contracted the virus without knowing it.Social distancing is 'useless,' Bolsonaro claimsBolsonaro recently reiterated his claims that efforts to flatten the curve of the virus's spread -- via quarantine measures and social distancing -- were ineffective.\"From the looks of it, from what we're going to see now, this effort to flatten the curve was practically useless,\" Bolsonaro said during a Facebook live on April 30th. \"Now, the collateral damage from all of that will be unemployment.\" Bolsonaro has repeatedly pushed back against quarantine and stay-at-home orders imposed by governors in some of the hardest-hit states, such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, during press conferences and via Twitter.Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro defends joining anti-lockdown protestHe's also participated in two so-called \"anti-lockdown\" protests outside Planalto presidential palace in Brasilia, where supporters crowded outside the gates and crammed against each other for a chance to see the President.The latest protest took place last Sunday, May 3. In a live video posted to his personal Facebook account, Bolsonaro appeared without a mask shaking some people's hands and waving at the crowd. Banners calling for military intervention and for the takedown of Congress and Supreme Court have been seen at the protests in the past.Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria said Bolsonaro's participation in the protests were anti-democratic. \"President Jair Bolsonaro reveals, once again, his disdain for democracy,\" Doria said in a series of tweets posted to his personal Twitter account Sunday. \"On top of that, he's encouraging the people from his country to disobey health and medicine.\"Bolsonaro and Doria have butted heads over measures to reopen the country, including during a video conference on coronavirus response that included other governors.\"We have to have a president to lead and drive the country, not to divide it,\" Doria said during the March 25 call. Bolsonaro accused Doria of letting his own presidential ambitions \"go to his head\" and said he is an \"example for no one.\"A street vendor walks along an empty popular shopping street in downtown Sao Paulo during its lockdown.The state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest and home to the country's financial capital, has registered the highest number of cases and deaths. At least 39,000 cases and 3,206 deaths have been confirmed in Sao Paulo, according to the latest data from the state's health secretariat. The state issued a new mandate Thursday, which makes mandatory the use of face masks in public spaces, including ride-share vehicles. The state government did not specify for how long the measure will remain in place.The state is scheduled to begin a gradual reopening plan on May 11, according to an announcement made by Doria last month. It's still unclear which businesses will be allowed to resume activities under that plan.'What do you want me to do?'Bolsonaro gave a late-night press conference outside the Alvorada presidential palace on April 28, the day when Brazil's death toll surpassed those reported in China.A reporter asked Bolsonaro about the spike, to which he responded: \"So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?\" He added that even though his middle name is \"Messias,\" which translates as \"Messiah\" in English, he's not \"a miracle worker.\"Brazil's supreme court allows investigation of President BolsonaroHe later walked back the comments during the same press conference, saying \"I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow.\"Brazilians in several major cities, including the capital Brasilia, protested the comments by banging pots and pans out their windows and yelling \"get out of here\" after the press conference was broadcast.While Sao Paulo's numbers are the highest, many poorer states in the North and Northeastern part of the country have been heavily affected.The comments came the same week the country's Supreme Court authorized an investigation into allegations Bolsonaro sought to interfere with police investigations following the resignation of his Justice Minister, Sergio Moro.A recent survey from pollster Datafolha, showed Bolsonaro's approval at 33% and that the country is split nearly down the middle on whether the President should be impeached.",

Large signs, including one reading \"military intervention with Bolsonaro in power,\" were visible in a livestream of the event posted to the president's personal Facebook page.Brazil President Bolsonaro replaces health ministerIn the video, Bolsonaro can be seen at the rally without a mask waving at the crowd and coughing at times. \"I'm here because I believe in you. You are here because you believe in Brazil,\" Bolsonaro said during the live stream, while standing on top of a white pickup truck. The rally was a protest against quarantine measures imposed by some state governors, Bolsonaro said at a press conference on Monday outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia.The state of Sao Paulo, Brazil's financial capital and the state worst-hit by Covid-19, has extended quarantine measures until May 10 for commerce, schools and all nonessential businesses. In Rio de Janeiro state, quarantine measures are set to remain in place through April 30.Read MoreBolsonaro told reporters that he never encouraged military intervention and that his support of the protest had been misinterpreted.\"I respect the Supreme Court, I respect the Congress -- but I am entitled to my opinions and some people can't just interpret anything I say as an act of aggression,\" Bolsonaro told reporters and supporters. \"Usually, when people are conspiring against someone it's to reach a position of power.

        "content": "(CNN)When the coronavirus first emerged, it seemed like a distant threat to Brazil and the country's sprawling and impoverished favelas. But as the virus spreads across the South American nation, one favela resident is taking it upon himself to protect the neighborhood.Thiago Firmino, 39, heard the early reports and decided to find some equipment to protect him and the community of the Santa Marta favela in Rio de Janeiro. \"I started keeping an eye on it when it was still in China and thought, if it's out of control there who knows what could happen here,\" Firmino told CNN during a telephone interview.Why are these three presidents downplaying coronavirus warnings?The community activist and entrepreneur bought two disinfectant sprayers and two white body suits that he found in a local paint shop. He already had a gas mask, purchased in the past to protect himself from police tear gas during anti-government protests. Last weekend, Firmino suited up and started spraying bleach on the side streets, alleys and nooks of his favela in balmy 80-degree heat. Rio's sanitation service, Comlurb, has been cleaning many of the city's bus stops, train stations and other areas of high circulation since March but Firmino said he has not seen them in Santa Marta or heard of them working in any other favela. According to the latest figures from the Brazilian Health Ministry, over 15,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus and 800 people have died. The number of cases has been increasing sharply, with health officials warning the high point may be between April and May. Read MoreRio de Janeiro state authorities confirmed the state has at least 1,688 cases and 89 deaths.  An estimated 13 million people live in Brazil's poverty-stricken and densely-populated favelas. In Rio, they are built on hills where even access to clean running water can be a challenge. Products like hand sanitizers are often too expensive as many residents subsist on minimum wage or less and depend on jobs that have been impacted by the pandemic.   Sebastiao Soares, a local vendor from City of God, the favela made famous by the 2002 film of the same name, told CNN he shares his 400-sq foot home with six other people including his three children. He usually sells beverages on Rio de Janeiro's beaches for a living, but had to quit after a state government ban last month. Despite being high-risk as a diabetic who suffers from hypertension, Soares told CNN he would still work if he could. Confused guidanceGuidance on social-distancing in Brazil in general has been confusing. State and local governments in some of the country's hardest-hit areas have been promoting social-distancing with online campaigns and having firefighters and police in the streets urging people to stay indoors. In Rio de Janeiro, governor Wilson Witzel extended quarantine measures in most of the state's major cities through the end of April and urged people to stay home. \"We are still in the early stages of this pandemic. People need to understand that we need to stay home,\" Witzel said during a press conference Tuesday. \"This is not the time to be out in street, except for those essential activities.\"The measure applies to schools, Rio's beaches and tourist sites, such as the Christ the Redeemer statue.According to a recent Datafolha poll, 76% percent of the population supports social-distancing policies in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus.However, President Jair Bolsonaro has continued to push back on social-distancing policies in recent weeks, dismissing the coronavirus as a \"little flu\" and saying Brazil will suffer more if the economy collapses.  Hungarian leader's outrageous power grabThe federal government will launch an emergency-assistance program this week to distribute R$600 (roughly $114) monthly over the next three months to people who are part of Brazil's \"informal economy\" and have lost their jobs.In the meantime, residents from several favelas, including City of God, have started collecting cleaning supplies -- like hand soap and dish detergent -- as well as meals for many of those who were left unemployed. Some have partnered with local NGOs, while others have initiated campaigns for online donations.\"These products aren't very expensive, but we know that they are inaccessible for some, given the realities in our favela,\" Victor Andrade, one of the volunteers, told CNN. \"People here simply don't have the means to buy these items.\"  Dozens of coronavirus cases have now been confirmed in favelas throughout the city, including City of God. The first coronavirus-related deaths in favelas were reported by the Rio de Janeiro city government late Wednesday. At least two deaths were reported in Manguinhos and two in Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil, which is home to roughly 150,000 people.Dozens of coronavirus cases have now been confirmed in favelas throughout the city, including City of God.

But sometimes they only target those people who are ugly for harassment,\" Moreno said.\"If the person is attractive, based on the canons of society, [women] don't necessarily consider it harassment,\" the 66-year-old leader continued.

I apologize if that is how it was interpreted. I reject violence against women in all its forms!\" Why did Ecuador give up Assange after seven years?

Women are exposed to this type of violence regularly in educational centers, universities, workspaces, political organizations, public transportation, streets, plazas, etc. Maybe that's why it seems normal, tolerable and ridiculous,\" read the council's statement.In a survey of more than 20,000 households last year, Ecuador's National Institute of Statistics and Census found that more than 32% of women said they had been victims of some form of sexual violence.The incident comes just days after the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) began hearings regarding a high-profile 2002 case that alleges the Ecuadorian government failed to investigate or hold responsible a 65-year-old school official accused of sexually abusing one of his teenage students, who later died by suicide.

        "content": "(CNN)Three decades ago in Rio de Janeiro, Freddie Mercury made history with a performance of the Queen hit \"Love of My Life,\" at the now-legendary Rock in Rio music festival. The scene of thousands of Queen fans all singing along was an indelible one -- and one recently featured in the film \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\"Brazil has always been famous for its music. The birthplace of beloved genres like samba, maracatu and forro, it is also a welcoming longtime home for global music styles. But now, one of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's top officials for culture is declaring a war on rock and roll.\"Rock music leads to drugs, which leads to sex, which leads to abortions,\" claimed Dante Mantovani, newly-appointed head of the National Arts Foundation (Funarte), in a recent post on his personal YouTube page.\"At the same time, the abortion industry feeds into something much more serious which is Satanism,\" he added.In the eleven-minute video, posted on October 30th, Mantovani criticizes rock icons Elvis Presley and John Lennon. \"Lennon openly said, more than once, that he made a pact with the devil -- with Satan, in order to be famous and successful,\" he says.Read More\"In the 1950's this so-called Elvis Presley emerges with rock music that makes everyone bounce and shake their hips,\" Mantovani adds. \"This is when certain behaviors start being introduced -- Elvis Presley, for instance, died of an overdose.\"Leonardo DiCaprio responds after Brazil's President blames actor for Amazon forest firesOn Dec 2, Mantovani was appointed to run Funarte, a Brazilian government agency with a mission to \"promote and incentivize the production, practice, development and diffusion of the arts throughout the country.\" Founded in 1975, it fell under the Ministry of Culture until that ministry was dissolved by Bolsonaro's government, and became a subdivision of the Ministry of Citizenship. It is unclear whether Mantovani's views could affect any projects that might finance initiatives for rock music events. But as a government entity responsible for determining public policy and federal funding for music and arts initiatives, the foundation's support can be critical. In the past, cultural projects could request up to 60 million Brazilian reals (roughly US$14 million) in federal funds through Funarte, though that figure has since been reduced under Bolsonaro.Mantovani himself seems to tend toward classical styles. Born in 1984, he identifies himself as a \"maestro\" with a master's degree in linguistics, according to his personal website. He studied the violin, trumpet, piano and led choirs and orchestras in different cities throughout Brazil. In the same video, Mantovani also blames rock music for destroying the fabric of the American \"moral\" family in the 1960s and indulges \"certain theories\" that the CIA distributed the hallucinogenic drug LSD at the 1969 Woodstock festival.\"Woodstock, that festival from the 1960s that gather a bunch of people, where hippies took drugs and LSD -- there are certain theories that suggest that the large scale distribution of the drug was actually carried out by the CIA,\" Mantovani said. Brazil's President Bolsonaro shares lewd video, sparking outrage He has held forth on what he views as rock's problems before, even asking, \"Is rock music?\" in a video posted February 2018.\"What happens with rock is that the rhythm is always very repetitive. When a musical genre is more based on rhythm is speaks more to the body than the soul,\" Mantovani said. \"That's why you see in rock shows people jumping, sometimes hitting each other -- in punk rock there is the tradition of people beating each other and then leaving as old friends.\"In the video, he does makes exceptions for two bands in the genre -- Metallica and Brazilian band Angra -- arguing that they alone are worth listening to \"when you're driving in traffic\" or \"feeling a bit tired.\"On Monday, Angra bassist Felipe Andreoli responded that he was \"embarrassed\" to have his band associated with Mantovani, in a post on his personal Instagram account.\"So much ignorance, so much disinformation, SO EMBARRASSED to have my band associated in any way with this guy. I'm not going to waste my time attacking his comments because, those of us who live off of and know about rock music know that he is delirious,\" Andreoli said.\"It scares me to see such a retrograde, fanatical person in such an important position for our country's culture.\"CNN has reached out to Mantovani for comment. Funarte forwarded CNN's request for comment to the Secretariat of Culture, a subdivision of the Ministry of Citizenship.",

        "content": "(CNN)Last month, 39-year-old Alex Nu\u00f1ez was sitting on a park bench in Maip\u00fa, a low-income neighborhood on the outskirts of Santiago, when a protest began in a nearby park.  People had been taking to the streets on a nearly daily basis throughout Chile to protest the rising inequality, cost of living and the policies of president Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era. Suddenly, police, known as Carabineros, broke up the protest and started chasing after people.  Caught up in the shuffle, Nu\u00f1ez was severely beaten by a group of officers. His wife, Natalia Perez, told CNN that Nu\u00f1ez walked home that night with his face mangled. The father of three told his family he was okay and needed to the rest. The next day, he was rushed to the hospital where he died from massive brain trauma.Read More \"I know that when the doctor says, 'I need to speak with you', it's because things are not good. Never in my mind did I think it was this serious,\" Perez told CNN shortly after Nu\u00f1ez's death. Nu\u00f1ez, whose story was reported by CNN in October, is one of several Chileans featured in a new Amnesty International report released on Thursday. The report alleges that state security forces, including both the police and army, deliberately use excessive force against protesters. After the report's release, President Pi\u00f1era spoke to reporters at La Moneda presidential palace on Thursday, saying his government and the country had faced \"a situation that they never had to face and that tough decisions were taken before these crossroads.\" \"The Armed Forces have rules that they need to follow in the use of force,\" Pi\u00f1era said. \"In some cases, the protocols that are in place and the law were not followed. Excesses and abuses were committed and the attorney general's office is investigating those incidents, which will be revealed and tried by our courts. This is how a democracy works.\"An anti-government demonstrator runs through a tear gas cloud during clashes in Santiago, Chile, on Nov. 19. \"A policy of punishment\"The ongoing mass protests began in Chile's capital Santiago on October 18, ignited by a hike in subway ticket prices and fueled by anger over economic and social inequality in one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America.  As the protests intensified, Pi\u00f1era declared a temporary state of emergency throughout the country. Daily curfews were put in place in the capital Santiago and soldiers deployed to the streets. He also asked all his cabinet ministers to resign, and promised to impose social and economic reforms that were at the heart of the protests.  The fare increase was ultimately suspended, but the people of Chile had already paid another price: At least 21 people have been killed, CNN's reporting shows. More than 2300 people were injured and of those 220 suffered severe eye injuries, according to data from Chile's National Human Rights Institution (NHRI), cited in Amnesty International's report.  \"The intention of the Chilean security forces is clear: to injure demonstrators in order to discourage protest,\" said Amnesty International Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas.  \"Instead of taking measures to curb the very grave human rights crisis, the authorities, under the command of President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, have pursued a policy of punishment for over a month, adding yet more people to the staggering number of victims, which is continuing to rise to this day.\" A protester in Santiago on November 21.Natalia Aravena, a 24-year-old nurse in Santiago, told CNN her right eye was severely injured during a protest. She said she was participating in a peaceful protest when the Carabineros began to use water cannons and tear gas to break up the crowd. \"It was instantaneous. I turned around and felt something in my eye and I told myself 'oh, no! It happened to me,\" Aravena said. \"I immediately thought I had lost my eye, impossible that after this I will still have sight or that my eye will go back to normal.\" Aravena said that a police tear gas canister hit her in the eye, damaging part of her cornea, and ultimately her vision. She believes the attack was intentional. \"If they wanted to break up the protest, they should have shot in the tear gas in the air and not directly at the people,\" she said. \"It was all very aggressive.\" Amnesty International says it has documented dozens of injuries caused by rubber bullets, as well as one death. Its report includes witness testimony that 24-year-old Kevin G\u00f3mez was killed when he was allegedly shot by a soldier with rubber bullets at close range and without warning in the city of Coquimbo. According to a medical report cited by Amnesty, G\u00f3mez died on Oct. 21 of a \"thoracic lung injury caused by multiple projectiles.\"  The soldier who fired on G\u00f3mez was arrested last month following the incident, according to local media reports. The Attorney General's office published on their official Twitter account on Nov. 19 that Gomez was among five people whose deaths were caused by \"agents of the state\" during the protests. Citing the national police, the Amnesty report notes that 1600 national police officials have also been injured, and 105 \"seriously.\"Demonstrators take cover from water fired by a riot police truck during a protest against President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era on November 19 in Santiago, Chile. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet sent a team to the South American country last month to investigate human rights allegations against protesters. They are scheduled to end their mission Friday. Opposition lawmakers also presented a motion Tuesday, to begin impeachment proceedings against President Sebastian Pi\u00f1era, which is known as a \"constitutional accusation.\" The accusation claims the President has \"openly violated the Constitution\" and displayed \"systematic violation of human rights.\" Meanwhile, protests continue. In an effort to quell demands and frustrations, lawmakers from several political parties announced a major step towards reforming the country's constitution, which was approved in 1980 during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet. Under the accord, which was signed by both the government and opposition parties, a referendum will be held next April in order for Chileans to vote on the changes.Matt Rivers, Natalie Gallon and Cristopher Ulloa contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Deep in the heart of the Amazon, Ajareaty Waiapi performs one of her tribe's most traditional rituals. The tribal chief crushes blood red urucum seeds into a thick paste and generously applies it to her face, bare chest and torso. The mixture protects her skin from the sun and insects. It's also believed to ward off evil spirits. For decades, the Waiapi have lived in the Brazilian state of Amapa in near-isolation from the non-indigenous world and in harmony with the rainforest. The river and trees that support their way of life are often described as the lungs of the world.Chief Ajareaty Waiapi stands by the Rio Onca river looking out into the forest. Now, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro wants to change that, with proposals that include moving the tribe out of their legally demarcated territory and opening the land to miners to exploit dormant deposits of copper, iron and gold near their homes. His pro-business policies in the Amazon have recently come under attack for encouraging deforestation, as massive wildfires now rip through large swaths of the rainforest.The Waiapi believe they are the guardians of the Amazon and are wiling to do whatever it takes to protect it. CNN gained rare access to a Waiapi village and spoke to tribal leaders about what could happen if the government expropriates their land.  Read More A mysterious death on indigenous landThe Waiapi believe they owe their existence to a melody played by divine creator Jane Jara. According to legend, Jane Jara began playing a song on a long flute made from the trunk of an embauba tree. As he sang and played, the Waiapi were born. The Waiapi made contact with non-indigenous people in 1973, when the Brazilian government started to build a new highway, known as the BR-210 North Perimeter. The project was abandoned three years later, but enough was built to allow pelt hunters and miners to reach the Waiapi, bringing diseases like measles and disrupting their way of life. The tribe drove away what they call the \"invaders\" in the 1980s and took control of the area, according to a study published by the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a Brazilian non-profit environmental advocacy group.\"Some time ago, we lived well; we did not worry about land,\" says the 59-year-old Ajareaty, one of the Waiapi's few female chiefs. \"We did not know we would have many invaders, loggers and prospectors in the future. Many talk about our land today, they say that they want to take our land.\"A rainbow shines over Jakare village, in the state of Amapa.  Her village, Kwapo'ywyry, is one of 92 different Waiapi villages that dot the roughly 1.5 million acres in northern Brazil that was officially declared an indigenous reserve in 1996. The area was categorized by Brazil's National Indigenous Affairs agency (FUNAI) as a \"traditionally occupied indigenous reservation.\" \"Our leaders struggled a lot to demarcate the indigenous land because we heard that it if we did not do it, non-indigenous leaders would enter and finish our land in the future,\" Chief Ajareaty says. \"That's why we made the demarcation.\"But legal recognition has not entirely protected their land from intrusion, they say. In July, tribe members said that a group of miners illegally invaded the nearby village of Mariri and killed 68-year-old chief Emyra Waiapi.Viseni Waiapi, who lives in Ajareaty's village, was one of the people who found Emyra's lifeless body covered with wounds in a local river, he says. A few days later, on July 27, he sent a nearly five-minute audio message to Brazilian and international media, alleging that a group of heavily armed wildcat miners and non-indigenous people had violently stabbed Emyra all over his body, including his genitals. \"We are asking for help,\" Viseni said in Portuguese during the message. \"We are in great danger.\"Karuwaniru Waiaipi protects her infant son from the rain with a leaf, as she walks by the BR-210 Perimetral Norte highway near the village of Aramira. Shortly after the news of Emyra's death, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet issued a statement calling on Brazil's government to \"reconsider its policies towards indigenous peoples and their lands, so that Emyra Waiapi's murder does not herald a new wave of violence.\"Bolsonaro reacted to the claims, telling reporters in Brasilia that Federal Police were investigating the death and that he was not convinced Emyra had been murdered. \"Up to now, there is no strong evidence that this indigenous (chief) was murdered. There are several possibilities,\" he said. \"The Federal Police are there, are being sent there to get to the bottom of the case and find out the truth about this.\"On August 16, Brazil's Federal Police finally issued a preliminary report, concluding that Emyra had suffered a head injury and that the cause of death had been drowning. It said there were no signs of non-indigenous people trespassing on the reserve or of a potential confrontation during the initial investigation, and that police were still awaiting a toxicology report within the next thirty days.Four days later, the Association of Waiapi Villages issued a statement disputing the police report and claiming to have pictures showing that Emyra had been stabbed. The Association said the photos had been given to Federal Police, FUNAI and the Human Rights Commission of the lower house of Brazil's Congress. It also said the river where Emyra was found was too shallow and that it would be very difficult for an adult person to drown in by accident.Brazil's Environmental Minister Ricardo Salles claimed during an event in Sao Paulo on August 20, that Emyra had drowned after drinking too much.\"It seems like the sad death of an indigenous leader, which some media outlets have pinned on wildcat miners who they say invaded the land and killed him, was caused by him drinking too much cacha\u00e7inha (Brazilian spirit), falling in the river and drowning,\" he said, without offering any evidence to substantiate the alleged drinking. CNN reached out to the Ministry of Environment to request evidence supporting the minister's claim, but did not get a response.Opening up indigenous landBolsonaro has said he believes too much land has been given to indigenous communities and that they stand in the way of Brazil's development and financial growth. He has also said that he wants to move the tribes out of demarcated areas and \"integrate the indigenous into society.\"\"There are places where we could be producing things and we can't because you can't draw a straight line without stumbling upon indigenous land or an environmentally protected area,\" Bolsonaro said on August 16 in Brasilia. \"As long as I am president, there will not be any new land demarcated as indigenous territory.\"About 13% of Brazil is legally considered indigenous land, mostly in the Amazon. That land is reserved for the country's 900,000 indigenous people, which represents less than 0.5% of the country's population. The role of certifying indigenous lands has long fallen under FUNAI, a task that Bolsonaro tried to move to the Ministry of Agriculture -- which is heavily influenced by the interests of Brazil's beef and soy industry -- but was later reversed by both Congress and the Supreme Court. Part of the Waiapi's reservation lies on the National Reserve of Copper and Associates (RENCA) -- a protected area slightly larger than Denmark, which occupies roughly 17,800 square miles of land in the states of Amap\u00e1 and Par\u00e1. It is thought to be rich in gold, copper and other minerals and has been protected by presidential decree against commercial mining since 1984. During a presidential visit last April to Macap\u00e1, the capital of Amap\u00e1 state, Bolsonaro said he wanted to open up the reserve to commercial mining. \"Let's use the riches that God gave us for the wellbeing of our population,\" he said. \"RENCA is ours.\"Bolsonaro's predecessor, Michel Temer, previously tried to abolish Renca's protected status and open it up for development, only to reverse the move within a month following backlash from Brazilian and international environmental groups. Where would tribes like the Waiapi go, if their lands became industrial mining or ranching zones? Bolsonaro would like to see them abandon the indigenous life, he has previously said. \"We practically only see indigenous reservations in rich areas. We want to integrate the indigenous into our society. The indigenous are human beings like you and I,\" Bolsonaro said during an event in Sao Paulo last June. \"They want television, they want internet, they want soccer, they want to go to the movies. They want to do what we do. They want to go to doctor, to a dentist. That's what we want for the indigenous people, to integrate them into the society -- as human beings, just like us\" At the same event, he blamed \"NGOs outside of Brazil\" for creating an \"external pressure\" to cordon off indigenous areas. Christian Poirier, a program director of the US based non-profit advocacy group Amazon Watch, tells CNN Bolsonaro's narrative is only empowering agricultural companies and local cattle ranchers in the area and encouraging them to take control of the land at any cost. \"When Bolsonaro says indigenous people have too much land, what he's really saying is militias (of local cattle farmers) can act with impunity,\" Poirier told CNN during a telephone interview. \"What we are witnessing is unprecedented, we haven't seen such an invasion of demarcated land in decades.\"  In their latest report on Brazil,  Amazon Watch warned of the dangers of deforestation, environmental crimes and human rights violations and argued that indigenous land rights are \"intrinsically linked\" to preserving the biome. \"These territories are the last buffer of protection against potential climate chaos on the planet,\" Poirier said. \"Indigenous people are on the front line and at the forefront of resistance.\"There will be \"great fires\"Ororiwa Waiapi, 98, the Chief of the Mogywyry and Pyrankenopa villages, is one of the oldest people in the tribe. He says he has no interest in leaving the forest and fears what may come if he doesn't keep fighting to protect it.  \"I've always been here, and I won't leave,\" Ororiwa says. \"If we humans misuse this planet, our creator will make a great flood that will melt the planet. There will be great fires, fires that will destroy the planet.\"Ororiwa Waiapi walks in the forest near Mogywry village, in Amapa state. The 98-year-old leader is one of the tribe's eldest chiefs.In recent weeks, the world has seen dramatic broadcast and social media images of the Amazon on fire. Since the beginning of 2019, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (known as \"INPE\") has reported up to 80,626 fires in the country as of Sunday night, with more than half of these in the Amazon region. An 85% increase in deforestation has occurred so far this year compared to last year, according to the institute. Many of the fires are believed to have been started by cattle ranchers and farmers using fire to clear land.World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have called the fires an \"international crisis\" and made it a topic of discussion during the G7 meetings.This comes within days of Norway and Germany suspending million-dollar donations to the Amazon Fund, which was created more than ten years ago as a global effort to help Brazil fight deforestation and expand research into biodiversity in the forest. Norway has also accused Bolsonaro's government of violating key elements of the agreement. Chief Ajareaty Waiapi builds a bonfire outside her home in Kwapo'ywyry village. Learning the ways of the non-indigenousChief Ajareaty has been studying non-indigenous culture for years. She has traveled within Brazil and abroad, where she's participated in forums and represented her tribe in countries like Germany and Colombia.\"I said to myself, I want to learn what non-indigenous life is like. What their life is like,\" says Ajareaty, who takes Portuguese language classes at a nearby school. \"I want to know how to speak their language. I want to learn, so I can speak to the white people out there.\" A young Ruwan Waiapi plays in the jungle. Her father, Jawaruwa Waiapi, testified before the United Nations in New York to ask for international support for Brazil's Amazon and the indigenous tribes that live in it.Protecting Waiapi land goes beyond the livelihood of her tribe, her daughter and granddaughter, she says. It is about protecting the planet and all living things. \"We do not think about today, we think about the future. In the future our children and grandchildren will not be able to live well if we do not demarcate the land,\" she says. \"In the forest there are many things, fruits, fish, animals and also our medicine. Our concern is that if the forest is gone, people will also end.\"She says she's been training her daughter, Karota, 20, and hopes she will follow in her footsteps one day.  \"She always talks about the fight for the land, for our land and to fights for our rights,\" Karota says, as she held her infant child. \"This is very important for me, to keep fighting for the future generations.\"",

El Salvador has an extremely strict abortion ban.In April 2016, Hern\u00e1ndez was found on the floor of her bathroom drenched in blood. She was taken to a local emergency room in her hometown of El Carmen, roughly 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) east of the capital by her mother and a neighbor. Doctors who examined her saw signs of a delivery but no baby and reported her to the authorities. When local officials arrived at her home five hours later, they found the newborn dead in a septic tank.In 2017, Hern\u00e1ndez was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing the child.

Paula Avila Guillen, director of the Latin America Initiatives for the Women's Equality Center, declared the verdict a victory for Hern\u00e1ndez and El Salvador's interpretation of its strict abortion laws. The New York-based group had provided legal support and assistance to Hernandez throughout the trial.The people fighting the world's harshest abortion law\"It seems the judicial system is starting to understand that stillbirths are not crimes, they are obstetric emergencies,\" Guillen told CNN. \"People in El Salvador now understand that the law, as it stands right now, criminalizes women in poverty.\"In a statement, Amnesty International called Hern\u00e1ndez's acquittal a victory for human rights and called on the government to end \"the shameful and discriminatory practice of criminalizing women once and for all by immediately revoking the nation's draconian anti-abortion laws.\"Depending on the charge, Salvadoran women who are suspected of having an abortion or an induced miscarriage can face serious charges including aggravated homicide, with sentences ranging from two to 50 years in prison, according to Amnesty International.Most of the women who have faced criminal charges for abortions in El Salvador come from poor rural backgrounds, and many suffered miscarriages or had obstetric complications because they weren't able to get regular checkups due to lack of resources.The unintended consequences of US global abortion policyElizabeth Deras, one of Hern\u00e1ndez's lawyers, told CNN last week the defense team was feeling positive because prosecution witnesses presented evidence that suggested that the baby died from complications during the delivery, which might have cleared Hernandez of any responsibility.\"The doctor who performed the autopsy on the child said the cause of death was aspiration pneumonia and that meconium was discovered inside the baby's stomach,\" Deras told CNN.

Evelyn Hernandez was a teenager when she was first accused of inducing an abortion and later convicted of aggravated murder, claims which she has repeatedly rejected.In April 2016, Hernandez was found on the floor of her bathroom drenched in blood.

A verdict is expected to be delivered on Monday at 1 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET).Hernandez, now 21, has pleaded not guilty. She has said that she did not even know she was pregnant until the delivery. \"Had I known I was pregnant, I would have awaited the baby with pride and joy,\" Hernandez told reporters last month.Her attorney Bertha Del\u00e9on also told reporters Friday that Hernandez was not physically able to react after going into labor. \"Forensic scientists deduced after she arrived at the hospital that she had suffered a hypovolemic shock, which is a severe loss of blood and liquids while giving birth. This resulted in a loss of blood pressure which kept her from reacting in a different way,\" Del\u00e9on told reporters.Both Hernandez and her defense team have said that her pregnancy was the result of a rape.Abortion retrial for teen rape victim Evelyn Hernandez is suspendedAbortion illegal under any circumstanceAbortion is illegal in El Salvador under any circumstance, including when the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother or in cases of rape. Depending on the charge, Salvadoran women who are suspected of having an abortion or an induced miscarriage can face serious charges including aggravated homicide, with sentences ranging from two years in prison to up to 50 years, according to Amnesty International.Hernandez's is the first abortion case to be tried since Nayib Bukele became president in June. During a campaign event last October at a local university in San Salvador, Bukele said he was anti-abortion but that he didn't agree with convicting poor women who suffer miscarriages.The unintended consequences of US global abortion policy\"If a poor woman suffers a miscarriage, she's immediately suspected of having had an abortion,\" Bukele said. \"That's where the issue of social inequality comes into play.\" He has not made any statements regarding Hernandez's case.Most of the women who have faced criminal charges for abortions in El Salvador come from poor rural backgrounds, and many suffered miscarriages or had obstetric complications because they weren't able to get regular check-ups due to lack of resources, says Herrera, the pro-choice activist. She and her organization have been at the forefront of pushing for reform to the country's abortion bill. \"We want Evelyn to go free,\" Herrera told CNN. \"But we know the realities of what the prosecution is asking for and know that, if convicted, she could face 30-50 years in prison.\"In 2017, the UN rights office urged El Salvador to change its \"draconian\" abortion laws, saying abortion should not be a crime when the pregnancy puts the mother at risk or in cases of rape or human trafficking.Defense team feeling \"positive\"Hernandez's defense team told CNN that they were feeling \"positive\" earlier this week, ahead of the trial's start.Elizabeth Deras, one of Hernandez's lawyers, said some of the witnesses who testified last month presented evidence that suggested that the baby died from complications during the delivery, implying that it was not the fault of Hernandez.\"We're feeling positive as her defense team because some of the prosecution's witnesses revealed details that are important for our case,\" Deras told CNN. \"The doctor who performed the autopsy on the child said the cause of death was aspiration pneumonia and that meconium was discovered inside the baby's stomach.\"Hernandez has already served 33 months of her initial 30-year sentence. She was freed last February after her team presented an appeal before the Supreme Court and requested her retrial.Herrera said she and others supporting Hernandez's case will gather outside the courthouse with protest signs demanding her freedom.Bryan Avelar contributed to this report from San Salvador",

The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world. (CNN)Friends and loved ones of Stanford University star soccer player Katie Meyer, who died by suicide earlier this month, will pay their respects at a memorial service on Saturday.Meyer, who helped secure the 2019 NCAA women's soccer championship for her school, was found dead in her dorm room on March 1, the university has said. A medical examiner determined her cause of death was suicide.Meyer's parents are asking the public for their privacy to be respected ahead of the memorial service at Newbury Park High School Stadium in Newbury Park, California. \"We are very grateful for the generous outpouring of support for Katie and our family and thank you all deeply. Katie was a bright light in our lives and the lives of so many. Her light will continue to shine through the changes that we intend to accomplish in her honor,\" Steve and Gina Meyer said in a statement to CNN. \"When the time is appropriate, we will provide further information regarding the desired and necessary change to prevent this tragedy from happening to other students and their families. We ask that everyone respect our family's privacy and give us the time we need to heal.\"Read MoreMeyer was a senior at Stanford, where she studied International Relations and was team captain as well as goalkeeper on the soccer team. Stanford University star soccer player died by suicide, parents tell NBCIn an emotional interview with NBC's \"Today\" show on March 4, Gina Meyer expressed anguish as her family grieved Katie -- saying the days following her death were \"like a parent's worst nightmare and you don't wake up from it, so it's just horrific.\" Her parents told NBC that they had spoken with their daughter hours before she died.\"She was excited and she had a lot on her plate, and she had a lot going on, but she was happy. She was in great spirits,\" Gina Meyer said.Gina Meyer acknowledged the pressure to be perfect and \"the best\" could induce anxiety. But \"the only thing we can come up with that triggered something,\" she said, was some form of disciplinary action at school. Katie had recently defended a teammate on campus over an incident and she was facing repercussions because of it, her parents said, pointing to that as the possible turning point for their daughter.Last week, Stanford said in a statement it has begun the process of adding more mental health counseling professionals to its staffing and encouraged people to seek the school's counseling and psychological services. \"For all in our community who are suffering, know that whatever feelings are arising in you are normal and need time to be felt. There's no one way or right way to grieve, and we are here to support each other as we find our own paths to healing,\" the university said.A GoFundMe has been established by friends and family for Meyer's memorial service.CNN's Cheri Mossburg and Stella Chan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Los Angeles County Public Defender's office has identified about 100 ongoing cases that involve the more than dozen Torrance police officers accused of exchanging racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic messages, Ricardo Garcia told CNN on Saturday.To date, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has dismissed about 40 felony cases, and the Torrance City Attorney has dismissed about 50 misdemeanor cases involving these officers, officials in those offices told CNN.Authorities in California dismissed 90 cases so far due to the involvement of Torrance officers under investigation for racist texts\"It brings into question the credibility of these officers, right?\" said Garcia, the Los Angeles County public defender. \"Because when they write reports, when they testify, when they talk about our clients to the prosecutor, their credibility about what our clients may or may not have done, is being weighed.\"More than 1,800 cases spanning over a decade in Los Angeles County are now under review due to the allegations against the officers, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.Greg Risling, the assistant chief of media relations for District Attorney George Gascon, wrote to CNN that prosecutors are reviewing criminal allegations of unreasonable force by these officers, which have been presented to their office.Read MoreState officials also conducting a reviewThe Torrance Police Department also faces an independent review from the state's department of justice, Attorney General Rob Bonta said Wednesday. Garcia said his office has not seen all the alleged text messages verbatim. But because of California's requirement that prosecutors turn over so-called \"Brady materials\" of exculpatory evidence or materials that could be favorable to the accused, prosecutors have now sent about 300 letters to Garcia's office, referring to and quoting Torrance officers' troubling messages.Garcia said his office has requested copies of all the text messages that may contain offensive material, but has not yet received them. He said it's unclear how far-reaching an impact this may have.After a long history of defendants and their families telling him about racist or bigoted behavior by officers, Garcia said technology is now allowing for video and electronic documentation of this alleged behavior.\"This is nothing new,\" he said. \"When I read about the officers thinking this way, I wasn't shocked by their actions. I was actually more surprised at the fact that they were so brazen, so bold, to communicate electronically back and forth.\"Hundreds of cases are being reviewed after police officers involved were relieved of duty over racist and anti-Semitic messages Tom Yu, an attorney representing former Torrance Police Officer Cody Weldin, told CNN he is going to court Monday to try to have his client's cell phone data suppressed. Yu said the search warrant and extraction of data were done in violation of the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.Weldin is one of two Torrance officers accused of spray-painting a swastika inside a suspect's vehicle, a case which prompted a larger investigation and the discovery of troubling text messages among more than a dozen officers.Sgt. Mark Ponegalek, public information officer for the Torrance Police Department, told CNN 15 Torrance police officers are currently on paid administrative leave. Some were put on leave as early as August, with more officers put on leave later as more information became available through the ongoing investigation.Los Angeles Times investigation revealed text messagesThe independent review came after an investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed a history of discriminatory text messages reportedly sent between what it says were at least a dozen current and former Torrance police officers and recruits, including a photo of Black men being lynched with the caption \"hanging with the homies.\"The LA Times report also references records from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office that said TPD officers made offensive jokes about Jewish people and threatened to assault members of the LGBTQ community.

He brought his four children, who tried to learn English while enrolled in what was then all-virtual school at the time. His wife joined them five months later.Thursday was the first time they had been invited by an American household to experience a Thanksgiving meal.\"Every homeland, every nation, every people, every person, they have got a culture or tradition, right? So it is our first time, and now we want to learn a little bit about what this is, really,\" Asghary said.This pilot fled Afghanistan as a child. Now he's bringing Afghan refugees hope on their journey to AmericaTheir host, Kiki Nagy, volunteers for Miry's List, a Southern California-based group that helps refugee families settle in the U.S. In August, during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Miry's List enrolled more than 20 refugee families, about five times the number of families compared to the month before. Next year, the organization is working to prepare to help more than 300 families settle in Southern California.Read MoreNagy had asked the organization's founder, Miry Whitehill, if she could host an Afghan family for their first Thanksgiving. She was connected with the Asgharys, whom she had never met until the day of the feast.Nagy made a big turkey, cranberry sauce, potatoes and spinach. But she also prepared a halal lamb to make sure the Asghary family could have something familiar to eat. Asghary said his daughter, especially, liked all the food.Nagy was eager to not only introduce them to Thanksgiving dishes, but to also show them the tradition of giving thanks.\"From the right and the left, everyone is kind of like, 'America has got problems -- x, y, z,\" Nagy said. \"In the midst of this conflicting cultural moment, this narrative of division that we hear so much about, that there is something essential to the American experience that is rooted in gratitude, that is rooted in the volunteerism that you leave your country, you leave a situation and you come here with sometimes very little -- sometimes with nothing. And you start over. And you create this opportunity for your family.\"Wahidullah Asghary.Asghary said they have much to be thankful for: \"We may have more opportunities in our life in our hands. So of course the foremost example is this, that we are together. Family.\"He said they're lucky his wife was able to join them before so many others tried to make a chaotic exit in August during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.The image of the many families trying to escape Afghanistan in August especially resonated with another guest at the same Thanksgiving party, Tam Van Tran.Tran, a friend of Nagy's, was a refugee from Vietnam in 1975. Tran told CNN he and his siblings arrived in the U.S. one week before the fall of Saigon.\"When I saw the photo of the Afghans and the cargo plane, it reminded me very much of just -- I was in the same, but it was a gigantic cargo ship,\" Tran said.Asghary's family enjoys its first Thanksgiving meal.When Tran came to California, he was about the same age as Asghary's oldest children. He said he and his siblings escaped initially without their parents, so they were welcomed in the home of Richard and Rejean Schulte, a foster family in Mountain View, California.He said he could offer the Asgharys a warm welcome: \"Brotherhood and camaraderie. In a sense, you know...I went through that experience in '75.\"Like at many holiday gatherings across the country, several people at the table were at one point new to the country and had to learn American traditions. And many of them worked to seize the opportunity available in their new home country.Asghary said he tells his children, \"We are here for you, the United States is here for you, and everything you have got in your hand. What are you going to do is you have to study. That's it.\"Nagy hopes one of their first lessons would be from their first Thanksgiving: \"To see that that kind of tolerance is really possible in the United States and, um, I guess I would want them to feel, I would appreciate, that Americans are at heart, really a generous people.\"",

Tornadoes occurring at night are more than twice as likely to be deadly as those during the day.When tornadoes occur during the day, people are awake, alert, and make a conscious effort to seek out weather alerts. At night, it is a different story. It is imperative to be sure you have a weather radio, weather app on your phone or any other alerting system to wake you up if you live in an area expecting severe storms overnight.By Tuesday the threat for severe weather increases as it shifts further east. The potential for strong tornadoes, hail, and damaging straight line winds exist from Lafayette, Louisiana, east into Huntsville, Alabama. A Level 4 out of 5 \"moderate\" risk for severe storms has been issued across portions of Louisiana and Mississippi by the SPC, and includes Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi.A Level 3 \"enhanced\" risk surrounds the moderate risk and includes New Orleans.Nighttime tornadoes will also be a concern Tuesday evening as well for areas of Alabama, southern Mississippi and the western panhandle of Florida.Wednesday, the focus becomes an area between Mobile, Alabama and Columbia, South Carolina.Warm, moist air will surge in from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of the advancing cold front, increasing the potential for flooding as well.\"Rainfall totals greater than 2 inches are possible and could create rapid runoff and flooding issues.\" the Weather Prediction Center said.While most areas of the Southeast will pick up between 1-3 inches of rain, isolated spots could see as much as 4 inches through Wednesday.Texas could use the rainTexas has been ravaged by fires during the past week along with worsening drought conditions in recent months. More than 90% of the state is now in drought, according to the US Drought Monitor update released Thursday morning.But before the much-needed rain arrives Monday, low humidities and gusty winds ahead of the cold front will bring an increased fire threat.Elevated and critical fire weather outlooks have been issued for parts of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota for Sunday.Widespread sustained winds of 20-25 mph are expected across the region, with gusts as high as 45-50 mph. Minimum relative humidities will drop to 10-15 percent by Sunday afternoon.While rain is set to arrive Monday, it cannot come soon enough. Most of the panhandle of Texas has not seen significant rainfall for much of the winter, largely preventing the normal March \"green-up\" and leaving areas with a large, dry fuel load, simply meaning the drier plants are more likely to burn.",

The main threats include damaging winds, though a few tornadoes and hail are also possible.Iowa, including Des Moines, can expect severe storms Saturday, mainly in the afternoon and evening. Omaha, Nebraska; Kansas City, Missouri; and Madison, Wisconsin, also could see severe storms Saturday. Read More\"It is rare to get severe weather that far north this early in the year, but it is not unprecedented,\" said Bill Bunting, chief of forecast operations at the Storm Prediction Center. \"It certainly doesn't happen every year.\"Typically in March, severe weather is focused over the Gulf Coast states, from Texas to Florida. For example, Texas averages 11 tornadoes in March, while Iowa typically only sees two.By Sunday, the severe storms will shift south, with the greatest threats from Paducah, Kentucky, back to Dallas. Those storms are mostly likely to hit from late afternoon Sunday into Monday morning, with a few tornadoes possible, along with damaging winds.While most places will not see a tremendous amount of rain, flooding will still be a concern in areas along the Ohio River Valley, particularly in Kentucky, where the ground is still moist from a very wet February. With several rivers still above flood stage, weekend rainfall could prolong flooding on main rivers and renew it on smaller creeks and streams.The weekend's interesting weather setup owes to a cold front producing winter weather in the northern Plains and Upper Midwest. As the front dives south into the Mississippi River Valley, it will encounter temperatures 20 to 30 degrees above normal.\"The abnormally warm air mass that has set up this week will allow the 'warm sector' of the storm (which will feature the thunderstorms and potential for severe weather) to extend all the way up to Iowa and southern Minnesota, which is unusually far north for this early in the spring,\" said Brandon Miller, CNN meteorologist.Winter isn't over yetMeanwhile, some parts of the Upper Midwest -- where temperatures still feel more like winter -- will have to deal with snow, sleet and freezing rain. \"Saturday will not be the ideal day to drive,\" the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan, tweeted.Snow, freezing rain, and thunder, oh my!

Many places will get a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain on Saturday morning before transitioning to rain or freezing rain as the temperature warms up through the afternoon. By Saturday night into Sunday morning, the precipitation will change back to snow and sleet as temperatures drop below freezing again.This will be a relatively fast-moving system, without a lot of time to dump a significant amount of snow. Most areas of Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan will pick up 2 to 5 inches, with isolated spots of 6-8 inches.\n\nFrom Kansas City up to Milwaukee and east to Knoxville, Tennessee, temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees above normal Saturday. Once the front moves through, those temperatures will drop sharply. How cold will it be in your city?For example, Chicago will go from a high-temperature Saturday in the mid-60s all the way down Monday to highs in the mid-30s, with a chance of snow showers. St. Louis will see a similar drop, going from the mid-70s for a high Saturday all the way down Monday to highs in the mid-40s.Heat and wind could trigger firesFurther west, elevated and critical fire weather conditions are expected this weekend across Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas.\"Winds of 20-30 mph are expected with locally higher speeds possible,\" according to the Storm Prediction Center. \"Relative humidity of 15-20% is probable, though values near 10% are not out of the question.\"Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly issued a declaration of disaster emergency Thursday \"due to the potential for wildland fires in the state on Friday and Saturday,\" according to a news release. \"Strong winds and low relative humidity with an abundance of dry vegetation will once again cause extreme fire danger across central Kansas Saturday afternoon,\" according to the National Weather Service Office in Topeka.Kelly urged \"all Kansans to be vigilant.\"Unseasonably warm temperatures that began Friday in the Southern Plains will shift east and south over the weekend.Record high temperatures are possible in over 40 cities from Mississippi to Massachusetts this weekend, but it does not last long.

The low pressure system's location -- whether offshore or closer to the coast -- will determine how much rain, snow and ice these areas see.Read More\"If it's too far offshore, you literally could have nothing,\" Petro told CNN Weather. \"But if it stays close to the shore, then we could have a wintry mix of snow, some sleet, maybe some freezing rain closer to the coast.\"Parts of Texas will go from 80 degrees and sunny to an ice storm in 36 hoursEastern North Carolina and South Carolina are likely to see widespread freezing rain late Thursday into Friday. On Saturday, conditions could shift to sleet and snow.\"Our best forecast is that areas away from the immediate coast and beaches will see a quarter of an inch, maybe as much as four-10ths of an inch of ice, lower amounts near the coast and maybe some lower amounts where some sleet and snow will mix in along our I-95 corridor counties,\" said Mark Bacon, meteorologist at the Wilmington weather service office. A little farther north in Virginia, temperatures will be just cool enough that most precipitation will be in the form of snow.\n\nFrom Raleigh up through Virginia Beach and Norfolk, 2 to 4 inches of snow are forecast.Travel and power outage concernsJUST WATCHEDEasy ways to prepare your home for winter stormsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEasy ways to prepare your home for winter storms 02:17When it comes to ice, travel and power outages remain the most significant concerns.In coastal South Carolina and Georgia, where freezing conditions are \"fairly rare,\" icing will be the main challenge, said Steven Taylor, lead forecaster with Charleston, South Carolina, weather office.\"Any type of icing is significant for us, but we have a lot of elevated bridges and roadways across, especially the Charleston and Savannah metro areas. So, any type of icing that could occur will certainly be a problem for travelers.\"\nAnother concern is what happens after the storm passes. By Saturday night, temperatures are expected to drop into the 20s across much of the Carolinas, making for dangerous conditions if customers lose power.\"Most deaths occur after an ice storm,\" Bacon said. \"People succumb to carbon monoxide poisoning when they're using heaters that aren't rated for the indoors,\" he said, adding that people should avoid any unnecessary travel from Friday through Saturday morning, when the storm will be at its worst.And if you do run a generator, Taylor emphasized, make sure it is in a well-ventilated space.CNN meteorologist Tom Sater and Paradise Afshar contributed to this story.",

        "content": "(CNN)Despite several recent drenching rainstorms in the West and enough snow to top the second story of some buildings, the United States has tied an alarming drought record: At least 40% of the Lower 48 has gone 68 straight weeks -- more than 17 months -- in drought conditions.Drought was present in nearly 55% of the contiguous US this week, according to the US Drought Monitor. The last time drought has been so widespread for so long was October 2013. And without significant and unprecedented precipitation over the next seven days, the country will be in uncharted drought territory and break that record outright. The last 7 years have been the warmest on record as planet approaches critical thresholdAlmost all of the US drought is located west of the Mississippi River, with extraordinarily dry conditions in far Western states, which scientists warn is a consequence of the climate crisis. Much of the West's drought is actually a long-term phenomenon, persisting from year to year without enough precipitation to lead to a full recovery, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture.\"The Southwest has been experiencing what many scientists have termed a 'megadrought' for about two decades,\" Rippey told CNN.In November, US drought coverage climbed above 50% for the first time since 2013. Before the 2013 records, the US had also experienced 65 consecutive weeks of drought between March 2002 and June 2003. The US Drought Monitor has been tracking conditions since 2000.Read More\n\nCurrent dry conditions are being exacerbated by water overuse, said Michael Anderson, a climatologist with the California Department of Water Resources. When the storms come, it might not be enough to replenish the aquifers, he said.\"That can take quite a bit of time, because its water is coming back to the aquifers,\" Anderson told CNN. \"But water is continuing to be used, so you have to have enough water coming into the aquifer that exceeds the use for that restoration to occur.\"Oregon also saw a huge increase in precipitation in December, but it did little to bring up the reservoirs around the Rogue River Basin, where half of the reservoirs are at less than 10% of capacity. Even as recent winter storms have helped recharge the parched Western landscape, drought has worsened in the Southern Plains, especially in Texas, where it has increased from 15% to 82%  in just the last three months.Winter rain and snow has helped, but not enoughThe winter season started strong with remarkable rain and snow in December, especially in California. For the first time since December 2020, the state this week has no areas with exceptional drought -- the highest designation, the US Drought Monitor reported. Extreme drought, the second-highest, is down to 1%, whereas 80% of the state was considered extreme or worse just last month.A quarter of the state's total average winter snowpack came in December alone, said Julie Kalansky, deputy director of operations for the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes.\"Currently, the snowpack is at about 50% of the end of season normal snowpack,\" Kalansky said. \"The storms helped a lot, but if there are not some other large storms this winter, it will not be enough to end the drought.\" Other states also saw huge gains -- including Oregon and Washington, where several cities broke daily rainfall records in the final month of 2021. \"We call it a great start,\" Anderson said. \"We are always appreciative when winter starts as fantastically as it did because that's the kind of start we needed. The challenge is that we kind of need to sustain that through the rest of January through March.\"A Wet December in CA/NV: Drought Buster, False Hope, or Somewhere in Between?Storms brought more than 200% of normal precip to parts, improving water storage.But the next 2 weeks look dry.Jan/Feb precip is key.See https://t.co/lgc09Nl32I @CnapRisa @WRCCclimate @DRIScience pic.twitter.com/fg5Rzffg3p\u2014 NIDIS Drought.gov (@DroughtGov) January 7, 2022\n\nRippey agreed that the West needs more storms this winter. \"Despite the promising start to the Western winter wet season, additional storminess will be needed in early 2022 to sustain the recovery from a multiyear drought,\" he said.Tremendous gains in precipitation only go so far when you're starting from such a low number, Rippey said.\"By July 1, 2021, the surface elevation of massive Lake Mead, which lies behind Hoover Dam along the Colorado River, fell to 1068.66 feet above sea level -- the lowest level since the spring of 1937,\" when the reservoir was created, he said.\n\n\n\nInteractive: The Colorado River's shortage is a sign of a larger crisis\n\n\nWhere precipitation falls is critical, too. California is a geographically complex state, with the highest elevation point (Mt. Whitney) and the lowest elevation point (Death Valley) in all of the Lower 48 states. Drought in Northern and Central California is arguably more problematic than drought in Southern California, Rippey said.\"A key element of California water in that we have our large water projects in (the) north, where typically more rainfall falls,\" Anderson said. \"Then, we move water where there tends to be less rainfall, but there tends to be more people because the weather is really nice.\"Years where all areas of California are dry, as now, pose a stiff challenge, and people rely more on stored water and groundwater.What this could mean for the futureScientists have noted that the variability in precipitation isn't just changing over the course of years but now within the same year -- something they call \"weather whiplash.\"'Off the charts': Weather disasters have cost the US $750 billion over past 5 years\"Now, even within the year, you can have a really wet month, like we did in October -- we had a fantastic atmospheric river -- then November comes around and it's really dry,\" Anderson said. Then, \"December comes to us quite bountiful, but now we're back in January and January is dry. That can really challenge trying to navigate that back-and-forth, unless you are prepared.\"Dry conditions aren't just a concern for reservoirs and water supply but also for fire mitigation. Where conditions are dry, fires can spark. In 2021, California and Colorado were hit by devastating fires that spread rapidly due to prolonged drought conditions. Wildfires in the West were the third-costliest weather disaster in 2021 at more than $10 billion.In general, droughts that may have occurred only once every 10 years or so now happen 70% more frequently, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in August. The climate change connection is particularly strong in the Western United States, it concluded.CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.",

Bookmark this site to check if snow is forecast for your regionToo much of a good thing for some statesThe West has hardly seen a break over the past several weeks after being pummeled by record-breaking rain and snow from Washington down to California. The cumulative effect of all that rain and snow will increase the threat for river flooding and avalanches.According to tweets from the Washington state Department of Transportation, \"extreme weather has created conditions so hazardous that it's too dangerous for our crews to be in the mountain pass areas. Because of that, Snoqualime, Stevens, White & Blewett passes will not reopen until at least Friday & possibly not until Saturday. Additionally, SR 14 and Oregon's I-84 in the Columbia River Gorge, are also closed to freight traffic, with I-84 closed to ALL vehicles. This means cross-state travel is almost completely impossible.\"Read MoreThe Northwest Avalanche Center in Seattle is warning that large natural avalanches will occur at all elevations of the Cascades, Olympics and Mount Hood. The center warns that backcountry travel is not recommended at this time.The rain and snow are very helpful in terms of mitigating drought conditions, but too much in a short period of time is far from helpful.\"All in all, this rain, combined with the snowmelt from the coastal mountains and to some degree, the lower slopes of the Cascades, will push many rivers upward, some potentially reaching near flood stage,\" the National Weather Service office in Portland, Oregon, said. Southern snow equals travel troublesAfter a very mild Christmas week across much of the southern US, the new year is trying to give winter a comeback.Updated Key Messages for the winter storm that will impact areas from the Mid-South into the Northeast today through Friday, bringing a swath of accumulating snow and some light freezing rain. pic.twitter.com/3CSk0RHoCK\u2014 NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) January 6, 2022\n\n\"Today, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along the arctic front draped across the Deep South,\" the Weather Prediction Center said Thursday morning. \"The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous road conditions through tonight in this region.\"By late Thursday afternoon, much of Kentucky and northern Tennessee were blanketed in four to eight inches of fresh snowfall. The snow led to snarled traffic and accidents in Nashville and Lexington, Kentucky.So far a wide band of 4 to 7 inch snow has fallen,Lesser amounts farther south, especially near the Alabama border where sleet and freezing rain has been more common. Tapering off soon, but hazardous travel will continue. Very cold night, so have extra gear if you must travel. pic.twitter.com/qm6CwKcicH\u2014 NWS Nashville (@NWSNashville) January 6, 2022\n\nKentucky State Police are working on clearing what they describe as a more than 20-car pileup on the Western Kentucky Parkway during winter weather conditions. Officer Scotty Sharp told CNN that the parkway was closed in both directions near mile marker 131 in Elizabethtown. \"The only injuries being reported at this time are minor non-life threatening,\" Sharp said.Sharp said the highways are covered in snow with a temperature of 20 degrees. \"I have no doubt that there is ice under that snow, and the snow is still coming down,\" he said.By Thursday evening, the snow will wind down in Tennessee and Kentucky as the system begins to shift into the Mid-Atlantic region.Even more snow up northBy Friday morning, the low-pressure system will move off the Mid-Atlantic coast and begin to rapidly deepen offshore, causing accumulating snow to spread from the Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast. \"The storm track for an approaching coastal low pressure system is beginning to become more clear,\" the NWS office in Boston said. \"At this time it appears as though this system will pass just south and east of the 40N/70W benchmark. This will support accumulating snowfall for almost all of southern New England.\"\n\nThere are some uncertainties, though. The NWS office in New York points out that any shift in the track of the storm will modify snowfall amounts. For example, if the track shifts slightly closer to the coast, that could increase amounts, especially across Long Island and southern Connecticut, but a track slightly to the east out to sea, could result in lesser amounts.Another question mark with the forecast will be whether any heavier snowbands develop, such as snow squalls.In Virginia,  Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency Wednesday evening and the National Guard is being mobilized to assist with emergency management as the state faces its second winter storm this week.In anticipation of the winter storm, Maryland and Virginia Health officials announced changes at their testing and vaccination sites. The Maryland Department of Health will delay operating times at various locations Friday and it urged customers to verify operating status of any site prior to visiting. Five Virginia Community Vaccination Centers will be closed on Friday.In Massachusetts, government officials are directing all non-emergency state employees who work in executive branch agencies not to report to their workplaces Friday. Boston Public Schools are closed. \"The Administration is urging residents to stay off roadways and to use public transportation when possible as the storm moves across the Commonwealth beginning late tonight and through tomorrow,\" said a statement released by the office of Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced a state of emergency effective at 10 p.m. Thursday evening as the state expects to receive about six inches of snow. That same low pressure system will generate gusty winds across the Northeast as we head into the weekend. Part of the concern with tonight/tomorrow's #snow is the timing. Short range models are signaling the potential for snowfall rates to exceed 1\"/hour just as the morning commute gets underway.Treacherous roadway conditions are likely, especially early. If possible, avoid travel! pic.twitter.com/PNXlsQGe2T\u2014 NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) January 6, 2022\n\nIt may be January, but the Great Lakes don't know that. They are still quite warm, relatively speaking, and that means lake effect snow will also be in full gear as another low pressure system slides by the region.\"A low pressure system lifting into eastern Canada will allow for heavy lake effect snow as chilly westerly winds blow over the still relatively warm lakes,\" the WPC said. \" Favorable locations downwind of the lakes could see 6 to 12 inches of snow by Saturday morning, with locally higher amounts.\"The polar plungeIn the Southeast, the snow usually melts as quickly as it arrives, so you don't have long to enjoy it. In this case, the snow will be lingering thanks to the temperatures taking a polar plunge.\"Sub-zero daytime highs will engulf the northern Plains today while temperatures as much as 20-25 degrees below normal will overspread the central Plains, parts of the southern Plains, and eastward into the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Friday,\" the WPC said.Even cities as far south as Atlanta, Memphis, Tennessee, and Huntsville, Alabama, will barely get above the freezing mark for high temperatures on Friday. East of the Rockies, the below average temperatures will extend all the way from the Canadian border down to the Gulf Coast, except for Florida.CNN's Amy Simonson, Jessica Jordan, Jaide Garcia and Sahar Akbarzai contributed to this report.",

As a cold front pushes its way into spring-like warmth all week over the southern states, it will help fuel strong to severe thunderstorms across the area. \"There is a moderate risk of excessive rainfall and an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower Mississippi Valleys from Saturday into Sunday morning,\" the WPC also said.Track the storms hereRead MoreThe weekend is also forecast to start off with measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix that are expected to cause widespread hazardous travel conditions on New Year's Day from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes.Another round of severe stormsOn the warm side of the front, ample moisture will help support storms capable of all severe weather hazards including large hail, damaging winds, flooding, frequent lightning, and tornadoes.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Saturday declared a State of Emergency due to severe rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes and strong winds across the state.\"It is devastating that we are once again experiencing severe weather just weeks after the deadly tornadoes hit Western Kentucky. Sadly, some counties have been affected by both of these events,\" Beshear said in a press release.\"We will continue to monitor the weather and provide needed updates. Everyone be aware, stay safe and seek shelter when advised.\"Central Alabama, including the cities of Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, are under a tornado watch until 10 p.m. CST according to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). Severe storms are expected to develop through the afternoon and evening.As they move through central Alabama, these storms have the potential to produce tornadoes, some of which could be strong, noted SPC. Additionally, these storms may produce damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph and large hail.The SPC also issued a tornado watch for portions of southeast Arkansas, northern Louisiana and central Mississippi until 8 pm CST.And a tornado watch is in effect for northern Alabama, northern Georgia, western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee until 3 am EST, according to the SPC.Clusters of severe storms containing embedded supercells will continue to quickly spread in the region through the late evening and early overnight hours.These storms may produce tornadoes, some of which could be intense, noted SPC. Additionally, these storms may produce damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph.Storms developing in these areas have the potential to produce damaging wind gusts up to 80 mph, SPC said. Storms in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi have the potential to produce hail nearly the size of golf balls. Flooding will also be a major concern, especially across Kentucky, where cleanup is still ongoing from the tornadoes that ripped through the western part of the state nearly three weeks ago. Family of five and their grandmother are confirmed dead in the Kentucky tornadoA flood warning remains in effect until 8 a.m. Sunday in portions of Western Kentucky as streams continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\"It will take several hours for all the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas,\" the warning said.Between 2 and 4.5 inches of rain have already fallen and additional rainfall amounts of possibly a half an inch are possible.Flood watches are in effect from eastern Oklahoma all the way through West Virginia.Widespread rain totals of 1-3 inches are expected from western Arkansas to western Pennsylvania. Kentucky could see the highest amounts, up to 4 inches through the weekend.Given that the ground is already saturated across Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee, flooding and flash flooding could be likely, forecasters said.New year, new (colder) weatherAfter an incredibly warm December for much of the US, the new year may bring the first prolonged taste of winter for some states. This could be the first significant snow event of the season for the Midwest, with widespread snowfall accumulations of 4 inches possible from eastern Kansas to Lake Michigan. Heavier snow bands could result in even higher amounts of 6-8 inches or more along the Iowa/Missouri border and northern Illinois, resulting in widespread travel disruptions.\"Saturday morning, mountain ranges such as the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch, and both the central and southern Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet of snow with totals exceeding 3 feet in the highest elevations of Utah and Colorado,\" the WPC explained.  \n\nYou can't have snow without cold, and there will be a major drop in temperatures this weekend. Wind chill alerts are in effect for over half a dozen states across the northern Plains as subzero temperatures are forecast, with wind chills possible down to 45 degrees below zero.\"The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes,\" the NWS said, referring to areas of Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska, and the Dakotas.As the arctic air continues farther south and east it will bring plummeting temperatures to some cities that have not yet felt winter's chill.Saturday, Memphis will go from highs around 70 degrees with thunderstorms down to highs in the mid 30s on Sunday, with some snow showers possibly mixed in.

        "content": "(CNN)Donald Trump is having second thoughts. Eleven months ago, he endorsed Rep. Mo Brooks for the Alabama US Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby. \"Few Republicans have as much COURAGE and FIGHT as Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks,\" said Trump in the April 2021 endorsement. Read More That support immediately made Brooks the front-runner in the GOP primary. \"With President Trump's endorsement, it's clearly Mo's race to lose,\" former Alabama Republican US Rep. Bradley Byrne told CNN at the time. The intervening months have suggested that Brooks is well on his way to doing just that.  His fundraising has lagged badly behind that of Katie Boyd Britt, a former chief of staff for Shelby. Britt had raked in almost $5 million for her campaign through the end of last year, compared with just over $2 million for Brooks. (And according to Politico, Britt's former boss is set to transfer major funds to a super PAC supporting her candidacy.)  Perhaps more importantly for Trump, Brooks -- who had aggressively pushed the false idea that the 2020 election was somehow stolen -- is, in the former President's mind, softening on the issue. \"I am baffled by the view that we can do something right now to put Donald Trump into office today,\" Brooks told a local radio talk show this week. Add it all up, and Trump is beginning to look for an exit strategy. As CNN's Gabby Orr reported Friday: \"While Trump has been seething over Brooks' lackluster campaign performance for several months now, four people familiar with the situation told CNN that he has reached his breaking point and is weighing when and how he might pursue a course correction in the contentious Republican primary. ...\"  That story followed an interview earlier in the week with The Washington Examiner in which Trump said Brooks was \"disappointing.\" Trump added: \"I'm determining right now, has Mo Brooks \u2014 has he changed?\"Trump then is trying to frame his second thoughts on Brooks as a disagreement on principle. (\"[W]hen you endorse somebody, you endorse somebody based on principle,\" he told the Examiner. \"If he changed that principle, I would have no problem doing that.\") But that's not really what's going on here. Remember the first rule of Trump: Always be a winner. And its corollary: Always associate yourself with winners. Brooks looked like a sure-fire winner nearly a year ago when Trump endorsed him. He's shown himself to be a mediocre candidate with much less of a chance of winning since then. So Trump wants off the boat. Because that's what he does. The Point: Loyalty is a one-way street for Trump. He will be loyal to you as long as it's good for him. And not one second longer. Sorry, Congressman.",

        "content": "(CNN)As you've been reading about the Russia-Ukraine crisis, you may have noticed a slight -- but significant -- discrepancy in how different media outlets spell Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's name.CNN uses the single \"y\" spelling for \"Zelensky,\" while Fox and MSNBC go with a double \"y\" for \"Zelenskyy.\" The New York Times and The Washington Post are both single \"y\" organizations. The Associated Press is a double \"y\" outlet. Reuters goes in a completely different direction, spelling his last name \"Zelenskiy.\"So, what gives? And why?The issue is primarily one of transliteration -- from the Cyrillic alphabet used in Ukraine to the Latin alphabet we use in America. There simply isn't a clear and definitive way to render the Ukrainian President's last name through our alphabet, which leads to the variety of spellings you see.Zelensky himself has it spelled \"Zelenskyy\" on his passport. In May 2019 his administration said he preferred that spelling when his name was transliterated from the Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet. Read MoreIn June of that year, Peter Dickinson, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, noted that in the early days of Zelensky's time in office, his own administration had his name spelled differently on different official releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nWrote Dickinson:\"As anyone who has ever covered Ukrainian affairs will confirm, spelling confusion surrounding the English-language versions of Ukrainian names is the rule rather than the exception. While some names such as Shevchenko lend themselves to flawless transliteration, many are ambiguous enough to open the floodgates for all manner of competing variations. This results in English-language coverage of Ukraine in both the media and academia that often employs a dizzying array of contradictory spellings while referring to the same people. For a country that is still struggling to shake off decades of international obscurity, this is particularly unhelpful.\"Dickinson added that the confusion over the spelling was part of a broader lack of understanding about Ukraine in the world community. \"Spelling the English-language versions of Ukrainian names in a consistent manner will not prove decisive in the information war, but it would mark a minor step away from perceptions of the country as a perplexing and often incomprehensible place where even people's names are open to interpretation,\" Dickinson argued.There is also some debate as to whether using the double \"y\" is an act of defiance against the Russians by Zelensky.To understand that, consider how the capital of Ukraine is spelled. \"Kyiv\" is the transliteration in English of the Ukrainian spelling of the nation's capital. \"Kiev\" is based on the Russian spelling of the city's name. \"Kyiv means that you transliterate into English from the original Ukrainian name of the Ukrainian capital. By doing so you recognize the fact that it is Ukrainian. By not doing so you question the fact that it is a Ukrainian city,\" Dr. Yuri Shevchuk, a member of the department of Slavic languages at Columbia University, told The Forward earlier this month.What should have the final word in this spelling debate? What better place than Twitter, which Zelensky has used extensively during the Russian invasion to get out word of the situation on the ground?

In fact, three-quarters (76%) of respondents used negative words to describe the state of the US, while only 15% used positive ones. That's indicative of other poll questions aimed at gauging the mood of the country.  In that same Monmouth poll, Americans were asked if they thought the country was on the right track or headed in the wrong direction. Just 24% said the right direction, while a whopping 73% said the wrong track. That sourness about how the US is doing has clear reverberations in the electorate. If voters feel generally unhappy about the country, history suggests they will take it out on the party that controls Washington.

Janice McGeachin spoke virtually at an event organized by White nationalist Nick Fuentes in Florida at the end of February.Her participation in that event -- which also featured the likes of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona -- was the subject of an interview she did with a local reporter named Brian Holmes, who works for a Boise TV station.This exchange between the two is remarkable:Holmes: Are you familiar with who puts this event on, like Nick Fuentes?McGeachin: I don't know who he is. I've never met him. I don't know who he is.Read MoreHolmes: Did you not look into it before you decided to say, 'Ok'? Like to find out -- his name is on it.McGeachin: Well, you know what, Nick Fuentes, as I said, I don't know him. He's never -- I've never met him. I don't know ... everything that he says or doesn't say does not reflect on who I am or who the thousands of others that are participating in this movement.Holmes: You didn't bother to look up his name or anything?McGeachin: I didn't say that.Holmes: You did look him up?McGeachin: That's not the question that you asked me.Holmes: Did you look up who Nick Fuentes was and what he's talked about? Like, things he has said?McGeachin: I have since. ... The mainstream media -- you do this to conservatives all the time, but you don't do it to yourself. That every time -- any time there's any kind of affiliation with anybody at any time on any stage, that we are all guilty by association. And it's not appropriate.(You can watch the full exchange here.)McGeachin is challenging Idaho Gov. Brad Little in the Republican primary this year with the backing of former President Donald Trump. So, let's give McGeachin the benefit of the doubt here -- although her past statements and controversies don't really warrant it.Under the BEST-case scenario for her, this is what happened:1. She agreed to record a video for an event organized by a high-profile White nationalist.2. She did zero due diligence -- and by that I mean going to Google and typing in the name \"Nick Fuentes.\"3. She delivered the speech and, after it created controversy, decided to look him up.4. When pressed on why she didn't know who she was speaking to, McGeachin said that she can't be held responsible for who she associates with.So, yeah.The interview went on for several more minutes, with Holmes trying to get McGeachin to explain what she knew and when she knew it. McGeachin obfuscated and blamed him for trying to \"assassinate me or my character.\" She then abruptly ended the interview and walked off.The position that McGeachin appears to be trying to hold here is that she is a) absolutely blameless for speaking at a conference organized by a White nationalist and b) she can never be held accountable for what people she associates with say or do.Both of those views are, of course, ludicrous. On the first point, it is the responsibility of every person in the public eye to do some basic research on whom they are spending time with, addressing or just generally being associated with. It's literally Politics 101.On the second issue, politicians are always held accountable for whom they choose to be around or near. Need a reminder of that fact? How about Jeremiah Wright, the controversial pastor at a church then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama attended? Or Roger Clinton, Bill Clinton's half-brother?Politics is riddled with these sorts of cases. Politicians are always held responsible for whom they choose to interact with -- because it can provide a window into who they really are when the spotlight is not shining on them.McGeachin is no exception. Which, of course, she knows.",

In a 2013 Pew Research Center poll, just 4 in 10 (43%) of self-identified Republicans agreed with the statement \"humans have evolved over time,\" while a plurality (48%) said that humans have always existed in their current form. (Two-thirds of Democrats and independents said they believed humans had evolved over time.)More recent data speaks to that split. Gallup survey data shows that in 2019, 40% of respondents said that God created humans in their present form, while 33% said humans evolved with God guiding the process and 22% said humans evolved without any influence from a divine being. (The number of people saying humans have always been in our current form has been on the decline over the past decade while the number of people who say evolution happened without any influence from God has been on the rise.)But let's not get twisted here. What Walker is doing isn't debating whether evolution exists and if a divine hand plays a role. Instead, he is fundamentally misunderstanding what scientists say and what evolution does.",

President Joe Biden hasn't offered his take on whether he would sign such a bill -- yet. (You can be sure the White House will be asked about this ASAP.)Read MoreSo, how did we get here?The notion of, well, saving daylight goes all the way back to Benjamin Franklin. In a satirical essay he wrote while he was a US envoy to Paris in the latter stages of the 18th century, Franklin noted the power of using  \"the economy of using sunshine instead of candles\" as a way to save Parisians money. (Fun fact: Daylight Saving Time never had anything to do with farming despite the persistence of that myth. Farmers actually lobbied against Daylight Saving Time!)But it wasn't until 1966 -- and the Uniform Time Act passed by Congress -- that Daylight Saving Time became the law of the land. (Worth noting: The Act allowed individual states to opt out of the whole Daylight Saving Time thing. Hawaii and Arizona currently do not follow DST.)The impetus for the act was, ostensibly, to save energy (and money.) As Vox's Brian Resnick wrote:\"The idea is that in the summer months, we shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, we'd presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving electricity.\"It also means that you're less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning since those are shifted an hour later too. Hence 'saving' daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.\"But this premise never seemed to pan out. The presumed electricity savings of taking advantage of more daylight in the evening turns out to be unclear or nonexistent.\"Under the original law, you would \"spring\" your clock forward an hour on the last Sunday of April, and \"fall\" back an hour on the last Sunday of October. That changed when then President George W. Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which, beginning in 2007, had the country spring forward on the second Sunday in March and fall back on the second Sunday in November. In 2005, Indiana, which had previously not followed Daylight Saving Time, also passed a law to put it in step with the rest of the country (except for Hawaii and Arizona). The measure was pushed by then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, who insisted the state's refusal to participate in DST had hurt business in the state and led to confusion.As best as I can tell -- based solely on personal experience -- the only argument to fall back is so that I don't fall asleep watching \"Saturday Night Live\" for that one episode on the second Saturday night in November. Which isn't enough of a reason to keep the status quo.",

It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\"When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges.\"And that was written a decade ago -- long before there was a President Donald Trump, a Sen. Josh Hawley or a Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene!Not surprisingly, the ideology of Congress as a whole has also moved rightward. The House (+.13) and Senate (+.14) are both demonstrably more conservative than they were in the 92nd Congress back in 1971-1972.What those findings mean is that not only have Republicans moved faster and further to the ideological right than Democrats have gone to the left, but also that they have made the entirety of the House and Senate more conservative over the past 50 years.The Point: It is true that Democrats have grown slightly more liberal over the past five decades. It is also true that Republicans have grown FAR more conservative over that same time and, in so doing, have moved the overall ideological center of the House to the right as well.",

Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\n\"A man stung by the presidential bee contracts an incurable disease that only embalming fluid can cure,\" said Harold L. Ickes, who was secretary of the Interior for more than a decade during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Ickes is the father of Harold M. Ickes, the longtime confidant of the Clintons.)Ickes was talking, specifically, about Thomas Dewey, who was the Republican nominee for president in 1944 and 1948. He lost the first race in a landslide to Roosevelt. The second race was so close that some newspapers -- most notably the Chicago Tribune -- declared Dewey the winner, only to see Harry Truman eventually emerge triumphant. Dewey was hardly the only politician who just couldn't quit running for president.   Adlai Stevenson II was the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and won a contentious convention fight for the nod in 1956. He ran a third time for the job in 1960, but was defeated by John F. Kennedy.Hubert Humphrey, a senator and onetime vice president, ran unsuccessfully for president three times: 1952, 1960 and 1968. (He was the Democratic nominee only once -- in 1968 -- when he lost to Richard Nixon.)Ronald Reagan, the father of the modern Republican Party, ran for president in 1968 and 1976 before finally winning in 1980.Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2008 and 2016, losing both times. (She also seriously considered running in 2004.)Mitt Romney lost a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, won the nomination in 2012 and was mentioned as a 2016 candidate before deciding against a third bid.And let's not forget that the current occupant of the White House -- Joe Biden -- lost bids for president in 1988 and 2008 before winning the Democratic nomination and the general election in 2020.I'm in the midst of writing a book about the sports presidents played, loved and spectated -- and what those sports reveal about who they are, really, and how they governed. The trait that has come up again and again in my research is that presidents are among the most competitive people on the planet. \"He is the most competitive person,\" said David Katz, a frequent golfing partner of former President Barack Obama. \"He loved the competition of the game and the moment. It was almost like a political race.\"I'd disagree only slightly with Katz. It wasn't \"almost\" like a political race. It was exactly like a political race.The simple reality is that extremely competitive people tend to find fields in which they can be routinely tested against others to see how and if they measure up. For athletes, that competition itch is scratched through practices and games. For politicians, it's through primary and general elections.And what they often come to realize is that the competition high produced in the heat of a game or a campaign can't be replicated. They wind up chasing that feeling for the rest of their lives -- even when the chances of winning appear elusive.That's the feeling Brady is chasing. \"Unfinished business,\" he said by way of explaining his return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Joe Biden understands.",

        "content": "(CNN)On Wednesday, news broke that Donald Trump had refinanced his mortgage on Trump Tower with a $100 million loan through a California bank whose president has been a donor to the former President's political campaigns.This seems like an odd move for a bank, given the legal and financial questions that have surrounded Trump since he left office in 2021. I reached out to Kara Scannell, a CNN correspondent well-versed in all of Trump's various legal and financial entanglements, for some answers.Our conversation, conducted via email and edited lightly for flow, is below.Cillizza: Let's start simple: What is the loan in question? When did Trump take it out? And when is it coming due?Scannell: The new loan is a refinancing of a commercial mortgage the Trump Organization took out on Trump Tower in 2012. That was a 10-year loan with an interest rate of 4.2% that came due this year, according to a financial disclosure filed by Trump.Read MoreThe lender of the original mortgage loan was Ladder Capital, a New York firm where the son of Trump's longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, is a senior executive. The new lender is Axos Bank of California. The documents for the new loan don't say what the financial terms are, so we can't evaluate if the interest rate is at, above or below average. (Weisselberg and the Trump Organization were indicted last year on charges they were involved in a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty.)Cillizza: Earlier this year, his longtime accounting firm -- Mazars -- walked away from the veracity of the last decade of his financial records. Does that factor into this loan at all?Scannell: This new loan was signed by Eric Trump on February 15, one day after the New York attorney general made public Mazars' letter stating that the Trump Organization and its lenders should no longer rely on those past financial statements. The NYAG's and Manhattan district attorney's investigations into the Trump Organization, and specifically the accuracy of its financial statements, have been publicly known for some time. The NYAG levied allegations of possible fraud in a January court filing and specifically alleged misstatements and omissions in the financial statements.It's very likely the new lender was aware of these public documents and would have come across them while doing its own due diligence and credit analysis before authorizing the loan. Banks do their own research about the creditworthiness of borrowers and make decisions based on multiple factors. Axos has declined to comment on the loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nCillizza: What do we know about the bank that agreed to refinance the loan?Scannell: Axos Bank is based in San Diego. It was formerly known as the Bank of the Internet, and its president for more than a decade has been Greg Garrabrants, a Trump supporter who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. He and the chief credit officer, who signed the loan agreement, have donated thousands of dollars to Republicans, Trump and Trump-related campaigns in recent years.Cillizza: Why would they do it given Trump's financial and legal peril?Scannell: For banks, it's about risk, reward and getting repaid. Big Wall Street banks stopped lending to the Trump Organization more than a decade ago following Trump's bankruptcies and litigation -- apart from German lender Deutsche Bank, which was trying to make a mark in the US. Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the company more than $300 million, said after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol that it would no longer do any future business with Trump. With that history, Trump has gone to smaller lenders, who have been willing to finance deals based on terms that they've negotiated, whether it's personal guarantees, high interest rates or other security. Collateral for the loans are Trump properties, which in this case is a towering Fifth Avenue condo and office building, with a prime location and Gucci as its flagship tenant. Eric Trump said the company is sound financially despite the legal pressures it's facing. \"We have incredibly low debt, have a tremendous amount of cash and have an extremely profitable company. We had no problem refinancing,\" he said.Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \"This refinancing does  for Trump's overall finances.\" Now, explain.Scannell: The deal shows there are still lenders willing to finance the Trump brand even while the parent company is under criminal indictment and there are open investigations into the business and its founder. Based on Trump's disclosure, it's the only loan due in 2022 so it alleviates, for now, any pressure facing the company related to existing debt. The Deutsche Bank loans for his Miami golf course, Trump National Doral, are due next year.Trump has been raising money since his presidency, tapping funds from the Republican National Committee to pay for some of his legal defense, and expanding into books and other projects to bankroll his lifestyle. He also launched a social media platform, Truth Social, which is funded by a publicly traded blank-check company called Digital World Acquisition Corp. His focus appears to have shifted away from the real estate business, which he transferred day-to-day operations of to his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. in 2017, and to post-presidency business ventures that can capitalize on his popularity.",

        "content": "(CNN)There's been a debate for much of the last few months as to when we really will know that the Covid-19 pandemic is over. The answer, at least in political terms, is March 25, when Hawaii will become the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. \"It's taken the entire community to get to this point -- with lowered case counts and hospitalizations,\" said Hawaii Gov. David Ige in a tweet announcing the decision.Read More While Ige also said he would consider reinstituting the mask policy \"if needed,\" it's very hard to imagine Hawaii -- or any other state -- going back to a mandatory masking policy. What's remarkable is the pace with which states -- those led by Republican governors, but also those with Democratic governors -- started to drop their mask mandates after an Omicron-fueled surge in cases this winter. Last month, many states that still had indoor mask mandates began announcing they would end the policies, in some cases even before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its national masking guidance. California Gov. Gavin Newsom very publicly declared that his state was moving to the \"next phase\" of dealing with Covid-19 in mid-February.  \"We have all come to understand what was not understood at the beginning of this crisis, that there is no end date, that there is not a moment where we declare victory,\" Newsom said in announcing the plan to treat the virus as endemic rather than a pandemic.That rush among even Democratic governors to drop mask mandates reflects, yes, the drastically lower case numbers. But it is also proof that even for those most tolerant and supportive of mask-wearing, patience has run out. In Axios-Ipsos polling late last month, 62% of Americans said they were wearing masks at least sometimes when leaving home. As recently as January, that number was 73%. (The highest the number ever went was 92% in December 2020/January 2021.) In the third year of Covid-19, people are done with it -- and acting accordingly. Given that, it's hard to imagine any politician -- no matter their party -- insisting on another mask mandate, even if cases do surge at some point. The Point: Over the past two years, masks became the biggest symbol of not just our battle against the virus, but also our own political views. Now it seems everyone agrees that it's time to take them off -- for good.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona:Reporter: Any update on your conversations with Congressman Gosar and Greene?McCarthy: Yes, I've talked to Greene. I'm still waiting to talk to Gosar.Reporter: And?McCarthy: I've talked to them. Read MoreReporter: But I think you told Jake and Manu [Raju] there's no place for that?McCarthy: There isn't no place for that. There's no place for what has gone on with that organization by far, and there never will be in this party, and it'll never be tolerated.Reporter: Will she go again?McCarthy: No, she will not go again.Reporter: Any repercussions for her?McCarthy: Look, my conversations with my members are exactly that, and I appreciate you asking. ... They have the ability to be able to get committees based upon that time when it comes.At issue is the fact that Greene and Gosar recently addressed a conference organized by a White nationalist.It's far from the only transgression either one has committed.Greene was removed from her House committee assignments  last year after a series of intolerant remarks made before she came to Congress came to light. Gosar was formally censured by the House -- and removed from his committees -- after sharing an anime cartoon video showing him appearing to kill New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attack President Joe Biden. Greene also drew widespread scrutiny last year when she compared mask mandates in the House to the Holocaust.When Greene commits a transgression like this, McCarthy usually expresses his dismay and meets with her. And then, well, nothing. (McCarthy opposed the vote to remove Greene from her committees, dismissing it as a \"partisan power grab.\".)He appears to be going down that same road again in the wake of the conference appearance by Greene (and Gosar).If you've ever raised a kid -- or known anyone whose raised a kid --  you know that's a sure-fire recipe for Greene to just keep acting out.Let's say your 9-year-old eats with his hands rather than using utensils. (I know this problem intimately well.) If after each time he does it, you say, \"Hey, stop doing that,\" but don't include any sort of punishment or consequence, well, you can be sure he is just going to keep right on doing it. While he probably doesn't love you telling him to stop eating with his hands, it's not a significant enough penalty to get him to actually change his behavior.The same goes for Greene. She is utterly unafraid of McCarthy because she knows he isn't going to really punish her -- almost no matter what she does. McCarthy badly wants to be speaker of the House if Republicans retake the majority this November. And he, rightly, believes that Green, Gosar and their fellow House Freedom Caucus members represent the only real threat to that scenario coming to pass.McCarthy can't be speaker with the House Freedom Caucus aligned against him. So he is simply not going to do anything to rock the boat with that decidedly volatile group. Which means the best he can -- or will -- do is to tell Greene she can't go to any more White nationalist conferences. Which, well, duh.What it all means is that Greene will keep acting out and avoiding any real consequences for doing so.",

        "content": "(CNN)Buried within the 2,700-page omnibus spending bill unveiled early Wednesday that would fund the federal government through September is something called \"member-directed spending.\" It might well be the single most important thing in the bill if you care about Congress actually passing legislation.See, \"member-directed spending\" is just a fancy name for earmarks -- a system by which federal spending in a certain district or state can be appended to legislation as a sweetener for the members of Congress representing those areas. Need an example? Drive through West Virginia and you'll see all sorts of highways and byways named after Robert C. Byrd, the long-serving senator from the Mountain State.Earmarks had long been part of the legislative process as a way to grease the wheel of bill-passing.But beginning in earnest with Arizona Sen. John McCain's 2008 campaign for president, earmarking began to be regarded as a bad thing. McCain was a longtime opponent of earmarks -- known derisively as \"pork\" to Beltway insiders -- and would regularly call out what he believed to be over-the-top pet projects inserted into bills by lawmakers. Read More\"233 million for a bridge to nowhere,\" intoned a narrator in an ad McCain ran during that election. \"Outrageous. Three million to study the DNA of bears in Montana. Unbelievable. A million dollars for a Woodstock Museum -- in a bill sponsored by Hillary Clinton. Predictable. Who has the guts to stand up to wasteful government spending? One man. John McCain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nAlthough McCain lost that race, former House Speaker John Boehner, himself a longtime opponent of so-called \"pork barrel spending,\" saw his chance. As part of Republicans' 2010 campaign for Congress, Boehner targeted the elimination of earmarks as a way to signal to the average voter that it was time to change the way Washington did business. When Republicans retook the House majority in that election, Boehner did exactly as he had promised -- he got rid of earmarks entirely.It seemed, at the time, like a smart political move. People were sick and tired of the insider game played by those in Washington -- the massive earmarking scandal involving California Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham had been national news earlier in the decade -- and banning these pet projects seemed like a way to get corruption (or the appearance of corruption) out of politics.Notice that I used the word \"seemed\" in that last paragraph. Because the actual impact of banning earmarks was very different than what those who pushed the ban hardest believed it would be.What happened, in practice, was that leaders in both parties lost leverage over their rank-and-file members. They no longer had a carrot to dangle in front of wavering members to get them to sign on to a piece of legislation where the vote was tight.That loss of leverage was compounded by the rise of third-party groups -- led by super PACs -- over the past decade. Their ascension signaled a diminution in the power of political parties. No longer could party leaders overseeing campaign committees bend members to their will by offering -- or withholding -- support. Add those two factors together, and you get developments like the rise of the House Freedom Caucus, a rump group that has no loyalty to or fear of party leaders. And over the last decade, it's the extremes -- like those represented by the Freedom Caucus -- who have increasingly have influence in Congress. (The irony is not lost on me that the Freedom Caucus, which Boehner helped to empower by banning earmarks, were responsible for running him out of the speakership in 2015.)The simple fact is that without earmarks in the modern political climate, congressional leadership has no tools to cajole and convince lawmakers to be for anything. The default position has, therefore, been \"no.\" Obstruction -- on everything -- has been the order of the day.Now, just because earmarks are back doesn't mean legislation will be rolling through Congress immediately. But it does mean that party leaders now have at least some real ability to persuade their members on key bills. Which makes a world of difference.",

        "content": "(CNN)From the very beginning of his presidency, Joe Biden has pledged to make sure communities hit hardest by Covid-19 will receive sound information about the virus and access to vaccinations. \"Equity (and) equality\" remain \"at the heart\" of the government's responsibility, Biden said at a White House briefing last summer. \"We need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door -- literally knocking on doors.\"  But some of the small groups representing communities of color that were contracted as part of a National Institutes of Health Covid-19 outreach project tell CNN they have not been paid properly. The end is near: The new pandemic data looks promising -- for some, anyway\"We lost trust in the system,\" said Venus Gin\u00e9s, president of D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina, who said the NIH effort has been \"poorly managed from the beginning\" and \"poorly executed.\"  \"It's a very lousy system, not set up for community engagement, but no matter how much we talk about it and there are apologies for it, there is no attempt to reform it,\" said Ysabel Duron,  executive director of the Latino Cancer Institute in California. \"For me, the system has to change.\"  Read MoreUnder that system, community groups such as D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina and the Latino Cancer Institute front money for their NIH projects and get paid back later.Gin\u00e9s said participating in the NIH program cost her organization $64,000 in unreimbursed invoices, which the NIH denies.   She said other costs were reimbursed many months late. Duron and the leader of a third community group also said it took months to reimburse tens of thousands of dollars in expenditures, which put a huge stress on their small operating budgets.  Dr. George Mensah, an NIH official, told CNN that many community organizations have been involved with his agency's effort, called the Community Engagement Alliance Against COVID-19 Disparities or CEAL, and he has heard directly about problems with only one of them, D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina.  He said NIH's \"strategic partnerships\" with community-based organizations -- the \"boots on the ground\" -- play a \"critical role\" in \"building confidence in the vaccine [and] conveying essential messages around prevention, so we take them very, very seriously.\"  As the CDC shifts masking guidance, Americans are split on path forwardMensah said NIH is \"committed to resolving\" the challenges small community-based organizations have had with CEAL and is \"fully, fully committed\" to making sure that the community groups are compensated \"promptly\" and \"fairly.\" At the center of the issue is the reimbursement model NIH used for the contracts with the community groups. Several  of these groups told CNN that while they were aware they wouldn't be paid up front, it has been a huge financial strain to spend tens of thousands of dollars of their own money and then wait -- sometimes for many months -- to get paid back.Mensah said NIH recognizes that small community groups are not like large academic centers and \"are not able to go out and do the work and wait to be paid later.\"  People involved with CEAL say they told NIH in the first half of 2021 there were problems with this payment system, but that NIH did not explain until last month that faster payment methods were possible.  Birth of an unprecedented NIH effort  In the spring and summer of 2020, federal officials realized they needed to work on two Covid-19 problems in communities of color -- and fast.   First, the virus was hitting these communities hard, with disproportionately more hospitalizations and deaths than White people.  Second, NIH and the pharmaceutical company Moderna were having trouble recruiting people of color into clinical trials for the Covid-19 vaccine.  Demand for Covid-19 testing is falling, but experts caution it's as important as everTypically, when the NIH sets out to address a health problem, it works with large organizations such as universities or pharmaceutical companies. But in 2020, agency officials spoke often about the need to do something different -- they needed to engage trusted messengers in small grassroots groups.That's how CEAL was born in September 2020. Since then, more than $48 million has been spent on the program, according to NIH.  \"Never before has NIH been involved in a community engagement effort of this magnitude,\" Mensah, director of the Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science at the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute told CNN, noting that \"the size, the scale, scope and speed with which we've responded [to] communities in greatest need has been unprecedented.\"  NIH at that time reached out to universities in 11 states and asked them to seek out grassroots, community-based groups to work on the project.  One of those universities, the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth, reached out to D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina, the health advocacy group that Gin\u00e9s, a breast cancer survivor, started 25 years ago in Texas. While the group is small, with just two full-time employees, it's well-known, and Gin\u00e9s was honored for her work at a White House event in 2009.  Gin\u00e9s said her group was approved for a $230,000 budget for a CEAL project, which included expanding a telephone hotline where bilingual promotores de salud, or community health workers, answer questions about Covid-19, logging thousands of calls a month.  \"COVID-19 Hotline Beats Misinformation One Call at a Time,\" proclaimed a headline on a May 2021 article on NIH's CEAL website. Gin\u00e9s says while the NIH was touting the hotline's success, her invoices to CEAL to pay the promotores were not being reimbursed.  D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina expanded a telephone hotline where bilingual community health workers answer questions about Covid-19.NIH is accustomed to working with large organizations that have financial and government contracts departments experienced at working out the nitty-gritty details of complicated NIH contracts and accounting requirements.But D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina doesn't have anything close to that kind of staffing -- the only full-time employees are Gin\u00e9s and an administrator. When Gin\u00e9s asked the university for reimbursement for her work on CEAL, she says she spent months submitting and resubmitting invoices and waiting for payments.  The US still isn't getting Covid-19 data right While other community leaders told CNN they believe bureaucratic issues are at the root of CEAL's reimbursement issues, Gin\u00e9s said for her, the entire experience adds up to \"systemic racism.\"\"Universities create metrics that are inherently biased when allocating budget funding to community partners,\" Gin\u00e9s wrote to CNN in an email. \"These practices are rooted in upholding systemic barriers that privilege larger institutions over smaller, grassroots ones. We call this a subtle form of structural racism and discrimination.\"  The \"COVID-19 pandemic exposed a deep-rooted under-investment and under-valuing of community- based organizations (CBOs) especially Community Health Workers/Promotores who are the footsoldiers combating COVID-19, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation,\" she added.  When asked about that charge, Mensah said NIH valued its partnerships with community groups and that \"remunerating them (is) very, very important to us.\" Jamboor Vishwanatha, the principal researcher for the Texas CEAL program, said he valued the \"tremendous contribution\" made by D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina to CEAL.The university and D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina communicated \"in an effort to detail invoicing instructions, outline the required Subrecipient Monitoring Form, and a request for [D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina] to update its budget to be in compliance with the NIH Uniform Guidance. This back and forth continued over several months,\" Laken Rapier wrote in an email to CNN in January, when she was associate vice president at the University of North Texas Health Science Center.   Surgeon general launches effort to get to the bottom of Covid-19 misinformationGin\u00e9s says she felt frustrated with both the university and NIH as she struggled to pay the promotores who were working the hotline phones.\"We felt that the government really spoke from both sides of their mouth,\" Gin\u00e9s said, meaning that the NIH emphasized the value of engaging with community groups, but did not ensure these groups were paid promptly for their work.  To form the CEAL team, NIH has contracted with universities in 21 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, which in turn have made subcontracts with community organizations.  Luis Torres-Hostos, a CEAL project lead at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said the community groups he's worked with on CEAL \"live paycheck to paycheck\" and have had to \"wait and wait and wait\" to get their payments.  \"The community-based organizations are critical. We can't do this work without them, so we've got to figure out a way to get money to them faster,\" Torres-Hostos said. \"There's going to be another health crisis, and if we don't learn lessons from this [CEAL] project, we're going to be in deep trouble next time.\"  A researcher at a university in Arizona that's participating in CEAL told CNN that the community groups he subcontracted with email \"constantly\" to ask when they will be paid. The researcher asked to be anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media about sensitive internal matters.   \"This is not an environment that's good for these small community organizations to work in. They can't wait six or seven months to get paid,\" the researcher said, adding that the community groups \"understand the needs of the community and their voice is essential in projects like these, but if we can't get them paid in time, then going forward, they're not going to trust us enough to partner with us anymore.\" NIH referred specific questions about CEAL community-based organizations to universities.  \"NIH's awards management relationship is with the primary recipient of NIH funding, not with the recipient of subawards made by the prime awardee,\" NIH spokeswoman Hillary Wicai Archer wrote to CNN. \"Given the nature of government funding, NIH can only speak to the funding that its administrative center awarded to principal investigators of the 21 CEAL teams at their academic institutions.\"  'We're depending on the big guy to pay us'  In addition to D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina, other community-based organizations involved with CEAL also said they struggled, waiting months to get reimbursed for tens of thousands of dollars in expenses for the work they did.  Duron, director of the Latino Cancer Institute in San Jose, California, said her group fronted about $16,200 for CEAL work starting in October 2020, doing media cultural sensitivity training seminars related to Covid-19, and didn't receive a reimbursement for six months. She said other reimbursements also took months.   \"We're depending on the big guy to pay us,\" she said, adding that it created a \"snowball problem\" as she sometimes couldn't pay her workers on time or had to use money from other grants to pay her workers.  She said her small organization -- she's the only full-time employee -- struggled to keep up with the complicated requirements to get reimbursed.  \"They were throwing paperwork at me like I was a multimillion dollar vending company,\" she added. \"We don't have huge financial offices. We don't have multi millions of dollars in business with you. If you want the community to be able to work with you, you have to make adjustments.\" When teens blow off pleas to get Covid-19 vaccines, the consequences can be deadlyDuron received her CEAL contract through UCLA.  \"The Latino Cancer Institute has been paid in full, consistent with our agreement. We understand the concern and apologize for the inconvenience related to timing,\" according to a statement from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \"While we received the first invoice from the Latino Cancer Institute in December 2020, we were unable to disperse payment until the contract was completed and signed in March 2021. Two subsequent invoices were paid promptly after receipt of invoices. We thank the Latino Cancer Institute for the thoughtful and valuable services provided.\"  The leader of a community group in another state said when they started working on a CEAL project to do Covid-19 outreach and education, they were not allowed to submit invoices for three months.While a three-month wait might not be much of an issue for a large company or a university, it was a major financial problem for this small community organization, the leader said, asking to speak anonymously \"to avoid any possible retaliation or retribution.\"  CDC estimates 140 million US Covid-19 infections\"I literally just wanted to help,\" the leader said, but \"[the university officials] were fierce.\"  She said once the three months were over, her small organization -- it has no full-time employees -- submitted and resubmitted invoices only to have them sent back to her because they failed to follow some rule or another. She said for one invoice to be paid, it took nearly 30 emails between her and about five different people.  \"At one point they basically said, 'If [you] can't figure it out, we can't accept the invoice.\"  Torres-Hostos, a professor and founding dean of the school of social work at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said he worked out payment issues with this community leader and thought it was resolved.  \"We made sure that the right people met with her and explained the process and the forms and how to fill them out, and once that was done, it was smooth sailing,\" he said.  The community leader said the process was not smooth, but after about four months, her group was paid in full. Complaints to federal officials  These problems came to a head in June of 2021, when Gin\u00e9s sent an email to Mensah at the NIH.   She wrote that CEAL had \"missed opportunities\" for universities \"to fully support community stakeholders who often execute the lion's share of the important work of reaching and intervening with distressed populations to bring about improved health outcomes and health responses in communities.\"  Mensah said he took Gin\u00e9s' complaints \"very seriously\" and called her within an hour of receiving her email.  He receives a lot of email, \"but an email like that we act on immediately,\" he told CNN. Covid-19 booster shot uptake is at all-time low in the US, CNN analysis findsGin\u00e9s told CNN that in that conversation, she asked Mensah to allow payments to be made in advance to community groups, instead of using the reimbursement model.  The day after Gin\u00e9s sent her email, another NIH official, Erynn Hunt, wrote to her that \"we are distressed to hear that members of the CEAL coalition of community-based organizations and health workers are not receiving payments and are working to better understand the issues.\"  Mensah said as far as he knew, the issue with Gin\u00e9s had since been resolved.  But Gin\u00e9s told CNN that CEAL\u202fdid not compensate her for $64,000\u202fof what she spent on her CEAL work.\u202f Vishwanatha, the principal investigator on the UNT CEAL grant, disputed this, and said Gin\u00e9s overspent her budget for the first six months of the project. Two months later, after speaking with Gin\u00e9s, the leader of a nonprofit group reached out to a White House official.\"How are we to expect community orgs to jump through hoops such as this while they have been called upon during a global emergency to educate and facilitate vaccination among our most vulnerable populations?\" Amy Pisani, CEO of Vaccinate Your Family, wrote to Dr. Bechara Choucair, then the White House Covid-19 vaccinations coordinator.  A source involved with the situation said Choucair sent a response the next day and forwarded Pisani's email to officials at the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees NIH,  for follow up. The source asked to be anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the media about internal department communications.  'In our community, it's all about trust'  Community groups weren't the only ones complaining last year to NIH officials about the payment structure to community groups.   Vishwanatha, the principal investigator for the Texas CEAL team, said a few months after the program started in September 2020, CEAL researchers and NIH officials started discussing the difficulties during regular weekly calls and asked whether there were alternative ways to pay the community groups.  \"All of us -- all the CEAL teams -- we are all in agreement that something needs to be done,\" he said, referring to CEAL contractors at other universities. \"There's no question about that.\"  But Mensah, the NIH official, told CNN last month he was unaware that universities had asked about alternative payment methods.These US counties still have 'high' Covid-19 levels as their states lift mask mandates, CNN analysis showsVishwanatha, a molecular geneticist and director of the Texas Center for Health Disparities, told CNN it was his understanding from discussions with NIH officials that the agency required that the contracts be made on a reimbursement basis, and payments could not be made up front.  \"This is a contractual mechanism where you do the work, you get paid. There is no down payment here,\" he said. \"The governmental procedures -- there's not much you can do. You have to go through all of these rules and requirements.\"  Torres-Hostos, the researcher at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, said he had the same understanding.  \"I didn't even think it was possible\" to pay community groups up front, he said.  But it turns out that for months, CEAL teams in several other states had been making payments up front.  Lisa Hamilton Jones, who runs a community group in Florida, said the University of Miami approached her in the fall of 2020 about a CEAL contract to do Covid-19 community education. But she said when she found out it would be on a reimbursement basis, she declined, and the university then agreed to make some of the money available in advance.  Covid-19 is killing more people now than during most of the pandemic. Here's who's still at riskJones said she had no financial issues with her CEAL contract, worth about $45,000.  \"I ended up having the opposite experience as other community organizations,\" said Jones, the co-president of the Florida Community Health Workers Coalition.  CNN first approached the NIH about this story last fall. Last month, an agency spokeswoman informed CNN that it was possible for universities to have prepayment arrangements, and included a list of several CEAL teams with such arrangements.\"Through preliminary data recently obtained through the CEAL review process which began last summer, we have learned that several of the CEAL funded universities have alternative approaches to ensure timely payment to community-based organizations,\" Archer, the NIH spokeswoman, wrote to CNN. \"CEAL is currently engaged in sharing these alternative payment models and processes with all 21 teams so that they can learn from each other's promising practices.\"  Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.She added that \"NIH is committed to ensuring that (community-based organizations), critically important partners in the fight against COVID-19, are paid on time\" and that \"NIH is committed to providing resources to its prime awardees to assist them in ensuring their subawardees (community-based organizations) are appropriately remunerated. When any challenge has come to NIH's attention, our business office has stepped in when appropriate and worked with awardees to ensure full payment.\"  Archer added that \"it's important to remember that we are in the middle of a pandemic\" and NIH is a \"learning organization\" that is \"taking the time to review processes, understand what is working, [and] identify and address challenges.\"  Rapier, the official at the University of North Texas, said her university did not learn about these alternative payment possibilities until a meeting on February 18. Vishwanatha said that for the next year of funding, he proposed to NIH paying the community organizations 20% of their money up front.The community leaders interviewed by CNN questioned why the NIH hadn't mentioned the possibility of using alternative payment approaches when the program started a year and a half ago.\"What happened with the money -- it's like a symbol -- you want my participation, but it feels like every step of the way you guys don't want to make it easy to participate,\" said Duron, the community leader in California.  Said Gin\u00e9s of D\u00eda de la Mujer Latina, \"They lost my trust. And in our community, it's all about trust.\"",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A federal judge on Thursday panned a recent court filing from special counsel John Durham, chastising him for including unnecessary information that fueled a firestorm in right-wing circles about supposed spying on former President Donald Trump.Judge Christopher Cooper of the DC District Court made the comments during a hearing in the case of Michael Sussmann, a layer who worked for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and was charged with lying to the FBI during a meeting about Trump's connections to Russia. Unspooling the latest twists in special counsel John Durham's investigation Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty, accused Durham's team of including unnecessary and incendiary material in a routine court filing to gin up negative coverage in Trump-friendly outlets. The judge agreed that the information was unnecessary, rebuking Durham's team. But notably, he said he was working off the presumption that the prosecutors were acting in good faith, and he rejected an attempt by Sussmann's lawyers to remove the material from the court record. \"Including the material in this motion, it was not necessary for me, let alone for Mr. Sussmann,\" Cooper said during the brief court hearing. \"I didn't see any link to areas that were relevant ... I didn't need any of that ancillary information ... I don't know why the information was in there.\" Read MoreThe disputed information was about Sussmann's efforts to prod the US government to scrutinize Trump's ties to Russia. Trump, Republican lawmakers and right-wing media outlets twisted and exaggerated what Durham said in the filing, and falsely claimed that it proved there was a massive \"deep state\" conspiracy by Clinton and others to spy on Trump during his presidency. During the hearing, Cooper pointed out that Durham previously said some people \"overstated, understated, or otherwise misinterpreted\" his filing. So, Cooper asked Durham's team if they wanted to correct any of the inaccurate information that was spreading. They declined. \"We don't want to enter that game of correcting misinterpretations that might be out there,\" replied Andrew DeFilippis, one of the prosecutors on the special counsel team. \"We will be very careful to be accurate to this court. ... We think everything we said in the motion was accurate.\"Former Attorney General William Barr appointed Durham in 2018 to investigate potential misconduct in the Trump-Russia investigation. His probe has not yet unearthed any of the Watergate-level wrongdoing that Trump has claimed went on. But Durham secured a guilty plea from a low-level FBI lawyer and has charged two people, including Sussmann, with lying to FBI investigators.",

        "content": "(CNN)Special counsel John Durham, who has been investigating the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia probe, ignited a firestorm in right-wing circles last weekend with a cryptic court filing.   The new filing fleshed out the case against Michael Sussmann, a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign who was charged with lying to a top FBI official during a meeting about then-candidate Donald Trump's connections to Russia. In the filing, Durham suggested Sussmann's allies \"exploited\" government databases to snoop on the Trump White House.  Right-wing media said it was exposing a scandal. What it really revealed is how bad information spreads in MAGA world This triggered a tsunami of coverage from pro-Trump outlets, and outrage from Republican lawmakers and Trump himself -- all of it rife with distortions, false claims and misinformation.   In a rebuttal filing Monday, Sussmann's lawyers said Durham was wrong about critical facts. His lawyers say the data was properly obtained and predated Trump's presidency. They also accused Durham of deliberately ginning up a false narrative for right-wing media.   Cyber researchers involved have said they are apolitical actors who were concerned about the national security implications of the data they uncovered. They also say Durham is cherry-picking their emails to make it look like they fabricated an unfounded narrative about Trump and Russia. Read MoreHere's a full breakdown of the latest twists and turns, in a saga that started over five years ago.   What new material did Durham reveal?  Durham previously accused Sussmann of working with cybersecurity researchers and data scientists to undermine Trump in 2016. They allegedly did this by digging up dirt about his ties to Russia, and peddling it to the media and US government agencies, in hopes of triggering an investigation. (Sussmann, who was charged with lying to a top FBI official, has pleaded not guilty and the case is slated to go to trial later this year.)   Durham alleged these researchers examined \"domain name system\" data, often called DNS lookups. It's like looking for a number in the phone book. A log is created when a computer gets ready to connect with a server, but the lookup itself doesn't prove that any communication occurred. Durham claims the cyber researchers had access to this trove of DNS data through a federal government contract.   U.S. Attorney John Durham, center, outside federal court in New Haven, Connecticut in February 2021Sussmann's allies believed they found some potentially alarming links from Trump to Russia, and have said it was within the purview of their government contract to look for security threats.   One dataset possibly linked the Trump Organization to Alfa Bank, the largest private bank in Moscow. Separate DNS lookups suggested that obscure Russian-made smartphones may have been used at Trump Tower and the White House. Durham's recent filings gave the impression that this data was from during Trump's presidency, but that assertion is now hotly contested.   What did Sussmann do with the data?  Durham previously revealed that Sussmann met with a top FBI official in September 2016 and passed along the information about the potential Trump-Alfa connections. Sussmann also met with CIA officials in February 2017, and Durham's latest filing gave new insights into what was discussed.   During that meeting with CIA officials, Sussmann \"further claimed that these (DNS) lookups demonstrated that Trump and/or his associates were using supposedly rare, Russian-made wireless phones in the vicinity of the White House and other location,\" Durham said in the filing.   Michael Sussmann in September 2021 in Washington, DC.But Sussmann's lawyers claim that isn't what he told the CIA -- and that Durham knows it. They also highlighted the fact that the meeting occurred after Trump took office, and therefore couldn't have been an attempt to undermine his campaign.  \"The Special Counsel is well aware that the data provided to (the CIA) pertained only to the period of time before Mr. Trump took office, when Barack Obama was President,\" they wrote in their court filing, accusing Durham of intentionally crafting a misleading narrative.   What have Trump and his allies said?  Trump and his allies essentially have taken Durham's assertions at face value -- and then some. They claimed, falsely, that the filings prove Trump was the victim of a massive deep state conspiracy to spy on his campaign and White House. Incredibly, Trump suggested that people involved deserve to be executed for their alleged actions. In lie-filled press releases, Trump falsely said Durham revealed \"indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on.\" Former Pentagon official Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist, falsely claimed that Durham had proven that Clinton's campaign \"directly funded and ordered its lawyers at Perkins Coie to orchestrate ... a criminal enterprise to fabricate a connection between President Trump and Russia.\"  Covering the Durham filings, Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo said the Clinton campaign paid to spy on Trump, \"before and during his time as president,\" even though Durham has never accused anyone of surveilling Trump's calls. She was one of many Fox hosts and guests to exaggerate or distort Durham's new filings.   In Sussmann's view, the right-wing feeding frenzy was no accident. His lawyers said in a rebuttal that \"the Special Counsel seems to be succeeding in his effort to instigate unfair and prejudicial media coverage,\" citing articles from conservative outlets like the New York Post and Breitbart.  Was the Trump-Russia data accurate?  With regards to the alleged contacts between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, both companies denied that there was a backchannel or that they colluded on the 2016 election.  The FBI investigated the underlying data and ruled out any improper cyber links, according to the Justice Department inspector general. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report said in 2018 that it accepted the FBI's conclusions, but the report also pointed out that the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank gave contradictory explanations for the \"unusual activity.\"    Regarding the Russian phones, Durham said his team \"identified no support\" for the claim that Trump associates used the devices near the White House. But Sussmann and the researchers called this a red herring. They said they found odd data at Trump Tower -- and separately at the Obama-era White House, while looking for security threats after a Russian hack in 2015.  What comes next in this saga?Legal experts have questioned the strength of Durham's case against Sussmann. For instance, there is only one witness to the lie he allegedly told the FBI, and that witness has given differing accounts of the situation. Before his trial, Sussmann will try to convince a judge to throw out the case because there isn't enough evidence. His first arguments on this front are due on Friday.  The five-year statute of limitations appears to have passed for Durham to charge Sussmann with crimes related to his CIA meeting. Sussmann maintains that he had no reason to doubt the information that he passed along to the CIA. Beyond that, the Durham inquiry is ongoing, but it's unclear if he if has the goods to indict anyone else or allege a broader anti-Trump conspiracy.     Ironically, many of the key players have seen a role reversal in this saga.   There was rampant speculation in left-wing circles that special counsel Robert Mueller would bring down Trump's presidency, and send him and his family to prison. Now, Trump and his allies are breathlessly hyping up the Durham probe, and have welcomed each development as proof that bombshell indictments against top Democratic figures are right around the corner.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Trump campaign officials, led by Rudy Giuliani, oversaw efforts in December 2020 to put forward illegitimate electors from seven states that Trump lost, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the scheme. The sources said members of former President Donald Trump's campaign team were far more involved than previously known in the plan, a core tenet of the broader plot to overturn President Joe Biden's victory when Congress counted the electoral votes on January 6. Giuliani and his allies coordinated the nuts-and-bolts of the process on a state-by-state level, the sources told CNN. One source said there were multiple planning calls between Trump campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet on December 14, 2020, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.Trump and some of his top advisers publicly encouraged the \"alternate electors\" scheme in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico. But behind the scenes, Giuliani and Trump campaign officials actively choreographed the process, the sources said.One fake elector from Michigan boasted at a recent event hosted by a local Republican organization that the Trump campaign directed the entire operation.   Read More\"We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that,\" Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, said at a public event last week that was organized by the conservative group Stand Up Michigan, according to a recording obtained by CNN. \n\n\n\n            Listen to Meshawn Maddock describe the Trump campaign's involvement in the fake elector plot at a recent speech in Michigan \n        \n\n\n\t\t\t\"[Matt Maddock] fought for investigations into every part of the election we could. He fought for a team of people to come and testify in front of the committee. We fought to seat the electors. Um, the Trump campaign asked us to do that -- under a lot of scrutiny for that today. My husband has, he's suffered for that a little bit in Lansing because it's not very popular, but you know when you represent the whole state of Michigan and that's what I see it now. I realize that even though you're going to vote for somebody to be your next state representative, your next state senator, the truth is, this body of people, they represent all of us.\n\t\t\t\n\n\nMaddock was also one of the 16 Trump supporters from Michigan who served as fake electors and signed the illegitimate certificate that was sent to the National Archives.    \"It was Rudy and these misfit characters who started calling the shots,\" a former Trump campaign staffer said. \"The campaign was throwing enough sh*t at the wall to see what would stick.\"JUST WATCHEDWhat Toobin predicts the court ruling against Trump will meanReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat Toobin predicts the court ruling against Trump will mean 02:48Integral to the Jan 6 planThe scheme was integral to Trump's plan to get then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden's electors and replace them with the GOP electors on January 6 when Congress counted the electoral votes. It has also come under renewed scrutiny by the January 6 select committee and state attorneys general, raising questions about the involvement of Trump's campaign and whether any laws were broken.  Committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi told reporters Thursday the panel is looking into whether there was a broader conspiracy or involvement from the Trump White House in the creation or submission of these fake electors.\"That's a concern\" Thompson said.In its subpoena letter sent to Giuliani on Tuesday, the House committee specifically references his efforts to convince state legislatures to overturn election results. The document cites Giuliani's comments from December 2020 in which he publicly urged lawmakers in Michigan to award the state's electoral votes to Trump.  One of the pro-Trump electors from Pennsylvania, Sam DeMarco, told CNN there was a last-minute dispute, where the state's GOP electors pushed Trump campaign officials to add legal caveats to the fake certificate to say they were only electors-in-waiting, if Trump's legal challenges prevailed. The fake documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico ultimately contained these caveats, but the documents from the other five states explicitly claimed, falsely, that the pro-Trump electors were the rightful electors. It's not clear that any of the fake electors themselves participated in strategy sessions with top Trump campaign brass. But both Maddock from Michigan and DeMarco from Pennsylvania have said they were in direct contact with members of the Trump campaign. Many of the players involved in the scheme, including Maddock, stand by their actions and are still pushing the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Giuliani, a Trump spokesperson and a representative from Stand Up Michigan did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.  Advancing the lie that the election was stolen After Trump failed to stop battleground states from certifying Biden's victory, Trump campaign officials, led by Giuliani, launched its parallel effort to disrupt and undermine the Electoral College process. This included publicly promoting false claims of fraud, while quietly exploring the fast-diminishing avenues to overturn the results.Trump hoped Republican legislators from the seven battleground states would replace Biden's authentic electors with the rogue GOP slate, and that Pence would seat those electors during the joint session of Congress on January 6.  Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi preside over a Joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 Electoral College results after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol earlier in the day on January 6, 2021.A source familiar with the situation told CNN that Pence was concerned about the possibility of \"alternate electors,\" and his team carefully worded what he said that day during the Electoral College certification to recognize only the legitimate electors. One of the sources with direct knowledge of the scheme, a former Trump campaign staffer, told CNN that Giuliani worked closely on the seven-state stunt with Christina Bobb, a correspondent for the pro-Trump propaganda network One America News.  Many of Giuliani's unhinged conspiracies about the 2020 election found a home at OAN. And in a deposition last year as part of a civil lawsuit, Giuliani said Bobb was \"very active in gathering evidence\" as \"part of the legal team\" working for Trump's campaign during the presidential transition. Bobb reached out to a top Arizona legislator about supposed voter fraud, according to emails obtained by the government oversight group American Oversight through a public records request. In the December 4, 2020, email Bobb said she was sending the message on Giuliani's behalf. The emails flesh out how Trump's team was trying to press state legislatures to overturn the results. Bobb didn't respond to messages seeking comment about the pro-Trump electors.\"They were all working together. Rudy, John Eastman, and Christina Bobb, in tandem, to create this coverage for OAN, to advance the Big Lie,\" the former Trump campaign staffer told CNN.While mainstream news outlets covered the Electoral College proceedings, which cemented Biden's position as President-elect, OAN focused on the rogue electors and voter fraud myths.   The Washington Post first reported new details about the role of Giuliani and Bobb.Battleground Michigan Republicans in Michigan were central to the effort to try and overturn the election results and Meshawn Maddock -- along with her husband State Rep. Matt Maddock -- were instrumental to the effort inside the state. The Maddocks have deep ties to Trump. The former president has endorsed Matt Maddock in his bid to be Michigan House leader. Maddock tweeted a photo last year of an article written about his campaign that Trump had signed, and added, \"Matt, I am with you all the way.\"  In the months leading up to January 6, Matt Maddock consistently pushed Trump's lie about the election. In early December 2020, Matt Maddock and other state GOP lawmakers in Michigan held a series of hearings seeking to validate unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud -- prompting a personal visit from Giuliani. When the effort to convince state legislators in Michigan to block Biden's electors ultimately failed, Maddock was among the GOP lawmakers from five states who sent a letter to Pence on January 5, urging him to delay certification of the electoral votes. Pence refused to go along with the plan.   Meshawn Maddock is equally close to Trump and is still peddling the lie that the election was stolen.Along with being an elector, she also helped organize buses to take GOP activists to Washington for protests around January 6 and took part in the march to the US Capitol. She later disavowed the violence that came after the march.  Maddock was named co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party one month after January 6. But as she is gaining prominence, her role as a fake elector is also attracting legal scrutiny. Attorney General of Michigan Dana Nessel, center, is escorted to the entrance of the Michigan State Capitol on December 14, 2020 in Lansing, Michigan, on the day electors would meet to certify the electoral college vote.\"Under state law, I think clearly you have forgery of a public record, which is a 14-year offense, and election law forgery, which is a five-year offense,\" Michigan Attorney general Dana Nessel, a Democrat, told MSNBC last week, about the fake certificates signed by pro-Trump electors. No one, including Meshawn Maddock, has been charged with any crimes related to the scheme.  \"This is nothing more than political prosecution of convenience led by Dana Nessel,\" said Gustavo Portela, MIGOP Communications Director, when asked about Maddock's comments and role as a fake elector.  Hedged language in Pennsylvania  The documents from Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada explicitly stated, falsely, that the GOP electors were the rightful electors, representing 59 electoral votes.But the documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico contained clauses saying that the Trump supporters were electors-in-waiting, in case a court or some other proceeding later ruled that they were the \"duly elected and qualified electors.\"  If anything, this provided a veneer of legal protection for Trump supporters who were trying to exploit the Electoral College process to overturn an election. Demarco, who was one of the state's pro-Trump electors, and is the chairman of the Allegheny County Republican Committee, told CNN he and other alternate electors signed the certificate at the Trump campaign's request but first demanded the language be changed to make clear it was not intended to contest the will of voters in that state who voted for Biden.The hedging language was included at the last moment as the Trump campaign had concerns, and questioned whether the change was appropriate in the immediate lead-up to December 14, according to a Trump campaign staffer with knowledge of the matter. Ultimately the Trump campaign acquiesced. But the internal debate shows that even some of Trump's strongest allies were concerned about the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.  Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro speaks with people as he awaits a speech from U.S. President Joe Biden at Mack Truck Lehigh Valley Operations on July 28, 2021 in Macungie, Pennsylvania.The office of Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement that they looked into the matter but concluded that the fake certificate was not an illegal forgery.  \"These 'fake ballots' included a conditional clause that they were only to be used if a court overturned the results in Pennsylvania, which did not happen,\" the statement said. \"Though their rhetoric and policy were intentionally misleading and purposefully damaging to our democracy, based on our initial review, our office does not believe this meets the legal standards for forgery.\"  Concerns about democracy  Democratic lawmakers, state officials, and Biden himself have roundly condemned the fake electors plot. Biden brought it up at a news conference Wednesday when asked about his stalled voting-rights bills in Congress.  \"I never thought we would get into a place where we were talking about... what they tried to do this last time out -- Send different electors to the state legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win but the Republican candidate won,\" Biden said. \"I doubt that anyone thought that would happen in America in the 21st century, but it is happening.\" President Joe Biden answers questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House on January 19, 2022.The coordinated nature of these fake elector efforts and the rising power of Big Lie-promoters in Republican circles has concerned voting rights organizations across the country. Nancy Wang, executive director of the Michigan-based Voters Not Politicians, said her group was founded in 2016   to address redistricting and voting access, but Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election spurred her group to focus on countering anti-democratic efforts at large.   \"This is existential. This about the very fundamental institutions of our government - whether we can vote at all, whether we have any power whatsoever,\" Wang said. \"It is a completely different time that we are facing in 2020 and 2022. It really feels urgent. It is a battle of a completely different kind. It is massive, it is coordinated at a national level. It is much more threatening.\" CNN's Pamela Brown and Annie Grayer contributed reporting",

        "images": [],
        "content": "Washington (CNN)Of the 50-plus defendants who have been sentenced for their role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, fewer than half were sent to jail for their crimes. Most received an assortment of lesser penalties, including brief terms of house arrest, a couple years of probation, four-figure fines or court-ordered community service, according to a CNN analysis.The milestone of 50 sentencings was hit on Friday, a busy day in court, with six hearings on the schedule. Four defendants got probation Friday, including a pair of veterans from Wisconsin, while one man who stole a beer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office got 20 days in jail. As federal prosecutors have brought cases against nearly 700 rioters, a heated debate has emerged over what justice should look like for such an unprecedented assault on democracy. This debate has raged on social media and in the halls of Congress. It has also played out among the two dozen judges handling the cases at the federal courthouse in Washington, DC. After 50 sentencings, a split has developed on the bench: One group of judges has handed down stiffer punishments to rioters, including time behind bars. While a more skeptical group of judges have rebuffed the Justice Department and instead imposed fines and probation, which means the rioters will avoid jail but stay under government supervision for years to come.\n\n\n\nInteractive: Assault on Democracy: Paths to Insurrection\n\n\nThis dynamic won't last forever -- this initial wave of guilty pleas and sentencings will eventually be followed up by dozens of more serious felony cases with longer prison terms. But for now, the dizzying array of outcomes has caused some headaches. Judges are questioning the department's approach to January 6, and politicians from both sides have fanned the flames. Read More\"It doesn't look great that we're taking a bunch of people who stormed the United States Capitol and letting them go home. Not a lot of people are spending a lot of time in jail,\" said a Justice Department prosecutor with knowledge of the January 6 investigation who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. \"But jail isn't always the best outcome. A lot of them are getting significant terms of supervised release and probation, so they've got to keep their nose clean.\"These wings of the court don't fall along political lines. There are GOP-appointed skeptics, and some Democratic appointees handing down tough punishments. But the dynamic is nuanced. This has also forced partisan players on both sides to contort their ideological views to fit the moment. Democratic lawmakers and activists are calling for more incarceration and want judges to throw the book at rioters, while many Republican officials and right-wing influencers have become newfound supporters of improving jail conditions for what they call \"political prisoners.\" \"You have this wild schism that is occurring in the public eye, with half the country saying these people were all violent and deserve to die in prison, and the other half saying they were simply exercising their rights to protest and to free speech,\" said Al Watkins, a defense attorney who represented the so-called \"QAnon shaman\" and a few other defendants charged in the riot. Crafting a 'fair and just' punishmentThe nearly 700 cases are divided into two basic groups. The nonviolent rioters, who are only charged with misdemeanors. And then the felony cases, involving rioters who assaulted police, breached the Senate floor, destroyed property or conspired with far-right extremist groups. To help judges, prosecutors created a rubric of what should be considered at sentencing.This includes routine factors, like prior convictions or cooperation with investigators, as well as factors specific to January 6: Did the defendant enter the Capitol? How did they get in? How long were they inside? Did they incite or celebrate violence? Are they still justifying the attack?Federal prosecutors have allowed dozens of nonviolent rioters to plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense, which caps their potential jailtime at six months. Only 19 of the 50 misdemeanor cases ended with incarceration, according to CNN's latest tally. An additional four defendants were convicted of felonies, and they received sentences ranging from 8 months to 3.5 years in prison.  Judges have collectively ordered these rioters to pay at least $70,000 in fines and restitution to the US government. That's a sliver of the $1.4 million in estimated damages to the Capitol, but for many of the blue-collar defendants, a fine of a few thousand dollars is a hefty financial hit.  \"The results so far are not surprising to me,\" said Ken White, a former federal prosecutor and current defense attorney who closely follows the January 6 cases. \"A lot of these are very minor crimes, so you expect the sentences to be very minor. It's somewhat unusual for someone to actually get jail time for a misdemeanor in the federal system. It's usually going to be probation.\"'There have to be consequences'District Judge Tanya Chutkan has come to epitomize the court's more muscular wing. Four of her misdemeanor cases reached sentencing so far, and in all four cases, she went farther than the Justice Department's recommendation and sent rioters to jail, ranging from 14 to 45 days. An Obama appointee, Chutkan said at one sentencing that \"the country is watching\" to see what happens to the Capitol rioters. Prosecutors requested three months of house arrest for Matthew Mazzocco, but Chutkan gave him 45 days in jail, saying, \"there have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home.\" District Judge Tanya Chutkan \"It's remarkably unusual to have federal judges on the record calling out the DOJ for being too soft,\" CNN's senior legal analyst Elie Honig said. \"I've been part of the opposite scenario, where judges say DOJ is being too aggressive, overcharging a case, or asking for an unreasonably high sentence. But to see judges say DOJ is coming in too low, that's unusual and noteworthy.\"The longest prison sentences so far have been reserved for felony offenders. The judges in these cases have generally agreed to the lengthy prison terms requested by prosecutors. \"The offense that you committed is so in the heart of our democracy that I cannot justify a sentence below the guidelines,\" District Judge Royce Lamberth told Scott Fairlamb, who pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and obstructing the Electoral College proceedings.  Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, sentenced Fairlamb to 41 months in prison, or about 3.5 years. That's the same punishment he gave to Jacob Chansley, the \"QAnon shaman\" who went viral for wearing a horned bearskin outfit while rummaging around the Senate floor. (Judges are randomly assigned to cases, and Lamberth happened to get these two prominent defendants.) In a misdemeanor case, Lambeth gave Frank Scavo two months in jail and a $5,000 fine, the legal maximum. Prosecutors sought only two weeks behind bars for Scavo, who organized busses to take 200 Trump supporters from eastern Pennsylvania to DC for the January 6 rally. \"What we're seeing on the felony level is troubling, and the trend is just starting,\" said Watkins, the lawyer who represented Chansley for most of this year. \"And I think the misdemeanor cases are getting a little more scrutiny than you'd typically see. This event did not occur in a vacuum.\"Skeptics opt for probation and finesOther judges on the DC District Court have a gentler approach. About 60% of the misdemeanor cases that have reached sentencing ended without jail for the rioters, according to CNN's tally. Many of these no-jail sentences came from two Trump-appointed judges, Trevor McFadden and Carl Nichols, though they were mostly in cases where prosecutors asked only for house arrest.For nonviolent rioter Danielle Doyle, prosecutors requested two months of house arrest and three years of probation. McFadden settled on a $3,000 fine and just two months of probation. \"I don't think the government's recommendation is appropriate,\" he said, before telling Doyle that January 6 was a \"strange aberration\" for her, and that he hopes she'll \"use your political passion and love for our country to protect and promote our country,\" and not to break the law. District Judge Trevor McFadden in 2018.McFadden also slammed the Justice Department for not being \"even-handed\" with the January 6 defendants, compared to the rioters involved in last year's racial unrest. He has imposed fines for three Capitol rioters, ignoring requests from prosecutors for short jail stints or house arrest. His first jail sentence came Friday, but with some caveats. Prosecutors wanted 60 days for Andrew Ericson, who stole a beer from a refrigerator in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office. McFadden gave him 16 days, and said he can serve on weekends, so he won't lose his jobs. The most influential skeptic on the court is Chief Judge Beryl Howell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama and has forcefully condemned the Capitol rioters and what they stood for -- but has repeatedly rebuffed prosecutors when they asked for incarceration. At a sentencing, Howell said the Justice Department was \"almost schizophrenic\" for stressing the dire consequences of the insurrection while letting rioters plead to a petty offense. She has also balked when prosecutors tried to use rioters' military service to seek tougher punishments. Most of these no-jail sentences contain significant terms of probation, often three years or longer. This means members of the January 6 mob will be under government supervision through the 2024 election, and will face harsher punishments if they break the law again.The Justice Department official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity said probation would be an important tool to prevent political violence. Prosecutors can seek court-ordered limits on defendants associating with dangerous groups or accessing extremist content online. \"People are reacting to routine stuff as if it's horrific, and as if the judge must be crooked,\" White, the legal analyst, said about the probation-only sentences for January 6 defendants. \"Things that are routine in courtrooms have been spun to create outrage and clickbait.\"CNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this story",

        "content": "(CNN)A federal judge on Friday upheld the Justice Department's decision to use a felony obstruction law against US Capitol rioters, a major victory for prosecutors who have used the statute to charge hundreds of Donald Trump supporters who were involved in the January 6 insurrection. Several other defendants have challenged the law, and many of those challenges are still pending. But Friday's ruling means the Justice Department's strategy for charging the Capitol rioters has survived a key test. Federal Judge Dabney Friedrich denied a request by two rioters to throw out the charge -- \"obstruction of an official proceeding,\" which is often used for things like witness tampering, but has been used in January 6 cases because of the disruption of the Electoral College proceedings before Congress. Lawmakers' formal certification of President Joe Biden's victory was delayed for hours as rioters ransacked the building and fought with police officers. Friedrich, a Trump appointee, rejected the defendants' argument that the congressional certification of the Electoral College results was not an \"official proceeding.\" \"The Joint Session thus has the trappings of a formal hearing before an official body,\" Friedrich wrote. \"There is a presiding officer, a process by which objections can be heard, debated, and ruled upon, and a decision -- the certification of the results -- that must be reached before the session can be adjourned. ... Accordingly, the congressional certification at issue here is a 'proceeding before the Congress.'\"Read MoreShe also rejected arguments that the law was unconstitutionally vague and that it only pertains to judicial, not congressional, proceedings. \"Because the government has alleged that the defendants acted corruptly, or unlawfully, and with the intent to obstruct ... the defendants were on notice that their conduct violated the statute and 'no more is required' at this stage of the prosecution,\" Friedrich wrote. The ruling concerned only two specific defendants, and it doesn't prevent other district judges from ruling against the Justice Department in other cases. With several other challenges pending, whether the law can be used against January 6 defendants may ultimately be resolved by a higher appeals court.Prosecutors have used the felony obstruction charge as the cornerstone of many of the more serious Capitol riot cases. Many of the few hundred defendants facing the charge were outspoken about their desire to stop the certification of the Electoral College results, or even entered the Senate chamber. A ruling against the Justice Department on this matter would have sent massive ripple effects throughout the January 6 cases, and would have had a dramatic effect on prosecutors' efforts to push for felony convictions and longer prison sentences. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison -- the same potential punishment as a sedition charge, which is much more difficult to prove in court.A few defendants have already pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge, including members of far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers. Three other defendants who pleaded guilty to the charge have already faced sentencing, and they got between 8 months and 3.5 years in federal prison.CNN's Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.",

Haffner was additionally charged with assaulting federal officers for allegedly spraying police with an unidentified aerosol while they guarded the Capitol doors. They haven't yet entered a plea. Prosecutors say Loehrke texted with far-right Proud Boys leader Ethan Nordean prior to January 6. According to court filings, Nordean told Loehrke he wanted him \"on the frontline\" of the protest in Washington. Loehrke said he would be there and that he'd bring three \"bad motherf*ers.\" (Nordean pleaded not guilty in a separate but related Proud Boys conspiracy case.) The complaint against Loehrke and Haffner said they marched with Proud Boys to the Capitol and were among the first to overrun police on the building's west side. It alleges they later moved to the east side and dismantled barricades there, helping the mob flood the area. When Haffner encountered police guarding the Capitol doors, he allegedly sprayed them with an aerosol.Lawyers for the two men didn't answer CNN's request for comment on Saturday.Read MoreInvestigators said they were able to identify Haffner in part because of a photo his wife posted to social media with Sidney Powell, a controversial right-wing attorney who worked with former President Donald Trump to contest the 2020 election results and is known for spreading outlandish conspiracy theories. Haffner's wife said in a Facebook post, cited in the DOJ's court filing, that he met Powell at a rally in South Dakota.  Both men were released pending trial. A few dozen people with ties to the Proud Boys have been charged in connection with January 6, and some of the group's leaders are currently in jail. Loehrke is the first person from South Dakota to be charged with federal crimes related to the riot. The Justice Department has prosecuted rioters from 46 states and Washington, DC.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A federal judge slammed one of the January 6 rioters for waving a 1776 flag while storming the US Capitol, saying his attempt to overturn a democratic election betrayed the values of the American Revolution.Judge Amy Berman Jackson made the comments Thursday at a sentencing hearing for Andrew Wrigley, 51, from Philadelphia. He spent one minute inside the Capitol building during the attack, and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for unlawfully protesting on restricted grounds. Jackson sentenced Wrigley to 1.5 years of probation and a $2,000 fine. The 1776 flag that Wrigley brought into the Capitol was repeatedly brought up during his sentencing hearing Thursday in DC District Court. Trump 'stoked' crowd on January 6 and should be held accountable, federal judge says\"This isn't a good analogy,\" Jackson said. \"... In 1776, the people who went on to form a democracy didn't do that at the urging of a single head of state. ...\"\"The point of 1776 was to let the people to decide who would rule them,\" Jackson continued, contrasting it with January 6, where \"the point was to substitute the will of the people with the will of the mob... It was not under the banner of 1776.\"Read More\"You were a participant, albeit a minor one, in an effort to subvert and overturn the democratic process,\" Jackson said. \"That day didn't just cost you a lot, it cost our country a lot.\"Federal prosecutors had argued in court papers that the flag suggested he supported a \"rebellion against a ruling government\" and that the 1776 comparison is popular among far-right conspiracy theorists. They asked the judge to sentence Wrigley to two months of house arrest, which she declined to do. The 1776 flag represents a \"revolt against the sovereign,\" prosecutor Mona Furst said. Wrigley's attorney said her client never endorsed violence and pushed back on the Justice Department's attempts to turn the flag into an aggravating factor. \"I mean, our basketball team is called the 76ers,\" defense attorney Ann Flannery said. \"It's not a symbol of revolution in the way the government describes it. ... He did not bring that flag to suggest another revolution. He brought it to show pride and to exercise his rights as a citizen.\" More than 680 people have been charged in connection with the January 6 attack.

        "content": "(CNN)An obscure far-right paramilitary group is in the spotlight this week after getting subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The committee subpoenaed the 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group founded in 2020 that recruits military veterans and former police officers to provide security at right-wing events. Lawmakers also subpoenaed the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, extremist organizations with dozens of members who are facing criminal charges in connection with January 6. The panel said these subpoenas could shed light on how pro-Trump groups planned for violence that day.Here's what we know about the 1st Amendment Praetorian and its ties to January 6. What does their name mean?Read MoreThe group's name and logo invoke ancient Rome and the Praetorian Guard of elite bodyguards and intelligence operatives that protected the Roman emperor. They are one of many far-right groups that appropriate Greco-Roman imagery to promote political violence, according to an analysis from Pharos, a group at Vassar College that studies these historical overlaps.  The 1st Amendment Praetorian's website says the goal is to \"protect the Republic and anyone who is willing to stand up on her behalf to voice their opinion or bring attention to something they've found, like voter fraud.\" They do this by providing security at controversial events, including at three pro-Trump rallies in Washington, DC, during the presidential transition. Like many paramilitary groups, they recruit US military veterans, retired law enforcement and ex-members of the intelligence community. Their website says their members must attend monthly training sessions. The organization didn't respond to CNN's request for comment Wednesday on the subpoena. So far, no one affiliated with the 1st Amendment Praetorian has been charged by the Justice Department in connection with the attack on the US Capitol, according to CNN's analysis of court filings.Who is the group's leader?The group was founded by Robert Patrick Lewis, an Army veteran who served in the Special Forces, who describes himself as an \"author... entrepreneur, political junkie (and) investor.\"In a letter to Lewis about the subpoena, the committee quoted some of his previous statements about January 6. He said he was coordinating with former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and \"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander, who pushed voter fraud conspiracies before the attack.\"Today is the day the true battles begin,\" Lewis tweeted at 2:18 p.m. on January 6, after the first wave of rioters breached the Capitol, which was broadcast live on national television.  A few hours later, the group's Twitter account posted, \"The cost of Truth is Pain. The greater the Truth, the greater potential for pain.\" Rioters were still in the building at the time of this tweet.Lewis has appeared on prominent QAnon online shows, and posted his own 10-minute video promoting some of the QAnon conspiracy theories, according to an investigation by The Daily Beast. His group provided security at a major QAnon conference held in Dallas earlier this year. Lewis didn't respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.  How are they tied to January 6?The group provided security at pro-Trump rallies in November and December 2020 that were followed by violence and arrests on the streets of DC. They were also present at a rally on January 5 that featured incendiary speeches from far-right provocateurs like Alexander and Roger Stone, and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones. Lewis was a featured speaker at the January 5 event. He invoked the American Revolution in his brief address to the crowd, where he compared the \"Stop the Steal\" movement to George Washington's surprise attack on pro-British troops after crossing the Delaware River in 1776.\"I am willing to get up here and walk into danger if we need if, if we need to be there, to make sure we don't cede this country, and have my kids grow up in a Communist hellhole,\" Lewis said. \"And I need each of you to fight as hard as you can to ensure that does not happen.\"  The official permit for the event, approved by the National Park Service, said 25 \"marshals\" from Lewis' organization would be there to \"help maintain order among participants.\" The permit also said these paramilitary guards would be \"unarmed\" and would \"not act as police.\" What does the committee want?Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, sent the subpoena directly to Lewis on Tuesday. The bipartisan panel is run by Democrats, along with two Republicans. The subpoena demands that Lewis turn over documents by December 7. The public version of the letter doesn't say what specific materials are being requested. The letter references the fact that Lewis has previously said that his members wear body cameras while providing security. The subpoena also demanded that Lewis appear for a closed-door deposition on December 16. It is unclear how Lewis will respond or whether he will show up to answer the panel's questions. 1st Amendment Praetorian provided security at events \"that amplified the former President's unsupported claim that the election was stolen,\" Thompson said in a statement, adding that the group \"suggested that violence was imminent\" in a Twitter post two days before January 6.CNN has previously reported that the committee has asked other witnesses for information about the organization. Many of the organizers and speakers at the January 5 rally, where some 1st Amendment Praetorian members provided security, have already received subpoenas.",

        "content": "(CNN)The US government has spent the past week assessing a report of a leak at a Chinese nuclear power plant, after a French company that part owns and helps operate it warned of an \"imminent radiological threat,\" according to US officials and documents reviewed by CNN.The warning included an accusation that the Chinese safety authority was raising the acceptable limits for radiation detection outside the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong province in order to avoid having to shut it down, according to a letter from the French company to the US Department of Energy obtained by CNN.Despite the alarming notification from Framatome, the French company, the Biden administration believes the facility is not yet at a \"crisis level,\" one of the sources said. While US officials have deemed the situation does not currently pose a severe safety threat to workers at the plant or Chinese public, it is unusual that a foreign company would unilaterally reach out to the American government for help when its Chinese state-owned partner is yet to acknowledge a problem exists. The scenario could put the US in a complicated situation should the leak continue or become more severe without being fixed. However, concern was significant enough that the National Security Council held multiple meetings last week as they monitored the situation, including two at the deputy level and another gathering at the assistant secretary level on Friday, which was led by NSC Senior Director for China Laura Rosenberger and Senior Director for Arms Control Mallory Stewart, according to US officials.Read MoreThe Biden administration has discussed the situation with the French government and their own experts at the Department of Energy, sources said. The US has also been in contact with the Chinese government, US officials said, though the extent of that contact is unclear.The US government declined to explain the assessment but officials at the NSC, State Department and the Department of Energy insisted that if there were any risk to the Chinese public, the US would be required to make it known under current treaties related to nuclear accidents. Framatome had reached out to the US in order to obtain a waiver that would allow them to share American technical assistance in order to resolve the issue at the Chinese plant. There are only two reasons why this waiver would be granted, and one is an \"imminent radiological threat,\" the same verbiage used in the June 8 memo.The memo claims the Chinese limit was increased to exceed French standards, yet it remains unclear how that compares to US limits.\"It is not surprising that the French would reach out,\" according to Cheryl Rofer, a nuclear scientist who retired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2001. \"In general, this sort of thing is not extraordinary, particularly if they think the country they are contacting has some special ability to help.\"\"But China likes to project that everything is just fine, all the time,\" she added.The US could give permission for Framatome to provide the technical assistance or support to help resolve the issue, but it is the Chinese government's decision whether the incident requires shutting down the plant completely, the documents obtained by CNN indicate.Ultimately, the June 8 request for assistance from Framatome is the only reason why the US became involved in the situation at all, multiple sources told CNN.However, the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant published a statement on its website Sunday night local time, maintaining that environmental readings for both the plant and its surrounding area were \"normal.\" The two nuclear reactors in Taishan are both operational, the statement said, adding that Unit 2 had recently completed an \"overhaul\" and \"successfully connected to the grid on June 10, 2021.\" The statement did not define why or how the plant was overhauled.\"Since it was put into commercial operation, the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant has strictly controlled the operation of the units in accordance with operating license documents and technical procedures. All operating indicators of the two units have met the requirements of nuclear safety regulations and power plant technical specifications,\" the statement noted. In a separate statement Friday, hours after CNN first reached out for comment, Framatome acknowledged the company \"is supporting resolution of a performance issue with the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong Province, China.\" \"According to the data available, the plant is operating within the safety parameters. Our team is working with relevant experts to assess the situation and propose solutions to address any potential issue,\" the statement added.Framatome would not directly address the content of the letter to the Department of Energy when asked by CNN.The letter comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington remain high and as G7 leaders met this weekend in the United Kingdom with China an important topic of discussion. There are no indications the reports of a leak were discussed at a high level at the summit. French utility company Electrictie de France (EDF) said in a statement it has been informed of an increase concentration of  \"noble gases in the primary circuit\" of reactor number one of the Taishan nuclear power plant.EDF holds a 30% stake in the company with Chinese state energy company China General Nuclear Power Group in TNPJVC, which owns and operates the power plant in southern China.EDF says \"the presence of certain noble gases in the primary circuit is a known phenomenon, studied and provided for in the reactor operating procedures,\" but did not elaborate on gas levels.Later on Monday, a spokesperson for EDF said the increased levels of radiation were caused by a \"degradation of the housing of the fuel rods.\"The spokesperson affirmed that the levels of radioactivity observed at the plant were below the threshold stipulated by the Chinese authorities, adding that the affected housings are the first of three containment barriers between the rods and the atmosphere. The spokesperson noted that the risk of a potential leakage in the rod housing was first discussed following a planned refueling outage in October 2020 after initial measurements led to suspicions of a \"lack of tightness\" in the housings.However, the spokesperson stressed that without a full analysis, it is too early to confirm whether a complete shutdown of the reactor is needed, adding that EDF currently has no information regarding the origin of the rod housing degradation. CNN has reached out to the Chinese authorities in Beijing and Guangdong province, where the plant is located, and the Chinese embassy in Washington, DC. None have responded directly, though China is amidst a three-day national holiday that runs through the end of Monday.A warning from a French nuclear companyThe issue first emerged when Framatome, a French designer and supplier of nuclear equipment and services that was contracted to help construct and operate the Chinese-French plant, reached out to the US Department of Energy late last month informing them of a potential issue at the Chinese nuclear plant.The company, mainly owned by EDF, the French utility company, then submitted an operational safety assistance request on June 3, formally asking for a waiver that would allow them to address an urgent safety matter, to the Department of Energy, warning American officials that the nuclear reactor is leaking fission gas.The company followed up with DOE on June 8 asking for an expedited review of their request, according to a memo obtained by CNN. \"The situation is an imminent radiological threat to the site and to the public and Framatome urgently requests permission to transfer technical data and assistance as may be necessary to return the plant to normal operation,\" read the June 8 memo from the company's subject matter expert to the Energy Department.Framatome reached out to the US government for assistance, the document indicates, because a Chinese government agency was continuing to increase its limits on the amount of gas that could safely be released from the facility without shutting it down, according to the documents reviewed by CNN.When asked by CNN for comment, the Energy Department did not directly address the memo's claim that China was raising the limits.In the June 8 memo, Framatome informed DOE the Chinese safety authority has continued to raise regulatory \"off-site dose limits.\" It also says the company suspects that limit might be increased again as to keep the leaking reactor running despite safety concerns for the surrounding population.  \"To ensure off-site dose limits are maintained within acceptable bounds to not cause undue harm to the surrounding population, TNPJVC (operator of Taishan-1) is required to comply with an regulatory limit and otherwise shut the reactor down if such a limit is exceeded,\" the June 8 memo reads. It notes that this limit was established at a level consistent with what is dictated by the French safety authority, but \"due to the increasing number of failures,\" China's safety authority, the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) has since revised the limit to more than double the initial release, \"which in turn increases off-site risk to the public and on-site workers.\"As of May 30, the Taishan reactor had reached 90% of the allegedly revised limit, the memo adds, noting concerns the plant operator may be \"petitioning the NNSA to further increase the shutdown limit on an exigent basis in an effort to keep running which in turn would continue to increase the risk to the off-site population and the workers at the plant site.\" The NNSA is China's nuclear safety regulatory authority. It oversees the implementation of safety standards at facilities like Taishan.The US State Department came into possession of the June 8 letter and immediately began engaging with interagency partners and with the French government, State Department officials said.   Over the course of 48-72 hours, the US government has been in repeated contact with French officials and US technical experts at DOE, State Department officials said, noting that this flurry of activity was due to the June 8 letter. Subsequently, there were several urgent questions for the French government and Framatome, they added. CNN has reached out to the French embassy in Washington for comment.Still, Rofer, the retired nuclear scientist, warns that a gas leak could indicate bigger problems. \"If they do have a gas leak, that indicates some of their containment is broken,\" Rofer said. \"It also argues that maybe some of the fuel elements could be broken, which would be a more serious problem.\" \"That would be a reason for shutting down the reactor and would then require the reactor to be refueled,\" Rofer told CNN, adding that removing the fuel elements must be done carefully. For now, US officials do not think the leak is at \"crisis level,\" but acknowledge it is increasing and bears monitoring, the source familiar with the situation told CNN. While there is a chance the situation could become a disaster, US officials currently believe it is more likely that it will not become one, the source added.  China has expanded its use of nuclear energy in recent years, and it represents about 5% of all power generated in the country. According to China Nuclear Energy Association, there were 16 operational nuclear plants with 49 nuclear reactors in China as of March 2021, with the total generation capacity of 51,000 megawatts. The Taishan plant is a prestige project built after China signed a nuclear electricity generation agreement with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France, which is mainly owned by the French government. The construction of the plant started in 2009, and the two units started generating electricity in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The city of Taishan has a population of 950,000 and is situated in the southeast of the country in Guangdong province, which is home to 126 million residents and has a GDP of $1.6 trillion, comparable to that of Russia and South Korea. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA). It is China's nuclear safety regulatory authority.CNN's Kylie Atwood, Kristen Holmes, Yong Xiong and Shanshan Wang contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A review of US Capitol security in the wake of the January 6 insurrection is set to recommend a series of sweeping changes next week intended to better protect lawmakers while they are in Washington, DC, and at home, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the findings. Both sources told CNN that a draft of the proposal recommends adding more than 1,000 US Capitol police officers, establishing a dedicated quick reaction force and building an integrated system of walls and fences around the Capitol complex. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed retired Lt. General Russel Honor\u00e9 to conduct an independent review of the security presence around the Capitol last month after a pro-Trump mob breached the building. Capitol Police chief warns militia groups want to 'blow up the Capitol' when Biden addresses CongressThe draft recommendations include dozens of improvements to physical security infrastructure around the complex, better communication resources for officers and additional personnel to bolster a force that was overrun by rioters last month. The addition of more than 1,000 Capitol Police officers -- at a cost approaching $100 million -- would include some 350 officers and expanded staffing in regional offices. The review found that the force must be expanded in part to meet members' security needs when they are back home, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the findings.Read MoreThe second source also noted that expanding the force will provide some relief for current officers, many of whom are exhausted and have been working significant amounts of overtime since January 6. Additionally, the recommendations call for establishing a robust and dedicated quick reaction force composed of a National Guard military police battalion to be on standby in Washington full time, according to both sources. The quick reaction force will be staged near the Capitol and able to respond in future crisis situations, one of the sources noted.In addition to dramatically increasing the number of USCP officers dedicated to protecting the Capitol and lawmakers, the recommendations include several short- to long-term improvements to perimeter security, which include purchasing \"rapidly deployable and removable fencing,\" which is estimated to cost tens of millions of dollars. Long-term, the draft recommendations suggest building an integrated system of walls and fences around the Capitol -- the cost of which is to be determined. One of the sources with knowledge of the recommendations insisted that the primary option is to use mobile fencing and the long-term suggestion should not be interpreted as building a permanent wall around the Capitol.   USCP and Pelosi's office declined to comment on the draft recommendations. The recommendation to build integrated fencing and walls around the Capitol could prompt questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have made clear the complex should not resemble a \"fortress.\" More than $30 million needed for riot aftermath and increased Capitol security, official says in House testimonyOn Thursday, acting USCP chief Yogananda Pittman declined to elaborate on a timetable for removing the fencing and sending National Guard troops that remain in Washington back to their home states despite bipartisan calls to reduce the security posture around the Capitol.\"We have no intention of keeping the National Guard soldiers or that fencing any longer than what is actually needed. We're actively working with a scaled down approach so that we can make sure that we address three primary variables,\" Pittman said during a hearing on security failures related to the January 6 Capitol attack.\"One is the known threat to the environment, two is the infrastructure vulnerabilities and then that third variable being the limitations the US Capitol's police knows that it has as it relates to human capital and technology resources,\" she added.Later in the hearing, Pittman said the fencing around the Capitol is not permanent -- an idea she had previously proposed.US Capitol Police tells lawmakers that razor wire fencing should remain until September\"The temporary infrastructure is only to address the vulnerabilities after the attack of January 6. Our priority is to make sure that the members of Congress are safe, and that democratic process is protected. Once we have appropriate infrastructure and human assets in place we will lean forward with the removal of the fencing,\" she said.CNN has previously reported that USCP told lawmakers that the razor wire fencing around the Capitol should remain in place until at least September due to lingering security concerns related to threats against members of Congress.Pelosi has not definitively said whether she supports permanent fencing around the Capitol. Future security decisions would be informed by the findings of Honor\u00e9's review, a Pelosi aide told CNN earlier this month.",

        "content": "(CNN)Police in Washington, DC, are investigating an allegation that conspiracy theorist Alex Jones threatened to push a pro-Trump political organizer off of an event stage in December, according to people familiar with the incident.  The allegation was filed with DC police by Kylie Jane Kremer, executive director of the organization Women for America First, a group that helped organize a series of post-election rallies, including one in a park south of the White House that preceded the Capitol riot on January 6.Kremer told police that on December 11 someone \"threatened to shove her off the stage at her event\" scheduled for the following day, according to a police incident report. That report does not name Jones, but four sources familiar with the incident, three of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Jones -- who spreads conspiracy-theory-laden content through the website InfoWars -- made the alleged threat.The fourth source, Scott Johnston, who was driving Kremer that day, told CNN that he witnessed Jones' alleged threat to Kremer and has spoken to police during their investigation.The allegation highlights the way that some influencers within the \"Stop the Steal\" movement at times clashed even as they shared a goal of rallying support to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Read MoreThe case of alleged \"threats to do bodily harm\" remains under active investigation, a spokesperson for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department told CNN. The spokesperson declined to confirm whether Jones was a subject of the investigation or provide further details about the investigation.InfoWars' Alex Jones helped jumpstart January 6 rally organization efforts Asked about the alleged threat, a spokesperson for Women for America First, Chris Barron, said, \"The police report speaks for itself.\"An attorney for Jones, Marc Randazza, told CNN that his client denies threatening Kremer. Randazza did not respond to a question asking whether Jones had spoken to law enforcement about the incident. The alleged threat occurred outside the Willard Intercontinental hotel, located about two blocks from the White House, according to the police report. Johnston, who said he had been assisting organizers with Women for America First, told CNN he witnessed Jones confront Kremer on December 11 and that he remembers Jones saying he would push her off a stage. Johnston said he drove Kremer to the hotel and as they were unloading luggage outside the hotel, Jones approached. \"He kept yelling, 'I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'm going to take over,' you know, words along those lines,\" he said.Alleged Oath Keeper charged in Capitol riot chauffeured Roger Stone, FBI agent saysJohnston said he perceived Jones' statements as a threat because he had witnessed Jones rush a stage at a prior event.  Johnston added he spoke to law enforcement about the December 11 incident after it occurred and that a detective called him again in January and asked for more information regarding Jones.On December 12, Kremer and others spoke from a stage that featured the Women for America First logo in Washington's Freedom Plaza and riled up a crowd of Trump supporters with false claims of mass election fraud. Jones spoke on a separate stage on the National Mall at a \"Jericho March\" event, where he declared, \"This is the beginning of the great revival before the anti-Christ comes.\" Later that afternoon, a crowd gathered near the Supreme Court, where Women for America First had a podium set up.Oath Keepers founder directed Capitol rioters on January 6, Justice Department saysJones said he had a confrontation with individuals running security near that podium on December 12, according to video posted by Jones' program, which shows a man wearing a security lanyard putting his hand on Jones' arm and saying, \"You're not allowed to be here.\" Jones responded with a number of expletives before saying he and those with him would leave. He then shouted, \"1776!\"Jones explained the incident on his show by saying, \"I was going to the Supreme Court building yesterday because I heard there was going to be a rally that I was invited to. Didn't really even know who was really doing it.\" \"It's not like I was trying to go to some event with a thousand people and take it over,\" he said. Jones emerged as a prominent figure in the broader \"Stop the Steal\" movement after November's election. He traveled to cities including Phoenix and Atlanta, and repeatedly used inflammatory rhetoric to bolster the movement's false claims. He also helped kick off some of the organizational efforts that eventually materialized into the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 6, according to a grassroots organizer who filed the permits. That organizer, Cindy Chafian, previously told CNN that Jones had reached out to her \"to make sure he was able to speak at an event that he had contributed to.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nChafian said she originally submitted event permits while working for Women for America First but later embarked on her own in organizing a January 6 event and eventually teamed up with Jones.Jones delivered another speech in Washington on January 5 in which he told the pro-Trump crowd, \"The system has had to desperately engage in this gambit to maintain control. But this will be their Waterloo. This will be their destruction.\"Kremer's allegation is not the first time Jones has faced scrutiny for threatening language.In July, the Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed a sanction against Jones related to statements he had made about an attorney for Sandy Hook families, who filed suit against Jones for advancing conspiracy theories about the 2012 mass shooting. The court said that, speaking of opposing counsel on a radio broadcast, Jones had said, \"One million dollars to put your head on a pike.\"\"We recognize that there is a place for strong advocacy in litigation, but language evoking threats of physical harm is not tolerable,\" the court's chief justice wrote.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)House investigators have received the first batch of documents they requested from the FBI and intelligence agencies as part of their ongoing probe into security failures around the January 6 US Capitol attack, according to an official from one of the committees investigating the matter.The FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center provided materials in response to a detailed request from January 16 made by four House committees that are conducting a joint investigation of the events surrounding the attack. The review is focused on three main questions: what did federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies know before, during and after the attack? How did foreign adversaries seek to exploit the event? And what's been done to address domestic terror threats in the weeks since?The official who spoke to CNN did not elaborate on the specifics of the documents provided to the committee. The joint probe conducted by the House Intelligence, Oversight, Homeland Security and Judiciary committees is also investigating the role private companies, including social media platforms like Parler, played in potentially helping fuel the attack and protect the identity of rioters involved. Leading House Democrat sues Donald Trump under a post-Civil War law for conspiracy to incite US Capitol riotIn a letter sent to company COO Jeffrey Wernick last week, House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney noted that multiple Parler users have been arrested and charged for their roles in the riot, \"with the Department of Justice citing in several instances the threats that individuals made through Parler in the days leading up to and following the attack.\"Read MoreThe first batch of documents sent by the FBI and NCTC indicates federal agencies are cooperating with lawmakers, who are aggressively seeking more evidence than what was collected for the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. A congressional source told CNN the massive scope and severity of riot merits a deep investigation to uncover every detail, and hold officials accountable to the public.Congressional committees have already announced plans to call witnesses for open hearings starting next week, something that was discussed, but never materialized during the impeachment trial. Those plans are expected to continue even as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week called for an independent commission to investigate the incident, a proposal that has received mixed reviews from some GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill.Lawmakers themselves could face scrutiny for their role in the attack. Many Republicans joined Trump in pushing false election claims in the weeks leading up to the attack, while some have raised questions about Pelosi's role in the security failures of January 6 and say that should also be part of any investigation into the attack on the Capitol. Senate and House hearings next weekThe Senate Intelligence Committee is also looking at the intelligence failures related to January 6, including the nexus between domestic disinformation and possible foreign intervention, according to a source familiar with the probe. That panel has started making requests for information, the source said. Additionally, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Senate Rules committees are conducting a joint investigation with plans to hold their first public hearing next week on the security failures that left five people dead, more than 140 officers injured, and raised questions about whether the trauma of the day contributed to two officer suicides. Senators demand intelligence agencies produce months-late report on domestic terrorismThe committees have invited Metropolitan Police acting Chief Robert Contee, former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger, and former United States Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund to testify. Sources tell CNN both Contee and Sund plan to testify. Sund's testimony could mark a break from a weeks-long silence about the dismal failure of his department and subsequent resignation from his post.  It's unclear whether Irving or Stenger will appear on Capitol Hill Tuesday, but if they do, their testimonies could be monumental. According to a letter from Sund to congressional leadership, Sund asked his supervisors, Irving and Stenger, to send the National Guard to the Capitol in the days before the riot. Sund accused Irving of denying the request over concerns congressional leaders wouldn't like the \"optics\" of armed military members patrolling the Capitol. In the letter, Sund said Stenger told him to ensure the Guard was in a \"forward leaning\" position prior to the assault. As Sergeants At Arms, Irving and Stenger bridged the gap between politics and policing. As members of the Capitol Police Board -- the most immediate oversight committee for USCP -- they were the final decision makers as USCP prepared its posture for January 6.US Capitol Police officers issue vote of no confidence for acting chief, other top leadersThe hearing won't serve entirely as a fact-finding mission. Lawmakers will undoubtedly grill Sund, Irving and Stenger about their failures leading up to the riot. Contee will likely feel less heat from lawmakers, as MPD swooped in to assist after staging law enforcement outside the Capitol Complex. The House Appropriations committee, which has direct oversight of the US Capitol Police, also plans to hold a hearing next Thursday with acting USCP Chief Yogananda Pittman and acting House Sergeant at Arms Timothy Blodgett. This will mark the first time either has appeared in an open hearing. Pittman apologized to lawmakers for security failures in a closed door hearing last month.The House committees conducting the joint review have not yet scheduled hearings but do have subpoena power to compel testimony if and when the investigation reaches that stage. Congressional sources say lawmakers realize the various committee investigations may overlap one another, which has prompted several committees to combine their efforts. The panels are also working to establish clear lanes for each investigation.For now, one of the broadest joint committee reviews is led by House Intelligence, Oversight, Homeland Security and Judiciary. It is focused on several core issues, including, \"what the Intelligence Community and federal law enforcement knew about the threats of violence, whether that information was shared or not, and whether the threats had any nexus to foreign influence or misinformation efforts,\" according to the same January 16 letter.  Lawmakers also want to know if any current of former holders of security clearances were involved in the riots, what warning signs may have been missed and if any measures were taken to apprehend or prevent travel by any domestic extremists involved in the attack, the letter states. Separately, the House Appropriations Committee, which was the first Congressional committee to have a hearing on the violent insurrection, is conducting its own review focused primarily on internal Capitol security, including assessments and communications between the various law enforcement agencies throughout January 6 attack. Additionally, retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore is conducting an independent review of the security posture on Capitol Hill at the direction of Pelosi and is expected to provide recommendations based on his findings next month.Walking a political tight-ropeCongressional sources have indicated that even they are unsure how the outside commission would interact with the numerous committee probes. While leading House Republicans haven't expressed outright opposition as they await more details, they warn the commission shouldn't relitigate the impeachment. And in the Senate, there are questions from Republicans about whether Congress is better positioned to investigate the January 6 riot than a new, outside entity.Pelosi's plan for commission to probe Capitol riot faces GOP resistance\"There is no need for Congress to abdicate its responsibility to conduct its own investigations and oversight since there are congressional committees with clear jurisdiction as well as subject matter and investigative expertise,\" one Senate GOP aide said. \"Commissions can be slower and costlier than congressional investigations and can also suffer from questions regarding access to records that are more easily surmounted by a congressional committee with subpoena power.\"Democrats say that the commission must examine all facets of the riot, which include the role that Trump played stirring up false claims of election fraud that alleged rioters charged by federal prosecutors have cited in explaining why they attacked the Capitol on January 6.\"I fully support Speaker Pelosi's 9/11-style commission. One thing they will find is that Donald Trump incited the insurrection,\" California Rep. Ted Lieu, one of the House impeachment managers, told CNN on Monday. \"Leading from that are a whole host of questions we don't know yet, such as how do we have such a massive breakdown in security?\"Pelosi announces plans for '9/11-type commission' to investigate Capitol attackOn Thursday, Pelosi reiterated her support for forming a commission, telling reporters it must have subpoena power and be \"strongly bipartisan.\" At the same time, Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill told CNN that the House committees are expected to continue their work if a commission is formed, noting the 9/11 Commission had inside and outside pieces.The House Appropriations Committee also plans to continue its work as the commission gets underway. \"Once a 9/11-type commission is established, the Appropriations Committee will share the information gathered through the Committee's ongoing investigation with the commission\" House Appropriations committee communications director Evan Hollander told CNN. Former New Jersey GOP Gov. Thomas Kean, who served as chair of the 9/11 Commission, said the overlap of Congressional investigations with the commission should not be a problem.\"There's no reason both groups can't work together,\" but reminded that \"an independent commission has advantages that Congress doesn't have\" such as more resources, staff and credibility because the commission is not partisan.CNN's Annie Grayer and Jeremy Herb contributed reporting",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Biden administration is just weeks away from having to make a decision whether to end the nearly 20-year military deployment in Afghanistan that has claimed nearly 2,400 American lives, as experts and US officials told CNN there are no good options available and the best hope is to avert \"catastrophe.\"With the May deadline for a withdrawal looming and NATO allies eager to learn what the US will do, the National Security Council (NSC) convened a meeting of senior officials Friday to discuss the way forward on Afghanistan, according to two administration officials familiar with the meeting.The administration has coalesced around two broad goals, an official familiar with the discussions told CNN. First, it aims to achieve a \"responsible conclusion\" to the conflict, which would see the end of ongoing violence and a stable Afghan government. Second, the administration wants to safeguard national interests and prevent the country from becoming an ISIS-style caliphate or the base from which a large attack is launched against the US.\"The violence is too high in Afghanistan. That's the bottom line,\" said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby Friday.Pentagon won't commit to Afghanistan troop withdrawal by May, says Taliban are not honoring commitments to USAn agreement between the Taliban and the US, signed by the Trump administration, committed the US to withdraw the final 2,500 troops by May, down from 13,000 one year ago. The Biden administration is looking for room to maneuver within the language of the agreement, but as the Taliban continues to carry out violent attacks and targeted killings, the US is left with few -- if any -- good options. One US official familiar with the internal discussions went so far as to call Biden's choices a \"s* sandwich.\"Read More\"They agreed not to shoot at us on our way out,\" said Marvin Weinbaum, director of Afghanistan and Pakistan studies at the Middle East Institute. \"That's the only part of the agreement that they've kept.\" Despite the violations of the agreement, the Trump administration plowed forward with troop withdrawals, pulling thousands of troops from Afghanistan days after it became clear he lost the election and thousands more days before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. All the while, the Taliban remains focused on their singular goal of US troop withdrawal. \"It was an agreement which was faulty because it committed the US to provably irrevocable actions, and the Taliban only committed themselves to promises,\" Weinbaum said.With the deadline drawing closer, the White House's options appear to be bad, worse, and worst. The only question is in which order they should be placed. Austin focuses inward in first days as Pentagon chiefA full withdrawal as envisioned in the agreement would allow the Taliban to claim victory and could lead to a resurgence of terrorist groups. Halting the withdrawal unilaterally could invite violence from the Taliban, now likely targeted directly at US troops instead of at Afghan allies. And trying to renegotiate the agreement with the group could also invite violence, since the group has made clear they see no wiggle room in the agreement.US intelligence agencies now believe that the Taliban is unwilling to consider any exceptions as far as the agreed upon timeline for US and coalition forces to leave Afghanistan, the US official told CNN. A rapid and unilateral withdrawal could also put at risk the gains made by women and civil society, particularly amid tenuous intra-Afghan negotiations. At his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed their importance, saying, \"I don't believe that any outcome that they might achieve -- the government of Afghanistan or the Taliban -- is sustainable without protecting the gains that had been made by women and girls in Afghanistan over the last 20 years when it comes to access to education, to healthcare, to employment.\"Zalmay Khalilzad, the Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, has remained in his role from the Trump administration as a key architect of the US-Taliban agreement. Khalilzad briefed Blinken last week, urging a \"conditions-based strategy, one that brings peace to Afghanistan, secures a stable future for its citizens, and prevents anyone from using Afghanistan to threaten the United States and our allies,\" he said on Twitter.Every available option could be framed as a failureThe NSC has convened a bevy of inter-agency meetings on Afghanistan over the last week, but due to the time constraints presented by the upcoming NATO meeting and looming withdrawal deadline, there has not been enough time for the \"churn\" -- a process that typically allows relevant agencies to get on the same page, the US official said. While there are still a wide variety of ideas being presented to the White House, national security officials have come to a near consensus that every option currently on the table could be framed by serious people as a political failure.Instead, the White House has received dozens of well-articulated and informed opinions that all have merit but do not offer a clear path forward that accomplishes all the administration's policy objectives, the official added. \"Most all of the policy options available are not optimal, shall we say,\" said Bradley Bowman, senior director for the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.Biden administration says it intends to close Guantanamo prisonThe Trump administration handed the Biden team a \"mess,\" Bowman said, with a withdrawal based on a strict timeline which ignored the advice of commanders and conditions on the ground. Moreover, the US-Taliban agreement sidelined the Afghan government, leaving out a critical partner for any successful end to the conflict.The previous administration made its priority clear: it wanted to remove all US troops from Afghanistan to fulfill former President Donald Trump's campaign promise. Trump's team did not seem perturbed by the consequences of a rapid withdrawal based on an unrealized peace. Less clear now is how the Biden team will proceed.\"Everyone understands the first of May is coming up,\" said a senior defense official. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has been part of interagency discussions examining the peace agreement between the US and the Taliban signed one year ago. The discussions have focused on the agreement, signed in Doha, and the extent to which the US has room to maneuver within the language of the agreement and whether the Taliban has complied with its requirements to renounce ties to al-Qaeda and stop carrying out violent attacks.Netanyahu's wait for a call from Biden raises questions about US priorities\"It's a catastrophe prevention strategy. It's not a 'Make Afghanistan Sweden' strategy. It's a lower bar, but it's a vital bar,\" Bowman said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki has stressed the importance of Afghanistan to the Biden administration, but said there would be no immediate update on troop levels. In the past, Biden has supported a smaller US presence in Afghanistan and opposed former President Barack Obama's surge of troops to the country in 2009.Austin, who has so far been \"information gathering,\" the defense official said, will speak virtually next week with NATO as part of the defense ministerial meeting, where America's allies will press the Secretary on US strategy. NATO now has 8,000 troops from 38 different countries operating in Afghanistan. Allies are concernedNATO allies, particularly Germany, are growing increasingly concerned about what the Biden administration is going to do, a European diplomatic source told CNN. These countries recognize that the peace process with the Taliban appears to be stunted and worry that a withdrawal of US troops would quickly lead to a withdrawal of NATO forces and an abandonment of Afghanistan.The Afghanistan Study Group, which began its work soon after the signing of the Doha agreement, warned that such a withdrawal could plunge Afghanistan back into civil war, while \"inviting the reconstitution of anti-U.S. terrorist groups that could threaten our homeland and providing them with a narrative of victory against the world's most powerful country.\" One such terrorist group would be al-Qaeda, which supported the agreement because it includes a timeline for US withdrawal, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency, one of their main goals.The study group, co-chaired by Gen. Joseph Dunford, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there was a \"real opportunity\" for a durable peace agreement to end decades of war in Afghanistan, but warned that a complete withdrawal of troops based on an inflexible timeline would \"simply hand a victory to the Taliban.\" The group called for a major diplomatic effort to extend the May withdrawal deadline \"in order to give the peace process sufficient time to produce an acceptable result,\" as well as regional efforts so that Afghanistan's neighbors help support and sustain a lasting peace.CNN's Jennifer Hansler, Barbara Starr and Ellie Kaufman contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Pentagon said Thursday that the Biden administration would not commit to a full drawdown of troops from Afghanistan by May because the Taliban have not honored the commitments they made in their deal with the United States.That agreement, negotiated under the Trump administration and signed in February 2020, calls for the militant group to reduce violence and cut ties with terrorist organizations, among other demands. If the conditions of the deal were met, US forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021. The US force level in Afghanistan went down to 2,500 troops just days before former President Donald Trump left office.\"The Taliban have not met their commitments,\" Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said at a news briefing. \"Without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces, and by dint of that the Afghan people, it's very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.\"Kirby told reporters the US remains committed to working toward that negotiated settlement between the Taliban and the Afghan governments. Pakistan's top court rules to free men previously convicted of kidnapping and murdering Daniel PearlHis comments echoed Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who had told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani earlier Thursday that there was \"robust diplomatic support for the peace process focused on helping the parties to the conflict achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire that benefits all Afghans.\"Read MoreThe intra-Afghan negotiations opened in September but have progressed slowly. The two sides agreed to the rules and procedures for the talks in December and reconvened after a break in early January. US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, the main negotiator on the US deal with the Taliban, has said the goals of the intra-Afghan talks are \"a political road map and a comprehensive ceasefire.\" The Biden administration has kept Khalilzad in his role.However, Kirby's assessment of the Taliban's noncompliance went further than Blinken, who told Ghani that the US was reviewing its deal with the Taliban \"and whether the Taliban are living up to their commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders,\" according to a State Department readout.Blinken told reporters Wednesday that he was working to understand \"exactly what is in the agreements that were reached between the United States and the Taliban to make sure that we fully understand the commitments that the Taliban has made as well as any commitments that we've made.\" In his confirmation hearing last week, Blinken called Afghanistan \"a real challenge.\"\"We want to end this so-called forever war. We want to bring our forces home. We want to retain some capacity to deal with any resurgence of terrorism, which is what brought us there in the first place,\" he said.He also voiced a need to protect the gains made by women and civil society, telling the lawmakers, \"I don't believe that any outcome that they might achieve -- the government of Afghanistan or the Taliban -- is sustainable without protecting the gains that had been made by women and girls in Afghanistan over the last 20 years when it comes to access to education, to health care, to employment.\"In his call with Ghani, Blinken \"reiterated his desire for all Afghan leaders to support this historic opportunity for peace while preserving the progress made over the last 20 years with regard to human rights, civil liberties, and the role of women in Afghan society,\" according to the readout.There are strong concerns that those gains, particularly for women, could be lost if the Taliban regain power. In an opinion piece in The Washington Post this week, Ambassador Roya Rahmani -- Afghanistan's first female ambassador to the US -- warned that just as peace talks do not necessarily mean peace, neither does a deal.\"Biden administration pauses arms sales to Saudi Arabia and UAE\"We cannot allow fatigue to lure us into a deal that hurts more than it heals. The consequences of a false peace are as dire as no deal at all,\" she wrote.\"In Afghanistan, gains on human rights and women's empowerment will be lost, democracy could crumble, and Afghanistan could again become a safe haven for terrorist groups in the region,\" Rahmani continued. \"Furthermore, Afghanistan's implosion would destabilize the region and have devastating consequences on global security.\"\"The United States must make the bold decision to hold the Taliban accountable for its egregious violations of the agreement and fully commit to the U.S.-Afghan partnership,\" she said.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Nearly a\u202fmonth after the deadly attack on January 6, the US Capitol Police force\u202fremains\u202fin turmoil, with union officials preparing an unprecedented \"no confidence\" vote in the department's leadership, and\u202frank-and-file\u202fofficers still reeling from the physical and psychological effects of the attack.\u202f  The fallout from the insurrection has been compounded by the death of an officer during the fight, another officer's\u202fsubsequent\u202fsuicide and a Covid outbreak that has infected dozens of people within the Capitol Police. More than 100 officers are still nursing significant physical wounds and countless others are dealing with the psychological trauma of the day -- all while working long hours to keep the Capitol secure.  In a sign of how contentious things have become, this week an effort by union officials to schedule a \"vote of no confidence\" against the department's top three leaders triggered a round of recriminations from officers who criticized the timing of the move, claiming it was inappropriate and overshadowed the memorial services this week for their slain colleague, Brian Sicknick, whose remains lay in honor at the Capitol this week.   The union pushed off the vote until at least next week. The no-confidence vote is aimed at the department's acting chief, Yogananda Pittman, as well as two of her top deputies, according to a copy of a memo and flyer obtained by CNN. Pittman, who spent 14 months as an assistant chief, took over the department after former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund announced his resignation the day after the riot. \"The officers are angry, and I don't blame them,\" said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the union\u202frepresenting\u202fCapitol Police officers. \"The entire executive team failed us, and they must be held accountable. Their inaction cost one officer his life and we have\u202falmost 140\u202fresponding officers injured. They have a lot to\u202fatone\u202ffor.\"\u202f  Read MoreCNN spoke to six officers and officials familiar with department operations and reviewed department and union communications for this report. Sources asked not to be named because department rules forbid members from speaking to the media and officers feared losing their jobs.  The US Capitol Police department is part of Congress and not required to make records available like most of the 18,000 other police agencies across the country. CNN asked the agency to make Pittman available for an interview, but the agency did not respond to that request.   While Pittman apologized to lawmakers during closed-door testimony before Congress last week, saying the department should carry some of the blame for failing to act on clear warnings leading up to the attack, members of the department tell CNN they haven't heard any such apology in person. A mass email from Pittman expressing appreciation for \"each and every\" officer did little to improve morale, which wasn't great before January 6 and has plummeted over the last month as demands on the department grow.   \"We are just a number on a schedule to them, not human beings,\" one officer told CNN. \"Just walk around and look at the officers' faces to see the bags under their eyes.\"  There's also growing concern among officers about the lack of clarity around the use of force and how to respond to future protests. One officer told CNN they were given conflicting instructions during the attack and subsequent communication from the organization hasn't clarified things.  \"After the events that occurred on the 6th, this department still doesn't have a contingency plan,\" the officer said. \"Their plan is to put the same officers back on the front line to risk their lives once again while they sit in their ivory towers and fail us once again.\"  \u202f\"Gotta think about the person next to you.\"\u202fCapitol Police officers sweep the grounds of the U.S. Capitol building on January 7, 2021 in Washington, DC.In some ways, the attack January 6 has only reinforced what many Capitol Police officers felt long before that day: In the end, all they have is each other. The events that day revealed, to the officer who spoke to CNN, a corps of officers already mismanaged. The subsequent crises the last few weeks have compounded the stress officers are feeling.  Officers who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity described a department long led by an insular command staff that applied scrutiny and discipline unevenly.\u202f\u202fAs many of them looked back on the events of\u202fJanuary 6,\u202fthey described\u202fa climate of command paralysis, with some leaders not present and others giving conflicting orders.\u202f\u202f Many officers said they are upset at the second-guessing from bosses about use of force that day, feeling they were in a fight for their lives and the lives of lawmakers and staff in the building.\u202f Asked to provide a timeline for all Capitol Police deputy chiefs and top leadership during the attack, agency\u202fspokeswoman\u202fEva Malecki said that because the events of January 6 \"continue to be under investigation by several law enforcement agencies, the Department cannot comment on individuals' actions at this time.\"In the weeks since,\u202fofficers\u202fhave been\u202freluctant to seek professional counseling through the department for fear of being found\u202funwell\u202fand unfit for duty, and\u202fhave had to balance that with the obligation they feel to keep working, one officer told CNN.  \"(Officers) are tired while being on edge,\" one department member told CNN. \"It's always in the back of (our) minds because reaction time decreases with lack of sleep.\"\u202f \"We're coming to work for the next person we work with,\" another officer said. \"We come to work and try to take care of each other.\u202fWe're\u202fall going through it. Everybody is. Gotta think about the person next to you.\"\u202f \"If you asked for time off because you're going through something, they give you time off as long as you don't say buzzwords like 'depression' and stuff like that, you can keep your gun,\" another officer said.  The department is trying to help officers, by making hotel rooms and hot meals available, according to Malecki. The department said it's provided roughly 10,000 hotel nights and 60,000 hot meals since the insurrection.   Demands on their time won't ease anytime soon.\u202fThe Capitol Police will soon have to secure the first-ever impeachment trial of a former President and an annual joint session of Congress.\u202f\u202f Members of Congress have asked for more protection, citing threats\u202fthey're\u202fgetting since the impeachment vote two weeks ago. The department may expand protection to members outside of DC, while they're\u202fin their home districts. US Capitol Police will partner with the Transportation Security Administration to\u202fprovide\u202fsecurity for members at airports -- the acting House sergeant-at-arms outlined the change in a memo to lawmakers last week.\u202f \"The Acting Chief has directed the command staff to consult with the USCP FOP to adjust officers' shifts to allow them to spend more time with their families and to get much needed rest,\" Malecki told CNN. \"The Department, however, continues to operate at a high-level of readiness given the upcoming Senate impeachment trial and continued security threats directed at the Congress and the Capitol.\"\u202f There's\u202fa feeling among some officers the department is adrift, and leaders\u202faren't\u202fup to the task of helping to correct course. Officers have cited a culture where managers\u202faren't\u202fheld to account and the lukewarm response to the separate but related crises by top department leaders.\u202f\u202f \"Feels horrible,\" one member of the department said.\u202f\u202f\"I loved this job when I first joined. Now I can't wait until I retire.\"\u202f\u202f At the same time, turmoil inside the department has only been compounded by the increasing amount of blame that has been cast in its direction since January 6 and a sense that senior leaders are looking for a scapegoat to atone for the security failures that day.  At least one unnamed high-ranking Capitol Police leader has hired an attorney to help \"lawfully reveal to oversight authorities, including Congress, all they know about the events of January 6.\"  \"For the moment, we are waiting on Capitol Police to make sure they handle things properly,\" Mark Zaid, the attorney representing the senior official, told CNN, underscoring concerns that the department could seek to silence those intent on speaking out about the leadership failures exposed by the attack. An outcome that was not inevitable A pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, breaking windows and clashing with police officers on January 6, 2021.  In her remarks to Congress,\u202fPittman told lawmakers she didn't believe \"any preparations ... would have allowed for an open campus in which lawful protesters could exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and at the same time prevented the attack on Capital grounds that day.\" Protests sometimes turn violent, and sometimes violent protesters coordinate their attacks. That either could happen was not surprising.  Acting chief of the USCP Yogananda \"Yogi\" Pittman, But officers who spoke to CNN said the outcome was not inevitable and laid blame with Capitol Police leadership. The people who assaulted the Capitol were able to because Capitol Police leadership and the US House and Senate appointees who oversee the department\u202fdidn't\u202fsecure the human or physical resources to protect the building, despite a known likelihood of violence\u202fthat day. Violence to lawmakers was narrowly avoided.   Pittman's promotion to acting chief after Sund resigned frustrated officers who believe she bears some responsibility for the failures of January 6.\u202f Before Pittman was promoted, she was assistant chief for protective and intelligence operations, a job she was in for just over a year. US Capitol Police sources have told CNN that, with planning, their agency and others would have been well equipped to hold the line against insurgents\u202foverrunning\u202fthe\u202fCapitol. Pittman told Congress there were 1,200 people \"on site\" that day -- a number disputed by officers who said they could have held the line at the Capitol while awaiting backup if they'd had that many. The agency employs more than 2,300 officers and civilians.  Three sources familiar with the matter said the 1,200 figure likely represents officers across the Capitol complex, including\u202fall the outlying office buildings. Those are must-staff positions across the campus, two sources said, and most wouldn't be allowed to respond as backup to what was happening at the Capitol. One source said there were hundreds of other officers across the campus spread among the communications building, the Library of Congress and the House and Senate buildings.  \"But at the Capitol, wasn't no\u202fdamn 1,200 officers. Hell, no,\" the officer said. \"Maybe 1,200 clocked in that day but no 1,200 people out there at the Capitol.\"  That source estimated that with another 200 officers at the west front, they could have held a perimeter until DC Metropolitan police arrived.\u202f\u202f \"Where were they? If we had 1,200 people on site, why were there only five (officers) when the crowd first entered the Capitol grounds to get onto the west front?\u202fThat's\u202fwhat pisses people off,\" another source said.'Are you going to back us\u202fup?'\u202f Capitol Police officers receive medical treatment after clashes with protesters attempting to disrupt the joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College vote on Wednesday, January 6, 2021.Officers also tell CNN they are frustrated by the lack of clear instructions on what they are supposed to do the next time there is an outbreak of violence at the Capitol. Lockdown drills this week did little to appease them, with one calling them \"smoke and mirrors.\"    \"It's pointless. We know how to fking press the button and lock the door,\" one source said. \"Come on. It was stupid.\"  \"It's just laughable stupid to me,\" another source said. \"The lockdown wasn't the problem that day. It was locked. They just busted windows and climbed in.\"   What would be better, the source said, would be for the department to provide more guidance about how to engage with protesters should they come to the Capitol again.  \"They need to let these guys know what to do if (protesters) come again. ... Whether they'd be supported if they upped the level of force. There were command-level people telling (officers) to put their sticks away,\" he said. \"One came up and grabbed his arm ... and said stop, stop, we don't do that to protesters. Officers are confused, they're getting mixed signals.\"  \"These guys need to know if you get jumped on, are you going to back us up if I take out my stick? ... (Officers) need to know what you want. Will you support us if we're in a hostile situation and we start busting people up the head?\" he asked.  Malecki, the agency spokeswoman, told CNN the events of January 6 would lead to further training. While Malecki said Pittman had visited some roll calls and some officers on post, she didn't clarify when or where. The officers who spoke to CNN said they haven't seen Pittman in roll calls and were upset by the lack of communication from the department.  \"That's why morale is low,\" one source said. \"Nobody communicates, on the ground where it matters the most. Not saying we need to be read into top-secret, need-to-know stuff. But some stuff we need to know, like why we needed helmets. Just give us a, 'Here, guys, this has the potential to get ugly.' \"  Malecki didn't respond to a request for comment about the pending no-confidence vote. The timing of the vote irked some officers in the department. A letter to union chairman Papathanasiou from a former union chair said the timing is \"disrespectful and appalling,\" according to a copy of the letter provided to CNN.  The union postponed the vote until at least next week.  Sicknick's memorialUS Capitol Police officers stand at attention as an urn with the cremated remains of US Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick arrives at the US Capitol to the Rotunda where it will lie in honor in Washington, DC, February 2, 2021.Officers were allowed a private visitation at the Capitol on Tuesday night beginning at 10. Those in his unit and who worked the same shift as Sicknick also had a separate visitation, one source told CNN.It's unclear how many officers who worked most closely with Sicknick were allowed to attend his services at the Capitol on Wednesday.That same source told CNN that officers were disappointed they couldn't attend Wednesday morning's memorial while department brass and members of Congress were there. A planning memo obtained by CNN said only a \"very small\" number of US Capitol Police officers would be able to attend.One officer said the services gave him flashbacks. Another officer who was in the Capitol on Wednesday said he felt sad and angry as the ceremony unfolded, calling the event \"great\" but \"very somber.\"The source said Sicknick's death has prompted others on the force to consider the reality that they, too, may have arrived at the same fate.\"I think every officer that worked on the 6th thinks that every day,\" he said.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Federal authorities are piecing together a chilling picture of the January 6 insurrection that reveals major security and intelligence failures, underscores profound fissures in American society and hints at the political challenges ahead for President-elect Joe Biden, even as they race to ensure the safety of US leaders and next week's inauguration.Emerging details paint an even grimmer picture than the shocking images of violence broadcast live around the world last week. Evidence suggests planning by the insurrectionists, and there are concerns that they may have received support from some Capitol Police, current and former members of the military, and even some members of Congress.As rioters broke into the Capitol building and some chanted \"hang Mike Pence,\" the seditious mob ripped through the \"thin blue line\" many claim to revere, kicking and beating police with their own batons, spraying them with chemical irritants, threatening to kill them. One policeman and four others died that day.Once inside the building, The Washington Post reports the insurrectionists came within minutes of reaching the vice president, who was whisked to safety with his wife and daughter. Some had driven to the Capitol days earlier, others had filled their vehicles with guns, ammunition, crossbows, machetes and, in one case, a note listing a congressman by name.Fearing for their safetyRead MoreDays after the attack, even as security reinforcements arrive, some lawmakers tell CNN they now fear for their safety.While some Republicans argued President Donald Trump's unprecedented second impeachment will only inflame divisions, federal officials warned that extremists, after seeing the results of last week's attack on the US Capitol, are now likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on the January 20 inauguration and throughout 2021.Members of the National Guard stand outside the  Capitol on January 14, 2021 in Washington, DC. An internal FBI bulletin disseminated to law enforcement this week warned that \"armed protests\" are being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington in the days leading up to Biden's swearing in. Federal law enforcement agencies issued urgent bulletins calling for assistance securing the nation's capital, which now bristles with road blocks and steel barriers to wall off the \"People's House\" and will host as many as 25,000 National Guard -- a stronger military footprint than the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined.By Friday, the FBI had received 140,000 digital tips regarding the attack, including photos and video, federal officials had opened 275 criminal investigations, charged roughly 98 individuals, and taken 100 individuals into custody. As senior administration leaders who would normally take the lead remained silent for days -- including the heads of the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the President himself -- federal officials launched the most extensive counterterrorism probe since September 11, 2001, and continued planning to fortify Washington. \"Our posture is aggressive. It's going to stay that way through the inauguration,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a Thursday briefing on inauguration security. He added that the agency was monitoring \"extensive\" online chatter about further potential armed protests and issued a warning to the men and woman who wreaked havoc on the Capitol. \"We know who you are, if you're out there,\" Wray said, \"and FBI agents are coming to find you.\"The domestic terrorists struck at a time when the US government is confronting the worst known cyberattack by a foreign adversary in its history, with Russia suspected of penetrating hundreds of businesses and numerous federal agencies. Their bloodshed and destruction come as Covid-19 claims record daily death tolls and a jobs crisis is brewing, with nearly 1 million people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time last week.The insurrection, fueled by Trump's lies about his definitive election loss, exposed the reach of baseless conspiracy theories that have radicalized Americans to the point that they laid siege to their own Capitol.Pro-Trump rioters storm the Capitol during clashes with police, following a rally to contest the certification of the 2020 presidential election.The events of that day raise questions about intelligence failures, the military's lethargic response as panicked lawmakers pleaded by telephone for help, and law enforcement's potential blind spots or willful ignorance about the dangers posed by white supremacists and right-wing nativists.Those groups formed a combustible mix with the anti-Semites and QAnon conspiracists rampaging on January 6 to create an existential crisis for the Republican Party, which faces the choice of remaining in thrall to Trump and his more toxic supporters or breaking away. It creates a challenge for the larger country as well, according to CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, who said the trajectory of Trump's \"white nationalist extremism has been very clear\" for the last four years, as are the potential costs to US security if it is left unchecked.  \"President Trump has provided an enormous amount of oxygen to this very dangerous ideology,\" Brownstein told Jake Tapper on Thursday. \"And unless everyone involved, the Justice Department, law enforcement, Congress, is very serious about imposing consequences and taking the threat seriously, this could become a steady drumbeat through the Biden presidency.\"\"The question is, can we more broadly send a signal that says we are not going to tolerate and look the other way as this metastasizes,\" Brownstein said.Ideologically motivated violenceAlready, thousands of armed pro-Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of Biden's inauguration, according to a lawmaker briefed by security officials Monday.A joint US government intelligence bulletin said the January 6 attack, meant to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory, may have given extremists of differing ideological stripes a way to connect. The bulletin warned that the insurrection \"is very likely part of an ongoing trend in which (extremists) exploit lawful protests, rallies, and demonstrations, and other gatherings to carry out ideologically motivated violence and criminal activity.\" Multiple defense officials have told CNN that the National Guard and law enforcement expect explosives like pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to be used in any coming unrest. They are assuming perpetrators will come with high \"aggression,\" said one senior defense official, who added, \"their intentions are very serious.\"Barbed wire is installed on the top of a security fence surrounding the Capitol.Pipe bombs that could have done serious damage were planted outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington last week but didn't go off. The expertise behind the bombs and the ease with which the raucous crowd seemed to mill about the Capitol complex with little resistance raised concerns participants had insider help and military expertise. At least two US Capitol Police officers were suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for allegedly playing some sort of role, CNN reported. Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, confirmed Friday that \"we're seeing indications that law enforcement officers, both former and current, maybe who have been off duty, participating in this riot activity.\" \"We don't care what your profession is, who you are, who you are affiliated with, if you are conducting or engaged in criminal activity, we will charge you and you will be arrested,\" Sherwin said. Military membersPart of that hunt is for \"several\" people possibly involved in the killing of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, according to two law enforcement officials. On Friday, Steven D'Antuono of the FBI's Washington Field Office said his investigators are \"making progress\" on the investigation and are looking at \"anyone and everyone\" who may be involved. He did not give specifics on the scope of the investigation.In the days after the attack, court records and news reports also confirmed that current and former US military members participated in the insurrection. The news triggered unprecedented statements from the leaders of major security agencies who felt the need to remind their men and women their loyalty is to the Constitution. On Tuesday, the America's most senior military leaders condemned the violent invasion and reminded service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism. The Defense Department has observed an increase in white supremacist ideology amongst active-duty service members and veterans, a senior defense official told CNN.The next day, US Secret Service Director James Murray sent agency employees a message urging them to remember their mission and remain professional during the upcoming inauguration. \"We are expected to behave in a non-partisan manner,\" his memo said. Video images of a Capitol Police officer wearing a MAGA hat during the invasion and of another taking selfies with rioters left lawmakers deeply shaken. According to the Wall Street Journal, the officer seen wearing the trademark red cap put it on as part of a ruse to rescue more than a dozen trapped police officers during the riot. The officer has been suspended and an investigation is underway.   Members of the New York National Guard stand guard along the fence that surrounds the Capitol.\"There were those acts of heroism, but next to that, there were also attacks of betrayal,\" Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York said Tuesday on Instagram Live. \"And to run in the nation's Capitol and not know if an officer is there to help you or to harm you is also quite traumatizing.\"\"I did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that many, many members of the House were nearly assassinated.\"Some members are asking for bulletproof vests, considering getting their own security and taking other steps, such as changing their routes to work, lawmakers told CNN. Meanwhile, some Republicans expressed outrage at metal detectors installed at the entrance to the House chamber.Many House lawmakers are considering another appalling possibility: that the mob got assistance from some of their colleagues. Thirty-one members of Congress sent a letter to the acting House Sergeant at Arms, acting Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the acting chief of the US Capitol Police asking them to investigate \"unusual\" and \"concerning\" tours they saw and reported to the Sergeant at Arms on January 5.\"Many of the Members who signed this letter, including those of us who have served in the military and are trained to recognize suspicious activity, as well as various members of our staff, witnessed an extremely high number of outside groups in the complex on Tuesday, January 5,\" the letter states. The groups of six to eight, who wore MAGA apparel, according to Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, \"could only have gained access to the Capitol Complex from a Member of Congress or a member of their staff,\" the letter said.Coordination\"I kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn't know the rules or something,\" Scanlon of Pennsylvania, one of the co-signers, told CNN. \"There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff\" at a time when tours have been canceled due to Covid.At least one right-wing conspiracist said he coordinated the rally where Trump spoke before the riot with three House Republicans: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke before the President took the stage and urged the crowd to \"start taking down names and kicking ass.\" Brooks, Gosar and several other House GOP lawmakers are facing criticism for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege.Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who is affiliated with the QAnon movement and regularly spreads right-wing conspiracy theories, has also come under scrutiny for tweeting about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's whereabouts as the attack was unfolding. On Friday, Pelosi announced retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9, a former vice director with the Joint Chiefs of staff, would lead a review of the Capitol's security. She added that, \"if, in fact, it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecution for that.\"  Later that day, when asked if they are investigating allegations that Capitol Police and lawmakers were involved in the riot, D'Antuono of the FBI's Washington Field Office said they will \"leave no stone unturned\" and are \"looking at every piece of the puzzle.\"Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, DC, told reporters earlier in the week that \"we're looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy.\"Evidence of planningEvidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning, a federal law enforcement official said. And court filings are offering shocking new details.One memo in a filing Friday seeks to extend the detention of Jacob Anthony Chansley, the face-painted QAnon believer who rallied people inside the Capitol wearing a horned headdress and carrying a six-foot spear and a bullhorn.  Prosecutors describe those who took over the Capitol as \"insurrectionists\" and offer new details about Chansley's role in the violent siege last week, including that Chansley left a note on the dais where Vice President Pence had stood that morning saying, \"It's only a matter of time, justice is coming.\"Jacob Chansley wore a horned headdress inside the Capitol.Chansley later told the FBI he did not mean the note as a threat but said the vice president was a \"child-trafficking traitor.\"Before he was arrested, Chansley also told the FBI he wanted to return to Washington for the inauguration to protest.In a separate case, prosecutors in Texas alleged that a retired Air Force reservist who carried plastic zip tie-like restraints on the Senate floor may have intended to restrain lawmakers. It was one of the many chilling details to emerge as investigators tracked down some of the most recognizable faces from the riot.Authorities apprehended the man in widely circulated photos carrying a Confederate flag inside Capitol Hill, another who had worn a \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt and the Olympic gold medalist swimmer Klete Keller.Federal officials also charged Peter Stager, a burly bearded man, with beating a DC police officer with a flagpole that had an American flag on it. \"Everybody in there is a treasonous traitor,\" Stager said in a video obtained by the FBI. \"Death is the only remedy for what's in that building.\"A few arrests suggest the apparent murderous intent of some in the crowd.One man from Alabama faces 17 criminal counts, largely for possession of multiple weapons, including a shotgun, a rifle, three pistols and 11 Molotov cocktails, as well as ammunition and shotgun shells without registration, according to an indictment. After living in his truck in DC for about a week, the man parked it about a block from the Capitol on January 6, according to court documents. Police started searching the truck after spotting a firearm handle and found the weapons, as well as a stun gun, several machetes, a crossbow; several large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices; and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to a memorandum that prosecutors filed January 12 in support of his detention.Also in the truck: the handwritten note with Indiana Rep. Andre Carson's name and an added observation that he is \"one of two Muslims in House of Reps.\" The second man is alleged to have driven from Colorado to Washington, DC, a day before Trump's rally with more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition and an assault rifle. He is said to have texted acquaintances that he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and shoot DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to court records. \"If I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don't remember it,\" Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court said Thursday.  Some lawmakers' experiences made them worry that the rioters had a level of careful preparation that belies the narrative of a protest that wheeled out of control. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN that someone removed panic buttons installed throughout her office that had been regularly tested and maintained. An investigation is underway, said Pressley, who said the discovery was \"certainly unnerving.\"Carson, whose name was on the note found in the car filled with weaponry and ammunition, is among a growing list of lawmakers critical of law enforcement's handling of the insurgency.\"It is extremely disturbing to learn from press reports that I was one of several individuals identified in a list of 'good guys' and 'bad guys' targeted for attacks,\" Carson said in a statement provided to CNN. \"As a former law enforcement officer, it is especially disappointing to see the failure of law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Capitol Police, to notify individuals like myself that we were targeted and at risk from the indicted terrorist and his co-conspirators.\"FailuresInvestigators will be asking how federal authorities missed so many red flags, why they were so underprepared and slow to react.The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to issue threat assessments about the potential of violence at the US Capitol ahead of last week's deadly attack, according to a source familiar with the matter and a senior DHS official. Typically, the FBI and DHS will produce a joint threat assessment for high-profile events and send it to law enforcement officials and relevant stakeholders. But no such report was compiled by either agency for the January 6 certification of Biden's victory, a controversial event for the President's followers.The Washington Post reported Friday that three days before the attack, an internal Capitol Police intelligence report warned that angry Trump supporters could attack \"Congress itself.\" The 12-page report describes a scenario eerily like the one that unfolded, with the President's enraged backers trying to stop Biden's certification and overturn the election results.Rioters overwhelmed security at the Capitol on January 6.A day before the chaos erupted, an FBI outpost in Virginia issued an internal warning that extremists were coming to Washington prepared to commit violence.The Post also reported that dozens of people on a terrorist watch list came to Washington for the January 6 events. The majority of them were suspected white supremacists with track records so disturbing they were put on the national Terrorist Screening Database as potential security risks.Four federal agencies announced Friday they are opening investigations into their own roles on January 6. The Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the Interior Department will all examine their preparations for the events in Washington that day that may have played a part in allowing rioters to breach the Capitol.These agencies and others are now preparing for rioters to descend on the Capitol again. The Secret Service is taking the lead on Biden's inauguration security planning. The National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day, according to an official familiar with discussions. There will be no big screens, no toilets and the public will not be able to get down to the Mall where traditionally thousands gather to watch the new president be sworn in, the official said.  The President-elect and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol during a significantly scaled-down event. Biden said this week that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence and that he was \"not afraid of taking the oath outside.\"CNN's Katelyn Polantz, Christina Carrega, David Shortell, Marshall Cohen, Nicky Robertson, Ellie Kaufman, Geneva Sands, Zachary Cohen, Oren Liebermann, Barbara Starr, Jamie Crawford, Jamie Gangel, Jake Tapper, Alex Marquardt, Jeff Zeleny, Kate Sullivan, Ryan Nobles, Annie Grayer, and Brian Todd contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Biden administration is leaning on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help state and local authorities combat domestic extremism in the United States.The new guidance directed by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was announced by FEMA to state and local officials in a briefing last week, an administration official said. The agency, often associated with storm and emergency relief efforts, plans to increase funding for states and cities to focus on the pursuit of domestic extremist groups, doubling down on the agency's efforts to combat domestic extremism, a FEMA source told CNN.The Trump White House's general lack of interest in addressing the problem of right-wing extremism has forced the Biden administration to essentially start from scratch as it conducts a variety of threat assessments. Officials acknowledge they must first understand the scope of the problem before they can begin to counter it.In a town hall with CNN Tuesday night, President Joe Biden said \"domestic terror\" is the greatest terrorism threat to the US. \"It is complex, it's wide ranging, and it's real,\" he said of the ongoing threats from Americans who embrace White supremacy.Read More\"There is an urgency and a priority coming directly to the interagency that was not there under the Trump administration\" when it comes to the focus on domestic extremism, a DHS official told CNN, adding that individual agencies were working on the issue at the operational level, but there was \"no real leadership\" coming from the top. \"January 6 was a wake-up call. The government is taking this extremely seriously,\" the official said.\"Since 2002, DHS has allocated more than $54 billion to states and territories to prevent and prepare for the threats that terrorist organizations pose. Almost 20 years later, the homeland security threat environment has evolved. As the threats evolve, so, too, must the grant programs intended to prepare communities for those threats, a FEMA spokesperson told CNN.The fiscal year 2021 grant program details will be publicly released next Thursday, according to the spokesperson.Rioters breached the US Capitol last month in an attack that left five people dead and prompted the House to impeach President Donald Trump over his role inciting the violence. The Senate acquitted Trump in his second impeachment trial over the weekend. During his first weeks in office, Mayorkas made it clear to officials in the department, as well as outside groups, that combating domestic violent extremism is a top priority, according to several officials. DHS is considering additional operational improvements to combat domestic extremism, such as, expanding training, providing technical assistance to local jurisdictions for threat assessment investigations, and developing strategies to combat the influence of false online narratives, according to the administration official. Initiatives are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. In January, President Joe Biden tasked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to compile a comprehensive threat assessment, coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremism. While the intelligence assessment is underway, the White House National Security Council is coordinating a government wide plan to deal with the threat.DHS counterterrorism strategyThe summer of 2019 brought the threat of domestic terrorism into focus after a string of incidents, including the mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, the deadly shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in Northern California and the shooting in Dayton, Ohio.Shortly after Labor Day 2019, former acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan unveiled the department's counterterrorism strategy, outlining the ongoing threats from foreign terrorism and focusing on domestic terror threats, particularly White supremacism.At the time, McAleenan called White supremacist extremism one of the most \"potent ideologies\" driving acts violence in the US. Mayorkas, who was confirmed earlier this month, told CNN's Ana Cabrera that domestic terrorism is \"one of the greatest threats\" to the US. \"To see the insurrection, the horrific acts of January 6, were not only personally devastating, but created in me a commitment to redouble our efforts, to fight hate and to fight one of the greatest threats that we face currently on our homeland, which is the threat of domestic terrorism,\" Mayorkas said.The most significant terrorism threat currently facing the nation comes from lone offenders and small groups inspired by domestic extremist beliefs, including those based on false narratives spread on online and through social media, a DHS spokesperson told CNN. Since late 2019, DHS observed more than a dozen domestic terrorism incidents targeting government facilities or officials, with most occurring since May 2020, according to the DHS spokesperson and first reported by CBS News. The key drivers of those attacks included: civil unrest, ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, the election season and the breach of the US Capitol, the spokesperson confirmed. In the first weeks of the Biden administration, John Cohen was appointed as the DHS coordinator for counterterrorism and the Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism & Threat Prevention. Cohen previously served in the Obama administration as DHS's counterterrorism coordinator and the former acting under secretary at the department. Sam Vinograd, a former CNN national security analyst, recently joined the department as a senior counselor for national security.A rattled department Mayorkas also takes the reins from a department that's been rattled by leadership turnover and vacancies for the better part of the last four years and was often at the center of Trump's political agenda. Last September, a DHS whistleblower, Brian Murphy, accused top Trump political appointees at the department of trying to alter a report to downplay the threat posed by White supremacists and instead emphasize the role of leftist groups due to concerns about how the initial language would reflect on the President, according to a complaint first reported by CNN.The complaint is still under investigation. About a month later, DHS published its first annual homeland threat assessment that concluded, White supremacist extremists will remain the deadliest domestic terror threat to the US, while also detailing a range of threats from election interference to unprecedented storms.The DHS Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) was established under the Trump administration as part of a rebranding that focused prevention efforts on all forms of violence, regardless of the ideological motivation.Funding for the office's next round of grants is expected to double from $10 to $20 million, according to two officials. An increase in funding for the grants, which was first reported by NBC News, has yet to be announced. These grants are awarded to state and local authorities, as well as schools and other nongovernmental groups to develop violence prevention capabilities. DHS awarded $10 million to 29 projects last September in support of these efforts, including grants to Boston Children's Hospital, the Philadelphia Police Department and Arizona State University.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Amplifying propaganda that is backed by the Kremlin. Spreading disinformation about mail-in voting that US election officials say is false. If it were coming from another country, it would be designated and attacked as foreign meddling, the kind of thing US national security agencies work around the clock to combat. But as the election approaches, it is increasingly coming from President Donald Trump and the inability -- or unwillingness -- of officials and agencies to publicly confront his efforts has become glaring.On Monday night, Twitter suspended a user's account after it posted what the US intelligence community had just cited as a specific example of Russia's efforts to \"denigrate\" Joe Biden. The post might have gone unnoticed except for the fact that Trump himself retweeted it to his more than 85 million followers.The President was turbocharging the very tactic his own intelligence community just nine days prior had called a measure used by a suspected Russia-backed actor \"to undermine former Vice President Biden's candidacy and the Democratic Party.\"No effective systemsThe intelligence community didn't respond publicly. Nor did any other election officials. It fell to Twitter to do what could be done to stop post from spreading, they suspended the account.Read MoreNone of the federal agencies charged with protecting the November election -- the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, among others --  are empowered or seem able to deal with one of the most serious election issues they grapple with daily when it's coming from the White House.\"It puts the agencies in an impossible position because it's their own boss and how are they going counteract the chief executive of our government?\" said Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff to former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\"In the past four years there's been a lot done to prepare the United States for the possibility of disinformation and foreign interference in the election,\" Taylor added, \"But none of that can prepare us for when the president may the one amplifying foreign government disinformation.\"Taylor recently became one of the highest-ranking former Trump administration officials to endorse Joe Biden.Not their remit\"Our system is not designed for elected officials -- especially at [the President's] level -- who regularly present categorically false information,\" a former senior intelligence official agreed. \"And so, all of the systems and controls that are supposed to be in place are not effective against this particular situation.\" Intelligence officials argue it's not their remit. By definition they're focused on overseas threats, even when the President is amplifying them. The Office of Director of National Intelligence declined a request for comment. On the President's retweet, they referred questions to the White House, which directed inquiries to the Trump campaign, which did not respond.In an August 7 statement, the intelligence community's top election security official, Bill Evanina, said that Russia is actively working against Biden -- but he also stated that China \"prefers\" that Trump \"does not win reelection.\" The Senate just dropped a massive Russia bombshell (and most people missed it) That appearance of equal threats, Democrats and numerous former intelligence officers say, is highly misleading when Moscow is far more active and overt with its intentions regarding the election. But with a President who interprets talk of Russian interference as diminishing his 2016 victory, Evanina's statement was also seen by many as a way to placate Trump.\"People are doing backflips to do their job,\" the former intelligence official said, \"it's difficult.\"  \"This is all about people's willingness to be fired,\" said a Democratic aide on the House Committee on Homeland Security, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security and its efforts to safeguard the election. \"If you want someone to come out swinging there's nothing stopping them, but they can be fired. And this President will fire people.\"The FBI and DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) play a variety of critical roles in helping states -- which actually run the elections - safely protect them. But none of those roles or preparations include thwarting a disinformation threat coming from the Oval Office. 'Rigged'At a Wisconsin rally on Monday, Trump told the crowd that \"The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.\" Two days before that, he told reporters and supporters at his New Jersey golf club that the winner of the election could take months or years to be determined, \"because these ballots are all going to be lost, they're all going to be gone.\"Asked recently by CNN how CISA can combat the President's disinformation, the agency's director Chris Krebs didn't respond directly but emphasized the array of tools and educational awareness for disinformation his agency has offered to the states, adding that state election officials should be the \"go-to\" trusted sources of information for their elections.The FBI declined a request for comment. Multiple state election officials say there's been no specific guidance from CISA or the FBI about what to do if the President or other government officials make allegations about their states that are untrue.\"We don't have conversations about that,\" said Washington DC's chairman of the Board of Election, Michael Bennett. \"I would go and correct the record and say there's no evidence. But we don't have any plans per se.\"Trump has targeted California, incorrectly asserting that the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has ordered ballots be sent to non-citizens and undocumented immigrants. \"Millions,\" the President tweeted, \"anybody that walks in California is gonna get a ballot.\"Trump's own intelligence officials contradict his repeated claims of mail-in voting fraud \"We need a national response when the President shares propaganda, we haven't seen it yet,\" California's Secretary of State, Alex Padilla, said in an interview. \"So the clock is ticking.\"Padilla, a Democrat, said California state officials follow the same protocol to address false claims coming from the President as they would suspected disinformation from Russia or another foreign actor.As the President has raged against mail-in voting, saying it will lead to \"the most corrupt election in the history of our country,\" CISA published an advisory. It did not say mail-in voting presented significantly more risks and it detailed how to best manage them. Then it warned that \"threat actors may mislead and confuse the public about the mechanics of mail-in voting and leverage limited understanding regarding mail-in voting processes, in order to cause chaos and provoke distrust in the election administration and electoral results.\"To the President's critics, that warning from CISA read as precisely what the President's is doing now and may easily do in the future. Short of speaking out bluntly and risk getting fired, that's about as far as administration officials can go when the President's tactics mirror those of malicious actors, the Democratic aide on the House Committee Homeland Security said.'No one in charge'\"There's no one in charge of the sanctity of elections and the provision of correct information in a democracy,\" said Glenn Gerstell, the NSA's former top lawyer who stepped down in February. \"There's nobody in charge and there's no plan.\"There's also no precedent. Beyond amplifying the attacks of the primary foreign threat to the election, Russia, Trump has presented national security and election officials with another obstacle: his own words about mail-in voting and the supposed potential for a rigged election, which observers of Russia's strategy expect to be used as fodder by foreign influence campaigns. \"Trump just gave them a gift on a silver platter,\" a second former senior intelligence official said. \"If you were sitting in the Kremlin and saying, \"How we could sow discord, is there anything we could seize on or jump on that would really resonate?\" And someone walked into the room and said, \"Well sir, we have this tweet from the President.\" You'd say, 'Oh my god, thank you.'\"Election officials say that due to the pandemic it's unlikely the results will be known on November 3. Chris Krebs, arguably the most visible federal election official, has repeatedly called for voters to be patient and issued a warning.Ripe for attackThe uncertainty over results and the expected lack of an immediate winner on November 3 make it \"absolutely ripe for a destructive or disruptive attack by a capable adversary,\" Krebs warned last month.Facebook, along with other major tech companies, met last week with Krebs' agency and intelligence officials, and said after the meeting that in the days before a winner is named, malicious actors could \"fill the information vacuum with misleading information.\"To many election officials, like California's Alex Padilla, the President could be among them. \"You can imagine what a, a certain somebody would do in that timespan in terms of spewing, lies and conspiracy theories about what's happening,\" Padilla said.Padilla says that much of the recourse he and others have to keep the President in check depends on Facebook and the other social media companies responding to their requests that posts be taken down. Amid fierce criticism for allowing disinformation to spread rampantly, they have tried to show lately that they are cracking down. Democrats say public needs to know more on foreign election interference Two weeks ago, Facebook took down a video the Trump campaign posted about the coronavirus that it said violated Facebook's misinformation rules. When the President on Sunday retweeted the widely discredited phone recording of Biden that came from a Ukrainian parliamentarian that the intelligence community says works for Russia, Twitter took down the account. \"This is an entirely different threat from 2016, when he was only tacitly welcoming the help of a foreign government,\" said Taylor, the former DHS chief-of-staff. \"Now he is the commander in chief and he's embracing foreign interference while sitting behind the Resolute Desk.\" On Tuesday, the Senate intelligence committee issued a nearly 1000-page, bipartisan report saying Russian intelligence operatives were closer to top Trump campaign efforts in 2016 than was previously known. Its findings, Democrats on the committee said, amounted to \"an alarm bell for our nation,\" both as a report on 2016 and as a caution for what is happening now. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon added that redacted information in the report is \"directly relevant to Russia's interference in the 2020 election.\" \"The threat is ongoing,\" said Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who chaired much of the committee's investigation. CNN's Pamela Brown, Zachary Cohen and Evan Perez contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)A secret push by President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner to sell advanced arms -- including F-35 stealth fighter jets -- to the United Arab Emirates has caused confusion and frustration among agencies and congressional committees that would normally be involved in such a sale but have been left in the dark.Kushner is supporting the administration's discussions with the UAE about the potential advanced arms sale, which have been led by the NSC Senior Director for the Middle East, Miguel Correa, a senior administration official said. The tight hold on details about these discussions has created confusion across the US government, two State Department officials and multiple congressional aides tell CNN.Trump said the potential sale was \"under review\" during a press conference on Wednesday. He also said the Emirates have the funds to pay for the military hardware.Expecting closer cooperationRead MoreOn Thursday, Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said at an Atlantic Council event that \"the UAE has indicated that it wants F-35s. The first time we made this request was 6 years ago. We ought to get them. It should be easier to get them.\" Gargash added that discussions about the F-35 are not connected to the deal with Israel.The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said in a statement Thursday that \"we have been flying the most advanced model of the US-made F-16 for more than 15 years. Facing new threats and more sophisticated adversaries, the UAE will continue to upgrade and improve our air defense capabilities. The F-35 has been part of these plans for more than six years.\"\"With the signing of the new accord and the added assurances it provides, we expect closer security cooperation among all three countries including on air defense and systems,\" the statement continued.The New York Times reported Wednesday that the Emirati military was given a classified briefing by administration officials on the F-35 fighter jet in recent weeks.Reports of a possible arms deal surfaced Tuesday when one of Israel's leading newspapers alleged there was a \"secret clause\" in Israel's deal to normalize relations with the UAE -- one that would allow the UAE to buy billions of dollars in advanced military hardware from the US, including drones, F-35 stealth fighters and other weaponry. The story raised hackles in Israel because of the potential threat to Israel's military superiority in the region. Israel has long opposed sales of strategic weapons systems to other countries in the Middle East and under US law, any arms sales must take Israel's qualitative military edge into account. It is unclear if there is a direct correlation between the discussions over the possible arms sale and the agreement which was inked last week, but Trump administration officials have indicated that the agreement paved the way for these discussions.Kushner was directly involved in discussion with the Emirates and the Israelis in the lead up to the agreement last week, he told reporters.State Dept watchdog finds Saudi arms sale was legal but risks to civilians weren't fully assessed  The National Security Council did not reply to a request for comment.Any sale involving the F-35 would require serious scrutiny from Congress, said two congressional aides. But relevant committees in Congress have not been notified of an arms sale to UAE involving F-35s and there is no unofficial review underway either, the aides said. There is frustration among members of both parties about the lack of communication from the administration on these discussions, the aides added.A Democratic Senate aide told CNN that Congress \"would almost certainly\" attempt to block a sale of F-35s to the UAE with a resolution of disapproval if the Trump administration disregards Israel's objections and moves forward with the deal.\"F-35s are really another level of technology that threaten Israel's qualitative military edge... so it is a big deal,\" the aide added.Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Ellen Lord, referred all questions about the F-35 and UAE to the State Department when asked about the issue Thursday.The State Department office that handles arms sales has not been formally been notified of a request for the purchase from the Emirates, which is required to trigger a formal review process, State Department officials tell CNN.Arms sales take years to come to fruition, particularly ones that involve such advanced defense systems.Earlier this month a group of Trump administration national security officials visited the UAE. Discussions focused on the UAE relationship with China, said a source familiar with the trip. It is unclear if there were also sideline discussions about the possible arms sale.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement Tuesday that Israel repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of advanced arms sales to \"any country in the Middle East\" in the weeks before the normalization deal was announced. Trump announced that agreement, heralding it as a \"significant step towards building a more peaceful, secure, and prosperous Middle East.\" CNN's Mostafa Salem and Becky Anderson contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed reports the US will sell stealth fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates as part of the agreement to normalize relations between Israel and the Gulf nation, tweeting that they are \"completely fake news.\" Netanyahu was responding Tuesday to a report in one of the country's leading newspapers alleging the existence of a \"secret clause\" in Israel's deal to normalize relations with the UAE -- one that would allow the UAE to buy billions of dollars in advanced military hardware from the US, including drones, F-35 stealth fighters and other weaponry. The story raised hackles in Israel because of the potential threat to Israel's military superiority in the region. Israel has long opposed sales of strategic weapons systems to other countries in the Middle East and repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility in the weeks before the normalization deal was reached. In Washington, an official at the White House's National Security Council directed CNN to the written announcement of the deal, which contains no clauses or references to weapons deals. \"The deal is the joint statement we released on Thursday,\" the official said, referring to the 556-word statement on the White House website.Surprised reactionsRead MoreIn other corners of the US capital, reports of the alleged deal were met with surprise. Officials in the State Department office that handles US arms sales to foreign countries were startled by the reports, two State Department officials said, adding that if there is any such agreement, they had not been briefed on it. If there were a sale to the UAE, the State Department would be in charge of overseeing the process. During that process, which requires congressional approval to finalize, the US must ensure Israel retains its qualitative military edge in the region, a requirement written into US law in 2008. The State Department directed inquiries to the White House. On Capitol Hill, Republican and Democratic aides said relevant Hill committees have not been notified about a deal of this nature and don't have any new transfers to the UAE before them for review at this time.Netanyahu's office backed up his tweet with a lengthy statement categorically denying the deal included any understanding of US arms sales to the UAE. \"The historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates did not include Israel's consent to any arms deal whatsoever between the United States and the UAE,\" the statement said. \"From the outset, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has opposed the sale of F-35s and other advanced weaponry to any country in the Middle East, including Arab countries that have peace agreements with the State of Israel.\" Read the full statement by the US, Israel and UAE on normalizing Israel-UAE relationsNetanyahu's rebuttal follows a story in the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, which said UAE Crown Prince and de-facto leader Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had demanded a clause be included in the agreement that would enable the Emirates to buy billions of dollars worth of F-35 fighter jets, drones and other advanced weaponry. The report cited unnamed US and Emirati officials. The US, Israel and the UAE announced the plan to normalize relations August 13. Since then, phone lines have been opened between the two countries and business deals announced.  Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who'd only just been released from hospital following back surgery, decided the story warranted a press conference. He said the proliferation of the F-35 was \"not good for Israel,\" adding: \"We need to talk to the Emiratis, to the Americans, and make sure our security interests are being upheld.\"The reports triggered widespread reaction for several reasons. First, there's the way the UAE-Israel deal was done. Unusually for an agreement of this nature, Netanyahu kept his foreign minister and defense minister (who just happen to be from rival parties) in the dark, telling Israeli media he did so at the request of the US.According to Israeli newspaper reports, the first time the two ministers heard about Israel agreeing to suspend plans to annex parts of the West Bank in exchange for normalization with the UAE was when the agreement was announced. An ideal drone customerSecond is the advanced weaponry itself. The UAE is seen as an ideal drone customer and was the client some US officials cited as a potential beneficiary, following the recent easing of the drone export regulations.Some US defense officials have also expressed interest in getting the UAE the F-35 after Turkey was kicked out of the program, leaving more than 100 jets without a customer. The UAE military is seen as potentially more capable of integrating and operating the advanced aircraft, as opposed to other regional militaries, such as Saudi Arabia.The third reason the story has caught hold may be an August 14 interview that US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman gave to NPR. Asked if the UAE-Israel deal would mean Abu Dhabi would now get hold of advanced American weaponry, he replied, somewhat cryptically: \"The more the Emirates becomes a friend of Israel, becomes a partner with Israel, becomes a regional ally of the United States, I think obviously that alters the threat assessment and could work out to the Emirates' benefit on that issue.\" And finally, there is Netanyahu's statement, which indicates that Israel repeatedly raised concerns about the possibility of advanced arms sales to \"any country in the Middle East\" in July and August -- and that the prime minister himself had told Friedman they would not be acceptable.  Explicit objections\"In his 7 July conversation with US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, Prime Minister Netanyahu was explicit in Israel's opposition to the sale of F-35s and other advanced weaponry to any country in the Middle East, including those with peace agreements with Israel,\" the statement said. \"On 8 July, the Prime Minister sent a letter -- via Ambassador Friedman -- to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in which he reiterated that Israel's position remains unchanged even following the reaching of peace agreements,\" the statement continued.It goes on to say that on August 3, at Netanyahu's direction, Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer met with Pompeo and once more \"underscored Israel's opposition to the sale of F-35s and other advanced weapons systems to any country in the Middle East.\"CNN's Betsy Klein and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Monday expressed skepticism about foreign disinformation campaigns related to the coronavirus pandemic, contradicting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who has been a strong critic of China and Iran in particular.Asked about reported efforts by China, Russia and Iran to mislead the public about the source of the deadly pandemic and the US response to it, Trump countered by voicing doubt about the media reports and suggesting that they were aimed at damaging his presidency.\"Number one you don't know what they're doing, and when you read it in the Washington Post, you don't believe it,\" Trump said on Fox & Friends. \"I believe very little of what I see. I see stories in the Washington Post that are so fake, that are so phony.\"Pressed on the fact that the Chinese government has engaged in such a disinformation campaign, the President seemed to downplay the matter.Trump strikes friendly tone on China with trade in mind, as his top officials point fingers over pandemic\"They do it and we do it and we call them different things and you know, I make statements that are very strong against China, including the Chinese virus, which has been going on for a long time,\" Trump said. \"Every country does it.\"Read MoreTrump's apparent nonchalance about the targeted foreign influence campaigns come in stark contrast to his own State Department, where key officials, including Pompeo, have sought to highlight disinformation as cornerstones of their coronavirus messaging.Pompeo has taken an aggressive approach in calling out disinformation, particularly from Beijing and Tehran. The top US diplomat, speaking from the White House podium on March 20, said the US had seen these activities \"come from places like China and Russia and Iran, where there are coordinated efforts to disparage what America is doing in our activity to do all the things that President Trump has set in motion here.\" He urged people to \"ensure that where they turn to for information is a reliable source and not a bad actor trying to create and flow information that they know is wrong.\" Trump says he will speak with Putin to discuss oil market and tradePompeo said that \"the intentional disinformation campaign that China has been and continues to be engaged in\" was a key topic of discussion at last week's Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers' meeting. The US scuttled the traditional joint statement from that coalition over insistence on the use of the phrase \"Wuhan virus\" -- a term which Pompeo and State Department officials have claimed is meant to counter misinformation about the source of the illness.Two weeks ago, the top official in the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai after China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson suggested coronavirus originated with the US Army.On Friday, the head of the State Department's Global Engagement Center told reporters that since January, they have \"been tracking narratives promoted by Russian, Chinese, and Iranian-sponsored sites or different platforms related to the coronavirus.\" \"During the crisis, we've seen Russian, Chinese, and Iranian state disinformation and propaganda ecosystems all converge around some disinformation themes intended to promote their own agendas,\" Lea Gabrielle said. \"The COVID-19 crisis has really provided an opportunity for malign actors to exploit the information space for harmful purposes, and really been providing unnecessary distractions from the global communities focused on this crisis.\"CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect the top official in the State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs summoned the Chinese ambassador.CNN's Alison Main, Alex Marquardt, Kylie Atwood and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US intelligence community is using its unique abilities to monitor foreign countries to keep track of the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and establish whether nations are being truthful about the extent of the outbreak.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the CIA are providing a steady flow of intelligence to oversight committees on Capitol Hill, giving the intelligence committees in the House and Senate daily briefings and updates on the spread of the virus, according to two congressional aides. The updates are focusing mainly on the tally of those cases and whether they match what is being reported publicly.That's the value the intelligence agencies bring, a former senior intelligence officer said. \"They are assessing foreign intent, activity, and reporting.\"America faces a new normal as coronavirus outbreaks show no sign of slowing downThe congressional briefings were first reported by Politico.US officials have publicly raised questions about the accuracy of numbers reported by countries like China, Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang, for example, which spends less on health care per capita than anywhere else in the world, has reported no cases of the virus.Read More\"I trust that the IC was looking very hard at China in the early days when the Chinese were less than forthcoming,\" says former Director of National Intelligence and CNN contributor James Clapper. \"It's a crucial role when governments aren't forthcoming.\"Who is gathering the intel?Much of the information flowing from the intelligence community on the current crisis comes from a little-known branch of the Defense Intelligence Agency called the National Center for Medical Intelligence, Clapper added. The NCIM is a unique outfit that combines wide-ranging, advanced medical expertise with intelligence gathering and assessments.\"I'm sure they're busier than hell right now,\" Clapper, who once ran the DIA, said of the center, which is the main source of medical intelligence for the federal government.To get the most accurate picture of how the coronavirus is impacting a country, intelligence analysts are using a variety of tools, the most prominent of which are human intelligence, signals intelligence and satellite imagery. What kind of access agencies and spies have in a country will dictate what combination of tools are used.The evaluations from the intelligence community are also included in the President's Daily Brief and likely the intelligence Vice President Mike Pence gets as he leads the coronavirus task force.Coronavirus adds to the risk of miscalculation between global enemies  Satellite images released Thursday showed two long trenches being dug in a cemetery in the Iranian holy city of Qom, ground zero for the virus in Iran which is among the hardest hit and least-trusted countries for reporting.Experts analyzed the imagery alongside social media posts and open source material to determine that the number of deaths is being underreported. Videos unearthed by the BBC's Persian service show workers dressed in blue protective gear carrying and burying bodies while a narrator says: \"More than 80 [people] have been buried in this section so far, and they say only 34 deaths.\"The videos were published and first reported in The New York Times and analyzed by The Washington Post, along with satellite images from Maxar Technologies.\"The video showed workers in protective gear that you would expect for COVID-19 victims,\" said Jeffery Lewis, an analyst at the Middlebury Institute. \"What the satellite images allowed us to do was authenticate the video, saying not only that it was taken here but also when it was taken. So, we know this isn't old footage, but rather footage from this pandemic.\"An analyst for Maxar told the Washington Post the large holes were dug quickly, which was different than past practices at the cemetery. A large pile of lime is also seen, which Iranian officials have used when burying virus victims.     US intelligence satellite capabilities far exceed those of commercial companies so it's safe to assume they have come to the same conclusion.Iran is of particular concern because of its central location in Asia and the Middle East, a destination for religious pilgrims and migrant laborers who then travel back to their countries of origin. Iranian forces are deeply involved in the war in Syria where the country's decimated health care system, combined with its long-suffering and displaced populations, make it a ripe target for the virus. Neighboring Lebanon, where Iran also has a heavy hand and presence through the militant group Hezbollah, was already in a state of crisis after months of protest before the virus hit. Hezbollah fighters move back and forth between Lebanon and Syria where they are helping Iran prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.In countries like Iran and North Korea where it's more difficult to gather human intelligence through spies, intelligence agencies will lean harder on other tools, like signals intelligence. Critical to understanding how a country is dealing with the crisis is tapping into their conversations, a task that would fall to the National Security Agency. The prevalence of social media has made that a crucial tool for analysts using the constellation of data streams to create a fuller picture.\"The art form here is melding the various sources into an assessment which will vary from country to country,\" said Clapper.Staying silent Largely silent no matter what is happening, intelligence agencies have said nothing publicly about their work to support the US government's efforts to fight the virus. One of the few ways they do communicate with the public about their priorities and analysis is through an annual unclassified report called the Worldwide Threat Assessment.Last January, the report warned that \"the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.\"Intelligence officials ask Congress not to hold threats hearings after angering Trump last yearNow, with the pandemic gripping the globe, the 2020 edition of the report has yet to come out and the intelligence community has pushed back on holding the open hearings that would traditionally accompany it before the House and Senate intelligence committees. After last year's hearing angered the President and he tweeted that his intelligence chiefs should \"go back to school,\" there has been no appetite among intelligence officials to do anything that could make them and their work a target for the president.It also comes amid turmoil at the top of the community, with President Donald Trump installing his inexperienced ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, as his acting Director of National Intelligence.On Thursday, ODNI announced that Grenell is reviewing staffing and initiating a hiring freeze, reviving fears he plans to rid its upper ranks of intelligence professionals deemed insufficiently loyal to the president.\"Acting DNI Grenell has emphasized with ODNI leadership this review is not an effort to purge, as some have erroneously suggested,\" said spokesperson Amanda Schoch. \"The goal is to make sure scarce Intelligence Community resources are used in the best way possible.\"",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)When the inspector general for the intelligence community alerted lawmakers to a mysterious whistleblower complaint detailing allegations about President Donald Trump's conduct, many who know him, including some who are skeptical of the complaint, said his reputation and credibility caused them to take his concerns seriously.Michael Atkinson, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\"As soon as I saw that he had recommended it be sent to Congress, that's all I needed to know it was legit,\" said Mary McCord, the senior litigator from Practice at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who worked with Atkinson at the US Attorney's Office and DOJ's National Security Division.  Several officials who acknowledged they are skeptical of the complaint told CNN the IC IG, Michael Atkinson, is a serious professional and that his recommendation gives them pause when they would have been inclined to dismiss the case otherwise. Atkinson is widely regarded as a career non-partisan with little interest in the public limelight but he currently finds himself at the center of the high profile controversy related to whether the whistleblower complaint.Schiff vows to investigate whistleblower complaint 'come hell or high water'His recommendation that the complaint, which Atkinson says raised allegations of \"urgent concern,\" be shared with lawmakers has fueled the escalating standoff between the director of national intelligence and Congress while Trump has continued to publicly question the whistleblower's motives for speaking out. Read MoreBut Atkinson has stood by his conclusion that the complaint indeed raises concerns that must be handed over to Congress in accordance with the law, despite clashing with his own boss, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, over that determination. The House Intelligence Committee released a letter from Atkinson last week in which he wrote that he and Maguire, \"are at an impasse\" over that point, marking an unprecedented disagreement between the DNI and IC IG. \"This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation, and the IG underscored the seriousness of this, and also that this needs to be looked into. And right now, no one is looking into this,\" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Friday.Appointed as IC IG by Trump in 2018, Atkinson's long-standing reputation as a straight-shooter with professional integrity has bolstered the legitimacy of the whistleblower complaint despite the President's attempts to paint it as a partisan attack, multiple sources have told CNN. Credible sense of urgency Prior to his Senate confirmation to become IC IG in 2018, Atkinson worked for the Justice Department for over 15 years, according to his biography on the ODNI website. From 2002 through 2006, Atkinson worked as a trial attorney in DOJ's Criminal Division, Fraud Section. He then served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 2006 through 2016, where he was the acting chief and deputy chief of the Fraud and Public Corruption Section.  Some of Atkinson's former colleagues agreed that his credentials as a non-partisan and relative obscurity prior to becoming involved in the whistleblower case lend weight to the seriousness of the complaint.White House also involved in advising DNI not to share whistleblower complaintAtkinson brought several major cases to the US Attorney's Office that were \"the result of thorough, quiet investigation,\" according to McCord, who served as the acting Assistant Attorney General for National Security at DOJ from 2016 to 2017 and Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division from 2014 to 2016. That quiet, non-partisan approach to his work is why McCord believed he would be a good fit for the IC IG role.\"The mere fact he was not on anyone's radar is points to the fact that his sense of urgency is credible,\" she said. \"People don't know who he is and that's because he does his job. He's the IG and most of that work is not in the public sphere.\"\"You would not know which political party he favors by working with him. I worked with him for years. That's the other reason I feel he's so credible in this space,\" McCord added.  Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's National Security Division, John Carlin, told CNN that Atkinson is \"someone who is very deliberate, thoughtful and tries to carefully review facts ... not someone who seeks attention.\" \"So if he is in a situation where something needed to be referred that's because it was his best and informed view of what the law required,\" he said. Not backing down?McCord told CNN that she believes Atkinson feels strongly that the complaint needs to be reported to Congress but is also trying to respect the hierarchy in place, which includes the DNI. During a closed-door briefing with Schiff's committee on Thursday, Atkinson would only discuss the process for his handling of the whistleblower's concerns, the chairman said. Though lawmakers pressed him for details on the complaint, their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.The inspector general does not have the authority to discuss the details of the complaint with Congress because the DNI has not shared the actual report with the committee and had apparently not otherwise authorized Atkinson to share those details.Trump at center of new intelligence storm as whistleblower mystery explodesAlthough the official details of the complaint have not been provided to members of Congress, Atkinson told the panel during the briefing that it raised concerns about multiple actions but would not say if those instances involved Trump, according to sources familiar with the briefing.According to one source, Atkinson referenced \"a sequence of events\" and \"alleged actions\" that took place. However, another source disputed that the IG provided substantive details regarding the whistleblower claim. The whistleblower's complaint deals at least in part with a July call between Trump and Ukraine's president. CNN has previously reported that Trump pressed Zelensky in the call to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Zelensky but has denied doing anything improper. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.While Trump and some Congressional Republicans have attempted to downplay concerns surrounding the complaint, McCord told CNN that she does not see Atkinson backing down from his position. \"If he got to a position where he saw resigning as the only alternative, he would do it ... but there is a lot of space between now and that point,\" McCord added, noting that Maguire is still expected to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.

When N95 respirators are in short supply, VHA staff performing low-risk care on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients may use surgical masks,\" the memo states.   It also asserts that VA PPE levels are consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, but makes clear the department was continuing to work toward securing additional equipment like masks in order to avoid more serious shortfalls.Veterans Affairs denies reports of face mask shortages at hospitalsThe memo undercuts public denials made by the VA just days earlier when agency communications officials called reports that the department was telling hospitals to decide which staff will receive face masks amid a shortage of PPE \"extremely misleading.\"Read More\"All VA employees who need PPE have it,\" a department spokesperson said on April 11, noting that the department was following CDC guidelines.  Asked about the memo CNN has obtained, the VA now acknowledges that it has needed to conserve supplies and says it is doing so in accordance with CDC guidelines.\"As America responds to a national emergency the likes of which the nation hasn't seen since 1918, every health care system is taking steps to conserve PPE. VA is no different,\" department spokesperson Christina Noel told CNN Tuesday. \"CDC guidance states that 'All U.S. healthcare facilities should begin using PPE contingency strategies now,' and VA is currently adhering to CDC's contingency capacity posture for PPE use.\"\"VA's PPE conservation posture is precisely why the department has not encountered any PPE shortages that have negatively impacted patient care or employee safety,\" Noel continued. \"VA is monitoring the supply levels at every facility every day to make sure facilities have adequate PPE for the number and types of patients they are seeing. And if a facility were to fall below stock levels, the facility could be cross-leveled by another VA facility or region.\"VA staff from around the country have continued to raise concerns about limited access to PPE, prompting lawmakers to demand information related to the department's supply levels. Veterans Affairs' staffing shortage raises concerns amid coronavirus outbreakStaff at several VA facilities across the country have told CNN they have continued to experience PPE shortages in the days since the memo was sent, with some saying as recently as this weekend that the problem persists. The staffers requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.The memo backs up the claims.\"VHA staff directly involved with the care of Community Living Center (CLC), Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders (SCI/D), and inpatient mental health patients will be provided with one facemask or surgical mask a day to protect the residents. Current supply levels do not support providing a mask to all VHA staff,\" it states.The memo also acknowledges the challenge of obtaining additional supplies due to the \"disrupted global supply chain\" and urges directors to plan accordingly. \"Plans should include scenarios that permit extended mask use, permit limited re-use, permit staff to bring in their own facemasks and N95 respirators, and allow decontamination of used N95 respirators,\" it says. \"The re-use of decontaminated masks should only be used under crisis scenarios.\"Nineteen VA employees have died so far from Covid-19 and more than 1,500 have tested positive.The department is also working to procure additional PPE from other agencies and commercial producers -- an effort that has ramped up since the April 16 memo was sent.Noel told CNN that FEMA provided the VA with 500,000 masks this week. On April 16, the department also awarded a $74,000 contract to the company MyPillow to produce additional cloth masks, according to a purchase order first reported by Politico. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is a close ally of President Donald Trump.",

And then they said hey wait, we're trying to take a look at the demand that's required, and so we were asked to just wait while there was just some sorting through on that. And I won't speak on behalf of them, but we were in a position to provide 2,000,\" said Lt. General Giovanni Tuck.Tuck said he had no details on the HHS decisions, but added that \"we haven't provided any, because as of last night, we were asked to just hold on the ones that we have, and then we will push them when they're ready for them.\"Commander of aircraft carrier hit by coronavirus outbreak asks Navy for more supportHe emphasized there are 1,000 ventilators fully ready to be shipped as soon as the Pentagon gets a destination of where to send them. The other 1,000 can also be assembled and shipped within days of getting the order he indicated.Read MoreThe uncertainty comes as health experts continue to say there is a serious need for more respirators and ventilators to deal with the surge of coronavirus patients at hospitals across the country. Medical professionals have also asked for help related to testing for the virus but several days after Pentagon officials offered to assist in this area, it remains unclear if they have begun to do so. Civilian Pentagon officials had repeatedly said they are making ventilators and five million N-95 respirator masks available. So far only 1.5 million masks have been shipped by the Pentagon. Another 500,000 are to be shipped within days. But HHS and FEMA have given DoD no indication of when or where they precisely want the other three million items to go.  An HHS official told CNN that, \"many of the DOD ventilators are deployable ventilators and require special training while the ventilators in the HHS Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) are the types of ventilators commonly used by US hospitals and are better suited for immediate use.\" The same official pointed out that other ventilators have been deployed with military deployments, like those aboard Navy hospital ships in California and New York who are treating non-Covid-19 patients.FEMA spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow did not comment on the fact that the Pentagon's ventilators have not been deployed but said the government is working to ensure \"ventilators are shipped to the states in the amount needed to manage the immediate crisis. In the case of ventilators, immediate is defined as requirements necessary to sustain life within a 72-hour window.\"On March 17 Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at a briefing that the department is prepared to distribute up to 2,000 ventilators \"as needed.\"\"We are prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2,000 deployable ventilators for use as needed.  These machines are different from their civilian equivalents and require special training to operate, but we are committed to supporting HHS's requirements in any way we can,\" he said at the time. \"The department has made our 14 certified coronavirus testing labs available to test non-DOD personnel as well, and we will soon offer two additional labs for that purpose. We hope this will provide excess capacity to the civilian population,\" Esper added. During that briefing, Esper acknowledged that \"when you look at the numbers of people that are projected that may need ventilators, 2,000 doesn't put much of a dent into it, but we can offer what we have.\"Unclear if Pentagon has tested civiliansAdditionally, it remains unclear if the Pentagon has tested any civilian patients for the virus more than two weeks after Esper said it had offered to do so.\"We are not maxing our capacity in our labs around the world,\" Joint Staff Surgeon Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs said at a Pentagon press conference last week, adding that the Defense Department is currently operating 16 labs capable of conducting the test.US military is not conducting civilian coronavirus tests despite offering to more than a week ago\"We have not received an RFA, a request for assistance, from HHS that I'm aware of,\" he said. \"But we do have capacity in some of our labs. We've identified that to HHS.\"Several hours after the Pentagon said it had not received a request for assistance with testing, HHS told CNN it had since made an \"initial request for assistance\" from the Defense Department.\"HHS has submitted an initial request for assistance to DOD and both departments are in the process of assessing the capabilities to partner on testing,\" the statement from HHS said.CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for an update but has not yet received a response. Meanwhile, the military continues to grapple with an increasing number of positive cases within its ranks.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump was already under fire for freezing aid to Ukraine when a Republican senator set off another alarm bell: If Trump didn't lift the hold now, Ukraine might lose the money altogether.In a phone call on September 11, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman made one last pitch to the President, telling him that with the end of the fiscal year fast approaching, if he didn't act soon there wouldn't be time to get the money out the door, according to six sources familiar with the call. Trump put up his usual defenses with Portman, claiming the US was getting a poor deal in Ukraine and that European allies weren't doing their fair share to help the embattled former Soviet republic, the sources said. But in a move that surprised officials from Washington to Kiev, after months of holding up the money the President finally relented. That evening after his call with Portman, Trump released the funds.   What triggered the President to ultimately release the nearly $400 million in security aid, and how that decision was communicated to other government agencies, is one of the key mysteries that impeachment investigators are trying to unravel. Read MoreThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In the past, it has offered shifting and vague explanations for the freeze. Most recently, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has said the money was released after a budgetary review, though sources tell CNN there is no evidence a review took place.  What is clear however is that in the days leading up to Trump's decision, there was a confluence of significant events. National security adviser John Bolton was fired the day before Trump changed his mind, and White House officials had recently been made aware of a whistleblower complaint that had been filed concerning Trump's behavior toward Ukraine. Trump was also under mounting pressure from several corners to release the money.Portman's call was part of a broader congressional campaign to push Trump to lift the hold on the aid. Vice President Mike Pence -- who was in the room with Trump when he spoke to Portman --  had just returned from a meeting in Poland with Ukraine's new president and was urging Trump to release the money. The President and his top officials were also becoming aware of concerns inside the administration that freezing the funds was improper and could possibly lead to much bigger problems. Trump demanded a Ukraine policy review. Months later, no one will say what happened. On September 9, two days before the call with Portman, Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told Trump that concerns were being raised that the President's actions amounted to a quid pro quo. Around the same time, White House lawyers informed top officials in the West Wing that a member of the intelligence community had filed a formal whistleblower complaint about Trump's Ukraine dealings. Administration officials have tried to pin the delay on government bureaucracy. They have pointed to reviews by national security agencies and another by the Office of Management and Budget to ensure the funds were well-spent. But detailed assessments had already been conducted before Trump froze the funds in June. And there's little indication that any such process took place after Trump placed a hold on the money.   Much like the decision to freeze the aid, the decision to abruptly release it appears to lie squarely with the President.Freezing fundsThe top diplomat to Ukraine, William B. Taylor, Jr., testified this week that he was alarmed by the decision to withold aid to Ukraine.After Trump made the decision to hold-up the money to Ukraine in June, it took months for the news to trickle out in Washington and make its way to Kiev. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, first learned of the freeze from an unidentified voice on a video-conference call on July 18.\"Toward the end of an otherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call\u2014the person was off-screen\u2014said that she was from OMB and that her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for Ukraine until further notice,\" Taylor said in his opening statement to the impeachment committees. \"All that the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB.\" After Trump put a hold on the aid, he directed Defense Secretary Mark Esper and John Bolton to run a policy review of the funds.The Pentagon responded almost immediately with a recommendation to release the money. \"At every meeting the unanimous conclusion was that the security assistance should be resumed, the hold lifted,\" Taylor testified. \"At one point, the Defense Department was asked to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance. Within a day, the Defense Department came back with the determination that the assistance was effective and should be resumed.\"5 explosive lines from Bill Taylor's statement  The Pentagon had just completed a review of the funds, including a corruption check, in May. So it quickly signed off for a second time. As for Bolton, he had approved of aid to Ukraine from the outset and there's no indication he was holding up the funds.Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has continued to raise the idea that a second budgetary review was holding up the money. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Mulvaney claimed that once the administration determined corruption in Ukraine was being addressed, OMB was instructed to research the type of aid that Ukraine gets from other countries. \"It turns out they don't get any lethal aid, but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid,\" Mulvaney told Fox News on Sunday. \"Once those two things were cleared, the money flowed.\" But multiple sources tell CNN there was no second extensive policy review at the budget office, as Mulvaney has suggested. Officials simply pulled the numbers on aid from other countries and waited for word from the White House to release the money, the sources said. Other departments that had already signed off on the money were perplexed by the hold up. For instance, the State Department didn't receive any substantive questions about security assistance from OMB during the months the money was frozen, a Senate source said.  \"At the end of the day it's the President's decision on whether or not to release the money,\" a senior administration official said.A President under pressureJUST WATCHEDJake Tapper breaks down Trump's call with UkraineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJake Tapper breaks down Trump's call with Ukraine 03:37By early September, it was clear what was going on. Diplomats, lawmakers, administration officials and the Ukrainians all knew the money was on ice because Trump had ordered a hold.  Staffers at both the Pentagon and the OMB began to express concern that they could be in legal jeopardy if they failed to spend money that Congress had appropriated by the end of the fiscal year on September 30. In Ukraine, Taylor notified the Ukrainian national security adviser that \"U.S. security assistance was an 'all or nothing' proposition,\" according to his testimony. The funds would expire within a few weeks.  Bipartisan groups of lawmakers began peppering the White House with letters pressing Trump to lift the hold on the funds.For administration officials who wanted the money released, those letters were welcome relief, according to a former senior administration official. Kurt Volker, the US Special Representative for Ukraine who resigned last month, forwarded one of the protest letters to his Ukrainian counterparts to show that efforts were underway to release the money, the source said. House Democrats took their inquiries a step further. On September 9, Democratic members of the House Oversight, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees opened an investigation into whether the President and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, pressured the government of Ukraine to help Trump's reelection campaign.'Forceful, blunt and undiplomatic': the ambassador now at the center of the impeachment probe  \"If the President is trying to pressure Ukraine into choosing between defending itself from Russian aggression without U.S. assistance or leveraging its judicial system to serve the ends of the Trump campaign, this would represent a staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow, and a betrayal of the public trust,\" the committees wrote to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.Meanwhile, others in Trump's circle were beginning to hear that the President may have had other motives for pausing the money: investigations into the Biden family and the 2016 election.Republican Sen. Ron Johnson had heard from Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, that Trump was holding up the money for issues related to US elections. Alarmed, Johnson called Trump on August 31, and inquired about it. Johnson recounted the conversation in an interview with the Wall Street Journal and said the President vehemently denied any sort of quid pro quo.\"He said, 'Expletive deleted\u2014No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?\" Johnson told the Journal.By September 9, other diplomats were catching on. Taylor texted Sondland, \"...I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"Sondland testified that he then called the President directly to ask what he wanted from Ukraine. \"The President responded, 'Nothing. There is no quid pro quo,'\" Sondland said. \"The President repeated: 'no quid pro quo' multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood.\"That same week, Mulvaney and other top White House officials first learned about the whistleblower complaint. While White House lawyers had known about the complaint for weeks, news of its existence was starting to spread within the West Wing. That timing has raised questions about whether knowledge of the complaint influenced Trump's decision to release the money. Though one administration official said it may have merely been coincidental.Pressure had also grown considerably on Capitol Hill, where Democrats were preparing legislation that threatened to strip billions of dollars out of next year's Pentagon budget if the White House did not release the money to Ukraine. A vote on the amendment, sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin, was slated for a vote on Sept. 12. After Trump finally decided to release the funds, the news traveled quickly. Mulvaney notified acting national security adviser Charlie Kupperman, who had replaced the fired Bolton. The decision made its way to the Pentagon, the State Department and to Taylor, in Kiev. He quickly notified Ukrainian officials that the money was coming after all. CNN's Sarah Westwood and Ellie Kaufman contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Lawmakers on Capitol Hill couldn't figure out over this past summer why nearly $400 million in aid they'd voted to go to Ukraine still wasn't in the country's coffers. There was growing speculation by the end of August. Congressional leaders, their aides and members of key committees -- including the Appropriations, Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees -- were scrambling to figure out why money that had been appropriated by Congress months before still hadn't been disbursed. Outreach by lawmakers to key agencies left few clues other than the delay was coming from the White House and no one could pinpoint exactly what the reason was.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell got involved, reaching out to both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper as other members urged action with letters, public statements, floor speeches and staff outreach.\"I have no idea what precipitated the delay, but I was among those advocating that we needed to stick with our Ukrainian friends,\" McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said about his outreach last week. The comment came in a week in which a redacted, whistleblower complaint was released alleging that Trump was trying to elicit dirt from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky about his political rival, Vice President Joe Biden (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe Biden or his son, Hunter). Earlier this month, the White House also released a transcript a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump touts the US support for Ukraine while Trump later asks Zelensky for a favor.Read MoreIn more than a dozen interviews with members of Congress and aides in recent days, many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle say that while they don't remember the exact timeline of when they became aware there was an issue with Ukraine funding, there was a growing sense at the end of August that Congress needed to push the administration harder when it returned from its Augusts recess to release it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN he talked to the Pentagon about the funding multiple times. Impeachment inquiry into Trump will test power of 'fully operational' right-wing media machine\"I called the Pentagon. The Pentagon said that they were worried about the new administration, they were doing their due diligence, they were worried about corruption, they were worried about military aid. They wanted to figure out what was what. I said, 'Fine, just figure it out,' \" Graham said, adding that it wasn't unusual for President Donald Trump not to be keen on foreign aid. \"As to the President, he wants to withhold aid across the board to get people to pay more,\" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican and key congressional ally to Trump, arguing there is no connection between the money and the President trying to get dirt on his potential political opponents. Trump and his supporters on Capitol Hill and at the White House have denied there was any quid pro quo. Instead, Trump's supporters have argued the delay in military funding came out of a fear the administration had about corruption in Ukraine.  Over the summer, Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had his staff making regular phone calls to the State Department while Menendez himself applied public pressure. In a statement on August 29, Menendez said \"in willfully delaying these funds, the Trump Administration is once again trying to circumvent Congress' Constitutional prerogative of appropriating funds for U.S. government agencies. It is also undermining a key policy priority that has broad and deep bipartisan support.\"Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, who planned to travel to Ukraine in the first week of September also released a statement urging the administration to release the money. \"Everything I had heard was that this was a decision made by the President. It was his decision and it was his decision alone,\" Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, told CNN. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rob Portman of Ohio each spoke directly with the President about it as well.Earlier in the summer, most members and aides hadn't raised a red flag on Ukraine aid. The money hadn't been sent out, but given this was an administration where key players had made no secret of how they felt about foreign aid, it wasn't particularly unusual. The President had been open he detested how much the US government sent to countries abroad. It was a refrain of his campaign. And Mick Mulvaney, the President's acting chief of staff and OMB director, who had earned a reputation from his colleagues on the Hill as a take-no-prisoners budget slasher, had been pushing for a rescissions package throughout the summer that would have cut roughly $4 billion in foreign aid. Many members and aides assumed a holdup on Ukraine funding could have something to do with the package. On August 22, news reports indicate Mulvaney and the administration had relented on rescissions, however. And, it was after that fight was over, members began to wonder why military aid to Ukraine still had not gone out. At the end of August, Politico reported millions in military aid to Ukraine was still being slow-walked. A bipartisan priorityLawmakers were struck by the fact that this was money that had already been appropriated with broad bipartisan support. Ukraine military aid was a rare, foreign policy issue that united members of both parties. Supporting the country was widely viewed on Capitol Hill as a way to deter Russian aggression, keep them at bay and secure the region. The fact that the money was being held up and without a clear explanation or briefings about a changing policy prescription in the region, bothered many.While, it wasn't unprecedented for an administration to change course or hold back money if there was an evolving situation in a country they were aiding, it was unusual for members of the relevant committees not to be in the loop on those discussions. \"We would have expected congressional notification that in fact monies were being held, and that would have elicited from us a briefing and normally we would have gotten a briefing,\" Menendez told CNN. He added, \"This is emblematic of this administration in so many ways.\"There were two separate lines of money being held up. There was $250 million in military aid that was appropriated to come from the Department of Defense that had yet to be dispersed and another $140 million that was supposed to come from the State Department. A Democratic Senate aide told CNN last week that the Defense Committees had been alerted by the Department of Defense that they were prepared to send off $125 million in February and then another $125 million in May.A top Pentagon official sent a letter to Congress in May certifying Ukraine was making progress in the fight against corruption justifying the US provide Ukraine with a $250 million military assistance.On June 18, the Pentagon announced plans to provide $250 million to Ukraine in security cooperation funds for additional training, equipment and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's armed forces.Then, nothing, according to a congressional aide and a US official familiar with the correspondence.\"We'd been given signals twice by the administration that they were going to release the funds then nothing happened. In August we were told the OMB is holding it,\" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said. \"They were withholding these funds that had been appropriated and signed into law by the President until the last two weeks of the fiscal year. That's crazy. It hardly ever happens,\"Another Democratic aide told CNN that the State Department notified OMB of their intention to obligate the $141 million in aid to Ukraine on June 21. Typically, that process would have just been a courtesy. OMB would have had up to five days to ask questions about the process. But, instead, it was more than two months before Congress received a notice that the money was being dispersed. State Department officials told Senate staffers in a briefing last week that the department had no objections to the money moving forward and were not aware that OMB had sat on it, according to a Senate source. But officials in the meeting pointed the finger directly at Mulvaney as the person who directed the State Department not to send out the funds.  In the beginning of September, Johnson and Murphy traveled to Ukraine. When they returned, they both talked to Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, about the need to make sure Ukraine got their money. \"I will tell you who brought it up to me was Ron Johnson,\" Durbin said. \"He came back from Ukraine and said 'we gotta get this money released.' And, I said, 'I'll look into it.' \"Murphy would say later about his time in Ukraine that there had been \"near panic\" in the country during his trip about whether America was really committed to their relationship in part because of delayed aid. In the meantime, more senators were catching on to the fact that the money was being held and they pointed their attention at Mulvaney. On September 3, Portman and Johnson along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne  Shaheen of New Hampshire and Richard Blumenthal also of Connecticut -- members of the bipartisan Ukraine caucus -- sent a letter to Mulvaney demanding answers as to what was going on with the money. \"This body has long advocated for increasing the military capacity and capabilities of Ukraine \u2014 a fledgling democracy that is pro-West and pro-United States and since 2014 has been under increased military, political and economic pressure from Russia,\" the senators wrote. In the House, the Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel of New York and the committee's top Republican, Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, sent their own letter to Mulvaney two days later. Finally, there was an opportunity to put the Trump administration on the spot. A little-noticed committee vote Durbin had been working on an amendment, which would hold back money to the Pentagon if the administration didn't spend military aid money for Ukraine on time. He'd been talking with one very concerned Republican about it: Lindsey Graham. On September 12, the Senate Appropriations Committee gaveled into their Defense Appropriations markup hearing. The routine session was mired with fireworks over the President's campaign promise of a border wall between the US and Mexico, but the meeting made news for another reason.Graham announced the Trump administration had finally released the military aid for Ukraine. There was no longer any reason for Durbin to offer his amendment. \"Why was it released? Because of your amendment,\" Graham told the committee. \"That is why it was released because I was going to vote for it ... If you are listening in Ukraine on C-SPAN, you are going to get the money.\"Graham pushed for Durbin to drop his amendment. \"We can call the Secretary of Defense at any time we want to about 2020 funds and say, 'When are you going to release the funds to the Ukraine? If you have a legitimate problem, tell us now.' If they give us the run-around, count me in on a bill that will get 90 votes,\" Graham said.Durbin spoke anyway, flirting with the idea he'd still force the committee to vote on his amendment that would put pressure on the administration to spend Ukraine aid money in the next fiscal year or face consequences.But, multiple Republicans also chimed in that they were concerned about the money having been withheld. Sen. Susan  Collins, a Republican from Maine, said she was \"inclined\" to vote for the amendment because \"I think it has been a problem that the money has not been released.\"Louisiana GOP Sen. John Kennedy asked multiple times, \"Mr. Chairman I would like to ask Sen. Durbin and Sen. Murphy why they think the funds were held up. \"Durbin responded, \"We don't know.\"Durbin withdrew the amendment, which he said at the time was an act of good faith. Less than two weeks later, Democrats across Capitol Hill including Durbin announced support for the House's official impeachment inquiry.CNN's Ellie Kaufman, Zachary Cohen, Ali Zaslav, Phil Mattingly, Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",

One of the sources tell CNN that Pompeo was alerted to internal and external concerns about Giuliani's effort to push out Yovanovitch, but Pompeo failed to act -- he was wary of getting too deeply involved over fears of derailing US-Ukraine policy and potentially sharing the fate of his former colleague John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser who was fired for not being aligned with the President.In a letter sent in the spring, which has not been previously reported, a handful of former US ambassadors to Ukraine urged top State Department officials to take action and defend Yovanovitch. They got a response from one of Pompeo's closest senior officials, Counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl, saying the message had been received and would be considered.Yet Pompeo did nothing and less than two months later, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post at the behest of Trump.Read MorePompeo's apparent choice not to put guardrails between State officials and Giuliani has come under scrutiny by House Democrats who are bent on learning as much as they can about what exactly Pompeo knew of Giuliani's dealings. In recent interviews, Pompeo has declined to answer questions about Giuliani's entanglement in the administration's Ukraine policy. He was however aware of it. In March, Pompeo received a packet from Giuliani containing unfounded claims about Yovanovitch, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter regarding their dealings in Ukraine.Giuliani has claimed Pompeo spoke with him to confirm the packet had been received and that he was passing along the information for an investigation. It is unclear if Pompeo actually did share the packet with the Department of Justice. Pompeo's deputy, Brechbuhl, did pass it to the State Department's inspector general.Pompeo has had to accept the resignation of two top State Department officials, Kurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, who resigned last month, and Michael McKinley, his hand-picked senior adviser, who quit last week. Both have testified to Congress despite the State Department's refusal to comply with subpoena requests.The State Department did not return CNN requests for comment. Mounting criticism about his handling of the matter has left the Secretary of State feeling victimized, according to those familiar with his thinking.\"He has been very disappointed,\" explained one of the sources who spoke with Pompeo. \"He feels that with these departures, the actual good work on Ukraine policy has come to a halt.\"Keeping his distanceUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has faced criticism for not defending former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.As a string of State Department officials have testified on Capitol Hill, Pompeo has stayed away from Washington and kept a packed foreign schedule. He was visiting with the Pope in Italy when Volker voluntarily testified to Congress. And this week he traveled to Turkey for talks on Syria with Vice President Mike Pence as even more State Department officials testified.Despite his efforts to distance himself, the continued testimony from current State Department officials has drawn Pompeo closer into the controversy.In his prepared statement on Thursday, US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland aligned himself with career diplomats and passed responsibility for his role in the situation to political players, including Trump and Pompeo.What House investigators have learned after two weeks of Ukraine interviewsSondland said that Pompeo was aware of all his efforts on Ukraine policy and set him to work on the country from his first day on the job, despite the fact that Ukraine is not a member country of the EU. Sondland said Pompeo even sent him a recent congratulatory note, saying that he was \"doing great work,\" and to \"keep banging away.\"Pompeo has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry.Former State Department senior adviser McKinley also testified Wednesday that he repeatedly asked Pompeo for a show of support for Yovanovitch -- and as Pompeo remained silent, he never explained his reasoning. McKinley had grown close with Pompeo over the last two years and was recruited into the top post by the secretary. McKinley told lawmakers that Pompeo's decision not to offer Yovanovitch support was a key reason for his decision to resign last week.However, a source close to Pompeo pushed back on the way that McKinley told the story, telling CNN, \"I think (McKinley) knew damn well that Pompeo was trying to help her.\"Despite what he may have been doing behind the scenes, Pompeo ultimately failed to intervene or speak out publicly on Yovanovitch's behalf before or after she was recalled. In fact, it seems Pompeo attempted to distance himself even further from the controversy in the heat of the moment. He did not tell Yovanovitch exactly what was happening when she got the sudden message to get on the next plane back to the US, she told lawmakers.The guardrails are off the Trump presidency Yovanovitch told Congress that upon her return to Washington it was John Sullivan, the Deputy Secretary of State at the time, who met with her to break the news she would not be going back to Ukraine as the US ambassador.Some former State Department officials felt Pompeo was somewhat justified in not publicly defending Yovanovitch. \"She was treated badly but she could have been treated worse. She could have been fired and sacked from the State Department but that did not happen,\" John Herbst, a former US Ambassador to Ukraine and expert at the Atlantic Council, told CNN.\"I understand foreign service officers who wanted him to shout from a rooftop that the accusations against her were unfounded and she was a great Ambassador. I would have liked to see that. But maybe he was not sure that he could do that and retain his job or influence,\" he said.Broader implications Critics argue that by not saying anything to defend Yovanovitch, Pompeo has sided with a foreign disinformation campaign built on false narratives dealing with Ukraine amplified by Giuliani, Trump and sources of Russian propaganda.\"The lack of support has broader implications,\" said Steve Pfifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine under President Bill Clinton, and currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Pompeo's decision not to defend Yovanovitch, intentionally or not, sent a message to the world, Pfifer said. \"The word is that if you have an American ambassador and he or she is problematic, put out some information, get it to Rudy Giuliani that this ambassador bad-mouthed the President.\"While CNN's fact-checkers have largely discredited the unfounded claims about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, related to their dealings with Ukraine, it's challenging to determine their origin. It seems that Trump, Giuliani and Kremlin-backed media have engaged in parallel processes of using this information as part of a broader strategy of denying everything by blaming anyone else, said Bret Schafer from Alliance for Securing Democracy.A whistleblower complaint regarding Trump's dealings with Ukraine, which was released publicly last month, alleged Trump \"is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election\" and labeled Giuliani as a \"central figure\" in the plot.The transcript of Trump's July 25 phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- that was also released to the public -- showed Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Giuliani was discussed, according to the transcript, with Trump telling the Ukrainian president at one point, \"I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call.\"Pompeo admitted, about a week after the phone call's transcript was released, that he was on that call. And in recent interviews he has repeatedly defended Trump's conversation as entirely appropriate. George Kent, a State Department official who focused on Ukraine, told lawmakers Tuesday that his superior, assistant secretary for European Affairs Philip Reeker, told him to \"lay low\" when he raised concerns about Giuliani.Now, Congress has requested to hear from Reeker. It is unclear if Pompeo told top State Department officials not to raise concerns about Giuliani or the removal of Yovanovitch.Pompeo defends the PresidentJUST WATCHEDPompeo tells reporter she 'has her facts wrong'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPompeo tells reporter she 'has her facts wrong' 02:21The testimony from McKinley this week showed Pompeo has kept a tight hold on his thinking throughout this controversy, even with those he is closely engaged with.Meanwhile, in the last few weeks, the State Department has fallen in line with the White House in not complying in part with the impeachment inquiry. 'Forceful, blunt and undiplomatic': the ambassador now at the center of the impeachment probe  Ambassador Sondland's lawyer explained in a letter to congressional committees that Sondland and others in his position have been prevented from providing documents to Congress because the State Department \"asserted that disclosure of these materials may implicate executive privilege, confidentiality, and other constitutional interests of the executive branch.\"The failure to release pertinent documents to Congress raises questions about what details they provide regarding Pompeo's awareness and actions on the specific developments. Mulvaney brashly admits quid pro quo over Ukraine aid as key details emerge -- and then denies doing so As the State Department has stopped working with Congress due to orders from the White House, Pompeo himself continues to defend Trump. He has called the Ukraine impeachment inquiry a conspiracy theory to take down the President. But there will be new questions about conversations regarding quid pro quo in the coming days given the pronouncement by acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in a news conference Thursday that the US withheld military aid from Ukraine in hopes of securing a promise that the foreign government would look into the possible presence of the physical Democratic National Committee server hacked by the Russians in 2016.Pompeo, whose department oversees a hefty amount of that assistance to Ukraine, was also asked last month if it would be a problem if there were a quid pro quo arrangement. Pompeo said it is his job to be sure that foreign assistance is \"completely appropriate\" and that \"American taxpayer dollars are used appropriately.\"CNN's Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

        "images": [],
        "content": "(CNN)The nine-page whistleblower complaint released Thursday morning amounts to pouring jet fuel on the already-raging fire of whether or not President Donald Trump sought to use his office to further his personal political agenda in a series of interactions between his administration and the Ukrainians.Much of what is in the complaint is somewhat subjective and not based on firsthand knowledge, facts that could allow Republicans to poke holes in it as nothing more than a political hack job.\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nNotice, however, that I said \"much\" of the complaint fits into this category. Not \"all\" of the complaint. And not one set of facts -- or alleged facts -- in particular. Here it is, in the words of the whistleblower, detailing the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky:\"In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple US officials that senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced -- as is customary -- by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.Read More\"White House officials told me that they were 'directed' by White House lawyers to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.\"Instead, the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature. One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\"Wow.Here's why that allegation from the whistleblower matters SO much and has the potential to directly threaten Trump's presidency:1) If true, it makes clear that there was a concerted effort by the Trump White House to cover up the conversation because they knew that what Trump had said and done was so problematic. That's a far cry from Trump's description of the call as \"perfect\" and totally normal.2) Either the transcript of the call is in the \"computer system where such transcripts are typically stored\" or it isn't. Ditto the allegation that the transcript was put into a separate electronic system reserved for classified information. Where the transcript was placed is not a subjective judgment. And it is something that should be find-out-able. Now, my guess is that if it turns out the transcript was placed in the electronic system for classified information, the Trump side's pushback will be that it was done so because there was classified information in it. But that runs counter to the transcript of the call released by the White House on Wednesday and Trump's repeated claims that the call was a total nothing-burger. (\"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call,\" he tweeted about it earlier this week.)In short: The allegation in the whistleblower report of a coverup over the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky matters so incredibly much not only because it alleges that forces within the White House knew how bad it was and acted to try to keep it from getting out. But also -- and this is the truly important part -- that there seems a high likelihood that there is an electronic paper trail that can either confirm (or not) the whistleblower's claim.If it is proven that the transcript of the call was purposely siloed -- and the classified categorization was misused to keep the conversation from ever reaching the public -- the Trump presidency could be genuinely imperiled. When it comes to a Senate impeachment trial, the political breakdown of the chamber is on Trump's side, for now. But could this change that? We're not there yet, but that coverup claim in the whistleblower's report provides a roadmap of how we might end up there.",

Those talks have been stalled, even as Pyongyang has pursued technical improvements to its program that increasingly could put the US within range of its rockets.Asked about recent comments and indicators from North Korea that Pyongyang may be getting closer to a long-range missile test or some other provocative act, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A new satellite image obtained by CNN indicates North Korea may be preparing to resume testing engines used to power satellite launchers and intercontinental ballistic missiles at a site President Donald Trump previously claimed was dismantled after his Singapore summit with dictator Kim Jong Un, according to experts who analyzed the photo.  The commercial satellite imagery, which was captured on Thursday by Planet Labs, shows new activity at Sohae Satellite Launching Station and the presence of a large shipping container at the facility's engine test stand, according Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute, which works in partnership with the imaging company.The shipping container was not seen at the site before Thursday and its presence suggests the North Koreans are moving to resume tests engine tests at Sohae, Lewis told CNN. The Pentagon and CIA did not immediately offer comment when asked about analysis related to the image.North Korea revives 'dotard' insult after Trump's 'Rocket Man' comment 'displeased' Kim Jong UnWhile engine tests are considered to be less provocative than those involving missiles or satellites, Lewis said that the activity at Sohae is a significant development and a step toward weapons launches of a more threatening nature. Read MoreThe timing of renewed activity at Sohae also sends a clear message to Trump after a foreign ministry official said earlier this week that Pyongyang was preparing a \"Christmas gift,\" for Washington, but warned that the present the Trump administration will receive depends on events in the coming days.That ominous threat has appeared to escalate tensions between the two countries.Trump dubbed a 'dotard'A senior member of the North Korean government again described Trump as a \"dotard\" Thursday after the US President revived the war words with Kim Jong Un by calling the North Korean leader \"Rocket Man.\"Speaking of the North Korean leader at the NATO summit in London on Tuesday, Trump said: \"He really likes sending rockets up, doesn't he? That's why I call him Rocket Man.\" Trump added that he and Kim have \"a good relationship.\"Choe Son Hui, North Korea's First Vice-Foreign Minister, was quoted by North Korea's state news agency as saying the foreign ministry \"can not repress displeasure over the utterances made by President Trump inappropriately at the most sensitive time.\"North Korea's UN ambassador says denuclearization is off the table in talks with USChoe added: \"If any language and expressions stoking the atmosphere of confrontation are used once again on purpose at a crucial moment as now, that must really be diagnosed as the relapse of the dotage of a dotard.\"The statement on Thursday is the latest in a series of increasingly dire warnings by North Korea, and recalls the strong language between the two leaders that escalated in 2017, before a landmark meeting the following year in Singapore.Tests would break agreement reached at summitResuming engine tests at Sohae would also carry symbolic meaning as it was the site North Korea agreed to dismantle after the summit in Singapore.At a press conference after their meeting, Trump said Kim had agreed to destroy \"a major missile engine testing site.\"\"That was not in your agreement,\" Trump told reporters at the time. \"I got that after we signed the agreement. I said, 'Do me a favor. You've got this missile engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat.' It's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you. I said, can you close it up?' He's going to close it up.\"North Korea did dismantle the test stand at Sohae but reassembled it March 2019, according to Lewis. \"Still, we had not seen activity at the site until today,\" he said. The move is consistent with North Korea's recent announcements suggesting it intends to move forward with those tests, Lewis added. Diplomats from Pyongyang and Washington have been attempting to negotiate a trade that would see Kim give up the country's nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles used to deliver them in exchange for relief from punishing US and United Nations sanctions that have crippled the North Korean economy.Though North Korea first detonated a nuclear device in 2006, Pyongyang successfully test-fired missiles that could potentially hit the US mainland with a nuclear warhead for the first time in 2017 -- upping the stakes significantly and increasing the urgency to reach a peaceful solution to a decades-long struggle.North Korea has this year continually blamed the US for the lack of progress in nuclear negotiations, singling out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Adviser John Bolton for censure. However, Pyongyang has made a notable effort not to criticize Trump and has emphasized the importance of the two leaders' relationship.Even if Trump was joking when he brought back a favorite nickname he used before his budding friendship with Kim, indications that North Korea is ready to resume testing at Sohae is only fueling concerns that the President may have been playing with fire.CNN's Josh Berlinger contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said Tuesday that new images indicate North Korea has begun dismantling \"a key missile site\" -- a step he says was promised by dictator Kim Jong Un after the two leaders met in Singapore last month.\"New images just today show that North Korea has begun the process of dismantling a key missile site, and we appreciate that,\" Trump said, an apparent reference to images of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station published Monday by the prominent monitoring group 38 North.Those images, captured between July 20 and July 22, show North Korea has indeed started to dismantle key facilities at the satellite launch station, a move analysts said represents \"an important first step towards fulfilling a commitment\" made by Kim during his summit with Trump.US intel agency believes Kim won't fully denuclearize\"Since these facilities are believed to have played an important role in the development of technologies for the North's intercontinental ballistic missile program, these efforts represent a significant confidence-building measure on the part of North Korea,\" according to 38 North's Joseph Bermudez Jr.\"Most notably, these include the rail-mounted processing building -- where space launch vehicles are assembled before moving them to the launchpad -- and the nearby rocket engine test stand used to develop liquid-fuel engines for ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles.\" Read MoreSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also said Tuesday that reports of missile engine test facility dismantlement in North Korea are \"entirely consistent\" with the commitment Kim made to Trump in Singapore, and the US has pushed for inspectors to be present.Asked about furthers steps North Korea should take, Pompeo said, \"They need to completely, fully de-nuclearize. That's the steps that Chairman Kim committed to and that the world has demanded through UN Security Council resolutions. It's that straightforward.\"Both Trump and Pompeo, have been urging patience since the President held a historic summit with Kim in Singapore last month but the President has privately expressed frustration over the perceived lack of progress in talks, a US official told CNN.

It's also troubling that North Korea has apparently been allowed to dodge verification at both Punggye-ri and Sohae. That will have to be fixed for subsequent agreements,\" Mount added. And while Monday's images may amount to a \"confidence building measure\" by the North Koreans, it appears that they expect the US to reciprocate if talks are to continue.  CNN reported on Monday that continued negotiations between the two sides hinge on Washington's willingness to make a \"bold move\" and agree to a peace treaty with Pyongyang, according to an official with close knowledge of North Korea's position on the matter.North Korea wants US to make 'bold move' towards peace before denuclearization, source saysIf the US is unwilling to replace the armistice agreement that ended the Korean War with a permanent peace that would ensure the survival of Kim's regime, Pyongyang will likely not proceed further with denuclearization talks, the source said.Meanwhile, US Democrats in Congress remain largely in the dark on the administration's plans with regards to a path forward with North Korea and skepticism over Kim's intentions.Ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez told CNN on Monday he hopes Pompeo can provide answers when he testifies on Capitol Hill this week. \"We all want diplomacy to succeed, so I am interested to hear more from Secretary Pompeo this Wednesday on his views on this development -- and if he considers this to be significant,\" the New Jersey Democrat said in reference to the images published Monday. Satellite images show North Korea upgrading nuclear facility \"The fact of the matter is that last year, on President Trump's watch, North Korea made significant advances in its ballistic missile technology, achieving what many experts agree is a nuclear-capable operational ICBM,\" Menendez added. \"I want to hear from the secretary how and if this action by North Korea is integrated into a cogent and coherent diplomatic framework that gets us to complete and verifiable dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs,\" he told CNN.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Long-simmering tensions between top figures on President Donald Trump's national security team have devolved into all-out hostility, creating a deep disconnect between staffers on the National Security Council, led by John Bolton, and the rest of the administration, six people familiar with the matter said.While there's been friction between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for months, as CNN first reported in May, things have gotten worse recently. Bolton and Pompeo rarely speak outside of formal meetings, three of the sources said, including a recent stretch of going weeks without speaking to one another. That has left key coordination efforts between the White House and State Department to underlings. There's also a rift between Bolton and Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who oversees the West Wing. Mulvaney has clashed with Bolton over ideological differences in recent months and sought to distance himself from the embattled national security adviser.Mulvaney has even added a national security expert to his team and made him an assistant to the President, the highest-ranking title in the West Wing. The expert, Rob Blair, joined Mulvaney from the Office of Management and Budget in January, and allows Mulvaney to have a hand in national security without going through Bolton.Trump hasn't indicated whether he minds the dispute underway among his team. In fact, he's said in the past that he tends to enjoy when his aides are at odds with each other.Read MoreBut the current situation has led to a deep sense of isolation for NSC staffers working under Bolton, who are charged with coordinating foreign policy and national security options for the President. The internal rift has only added to the sense of confusion about the administration's foreign policy priorities, and left some allies and experts scratching their heads about who is running Trump's policy abroad, according to diplomats and administration officials.\"The administration's national security team is the weakest in decades and is now on the verge of complete collapse,\" said Tom Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Meanwhile, the President just goes rogue, making vital decisions on the fly, with little thought or process.\"Tensions rise between Pompeo and Bolton Given the number of foreign policy problems facing the country, including Iran, North Korea, China and Venezuela, multiple White House officials expressed dismay that the relationship between a secretary of state and national security adviser could disintegrate to this extent. Still, administration sources contacted by CNN were defensive about issues related to foreign policy and denied that there is a rift between Pompeo and Bolton, or that they rarely speak outside formal meetings. \"This is false and your reporting is frivolous,\" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said.\"Nearly everything in this article is false,\" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said.\"Can we get away from the palace intrigue and focus on something that matters -- like perhaps today's opioids announcement?\" said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.Former alliesOnce closely aligned on tactics and ideology, Pompeo and Bolton no longer meet privately to hatch plans and devise ways to approach the President, multiple people familiar with the change in their dynamic said. While their views on Iran and North Korea remain largely in sync, they have sharply diverged on how to handle a president who is often at odds with their advice.Pompeo, who joined the Trump administration as CIA director before being tapped as the chief diplomat, has developed closer ties to Trump than perhaps any other member of the Cabinet, according to administration officials. His skill has been in anticipating and maneuvering around Trump's whims, the officials said, in ways that Bolton hasn't been as adept at navigating.Whereas Pompeo tends to strike a balance between what the President wants and what the national security community feels is important, Bolton is more combative and outspoken in his views, a style that has irked the President in recent months. Mike Pompeo talks with  John Bolton before a in  Rose Garden news conference in June 2018. When Bolton was first hired by Trump last March, he was empowered to revamp the National Security Council. He downgraded positions he felt were unnecessary and filled others with loyalists, some of whom have worked for him for decades. He met regularly with the President privately, and when he wasn't in the Oval Office, he often got together with Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence. The three men were \u2014 and remain \u2014 ideologically aligned, and often combined forces to sway the President. Bolton sidelinedIn recent months however, that dynamic has changed dramatically. Trump has made clear that Bolton's interventionalist views will not outweigh his own isolationist instincts, including in the Middle East. In remarks from the Oval Office in May, Trump told reporters, \"I actually temper John, which is pretty amazing.\"Privately, he has warned Bolton to tone down his rhetoric and remember the promises Trump has made to end foreign wars. Trump has also told other people, including foreign leaders, that Bolton's hawkish views do not always represent his own, according to multiple sources familiar with those conversations.Last week, the Washington Post reported that Bolton had been sidelined as top officials prepared for negotiations with the Taliban. Bolton's staunch opposition to a peace deal irritated the President, who has made clear that he wants to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2020.A source close to Bolton told CNN that even if he has been sidelined on Afghanistan by State Department officials for the moment, he is still voicing his criticism directly to the President.Leaving John Bolton out of key Trump meetings is strange Bolton and other advisers who are fiercely critical of the terms of an emerging deal with the Taliban, believe that despite his fundamental desire to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan that Trump remains amenable to changing his mind if additional information is presented in a certain way, a source familiar with the President's thinking said. Meanwhile, Pompeo and his envoy leading the negotiations, Zalmay Khalilzad, remain focused on securing a peace deal, which would reduce the number of US troops in Afghanistan from roughly 14,000 to 8,000, aligning with the President's own stated goal of withdrawal.  More broadly, the same source close to Bolton maintains that the national security adviser's professional ambitions have little impact on how he operates in his current role, noting that he continues to offer the President his unfiltered opinion even when it does not align with Trump's inherent views. However, this source added that Bolton fully understands that his job is to execute Trump's agenda.Bolton accepted the role of national security adviser with the understanding that it could be his last opportunity to affect change from inside an administration, multiple sources have told CNN, and that at his core, Bolton's decision-making is motivated by ideological principles rather than personal ambition.  John Bolton and Mike Pompeo at the White House in October 2018. Pompeo now avoids Bolton, sources who have observed them say, and does his best to distinguish his approach to Trump from Bolton's, even if their advice often mirrors one another's. Administration sources point to a recent national security meeting as an example of how Pompeo has distanced himself from Bolton.As Trump huddled with his national security team earlier this summer over whether to proceed with a planned retaliatory strike on Iran, the debate between military advisers and congressional leaders at times became intense, but Bolton, Pompeo and Pence agreed: Trump should strike. Multiple people familiar with the President's thinking said the entire episode wavered from on-again to off-again strikes, but after Trump's reversal that evening, Pompeo and his allies reacted mutedly and insisted they were on board with the President's decision.Political ambitionsThough Pompeo has publicly denied that he's running for Senate in Kansas next year, people close to him have said the option is still on the table. Should he decide to run, having worked for Donald Trump and around John Bolton could be used as ammo for the opposition.Pompeo recently met with Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon to discuss the race, and several people have suggested to CNN that Pompeo will run if he thinks Trump could lose re-election. The Washington Examiner first reported the meeting with Bannon.Two sources familiar with the situation told CNN that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been personally lobbying Pompeo to consider a run for the Senate and calls him to discuss the race. McConnell has privately advised Pompeo that he has concerns that a certain candidate wasn't able to win in 2018, and fears he'll become the Senate nominee, according to a source familiar with Pompeo's thinking. (Kris Kobach was the Republican nominee for governor last year but lost to Laura Kelly, the Democratic candidate, by five percentage points in a state that's reliably Republican.) Pompeo has until next June's filing deadline to decide.Bolton is watching Pompeo's political aspirations closely, according to two people familiar with his thinking. They say even though he is aware of his diminished standing, Bolton has designs on the secretary of state job should Pompeo decide to run for Senate. \"There is no question that Ambassador Bolton would love the position as Secretary of State,\" said Mark Groombridge, a former advisor to Bolton and a scholar at the CATO Institute. \"He's thought about it many times before. But he is also smart enough to realize that it would be an uphill climb, not only because of his distanced relationship with Trump but because of Senate confirmation. He has to confront the political realities and the headwinds that are against him.\" This story has been updated.CNN's Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Prior to last week, most Americans had never heard of John Ratcliffe. But in the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, the second-term Republican Texas congressman put on quite a show. He berated Mueller, the former head of the FBI, for stating that President Donald Trump was not fully exonerated in his eponymous report on his findings of the nearly two-year-long investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the President.\n\n\n\n\n\n THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\n\n\nRatcliffe took particular issue with the second volume of Mueller's report, which details seemingly obstructive behavior by the President. Here's the key bit:\"So Americans need to know this, as they listen to the Democrats and socialists on the other side of the aisle, as they do dramatic readings from this report: that Volume 2 of this report was not authorized under the law to be written. It was written to a legal standard that does not exist at the Justice Department. And it was written in violation of every DOJ principle about extra-prosecutorial commentary.\"And then, suddenly, everyone in the political world had heard of Ratcliffe. Even as the buzz -- both good and bad -- from his attacks on Mueller began circulating, the news that he was under serious consideration to be the next Director of National Intelligence began to spill out into public view.Read MoreWhat a coincidence! A guy in the mix for a top job in the intelligence community decides to use the platform afforded him by the Mueller hearing to make a very clear impression on someone he knows was watching the hearing very intently: Donald Trump.And here comes the truly amazing part, courtesy of a tweet from Trump himself on Sunday night:\"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves.\"So consider the timeline: On Wednesday, Ratcliffe makes a name for himself by savaging Mueller and insisting that the whole obstruction of justice part of the report is \"extra-prosecutorial\" and should have never been produced -- all of which is absolute music to Trump's ears. Five days later -- whammo! -- Dan Coats, the current DNI has decided to resign and Ratcliffe is named in his place.What's amazing about all of this is that there isn't even any attempt to suggest that a) Ratcliffe was trying out for the DNI job during the Mueller hearing or b) his performance in that tryout is what got him the job.This, from CNN's Nicole Gaouette, Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju, is telling in that regard:\"Ratcliffe had been under consideration for an administration position for a while but was considered by some inside the West Wing to be too nice, according to an official familiar with the dynamic. They didn't think he was aggressive enough, but his aggressive questioning of Mueller on Wednesday changed the thinking on that.\"What these past five days reinforce is the distinctly performative nature of the Trump presidency. He is someone whose lens on the world is cable TV so the better you perform on that medium, the more esteem Trump holds you in. It has ever been thus. A December 2016 Washington Post story headlined \"Donald Trump is holding a government casting call. He's seeking 'the look'\" got to that reality nicely:\"The parade of potential job-seekers passing a bank of media cameras to board the elevators at Trump Tower has the feel of a casting call. It is no coincidence that a disproportionate share of the names most mentioned for jobs at the upper echelon of the Trump administration are familiar faces to obsessive viewers of cable news \u2014 of whom the president-elect is one.\"Trump isn't wrong that the ability to perform when the lights go up is of real value for anyone in such a prominent political position. The problem -- as has been demonstrated by his unprecedented Cabinet turnover -- is that he appears to put stock primarily in the performative aspects of the job, rather than balancing experience, readiness, temperament and the ability to actually do the job. Judging from Trump's picks as his first term has worn on, he prizes performance and personal loyalty above all else -- including qualifications.Which brings me back to Ratcliffe. Yes, he has served as a US attorney and a federal terrorism prosecutor. But he is best known -- prior to coming to Congress -- as the mayor of a town called Heath in Texas, which has a population of under 9,000.That's not to say Ratcliffe can't and won't do the job -- if he gets confirmed by the Senate (which remains an \"if.\") It is to say that none of his past qualifications are what tipped the scales for Ratcliffe. His performance last Wednesday in attacking Mueller played an outsized role in getting him this job. Which tells you a lot -- actually everything -- you need to know about how Trump looks at the world.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US government has obtained intelligence that Saudi Arabia has significantly escalated its ballistic missile program with the help of China, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, a development that threatens decades of US efforts to limit missile proliferation in the Middle East. The Trump administration did not initially disclose its knowledge of this classified development to key members of Congress, the sources said, infuriating Democrats who discovered it outside of regular US government channels and concluded it had been deliberately left out of a series of briefings where they say it should have been presented.The previously unreported classified intelligence indicates Saudi Arabia has expanded both its missile infrastructure and technology through recent purchases from China. The discovery of the Saudi efforts has heightened concerns among members of Congress over a potential arms race in the Middle East, and whether it signals a tacit approval by the Trump administration as it seeks to counter Iran. The intelligence also raises questions about the administration's commitment to non-proliferation in the Middle East and the extent to which Congress is kept abreast of foreign policy developments in a volatile region.The development comes amid growing tensions between Congress and the White House over Saudi Arabia. Read MoreSaudi Arabia Fast FactsDespite bipartisan criticism over the Kingdom's war in Yemen and its role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the White House has sought an even closer relationship with the Saudis, as evidenced by its recent decision to sell the Kingdom billions of dollars in weapons and munitions despite opposition in Congress.While the Saudis' ultimate goal has not been conclusively assessed by US intelligence, the sources said, the missile advancement could mark another step in potential Saudi efforts to one day deliver a nuclear warhead were it ever to obtain one.The Kingdom's Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has made clear that should Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, Saudi would work to do the same, telling 60 Minutes in a 2018 interview that, \"Without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible.\"Though Saudi is among the biggest buyers of US weapons, it is barred from purchasing ballistic missiles from the US under regulations set forth by the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime, an informal, multi-country pact aimed at preventing the sale of rockets capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction. Yet the Saudis have consistently taken the position that they need to match Iran's missile capability and have at times sought help on the side from other countries, including China, which is not a signatory to the pact.Saudi Arabia is known to have purchased ballistic missiles from China several decades ago, and public reports speculated that more purchases may have been made as recently as 2007. The Kingdom has never been assessed to have the ability to build its own missiles or even effectively deploy the ones it does have. Instead, the Saudis' arsenal of Chinese-made ballistic missiles was a way to signal its potential military strength to regional foes, primarily Iran.That, the sources told CNN, has shifted based on the new intelligence. US-supplied air powerFor decades, the US worked to ensure that Saudi Arabia had air supremacy in the region, largely through its purchases of American military aircraft, precisely so that it wouldn't seek to go around the US to upgrade its missile capabilities. \"Saudi Arabia needn't race Iran to produce or procure ballistic missiles. It already has a significant conventional military advantage,\" said Behnam Taleblu of the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.But questions have arisen in recent months about whether that rationale still stands, particularly as the Trump administration has pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Kingdom faces ballistic missile threats from Iran proxies in Yemen.Satellite imagery, first reported by the Washington Post in January, suggested the Kingdom had constructed a ballistic missile factory. Analysts who viewed the images said they appeared to match technology produced by the Chinese. Satellite imagery captured on November 13, 2018 shows a suspected ballistic missile factory at a missile base in al-Watah, Saudi Arabia. Image was initially discovered by Planet Labs and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.A second image of the same missile facility obtained by CNN shows a similar level of activity at the site on May 14, 2019, according to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute. \"Saudi Arabia's reported interest in domestic ballistic missile production should rightly raise eyebrows,\" Taleblu said. \"Both the reported missile base and Riyadh's interest in a domestic fuel cycle indicates, however nascent, a desire to hedge against Iran.\" The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on any intelligence related to Saudi Arabia's ballistic missile activity or whether the US believes the Kingdom is contracting in that area with foreign partners.A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in the US did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China and Saudi Arabia are \"comprehensive strategic partners,\" and that both countries \"maintain friendly cooperation in all areas, including in the area of arms sales. Such cooperation does not violate any international laws, nor does it involve the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"Saudi Arabia and Israel are pushing US to confront Iran. Trump shouldn't take the baitA State Department official declined to comment on classified intelligence matters, but told CNN that Saudi Arabia remains a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and has accepted an obligation never to acquire nuclear weapons. The spokesperson also pointed to a recent statement by a US State Department official reaffirming the US  commitment to \"the goal of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems.\" Sources said there has been no indication from the administration that there has been an explicit policy shift as it relates to non-proliferation of ballistic missiles in Saudi, but noted the administration's awareness of the intelligence -- and lack of concrete action to halt the advances since it was obtained.Beyond satellite imageryUS intelligence agencies constantly monitor foreign ballistic missile development and the flow of materials around the world. Related intelligence is analyzed on a daily basis and any significant change would likely make it into the Presidential Daily Briefing, according to two former senior US intelligence officials.The Senate Intelligence Committee has been given access to the Saudi intelligence, though it has not received a specific briefing on the subject, according to two sources familiar with the matter.But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has oversight of the State Department and US foreign policy broadly, learned about the Saudi intelligence earlier this year only after it was discovered by Democratic staff on the committee, including in one instance when a staff member on an unrelated trip to the Middle East was informed of details through a foreign counterpart, two of the sources told CNN.There had already been at least two classified briefings on issues related to the topic where the information could have been disclosed to senators, according to one source.First phase of US missile system sale to Saudi Arabia moves forwardWhen the staff brought the new information to the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, he immediately requested-- and was granted-- a classified, senators-only briefing for committee members on the details, a rare occurrence that underscored the importance of the discovery and the administration's failure to initially brief the committee on the matter.Several sources said the analysis presented in the classified briefing, held on April 9, went far beyond the January Washington Post story about the satellite images, and provided concrete evidence that Saudi Arabia has advanced its missile program to a point that would run in direct conflict with long-established US policy to limit proliferation in the region.The day after the classified briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified publicly in front of the committee as part of a routine hearing on the State Department budget. Over the course of a few hours, the dispute over intelligence sharing began to spill out into the open, turning a relatively benign budget hearing into a debate over a potentially crucial shift in US policy over missile proliferation in the Middle East. Though at the time, it was hard to notice.Without going into specifics, Menendez castigated Pompeo for the administration's  decision not to share classified information with the committee until it was brought to the administration by the senator himself.\"That's simply unacceptable,\" Menendez told the country's top diplomat, adding that if Congress is to perform its constitutional duties, the State Department \"needs to do a better job of engaging with us, briefing us and responding to our requests.\" Later in the hearing, three other Democratic senators obliquely referenced the issue in their questions to Pompeo, citing public reports related to Saudi ballistic missile ambitions. JUST WATCHEDSen. Kaine asks Pompeo about Saudi missilesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Kaine asks Pompeo about Saudi missiles 01:15Neither the senators nor Pompeo mentioned the previous day's briefing, or that their questions or answers were based on specific intelligence. But in hindsight, the exchanges shed light on the Trump administration's hardline position that countering Iran is the ultimate priority in the region -- regardless of long-held US non-proliferation positions.In his responses, Pompeo made clear the administration's preference that Saudi Arabia buy US technology, a possible nod, multiple US officials said, to internal opposition inside the Trump administration to restrictions on US sales of ballistic missiles to the Kingdom.\"There've been those who've urged the United States to take a different posture with respect to Saudi Arabia, not to sell them technology,\" Pompeo said. \"I think you see the risks that are created. It would be better if the United States was involved in those transactions than if China was.\"While Pompeo acknowledged under questioning that it is still US policy to oppose proliferation of ballistic missile technology in the Middle East, a telling exchange occurred later. JUST WATCHEDSen. Udall asks Pompeo about Saudi and Chinese missilesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Udall asks Pompeo about Saudi and Chinese missiles 01:50Sen. Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, citing the Washington Post report on the satellite images, asked what the US was doing to prevent foreign sales of ballistic missile technology to Saudi Arabia. Pompeo made clear, intentionally or not, a prevailing administration position that has guided much of its policy in the region -- including its knowledge of the expanding Saudi ballistic missile program. \"This is certainly something that we all need to keep an eye on,\" Pompeo said, before adding that \"most of the folks who are working to build out missile systems\" were doing so in direct response to Iran's ability to continue to enhance its missile program under the 2015 nuclear accord.  \"Others are doing what they need to do to create a deterrence tool for themselves,\" Pompeo said. \"It's just a fact.\"Udall, who a source confirmed had been in the classified briefing the day prior, responded after a pause by pressing the administration to stick to the long-held US policy to deter missile proliferation in Saudi \"Well, I very much hope that the administration will push back in terms of what's happening in missiles across the Middle East.\"Tensions over Saudi policyThe new revelations come at a particularly fraught time in the Saudi-U.S. relationship.Last year, as evidence of the Saudi government's role in the murder of Khashoggi emerged, GOP Senators including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and then-Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee publicly condemned the Trump administration's timid response.\"There's not a smoking gun, there's a smoking saw,\" Graham said after emerging from a classified briefing in December, referring to reports that the Saudi team had included a forensic expert who arrived in Turkey with equipment to dismember Khashoggi's body.Bipartisan group of senators fuming over administration's handling of Khashoggi aftermath In an interview with Axios on HBO that aired on Sunday, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner refused to go into details about his private conversations with the Saudi crown prince, and maintained that the Saudis are a key ally in helping the US contain Iran. Asked whether he would join Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e in calling on the Saudi government to release Khashoggi's body, Kushner demurred, saying the decision \"would be up to the Secretary of State\" and that \"we'll do everything we can to try to bring transparency and accountability for what happened.\"Anger over the administration's handling of the Khashoggi murder led to bipartisan support for resolutions to end US involvement in the war in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition has been accused of indiscriminately bombing civilians. The conflict has resulted in widespread famine and put an estimated 14 million people at risk of starvation, according to the United Nations. In March, lawmakers pushed through the House and Senate a measure that would've forced Trump to get permission from Congress before allowing the US military to aid Saudi Arabia in its fight against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Lawmakers were ultimately unable to override Trump's veto. Tensions between the administration and lawmakers were again exacerbated by the administration's May 24 announcement that it would declare an emergency over escalating tensions with Iran in order to bypass Congress to complete an $8.1 billion sale of weapons, munitions, intelligence and maintenance to various countries including Saudi Arabia and UAE. A bipartisan group of seven senators, including Menendez and Graham, on Wednesday said they were introducing resolutions to block all 22 arms sales tied to the administration's move.Trump declares emergency to expedite arms sales to Saudi Arabia and UAEThere is also an ongoing bipartisan effort to finalize a new sanctions package targeting Saudi Arabia -- one opposed on its face by the Trump administration, which tends to cast its view of the Kingdom as a binary choice: you either support Saudi Arabia or you support Iran. For Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and sharp critic of the administration's Saudi policy, the choice is not that simple when it comes to ballistic missile proliferation. \"I think it's a total misread of the region to think that the Saudis are the good guys in this equation. The Iranians do really awful things in the region. But so do the Saudis. \"Murphy declined to comment on the Saudi missile intelligence he received during the April 9 briefing, but was willing to address the broader issue, including the long-term implications should the US abandon its policy of missile deterrence in the Middle East. \"For decades the US has had a policy of trying to quell, not ignite an arms race in the Middle East, and for good reason,\" said Murphy. \"It stands to reason we would want less weapons pointed at each other.\"'It was egregious'The whole incident puts the panel's Republican chairman, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, in a tricky spot. Compared to his predecessor Corker, an avid Trump critic, Risch has refrained from criticizing the administration, and has attempted to strike a balance between tending the concerns of angry committee members while also trying not to undercut Trump's foreign policy strategy.  Risch, who also sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, dismissed complaints that the intelligence omission was intentional and chalked it up to a simple oversight, given the sheer volume of information the intelligence community gathers each day.  Trump ally caught in crossfire as White House clashes with GOP over Saudi Arabia\"There's no doubt that factual matters that the intelligence community has sometimes don't get into the hands of senators simply because there is too much of it,\" Risch told CNN, noting that he hadn't received any complaints from Republican members of the panel. \"It's not intentional at all. It's just simply that it can't be done.\"  Menendez doesn't buy into that theory.  \"You can't lose track of something like this,\" said Menendez, who would not discuss the topic of the underlying intelligence at issue. \"It was egregious.\" Menendez is now pressuring the administration to provide a classified briefing on the issue for all 100 senators. While frustrations over access to classified information by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee go back years, they have become particularly acute during the Trump administration, senators and aides interviewed for this story said.\"I think our [intelligence community] knows a lot and they don't want to tell us,\" said Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who declined to address the specific subject matter. Kaine noted that there are a series of issues -- several related specifically to Saudi, including authorizations to sell civilian nuclear technology to the country -- that have remained shrouded in secrecy, despite repeated requests to the administration to provide briefings or documentation. Kaine on Tuesday revealed for the first time at least two of the technology sales occurred after Khashoggi's murder, including one that was finalized just 16 days after the journalist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Democratic senators want intelligence community to submit report on Khashoggi's murderThe divide between Congress and the administration on Saudi has led to increasingly hostile receptions for Trump officials who come to Capitol Hill to testify. It's also one that has largely left the US public in the dark as to the administration's actions with its closest allies in the region.For at least one Democratic Senator who spoke on condition of anonymity even as he declined to address the underlying Saudi intelligence, it's all part of a broader trend of the administration refusing to share intelligence with Congress.The administration \"has taken a position of: you don't need to know anything,\" the senator said. \"Which, of course, is constitutionally inaccurate.\"CNN's Steven Jiang contributed reporting",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)US Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not know exactly how many noncitizen veterans it has deported over the last five years, according to a federal watchdog group. In a new report released Thursday, the Government Accountability Office not only concluded that ICE has failed to consistently adhere to its own policies related to cases of veterans who may be subject to deportation but also lacks a complete record of how many of these individuals were removed from the US from 2013 to 2018.\"ICE has developed policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans who may be subject to removal from the United States, but does not consistently adhere to those policies, and does not consistently identify and track such veterans,\" the report states.A deported veteran just became a US citizen. Wait ... what?  \"Additionally, ICE has not developed a policy to identify and document all military veterans it encounters during interviews, and in cases when agents and officers do learn they have encountered a veteran, ICE does not maintain complete electronic data,\" it reads. \"Therefore, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that it is consistently implementing its policies for handling veterans' cases.\"Those findings have drawn the ire of Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat who's the chairman of the House Veteran's Affairs Committee, who sent a letter to acting ICE Director Mark Morgan on Thursday demanding answers.Read More\"I was deeply alarmed by the findings in the report that show not only are we unable to fully quantify how many of these men and women are being deported, but that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has certain policies already in place to which it consistently fails to adhere,\" he wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained exclusively by CNN. An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that the agency \"respects the service and sacrifice of those in military service, and is very deliberate in its review of cases involving veterans\" and noted that \"any action taken by ICE that may result in the removal of an individual with military service must be authorized by the senior leadership in a field office, following an evaluation by local counsel.\"\"ICE exercises prosecutorial discretion for members of the armed forces who have honorably served our country on a case-by-case basis when appropriate. ICE specifically identifies service in the US military as a positive factor that should be considered along with other factors in the totality of the circumstances when deciding whether or not prosecutorial discretion should be exercised,\" the statement said. Exclusive: Homeland Security watchdog finds 'egregious' conditions at ICE facilities in 2018When ICE agents and officers learn they have encountered a potentially removable veteran, they are required under agency policy to take additional steps to proceed with the case. These policies are intended to help ensure that veterans receive appropriate levels of review before they are placed in removal proceedings, according to the GAO. \"Because ICE did not consistently follow these policies, some veterans who were removed may not have received the level of review and approval that ICE has determined is appropriate for cases involving veterans,\" the report says. \"Our government is failing our immigrant veterans -- men and women who have dutifully served our nation,\" Rep. Juan Vargas, also a California Democrat, said in a statement to CNN. \"The GAO report reveals obvious instances of mismanagement and policy noncompliance that have led to numerous veteran deportations.\" But according to ICE, applicable law requires the agency \"to mandatorily detain and process for removal individuals who have been convicted of aggravated felonies as defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\"Vet deported because of felony says he did his time in prison, belongs back in US\"In 100 percent of the veteran case files GAO reviewed, the individuals were placed into removal proceedings because of felony convictions related to drugs; sexual abuse, of which 18 involved minors; firearms, explosives, or explosive material; kidnapping; terrorist threats; and other crimes,\" the agency said in its statement. Specifically, Takano and Vargas have asked Morgan to address the following questions:What steps will ICE take to ensure full adoption and compliance with the 2015 ICE Directive 16001.2 and the 2004 memo issued by acting Director Victor Cerda to standardize the reporting requirements for potentially removable individuals?Does ICE have any existing plans or plans currently in development to strengthen its internal requirements to document the veteran status or service history of potentially removable individuals?What additional training will be adopted in response to GAO's findings that ICE personnel do not consistently adhere to its own policies on the handling of potentially removable individuals who are veterans?What additional processes or procedures will be adopted to ensure that ICE can accurately inventory the total number of veterans current in removal proceedings and identify new potentially removable veterans?What additional authorities may be necessary to satisfy the recommendations in the GAO report?\"We cannot allow noncitizen veterans to fall through the cracks of our broken immigration system,\" Takano told CNN. \"Deporting veterans represents a failure by our government that could have been prevented if ICE officials had been adhering to agency policies. \"This level of carelessness and disregard for official procedures is negligent and unacceptable. Although we do not know the exact number of deported veterans, we do know that one deported veteran is one too many. It's one more veteran who does not have access to the benefits and care they earned and who has been removed from the country they fought for,\" he added.",

        "content": "(CNN)Congress is backing down from its threat to reinstate harsh penalties on China's ZTE.It's a win for President Donald Trump, who recently eased restrictions on the company. Members of the House and Senate on Monday announced that they have agreed to the final version of the annual defense policy bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act. It did not include a provision to reimpose a US export ban on ZTE, which had been in the version passed by the Senate.The legislation still needs to be voted on in both chambers, though it is widely expected to pass.The Trump administration lifted the export ban on ZTE earlier this month after striking a deal with the company,  which makes smartphones and telecommunications equipment. Read MoreBefore the final version of the defense bill was crafted, members of Congress from both parties had threatened to undo Trump's agreement. They claimed that ZTE posed a security threat. Lawmakers ultimately softened the bill Monday, though some on Capitol Hill still weren't happy. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, said Monday he was \"shocked\" by the weakened version. \"No nation steals American intellectual property or spies on America more than China, and Chinese telecommunication companies are among the most powerful tools they use to do this,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"That is why I fought so hard last month to put ZTE out of business. And that is why I am so shocked that some of my colleagues decided to let ZTE continue to do business.\"Related: ZTE can once again do business with American companiesThe legislation doesn't let ZTE off the hook entirely.It prohibits government agencies and companies that do business with the US government from buying technology from both ZTE and Huawei, China's biggest telecom company.Companies that do business with the government will have five years to get rid of ZTE and Huawei equipment, according to a Congressional aide familiar with the final bill.It's been a tumultuous few months for ZTE. In April, the United States blocked ZTE from buying US parts. The Trump administration said that ZTE had lied to US officials about punishing employees who violated US sanctions against North Korea and Iran.And in May, the Pentagon told US military bases to stop selling phones made by ZTE and Huawei. The agency claimed they posed security risks to the Defense Department.Later that month, though, Trump said he would personally work with Chinese President Xi Jinping to get ZTE \"back into business, fast.\" He said the US punishment was costing too many Chinese jobs.When the US Commerce Department eventually lifted its export ban on ZTE, the company paid a $1 billion fine and put $400 million in an escrow account. ZTE also had to bring in an American monitoring team and overhaul its top management.--CNN's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)A former nuclear launch officer is warning that President Donald Trump's nuclear weapons strategy is encouraging an arms race that could increase the chances of a catastrophic nuclear war. He argues that the Pentagon should instead adopt a \"deterrence-only\" approach that phases out land-based missile systems that have served as one leg of the nuclear triad for decades.In a new report released on Tuesday, Global Zero's Dr. Bruce Blair, a former Air Force launch control officer who's a nuclear security expert at Princeton University, argues that the United States' nuclear stance is a \"vestige of the Cold War\" that creates instability with an unnecessarily hefty price tag.  His proposal is intended to reshape the Pentagon's thinking on nuclear weapons by promoting a \"deterrence-only\" strategy that supplements sweeping cuts to the US nuclear force with additional options involving conventional weapons that he says are better suited to hit specific targets. \"This alternate nuclear posture review is the first and only analysis in the public domain that uses credible estimates of existing US war plan target requirements and goes on to define the forces needed to meet them, and thus it challenges the Pentagon on its own terms,\" Blair told CNN. Read More\"It starts from the same place as Pentagon officials and nuclear war planners, offering a different perspective -- one that questions the foundation of nuclear planning. The US shouldn't base decisions on a strategy of nuclear war fighting, it should make decisions based on a deterrence-only role for the nuclear arsenal,\" he said. The report also dissects what Blair characterizes as the US nuclear posture's \"Achilles' heel\" -- the system's communication network. \"Having the ability to absorb an attack and retaliate is the essence of deterrence, and yet the United States has failed to ensure presidential survival and robust communications\u2014both vital to executing a retaliatory attack,\" the report said. The Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review released in February focuses primarily on countering threats posed by Russia, and military officials are adamant their plan walks the line between maintaining a nuclear deterrence and encouraging controls on nuclear weapons.\"It reaffirms that the fundamental role of US nuclear policy is deterrence and continues our clear commitment to nonproliferation and arms control,\" said Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan.However, Blair argues that the Trump administration's nuclear posture \"promotes a nuclear arms race.\"\"The Trump administration's nuclear posture goes beyond legitimate goals of credible national security, and actually promotes a nuclear arms race and nuclear war fighting,\" he added.Blair said some of the Pentagon's nuclear strategies are \"dangerous\" and contain unnecessary redundancies that may increase the chances of a full-scale nuclear conflict. Mattis and Dunford call for classified nuclear changes\"Nuclear war fighting is destabilizing. ... Once it starts, escalation is likely,\" he told CNN, adding that he would argue against the Pentagon's current war fighting target set and recommend scaling down to a deterrence-only strategy that threatens key targets. According to Blair, his report lays \"out the steps needed to significantly reduce the risk of the use of nuclear weapons by design or accident and the risk of escalation to full-scale nuclear war if conflict happens.\"One such recommendation is for the Trump administration to phase out its arsenal of silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles over the next 10 years and adopt a deterrence-only model by dramatically cutting its arsenal of nuclear weapons and bomber force.US says Russia 'developing' undersea nuclear-armed torpedo Silo-based ICBMs are one leg of the US nuclear triad, which also consists of bombers and nuclear-armed submarines.  According to Blair's report, five US Columbia-class submarines, backed by a reserve force of 40 nuclear-capable bombers, would be capable of retaliating with enough force if necessary, also rendering the third arm of the triad \"redundant and dispensable.\"  The Pentagon's current Nuclear Posture Review calls for at least 12 new Columbia-class submarines and 175 bombers. \"The almost exclusive mission of these missiles is to engage Russia, or Russia and China simultaneously, in large-scale nuclear conflict,\" the report said. \"Such wartime scenarios have become unthinkable. Waging war against both countries simultaneously is a contingency so improbable that US planners can safely ignore it.\" Can military commanders refuse an order from Trump?Blair also noted that silo locations are \"fixed and known,\" creating vulnerabilities for the weapons. However, Defense Secretary James Mattis has reiterated the administration's support for the nuclear triad. In September 2017, Mattis argued it is a crucial form of deterrence. \"I questioned the triad, and I cannot solve the deterrent problem reducing it from a triad,\" Mattis said, according to a report by Military Times. \"If I want to send the most compelling message, I have been persuaded that the triad and its framework is the right way to go.\"Mattis has stressed the importance of including more conventional options as part of nuclear war planning and has worked toward overhauling US nuclear communications, a priority listed in Blair's report. For decades, the military plan for nuclear war has been known as the Single Integrated Operational Plan -- focusing entirely on a nuclear campaign. US Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear defense, is continuing the effort begun by the Obama administration to provide military plans that combine nuclear and conventional options, in order to be able to de-escalate a crisis, defense officials familiar with the effort told CNN in July.The move to include conventional options as part of planning for nuclear war took on additional importance as tensions rose with North Korea, and the Pentagon leadership was looking for a wide range of military options to offer Trump, officials said.Correction: This story has been updated to correctly attribute a quote to Bruce Blair rather than Vipin Narang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US Air Force wants to add more bombers, fighters, tankers and other front-line units by 2030 to confront rising threats from China and Russia, senior officials said Monday, outlining a proposal for what the service will need to fight and win future conflicts. Specifically, officials called for a nearly 25% increase in operational squadrons over the next 12 years, which would bring the Air Force to a size not seen since the Cold War, when there were 401 squadrons. CIA official: China wants to replace US as world superpower\"The Air Force is too small for what the nation is asking us to do. We have 312 operational squadrons today. The Air Force we need has 386 operational squadrons by 2030,\" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said during a speech at the Air Force Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference in Maryland.   The call for more than 70 additional squadrons is based on estimates of the expected threat facing the US between 2025 and 2030 and represents an honest assessment of what the Air Force needs to fight and win a potential conflict with China or Russia in the future, according to Wilson. Defense bill offers harsh words for Russia and China\"It's not just larger; the way we fight will be different,\" she said, noting that this assessment is in line with priorities outlined in Defense Secretary James Mattis' National Defense Strategy, which calls China and Russia \"the central challenge\" facing the US military. Read More\"Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in US national security,\" according to the document, released earlier this year, which added that \"long-term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department.\"\"Today, we are the best Air Force in the world,\" Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein said. \"Our adversaries know it. They have been studying our way of war and investing in ways to take away those advantages. This is about how we stay in front.\"While the proposed increases have not yet been worked into the Pentagon's budget plans, Goldfein stressed the idea that the changes are essential to ensuring the US can maintain its military dominance going forward. \"We usually have the dialogue about the Air Force we can afford,\" he added. \"This is different. This is about the Air Force we need to present credible options to compete, deter and, if deterrence fails, win.\"China 'likely' training pilots to target US, Pentagon report says\"These observations are not new or novel. Defense leaders have understood these factors for a long time. What is different about Secretary Wilson's outlined approach is her willingness to put the Air Force's challenges on the table so that Congress and others can understand the risk and prioritize necessary solutions,\" retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, wrote in an op-ed for Defense News. The largest proposed percentage increase would be to the Air Force's bomber squadrons, which would grow from nine to 14, according to Wilson, who noted that an increased bomber presence is particularly important in the Pacific, where China's first aircraft carrier has been conducting flight operations after being declared combat ready this year. \"China has militarized islands in the South China Sea, and now all of Southeast Asia is within reach of its long-rang bombers,\" she said. \"Part of President Xi's plan is for China to be a top-ranked military by 2050, and President Xi is no longer bound by term limits on his presidency.\" Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum earlier this summer, Michael Collins, the deputy assistant director of the CIA's East Asia Mission Center, said Chinese President Xi Jinping and his regime are waging a \"cold war\" against the US.By looking at the writings of Xi, whose \"thought\" or worldview was recently enshrined in China's Constitution, it's clear, Collins said, that the threat China presents is the greatest global challenge the US currently faces.\"It sets up a competition with us and what we stand behind far more significantly by any extreme than what the Russians could put forward,\" Collins said.According to Deptula, the US bomber force has been significantly under-resourced since the end of the Cold War. Trump's Space Force could cost nearly $13 billion over 5 years\"The modern threat environment demands that the Air Force build a force with range, responsiveness, payload, survivability, and versatile combat power as keystone attributes. This force must be able to address concurrent large-scale conflicts and persistent steady-state demands,\" Deptula argues in his own analysis of the Air Force's bomber fleet, obtained by CNN prior to its expected release this week. The Air Force's proposal also calls for the following additions to fighter squadrons, attack and special operations, space, cyber, tanker, airlift and other front-line units: Seven space squadrons14 tanker squadrons Seven special operations squadronsNine combat search and rescue squadrons 22 Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance squadronsSeven fighter squadrons Two Remotely Piloted Aircraft squadronsOne airlift squadronWhile the plan does not include an increase in the number of missile squadrons, Wilson said the US \"should modernize our nuclear deterrent.\"\"Cyber would also not see an increase in squadrons, though we will develop new tools for the squadrons we have,\" she said. Wilson said she understands that it will take time to build the support and budget needed to implement the proposed changes but emphasized that there is an urgent need to address the issues at hand. \"We aren't na\u00efve,\" she said. \"But we have an obligation to be honest with our countrymen and tell them, as those who came before us have done in their time, what should be done. ...

It added that the intercept took place while the Russian bombers were in the US Air Defense Identification Zone, which extends about 200 miles off Alaska's western coast.Two NORAD F-22 \"Raptor\" fighter jets positively identified and intercepted two Russian Tu-95 \"Bear\" bombers at approximately 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday, September 11. The Russian bombers intercepted west of mainland Alaska were accompanied by two Russian Su-35 \"Flanker\" figher jets. The incident marks the second time US F-22s have intercepted Russian bombers off the coast of Alaska this month. The previous intercept occurred on Sept. 1. However, during that earlier intercept, the Russian Tu-95s were not escorted by Russian fighter jets.Two Russian Tu-95 bombers were also intercepted by F-22's off the coast of Alaska in May, nearly a year after the last encounter of this kind.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Army Spc. Sarah Reyes' instincts had always prompted her to run toward danger, not away from it.\"I lived for it, and I was good at it,\" she said of her time as an Army combat medic, which included a nine-month stint in Afghanistan. But today, she is a different person.Reyes still fears talking about the night she says she was raped by a \"monster\" disguised in combat fatigues at Ft. Stewart, Georgia -- a member of her own platoon who had served at her side while deployed overseas.Why the military's long reckoning with sexual assault can help us now\"I am terrified that my story isn't good enough ... that it doesn't represent what's going on,\" Reyes said. But despite that fear, she is speaking out for the first time, telling CNN she hopes her words can help others. Read MoreReyes said she now suffers from extreme anxiety and has a tendency to \"run away and avoid things\" due to the pain inflicted by a man she had grown to trust nearly four years ago.   Like the vast majority of military victims who report crimes of sexual violence, Reyes said she remains dissatisfied with the way she was treated by investigators who decided not to pursue charges against the alleged assailant.Her experience is an illustration of what many survivors described as a broken system that they say perpetuates a culture that suppresses the reporting of sexually violent crimes.Recent reports of sexual misconduct by high-profile politicians, entertainment moguls and media personalities have revived a public discussion about sexual assault and revealed a deep-seated culture of tolerance of inappropriate behavior that also extends into the US military. While the issue of sexual assault in the military has been widely reported for years, the recent spate of allegations against individuals and momentum of the #MeToo movement has prompted a renewed effort for transparency within the armed services. Pentagon reports increase in misconduct complaints against senior officialsIn November, 200 women working in national security\u00a0signed a letter\u00a0titled #metoonatsec, stating that this is a problem they also face. Those who signed the letter included women who have worked as ambassadors, civilians at the Pentagon, military officers, staffers on Capitol Hill and professors as well as women in the nonprofit and think tank worlds.\"This is not just a problem in Hollywood, Silicon Valley, newsrooms or Congress,\" the women said in their letter. \"It is everywhere.\"'He had his hand around my neck'Reyes said she has actively avoided speaking out because she felt that some of the circumstances around the alleged assault -- including the use of alcohol and gaps in her memory -- delegitimized her case in the eyes of Army investigators and many of her fellow soldiers. Prior to the alleged assault, Reyes said she was at a party in the barracks, where she and her fellow soldiers were drinking.Reyes told CNN that she did not feel like she drank too much but noted that she was \"not making her own drinks\" and \"does not have much memory\" of the night.  Although the timeline of the evening is still fuzzy at times, Reyes said she now recalls more about the what occurred -- including feeling very tired during the party and lying in the bed of a male soldier.JUST WATCHEDRape trauma often mistaken for deceptionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRape trauma often mistaken for deception 01:56\"Next thing I remember is being in his bed and him being so nice to me,\" Reyes said. \"Then I kind of zone out and don't remember much ... I think we were kissing at that point.\"The next morning, Reyes said she woke up feeling confused and physically sick but initially did not recall having sex.\"All I could remember were the nice things he was saying -- like my own brain had tricked me into believing or remembering the good things,\" she said. At that point, Reyes said that she still did not fully realize that she had been raped and even wrote the man a message on Facebook to apologize for leaving his room so abruptly. \"At some level I must have known, but it was not what I was focused on,\" she said.  The realization that something beyond her initial memory of the night had occurred did not fully set in until the next day, when her friends asked if she had consented to everything that happened during the encounter.    \"That moment was like someone flipped on a light switch -- I realized I didn't want it all to happen,\" Reyes said. \"My body went numb and I was crying. ... (I) felt like my world had ended and I couldn't figure out why.\"Hagel outlines plan to reduce, respond to sexual assault casesReyes maintained that she was incapable of giving consent at the time and emphasized that she would not have willingly agreed to have sexual intercourse under normal circumstances -- highlighting that the soldiers in her platoon were aware that she and her best friend, Melissa, had both recently decided to abstain from sex until marriage as part of a pact to recommit themselves to their Christian faith.\"We had both been in relationships that had gone bad. We wanted to start fresh, and we were committed to abstaining from sex until marriage,\" Melissa told CNN. \"We were the church girls, everyone in our platoon knew this,\" Reyes said, adding that some of her fellow soldiers said she was acting provocatively during the party but that behavior \"is not who I am.\"CNN has agreed not to use Melissa's last name to protect her privacy.Additional memories began to surface over the course of the next few days, according to Reyes.\"Now I know more happened,\" she said. \"He had me bent over and had his hand around my neck and was behind me and was raping me.\"\"He was still saying nice things while he was doing it. ... I remember trying to turn around and push him off me, but he kept saying nice things and kept going,\" Reyes added. \"If someone had asked me if I had suicidal thoughts at that moment, I would have said yes -- that terrified me.\" That realization drove her to initially tell Melissa and Kim Speedy, a counselor working at Ft. Stewart at the time.Speedy ultimately encouraged Reyes to report the incident. Reyes told the investigators -- all of whom were males -- as much as she could remember about the assault but was informed that there was not enough evidence to pursue charges against the accused assailant due, in part, to the gaps in her memory. \"He asked if I said no,\" Reyes said about the investigator, a detail that, at the time, she was not completely certain about. \"I said, 'I don't know,'\" she said, adding that she kept wondering to herself why they did not believe her.  Sharp decrease of sexual assault in military, study findsAfter a series of interviews over the course of several days, completing a rape kit and getting a CT scan, Reyes said she was told by investigators that the soldier \"admitted it happened\" but that they \"don't have anything to prove it.\"The soldier had admitted to \"a sexual encounter that was violent (enough to almost break her neck) but claimed that she never said no,\" according to Speedy, a mental health therapist who has treated victims of military sexual trauma for years and was the counselor who handled Reyes' case in 2012.  But despite Reyes' testimony, investigators found that the man did not rape or assault her because of his claim during the investigation that he stopped when she demonstrated an unwillingness to participate and that she was not incapacitated to the point where she was incapable of performing sexual acts. Investigators also determined that although the man did place his hands around Reyes' neck, the action was not done with the intent to force sexual acts or cause her bodily harm. \"There wasn't enough to prosecute,\" they kept saying, according to Reyes. \"I don't know what they would expect to have ... should he have broken my neck?\"Speedy, who was the first person Reyes told about the incident and who advised her to report it at the time, said the investigators' conclusion \"shows exactly how a sexual assault is dismissed in the military\" -- particularly cases involving decorated soldiers. \"Based on the bruising around Sarah's throat and the fact that she was sobbing, fearful of all touch and was found on the floor in the fetal position, rocking back and forth in a dark exam room, coupled with her statements about what happened, I can say with a 99% certainty that a sexual assault occurred,\" she told CNN.\"People who engage in consensual sex do not present with those symptoms. This is exactly how these cases get swept under the rug. Facts are misrepresented by investigators and attorneys,\" Speedy added.Reyes said her \"case was not straightforward\" but that after talking to military investigators, she believes \"there is a preconceived notion what the story should sound like, what the timeline should look like and what the reaction should be.\"The male soldier was ultimately allowed to continue his normal duties at Ft. Stewart and was never charged in military or civilian courts related to Reyes' accusations.CNN reached out to Ft. Stewart and the Pentagon for comment but they declined to discuss details pertaining to a specific investigation.What is being done?The Pentagon said that it remains committed to addressing the issue of sexual assault and harassment within the ranks as survivors demand accountability from military leadership. \"The Department of Defense continuously works to eliminate sexual assault and assault from the military, and we encourage service members to report all instances of sexual assault so we can provide support services and hold offenders accountable,\" spokesman Col. Rob Manning told reporters last month after a #MeToo protest held outside the Pentagon. In 2015, a bill sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, passed that ended the statute of limitations for rape cases in the military, banned commanders from reversing jury verdicts in sexual assault and rape cases, made it a crime to retaliate against personnel who report sex crimes, and permitted victims to have their cases handled by civilian authorities in certain circumstances.President Donald Trump called the issue \"a massive problem\" during the 2016 election at a forum, where he was questioned about a 2013 tweet that said: \"26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\"When asked if that meant the \"only fix is to take women out of the military,\" Trump said: \"No, not to kick them out.\"\"But something has to happen,\" he said. \"Right now part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. You have reported ... you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.\"Pentagon report says military sexual assaults decreased in 2016The Department of Defense recently released data showing that the number of reported sexual assaults that occurred at military bases and installations around the world have increased since 2013.But in 2016, 68% of military victims did not report sexually violent crimes, according to data from the annual Department of Defense report on sexual assault.\"The truth is that the scourge of sexual assault in the military remains status quo,\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said about the 2017 Pentagon report. \"(It) disappointingly shows a flat overall reporting rate and a retaliation rate against survivors that remains at an unacceptable 6 out of 10 for a third year in a row.\"Hiding in plain sightReyes is one of several former and current service members who told CNN that the military failed to properly address their reports of sexual assault, despite implementing programs like SHARP, or Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention.CNN talked to five women who said they were assaulted while serving in the military, and data says 1 in 4 women are assaulted by someone in their chain of command -- numbers that have led the Pentagon to target what it calls a pervasive issue of sexual assault within its ranks.\"There is a lot of victim-shaming that happens ... the justice system has an archaic view of sexual assault,\" according to Speedy.\"A lot of people are largely unaware of how the military justice system functions,\" Speedy said, specifically referencing issues with what she called the \"good soldier defense.\"JUST WATCHEDRape victims: Military calls us 'crazy' (2012)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRape victims: Military calls us 'crazy' (2012) 05:29The military tends to give decorated and successful soldiers the benefit of the doubt even when they are accused of a crime, she told CNN. \"That mentality sets up a perfect breeding ground for someone who wants to assault women.\"\"Eighty-five percent of assaults that occur in military are acquaintance rape,\" she added, noting that service members are often \"brainwashed to think these people would lay down their life for you or take a bullet for you.\" Capt. Celina Baldwin, who was recently deployed to Iraq, said she was raped after a night of drinking by an \"acquaintance\" -- who was a member of the West Point Military Academy hockey team -- while she was attending the academy in July 2011. Speedy, who has seen all the related documents in Baldwin's case and was present with the prosecution during the preliminary hearing, corroborated her story. According to Baldwin, the assailant was a teammate of an ex-boyfriend. \"I woke up a couple of times during the act and told him to stop, but he continued,\" she said. \"I remember waking up the next morning feeling like something felt strange and remembering that he had sex with me while I was asleep.\"Baldwin did not immediately report the assault to Army leaders and also had trouble remembering the details of the encounter at first.She told CNN that she \"even apologized to him for falling asleep during sex as a way of asking for confirmation that it actually happened.\"\"My rapist responded mentioning it was OK, and ultimately acknowledging that I fell asleep while he had sex with me,\" she said.But the process of piecing together memories of that night was something that took years and extensive therapy, according to Baldwin, who, like Reyes, described feeling confused about the idea that she was \"raped\" by someone she knew. In addition to the July 2011 encounter, Baldwin said she was also subjected to unwanted touching and experienced sexual harassment throughout her time at West Point.Over the span of two years, Baldwin said she was touched against her will on several occasions by two members of the West Point rugby team and was one of several female cadets mentioned in a series of \"sexist and violent\" emails disseminated by rugby players.   Baldwin was dating a member of the rugby team at the time. \"The culture on the West Point rugby team was very disgraceful toward women, especially female cadets,\" she told CNN. \"This behavior was so widely accepted and considered funny, cool and popular that it became a necessity to assimilate to if you wanted to be accepted into this community.\"Baldwin said she and several other female cadets were sexually harassed in the form of an email chain that the rugby team called \"the highs and lows.\" \"Each week, players would submit the 'highs' -- things which deserved praise by the other teammate -- and the 'lows' -- things which deserved shaming by the other teammates. Female cadets were often the subject of the 'highs and lows,'\" Baldwin said. The emails were ultimately turned over to West Point leadership, but the subsequent investigation resulted in a minimal one-week punishment for the team, and those involved were allowed to graduate from the academy with their 2013 class. \"On multiple occasions, the leadership at West Point and throughout the Army commended the rugby team for sticking together and taking the punishment as a team instead of singling out those who were 'worse' offenders than others,\" Baldwin said. The case resurfaced in the summer of 2013, when the Pentagon's Inspector General's office opened an investigation into how West Point leaders handled the situation.During the course of this investigation, Baldwin said she disclosed that she had been touched against her will by members of the rugby team on multiple occasions. Investigators also discovered that Baldwin had revealed the 2011 rape to her boyfriend at the time -- prompting a separate inquiry into the incident. But although investigators found probable cause of rape and sexual assault, officials determined that Baldwin's \"character was questionable and the statements I made could not be relied upon,\" she said.\"The case went no further than this,\" Baldwin added. Report: Military punishes sex assault victimsWhen she pushed investigators for more information, Baldwin said she was told that the case involving the two rugby players was \"put on hold because they were at Ranger school.\"While soldiers who are under investigation or pending any sort of legal, UCMJ or Administrative Action are typically prevented from receiving \"favorable action\" -- like admission to US Army Ranger School -- Baldwin told CNN that she was notified that the two rugby players were not flagged due to a \"mistake\" and would not be removed from the program. Baldwin has previously spoken out about what happened but told CNN she is \"still very disappointed\" in the way it was handled.\"The Army promised on multiple occasions, even at some of the most senior levels (Pentagon), that this would be handled the right way, but at the end of the day, no repercussions have been taken,\" she told CNN. Mishandled casesThe Washington Post reported in February 2017 -- prior to the rise of the #MeToo movement -- that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who currently serves as Trump's national security adviser, was the commanding officer who presided over Baldwin's assault case involving the two rugby players.The Inspector General's office investigated McMaster's handling of the case and found that he had directed the indicators of a pending assault investigation be removed from the two rugby players' records so they could attend Ranger school.McMaster later said that he did not know all the rules for removing that information, and he was not formally reprimanded for his actions despite a memo from the Inspector General that said he mishandled the case.\"I still do not know the answer to this question -- whether anything was done in response to these two Rugby players sexually assaulting me,\" Baldwin said, adding that she recently found out that McMaster was also a rugby player while attending West Point as a cadet. McMaster did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN on the case.All three officers named in Baldwin's reports now have leadership roles in the military, she said. \"They are still active-duty Army officers, and as they continue to be promoted and progress in their careers, they will take command at higher echelons over larger units of soldiers,\" Baldwin told CNN. \"I am concerned that one day they, accused of sexual assault themselves (and admitting to it), will be in a position, as commanders, to preside over other cases like this.\"When asked why she decided to remain in the service after her experience reporting sexual assault and harassment, Baldwin said that while she has the \"utmost respect for those survivors\" who chose to leave that she wanted to promote change from the inside. \"I think a lot of survivors are given an escape route and pushed out the door. However, for me, I want to be a part of the change,\" she said. A 'pervasive pattern' of silenceWhile the call to address the issue of sexual abuse in the military has gained momentum in recent months, many victims and experts said the Pentagon must do more to address cultural and systemic issues that exist if it is serious about meaningful reform.\"Despite the many efforts made by the military to address sexual assault and harassment, 58% of those who report a sexual assault also report being retaliated against, and only 4% of cases result in conviction,\" said Lydia C. Watts, CEO of the Service Women's Action Network, or SWAN. \"True progress will be measured when there is a wholesale culture change in which retaliation is not tolerated, survivors feel safe coming forward and there are swift and fair prosecutions.\"In November, the Defense Department's watchdog named \"ensuring ethical conduct\" one of the top 10 \"management and performance\" challenges for the Pentagon in 2018.JUST WATCHEDNot just Hollywood: Survivors share their storiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNot just Hollywood: Survivors share their stories 02:01\"In the category of personal misconduct, there has been a steady trend in substantiated allegations of improper relationships and sexual misconduct,\" the report said.When asked what message she would like to convey to Defense Secretary James Mattis about the issue of sexual assault, Reyes said, \"Something needs to change. What they are doing now isn't working.\" The ongoing public discussion about sexual assault perpetrated by celebrities and politicians also reveals an ironic truth about a \"pervasive pattern\" of silence that has existed for decades, according to Speedy. \"I think there is just a big veil of secrecy,\" she said, noting that the military maintains a similar history of failing to report crimes to revelations within the entertainment, political and media realms. \"We protect our own,\" Speedy said, \"but we are protecting perps, not victims.\"",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)President Trump's secretary of state has dubbed Julian Assange's group WikiLeaks a \"hostile intelligence service.\" Trump's national security adviser once called on the US to use WikiLeaks for \"target practice.\" And his attorney general asserted that the arrest of Assange remains a \"priority\" for the United States.But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher sees Assange differently.\"He's a very honorable man,\" Rohrabacher told CNN.Rohrabacher, a California Republican facing a potentially difficult re-election this fall, occupies an unusual space in politics. He's an unapologetic defender of someone viewed as a villain in Washington and a sharp skeptic of the widely held view in Congress and from US intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the US elections. Stone, on day he sent Assange dinner email, also said 'devastating' WikiLeaks were forthcomingIn an interview with CNN, the Russia-friendly congressman doubled down on his stance, vigorously defending Assange and offering details about a meeting he initiated -- along with a controversial, far-right blogger -- with the WikiLeaks founder at the Ecuadorian embassy last summer in London where he has been out of reach of authorities since 2012. Read MoreRohrabacher, 70, came away from that meeting assured that the hack at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 2016 -- viewed with certainty by the US intelligence community as an attack orchestrated by Russia -- had nothing to do with the Kremlin.  It was, as Rohrabacher asserted, an \"inside job,\" though there's no evidence to suggest that's the case.\"No, I do not,\" Rohrabacher said flatly when asked if he believed the Russians were behind the hack of the DNC and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails.\"He said, 'I have physical proof that the Russians did not give me this,'\" Rohrabacher said, referring to Assange. \"And [Assange said] that 'I have physical proof that I would be very happy to provide once I can leave the Ecuadorian embassy without being arrested.'\"Ecuador suspends Julian Assange's internet access at London embassyRohrabacher, a former aide to Ronald Reagan who has served in the House for nearly three decades, tried to take Assange's message directly to Trump but was denied a meeting by White House chief of staff John Kelly, something the California Republican attributed to the Mueller investigation. A source familiar with the White House's thinking said officials feared Trump would seize onto Rohrabacher's cause to rebut allegations of campaign collusion with Russia, but doing so would put Trump at sharp odds with the rest of his government that has pinned the blame for election meddling squarely on the Kremlin.\"That's what I wanted to talk to the President about,\" Rohrabacher said, referring to Assange's promise to provide information to Washington exonerating Russia in exchange for allowing him to be released from the embassy without being arrested by the US. \"But now I've been cut off from that because of the fear that the special counsel here will use that as an excuse to expand this nonsensical witch hunt.\"Hot Pockets, mismatched chairs and a critical mission: Inside year one of the Mueller investigationRohrabacher has spoken with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about his interactions with Assange, but he has yet to speak to Mueller's team. His deputy chief of staff, Paul Behrends, who also has Russia contacts, has spoken to the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to Rohrabacher's spokesman.Last year US officials told CNN that authorities have prepared charges to seek the arrest of Assange -- who has been under investigation by the Justice Department dating back to at least 2010 when WikiLeaks posted thousands of files stolen by the former US Army intelligence analyst now known as Chelsea Manning.That preceded the effort in 2016 when hackers working for Russian intelligence agencies stole thousands of emails from the DNC and officials in the Clinton campaign and used intermediaries to pass along the documents to WikiLeaks, according to a public assessment by US intelligence agencies.But Rohrabacher, who views himself as a \"Libertarian conservative\" and Assange as a \"Libertarian leftist,\" sees it differently. While he said \"a few times\" WikiLeaks has released information that has been \"damaging to our national security,\" Rohrabacher added: \"I think he's had a good positive influence on our country and the world by making information available that was not available.\"How Dana met Julian Late one night last year while hosting a barbeque at his home in California, Rohrabacher struck up a conversation with Chuck Johnson, a conservative blogger with controversial views who has a friendly relationship with the congressman. Johnson told CNN that the two discussed meeting in London since they both planned to be in Europe on separate trips at the same time. Their plan: Meet with Assange, with whom Johnson says he has a prior relationship and speaks with on a \"semi-regular basis\" through his associates.Rohrabacher, who became the first congressman known to have met with Assange, paid for the trip out of his own pocket since it was not authorized by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he serves as a member, according to a congressional aide. Rohrabacher has long contended that his position on the panel has encouraged him to build closer ties to Russia.The two Americans met in a conference room of the Ecuadorian embassy with just Assange and his attorney present. Rohrabacher first had to convince the WikiLeaks founder he was not one of \"those deep state guys\" -- and was on Assange's side.Rep. Rohrabacher says 'rendezvous' being set up with Trump to relay info from WikiLeaks' Assange on DNC hack\"He had to get a feeling that he could trust me and he knows I'm not there as basically an agent for the government,\" Rohrabacher said.During their three-hour meeting, Rohrabacher recalled discussing their respective philosophies about government -- and talking at length about the 2016 meddling in the elections. Assange made the case that the Russians were not behind the 2016 attacks on the US elections.\"He showed us the evidence that the Russians were not involved,\" Johnson said. \"He said he would love to open up a channel of communication with the Trump administration, and we said we would see what we would do on that front.\"Both Rohrabacher and Johnson said Assange did not disclose having any contacts with Trump associates during the 2016 elections. \"I didn't talk to him about that,\" Rohrabacher said.Roger Stone claimed to know of WikiLeaks email release date, despite saying otherwiseWhen they returned to Washington, Johnson said they pursued the matter with White House officials and several lawmakers, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whom the two met with, according to Johnson. Paul declined to comment. \"I don't have anything for you,\" he said when asked about the meeting.Johnson said he had a \"pretty good conversation\" with Paul but the senator was \"resigned to the fact\" that there was no way to pursue their cause.\"No one really wanted to touch the matter,\" Johnson said. And virtually no one on Capitol Hill shares Rohrabacher's rosy view of Assange.\"Deep staters believe that he's a bad guy and an evil person,\" Rohrabacher said. \"I don't.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)The United States combined with the armed forces of the United Kingdom and France early Saturday to carry out airstrikes against the chemical weapons facilities maintained by the regime of Syria. Here are some of the weapons they used:UK Tornado fightersAn RAF Tornado taxis into its hangar after landing at the British air force base in Akrotiri, Cyprus, after a Syria strike mission, April 14, 2018.Britain contributed four Tornado fighter jets armed with Storm Shadow cruise missiles to the operation, the UK's Ministry of Defense said. Officials later said Typhoon fighter jets also participated in the mission.The jets took off from RAF Akrotiri, the Royal Air Force base on Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean, and targeted a Syrian chemical weapons site in Homs, the British Ministry of Defense said.The twin-engine Tornado GR4 is the United Kingdom's main ground-attack aircraft, and they were armed with Storm Shadow missiles, an air-launched weapon that carries a 400-kilogram (900-pound) warhead as far as 400 kilometers (250 miles). That means the Tornadoes will not have been required to fly far, and would not have needed to cross into Syrian airspace to launch their strikes. Read MoreThe British jets fired a total of eight Storm Shadow missiles, Pentagon officials said.French Rafale jetsA French Dassault Rafale receives fuel from a KC-10 tanker in 2016.

Like the British Tornado, the twin-engine Rafale could be armed with Storm Shadow missiles that can fly for more than 250 miles.This means jets could strike without having to fly over Syria and avoid anti-aircraft defenses.US officials said French Mirage jets were also used in the attack and that the French aircraft fired a total of nine missiles. US B-1 bombersA US B-1 bomber releases a JASSM missile like the ones fired against Syria early Saturday.Pentagon officials said the US Air Force used two B-1B bombers in the Syria strike.Syria strikes related coverageLive blog: Latest developmentsUS and allies launch Syria strikesWhat we know and don't know After Syria strikes, now what?Weapons used in strikes on SyriaTrump's rationale highlights contradictionsThe four-engine B-1s fired 19 air-launched JASSM cruise missiles, which carry 450-kilogram (1,000-pound) warheads and have a range of more than 370 kilometers (230 miles). That means the B-1s would not have needed to expose themselves to Syrian air defenses to make their strikes.The defense sources did not say from where the B-1s flew, but Air Force media earlier this month showed the bombers arriving at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, on the Arabian peninsula. US guided-missile cruisers, destroyers and submarinesThe US Navy's guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey can carry dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles.The Pentagon said three US warships and one submarine using Tomahawk cruise missiles participated in the Syria strikes.From the Red Sea, the cruiser USS Monterey fired 30 Tomahawks and the destroyer USS Laboon launched seven more.Meanwhile, the destroyer USS Higgins fired 23 Tomahawks from the North Arabian Gulf.Watch as @USNavy #sailors aboard #USSJohnWarner (SSN 765) launch a Tomahawk land attack missile on April 14, the from the\u200b \u200b#MediterraneanSea as part of a multi-national strike operation against the Syrian government. @subgru2 pic.twitter.com/0ynZsRjjPc\u2014 U.S. Dept of Defense (@DeptofDefense) April 14, 2018\n\nThe attack submarine USS John Warner fired six Tomahawks from the Mediterranean Sea.The US Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, Ticonderoga-class cruisers and Virginia-class submarines carry dozens of Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of up to 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles).Tomahawk cruise missileThe guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey fires a Tomahawk land-attack missile in strikes on Syria early Saturday.The Tomahawk cruise missile has been the military's go-to weapon in operations such as the one conducted Saturday. It was also used a year ago when the United States fired nearly 60 Tomahawks at a Syrian airbase following a previous use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.     The Tomahawk is carried by the dozens by US and British warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, and is capable of delivering a 1,000-pound warhead.It is designed to fly extremely low and can navigate around defenses using its on-board guidance systems. Its target can also be changed mid-flight through communication with controllers.French frigates and cruise missilesThe French multimission frigate Aquitaine France fired three cruises missiles from one its multimission frigates in the Syria strikes, the Pentagon said.Tir d'un missile de croisi\u00e8re naval depuis une de nos fr\u00e9gates multimissions cette nuit en M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.

The F-35 fighter jet is touted as the future of military aviation; a lethal and versatile aircraft that combines stealth capabilities, supersonic speed, extreme agility and state-of-the-art sensor fusion technology, according to Lockheed Martin, the plane's primary contractor. Read MoreHowever, the aircraft, which is the most expensive weapons system in history, has also drawn sharp criticism in recent years after facing a long list of setbacks -- including problems with the software, engines and weapon systems.     And critics have continued to express skepticism about the F-35's combat capability despite reassurances by US military leaders who say the kinks are being worked out. The US Air Force became the first military service to declare its version of the F-35 ready for combat in August 2016.The Marine Corps accomplished a significant milestone last year by deploying its variant to Japan -- the aircraft's first permanent overseas deployment. But Israel's announcement on Tuesday marks the first time that the F-35 has been used in an actual combat situation -- a significant moment given the program's checkered past. Over the past five decades, Israel has sought to maintain its superiority in the skies over the Middle East -- perceiving many threats in its neighborhood, including the Syrian conflict and missile attacks from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon.In recent years, Russia has also introduced its S-300 and more advanced S-400 surface-to-air missiles systems in Syria -- a challenge to Israel's regional air superiority.Israel acquired the F-35 in response. The fighter can fly virtually undetected but stealth technology does not guarantee a jet can fly unseen.US shows off new F-35 fighter jets ahead of US-South Korea drills Nicknamed the \"Mighty One\" by the Israeli press, the F-35 is part of a $38 billion Memorandum of Understanding between Israel and the US covering a 10-year period beginning in 2019.The Israeli Air Force has ordered 50 F-35s from the US -- each with a price tag of more than $100 million. It received its first aircraft in 2016 and declared its fleet operationally capable in December of 2017.   CNN's Ian Lee contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The White House warned Beijing on Thursday that there will be consequences for its growing militarization in the South China Sea, following reports of missiles being deployed to three of the country's outposts in the disputed region.US intelligence assessed that there is a high probability the Chinese military had deployed anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles to three artificial islands during recent military drills on the contested sea. But a US defense official told CNN it was unclear if the missiles remained on the outposts following the April exercises.The South China Sea is one of the most contested regions in the world, with overlapping territorial claims by China, the Philippines and Vietnam, among several others.The move would mark the first reported Chinese missile deployment in the Spratly Islands, a series of small inlets and reefs that Beijing has slowly built into militarized, artificial islands to reinforce its claims.Read MoreWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that the United States has \"raised concerns\" with the Chinese. \"We're well aware of China's militarization of the South China Sea,\" she said.\"There will be near-term and long-term consequences, and we'll certainly keep you up to date,\" she added.     CNBC first reported the Chinese military had deployed the weapons systems to Subi Reef, Fiery Cross Reef and Mischief Reef, west of the Philippines, on Thursday, quoting a source with knowledge of US intelligence reports.According to CNBC, the YJ-12B anti-ship missiles would be able to strike ships up to 295 nautical miles away from the artificial islands.Beijing previously announced in 2016 it had already deployed similar weapons to Woody Island in the Paracel Islands, on the northwestern edge of the South China Sea.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday the deployment of \"necessary national defense facilities\" to the artificial islands were within China's rights.\"It has nothing to do with militarization,\" she told reporters at her daily press briefing. \"The US constantly strengthens its military deployment in the South China Sea ... they should consider the consequence of this. We think the US should reflect on its wrong doing.\"She said on Thursday China has \"indisputable sovereignty\" over the contested islands.This aerial photograph of Fiery Cross reef obtained by the Philippine Inquirer and taken on November 28, 2017.'Point of no return': expertChina's militarization has alarmed countries both in the region and around the world, prompting freedom of navigation operations by the US Navy to assert its right to travel in international waters.\"The United States has long raised concerns about the militarization of outposts on disputed features in the South China Sea,\" said a State Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Xi Jinping's China shows off force in South China Sea\"China's leadership has publicly pledged not to pursue militarization in the disputed Spratlys. We are concerned that China is not acting in accordance with this pledge.\"Speaking during a visit to Australia on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was important not to have any one \"hegemony\" in the region.\"What's important is to preserve a rules-based development in the region, especially the Indo-Pacific region and to preserve the necessary balances,\" he said.Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told CNN-affiliate Sky News Australia on Friday said if the media reports were correct, she would be \"concerned.\" \"This would be contrary to China's stated aspiration that it would not militarize these features,\" she said.But China's steady military buildup on the islands is reaching a \"point of no return,\" Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies' Maritime Security Program, told CNN\"There is no way we can reverse all these ongoing additions, it will be up to China. They will decide whether they will deploy these systems or withdraw these systems. All we can do is manage it,\" Koh said.China's unmovable aircraft carriersBeijing claims an enormous swath of territory through the center of the sea, delineated by the Chinese government's controversial \"nine-dash line\" which runs all the way from Hainan Province down to Malaysia and back past Taiwan.In a ruling in July 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague ruled China's territorial claims had no legal basis.Nevertheless, Beijing has attempted to reinforce its hold on the area by creating and militarizing artificial islands in the Spratlys and the Paracels.JUST WATCHEDUS aircraft carrier visits VietnamReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS aircraft carrier visits Vietnam 02:39Koh said China's string of militarized islands -- equipped with airfields and radar facilities -- have become like a series of immovable aircraft carriers.He said that the missiles will allow China's armed forces to form \"a multilayer military umbrella over the South China Sea,\" with interlocking sensors and weapons systems.Satellite imagery had previously emerged of China building installations to hold these missiles, said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\"This is exactly what we have expected the Chinese to do,\" she said. \"Next thing we'll see is fighter aircraft to deploy, probably on rotation, then they'll begin exercises near the islands. I just think that (Beijing) believes everybody, including the claimants, understands this is inevitable.\"Pentagon chief spokeswoman Dana White reaffirmed the United States' commitment to the international waters. She said the Chinese must understand that \"they cannot, and should not, be hostile, and understand that the Pacific is -- is a place in which much commerce goes through. And it's in their interest to ensure that there's a free navigation of international waters.\"Rapid militarizationThe missile deployments are just the latest example of Beijing tightening its hold on the South China Sea in recent years, as the world's attention focused farther north, on the Korean Peninsula.In April, the Wall Street Journal reported US officials had confirmed China had installed military radar jamming equipment on the Spratly Islands.China challenged Australian warships in South China Sea, reports sayThe same month, Australian warships en route to Vietnam were challenged by the Chinese navy as they traversed the South China Sea, leading Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to assert Australia's right to travel international waters.Hanging over everything was a massive display of Chinese military might in the sea on April 12, culminating in a parade led by Beijing's only aircraft carrier and personally reviewed by President Xi Jinping.The United States under the Trump administration has increased the number of freedom of navigation operations near China's artificial islands, but Glaser said it was difficult for the United States to stand up to Beijing with little support in the region.\"(China) believes they can get away with it and they have probably calculated correctly,\" she said. \"The big question has always been: How do we impose enough costs so we stop the Chinese where they are, and not go any further? And so far we haven't been successful in that.\"Adm. Philip Davidson, nominated to take charge of the US Pacific Command, told his confirmation hearing last month that China is already the master of the South China Sea.\"China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,\" Davidson said in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\"The PLA [People's Liberation Army] will be able to use these bases to challenge US presence in the region, and any forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\" Davidson wrote.The admiral also pointed to the fact that China's current activity contradicts what Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a White House meeting with then-US President Barack Obama in 2015.On the topic of the South China Sea, Xi said at the time that \"China does not intend to pursue militarization.\"But, speaking at his testimony last month, Davidson noted that China's \"forward operating bases\" now appear complete. \"The only thing lacking are the deployed forces,\" said Davidson.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US, South Korea and Japan agreed this week to shift a planned flight of at least two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers so they would not fly over the Korean Peninsula, according to two US defense officials.The decision was made in the wake of North Korea's objection to US military exercises in the region and a suggestion from Pyongyang that the upcoming summit between Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump could be at risk. North Korea threatened to cancel the planned summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, saying the US should carefully consider the fate of the upcoming meeting, in view of what it calls \"provocative military disturbances with South Korea,\" North Korea's state news agency reported early Wednesday local time.North Korea warns US as it suspends South Korea talks over military drills Officials said Friday it was not clear to them whether the decision to shift the route of the aircraft was in response to Kim's statement but noted the move was part of an effort to try to ease the prospect of North Korea being able to claim the US was engaging in provocative behavior. The officials insist the bomber missions, which have been going on for several years, are not considered military exercises.Read MoreOfficially, the Pentagon refused to comment. \"We continue to coordinate with our allies but for operational security reasons we cannot comment on future or ongoing operations.

        "content": "It was a once-in-a-decade display of American firepower.  Three US Navy aircraft carriers -- the largest, most sophisticated warships in history -- assembled off the Korean Peninsula, in a move timed to coincide with US President Donald Trump's first official visit to the region.But behind the dramatic show of force, questions are emerging as to whether the US Navy is up to the challenges it faces in the Pacific -- from both a nuclear-armed North Korea and a strengthening China -- at a time when its top leaders acknowledge it lacks the money, manpower and weapons to ensure success. And when a massive corruption scandal threatens the ranks of dozens of its top officers.The three-carrier exercise, conducted in early November with South Korean and Japanese warships, was just one of about 160 multilateral and bilateral exercises performed this year in the area of operations overseen by the Navy's 7th Fleet, a Navy spokesperson told CNN. That's about one exercise every two days.And the tempo of operations isn't slowing.        The aircraft carriers USS Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson steam with their strike groups and ships from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force during bilateral training in June.Read MoreStretched too thin?Just two days after the three carriers -- the USS Ronald Reagan, USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz, and their multi-ship strike groups -- wrapped up four days of war games off Korea, the USS Ronald Reagan, with its air wing and three guided-missile destroyers, began a 10-day exercise with Japanese naval units off Okinawa.While the US exercises are intended to reassure Asian allies and to show North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the United States will not be intimidated by Pyongyang's testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, the moves also highlight concerns that the 7th Feet is being stretched too thin.The toll of operations in the Pacific has been grim this year. Two US guided-missile destroyers, USS Fitzgerald and USS John S McCain, suffered collisions with merchant ships, leaving 17 US sailors dead and the two warships needing hundreds of millions of dollars in repairs.The accidents, off Japan and Singapore respectively, also left the Navy wondering how two of the most sophisticated ships on the seas couldn't even navigate crowded shipping lanes. In total, the 7th Fleet has clocked up five major non-combat incidents in 2017 involving ships and an additional two involving aircraft, including Wednesday's crash in the Philippine Sea of a plane taking personnel to the Reagan.\n\n\n\nJan-31\n\nTuesday 31 January:USS Antietam runs aground in Tokyo Bay\n\nThe USS Antietam, a guided-missile cruiser, damaged its propellers and spilled hydraulic oil into the water after running aground while the ship was anchoring in Tokyo Bay.\n\n\n\nMay-9\n\nTuesday 9 May:USS Lake Champlain collides with South Korean fishing boat\n\nThe guided-missile cruiser was struck by a 60- to 70-foot-long South Korean fishing boat while conducting operations in international waters near the Korean Peninsula, the Navy said.\n\n\n\nJune-17\n\nSaturday 17 June:USS Fitzgerald collides with Philippine cargo ship\n\nThe collision between the Fitzgerald, a guided-missile destroyer, and the ACX Crystal on June 17 claimed the lives of seven US sailors. It took place 56 nautical miles off the coast of Honshu, Japan, in an area heavily traveled by commercial shipping.\n\n\n\nAug-21\n\nMonday 21 August:USS John S McCain collides with oil tanker off Singapore\n\nThe US guided-missile destroyer collided with a Liberian oil tanker in crowded shipping lanes off Singapore, leaving 10 US sailors dead and five more injured. The accident left a large highly visible hole in the US ship.\n\n\n\nNov-18\n\nSaturday 18 November:USS Benfold struck by Japanese tugboat\n\nThe guided-missile destroyer USS Benfold was struck by a Japanese tugboat while participating in a scheduled towing exercise off Japan. The tug boat lost propulsion and drifted into the US ship, the Navy said. No one was injured.\n\n\n\n\n\nA US Government Accountability Office report from September warned lengthy deployments of US ships based in Japan -- as both the Fitzgerald and McCain had been at the time of their collisions -- often result in key training requirements being neglected due to the demands of operational duties, something the report describes as a \"problem.\"Without training time, \"perishable skills atrophy,\" said Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor who spent 10 years \"driving\" US warships.\"Military commands are like a football team, you constantly have to practice,\" added Schuster. Appearing before the House Armed Services Committee as part of an investigation into the series of fatal crashes and collisions at sea, the Navy's No. 2 officer, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran, said the Navy is trying to do too much with too little.\"We continue to have a supply-and-demand problem which is placing a heavy strain on the force,\" said Moran.All of these things culminate with this notion we aren't big enough to do everything we're being tasked to doVice Chief of US Naval Operations Adm. William Moran\"All of these things culminate with this notion we aren't big enough to do everything we're being tasked to do,\" Moran added. \"And our culture is, 'we're going to get it done,' because that's what the Navy is all about. And sometimes our culture works against us.\"It's an opinion shared throughout the naval establishment, where frustrations are mounting as to the rising set of operational demands placed on the 7th Fleet. In a testimony delivered to Congress in September, John Pendleton, director of defense capabilities and management in the Government Accountability Office (GAO), said the Navy was operating on what people in the service call a 'train on the margins' approach.That means ships had no dedicated training time but instead fit whatever they could into time on missions, said Pendleton.Exhausted crews can make bad decisions. As Schuster points out, in the case of the Fitzgerald collision, officers on watch did not wake the sleeping captain when the warship got in range of the merchant vessel.\"They were either incredibly complacent or sloppy beyond description,\" said Schuster. The Navy has launched multiple investigations, a safety pause, and reviews in the wake of the recent accidents.During an appearance at the House Armed Services Committee hearing in September, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer said the reviews will include a chief of naval operations-led \"comprehensive review\" that will \"take a look at the tactical and operational situation\" as well as a departmental \"strategic readiness review\" that he said will involve \"an independent team comprised of military and industry experts that will look and examine root causes, accountability, long-term systemic issues, and then provide remedial insight.\"\"We are taking immediate corrective actions to ensure we meet the training and material readiness standard to prevent another mishap,\" Richardson said.The Navy has also taken several personnel actions, including sacking the commanders of the Fitzgerald and the McCain, several other senior officers, as well as the commander of 7th Fleet, Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, the first time a fleet commander has been relieved of duty in the history of the US Navy. Aucoin, who had been commander of the fleet since September 2015, was dismissed \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command.\"        F/A-18 Hornets fly over US and South Korean warships during an exercise off the Korean Peninsula.The Navy's internal report on the Fitzgerald and McCain collisions, released in early November, said cutting corners to meet demands on 7th Fleet ships had become the norm.\"The risks that were taken in the Western Pacific accumulated over time, and did so insidiously,\" the report said. \"The dynamic environment normalized to the point where individuals and groups of individuals could no longer recognize that the processes in place to identify and assess readiness were no longer working at the ship and headquarters level.\"Surveys of sailors aboard the Japan-based guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh carried out between June 2015 and August this year point to severe morale problems.One sailor described serving aboard the ship as being akin to being on \"a floating prison,\" according to surveys obtained via the Freedom of Information Act by Navy Times.The survey responses, which run into the hundreds of pages and list a variety of complaints, including suicidal thoughts and despair, also show that junior sailors were concerned about receiving harsh punishments from the Shiloh's then-commander, Capt. Adam M. Aycoc, including being placed in the brig and fed only \"bread and water.\"\"Even the taxi drivers on base know us for being the 'USS Bread and Water,'\" one survey respondent said.Pressure mountingTop commanders acknowledge the Navy may be asking too much of its sailors, ships and aircraft. Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee earlier this month, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker, commander of the US naval air forces, detailed the extraordinary lengths the Navy now has to go to send fully equipped carrier air groups to sea, due to the low stocks of working equipment -- including fighter jets and trained personnel.\"To get Carl Vinson, Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt ready to deploy in January, June and October of this year, and equip their embarked air wings with the required number of mission capable jets, 94 strike fighters had to be transferred, to and from the maintenance depots, or between F-18 squadrons on both coasts,\" said Shoemaker.While this exercise is encouraging, the reality remains that our Navy is underfunded, over-tasked, and too small.US Sen. John McCainIn September, Moran said hundreds of parts were cannibalized from some F/A-18s and used on others to get carrier-based squadrons combat ready.One congressional aide told CNN that having to reshuffle 94 fighters to equip three carriers is \"crazy.\" The problem also directly impacted the sailors and pilots aboard those ships as the Navy was forced to fill gaps in those deploying squadrons and the three carriers by temporarily reassigning more than 300 sailors or extending their deployments beyond normal lengths, Shoemaker said.Such moves, which Shoemaker called a strike fighter \"shell game,\" hurt morale, meaning personnel don't sign up to extend their Navy careers, leaving positions open and years of training and experience wasted.Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, applauded the Navy for conducting exercises with three carriers near the Korean Peninsula but also highlighted several of the shortfalls plaguing the service.\"Too often exercises like this, which are critical to maintaining tactical proficiency, are sacrificed due to higher priority operations, maintenance delays, or fiscal constraints,\" McCain said in a written statement. \"While this exercise is encouraging, the reality remains that our Navy is underfunded, over-tasked, and too small,\" he said.     Navy commanders have previously warned that years of spending cuts have limited the number of usable aircraft and ships -- an issue that has only escalated amid increasing demands for US military presence.For the Navy's 7th Fleet -- the largest of the Navy's numbered fleets -- that means staying on watch for North Korean provocations, including having ships on the ready that could shoot down ballistic missiles headed for Japan, Guam or even the mainland United States. Those ships included the Fitzgerald, John S McCain and Shiloh.It also includes freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, where the Beijing government has been building man-made islands, installing fortifications to strengthen territorial claims, and deploying new ships and planes that challenge a long-time US technological edge.And then there are exercises with an Indian military eager for US help in increasing its naval capabilities, watching Russian nuclear-armed submarines deploy from that nation's eastern ports into the Pacific, and making port calls from Australia to Vietnam to show the US flag and maintain an American presence.In total, the 7th Fleet's area of operation spans more than 124 million square kilometers, stretching from the International Date Line to the India-Pakistan border; and from the Kuril Islands in the North to Antarctica in the south. We can build up our navy to a level where it can do all of these things without wearing out crews and hardware, or we can 'pivot' or 're-balance' more of our forces to the Pacific theater. James R. Holmes, professor of strategy, US Naval War CollegeIn regard to China, in particular, neither the Obama nor the Trump administrations has shifted forces to the Pacific in sufficient enough numbers or capability, said James R. Holmes, professor of strategy at the US Naval War College. \"China has come to this commonsense realization, and understands that it can grind down adversary sea services just by being active in its 'near seas,' mainly the China seas,\" said Holmes. \"Imposing a swift 'optempo' on your opponent, meaning keeping him on the go all the time, wearies him over time. And while that hasn't been a direct cause of this year's mishaps, it does contribute to crew fatigue, cut down on training time, and thus exacerbate the factors our navy cited in its recent collision reports.\"In response, the Navy has two options, said Holmes. \"We can build up our navy to a level where it can do all of these things without wearing out crews and hardware, or we can 'pivot' or 're-balance' more of our forces to the Pacific theater.\" Holmes points out that while large, the 7th Fleet represents only a part of the US Navy. \"If we can no longer overpower opponents in both the Atlantic and Pacific, then we need to make some hard choices about where to apply the bulk of our effort -- and accept that that means accepting risk in the other theater.\"         F/A-18 Hornets fly off the carrier USS Carl Vinson off the Korean Peninsula in March. US officials say they've had to scavenge parts to keep the F/A-18s flyable.Corruption scandal The Navy's operational problems can be tackled, argue experts. But that is without contending with the biggest corruption scandal in US naval history. The ongoing scandal has seen 20 current and former Navy officials charged so far in a fraud and bribery investigation stretching across Asia.Known as the so-called \"Fat Leonard\" scandal, the investigation centers on former defense contractor Leonard Glenn \"Fat Leonard\" Francis, whose company provided services to Navy ships including fuel and tugboats.Since the investigation began in 2013, multiple Navy officials have been arrested and accused of accepting cash, prostitutes and all-expenses-paid trips in exchange for steering ships to ports where Francis' company operated.In June, Michael Brooks, who served as the US naval attach\u00e9 at the US Embassy in the Philippines from 2006 to 2008, was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison after admitting to using his influence to benefit Francis in exchange for \"bribes of travel and entertainment expenses, hotel rooms and the services of prostitutes,\" the Justice Department said.The Washington Post reported in early November that the Navy is reviewing the actions of 440 more active-duty and retired personnel in connections with the scandal. According to the report, sixty current and former admirals are included in the review.In an article published earlier this month by Stars and Stripes, Capt. Michael Junge, a military professor at the US Naval War College, linked the scandal to wider, more systemic problems. \"There's no way you could have as much churn as Fat Leonard caused in the last few years in 7th Fleet and have it not impact what's been going on,\" said Junge. \"You just can't separate it.\"         The US 7th Fleet this year has participated in about 160 exercises with other countries, including this one with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force.The coming storm The US Pacific Fleet was first established in 1907, though it can trace its origins back much further to the formation of the Pacific Squadron in 1821. Since then, it has seen its size grow in line with its overall strategic importance, as Asia -- and East Asia in particular -- became a focal point of US foreign policy.Today the fleet is the world's largest, with approximately 200 ships and submarines, nearly 1,200 aircraft, and more than 130,000 sailors and civilians.Since coming to office President Trump has set the goal of bolstering the Navy's overall size to 355 ships, up from its current total of 308.But the goal also means keeping what's in the fleet in working order -- and that's no easy task. Maintenance delays are currently sidelining 11 Navy ships, a congressional aide told CNN.A September report from the Government Accountability Office found that the Navy's shipyard facilities and equipment in poor condition with a backlog of restoration and maintenance that will take at least 19 years to clear. Lawmakers have often cited budget caps implemented by Congress and President Barack Obama in 2011, coupled with the high demand for the fleet's services, as key factors contributing to the Navy's lack of fiscal flexibility,\" the report said.\"Inadequate facilities and equipment led to maintenance delays that contributed in part to more than 1,300 lost operational days \u2014 days when ships were unavailable for operations \u2014 for aircraft carriers and 12,500 lost operational days for submarines,\" according to the report.       \nThe littoral combat ship USS Coronado fires a Harpoon missile during Exercise Pacific Griffin, conducted with the Singaporean navy.In early November, the House of Representatives passed an annual defense policy bill that -- if passed by the Senate -- would authorize the full ship maintenance budget requested by the Navy and provide additional funding for more aircraft. \"This year's National Defense Authorization Act will help address this problem by increasing funding for the Navy, including authorizing five additional ships and hundreds of millions of dollars for maintenance above and beyond the President's budget request,\" McCain said in a statement. But while the defense bill is a move in the right direction, the funding authorized won't fix the readiness problem -- an issue that will take years to address, according to Randy Forbes, a former US representative who served as chairman of the House Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee. \"This is not a spigot you can turn on and off,\" Forbes said, referring to defense funding. \"If we get into a conflict you will fight with what you have so it is important to project out what you need.\"And while Forbes recognized the Navy's need to flex its muscle through exercises like those conducted near Korea, he said the US must address the fleet's \"diminishing surge capacity\" as a potential conflict will likely require a response by more than three carriers to carry out the operations plan.To ensure its carrier strike groups are able to respond to an emerging conflict, the US must launch a course to \"rebuild the Navy,\" Forbes told CNN. \"The current math won't work,\" Forbes said. \"It's going to take an overall rebuilding of the Navy to meet the challenges around the globe.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe missile went higher than any previous North Korean test North Korea has tested 23 missiles in 16 tests since February Washington (CNN)North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, topped with a \"super-large heavy warhead,\" which is capable of striking the US mainland.The country's state media made the announcement Wednesday, hours after leader Kim Jong Un ordered the 3 a.m. launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, which reached the highest altitude ever recorded by a North Korean missile.Image from Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's official newspaper, which published photos said to be of the latest missile launch.State news agency KCNA called its so-called new missile \"the most powerful ICBM\" and said it \"meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development.After the launch, Kim said North Korea had \"finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force,\" according to KCNA.US Defense Secretary James Mattis said earlier the missile launched demonstrated North Korea had the ability to hit \"everywhere in the world.\" Read More     The launch was the first since September, and came despite repeated warnings from President Donald Trump who told reporters at the White House after the launch that the US \"will handle\" the situation. \"We will take care of it,\" the President said. The Hwasong-15 soared 4,475 kilometers (2,800 miles) in the sky, spending 53 minutes in the air, before splashing down in waters off the coast of Japan, North Korea said. The figures tallied with estimates released by Japan and South Korea.JUST WATCHEDTrump on North Korea launch: We will handle itReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump on North Korea launch: We will handle it 00:17Mattis, who was with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, outlined how much tougher that situation has become. The test missile, he said, went \"higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken\" and demonstrates that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now has the ability to hit \"everywhere in the world basically.\"\"The bottom line is, it's a continued effort to build a threat -- a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace and certainly the United States,\" Mattis concluded.David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists said that if the missile hadn't been lofted into the sky and had flown on a standard trajectory, it would have been capable of traveling 13,000 kilometers, or 8,100 miles. \"Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, DC, and in fact any part of the continental United States,\" Wright said in a statement, though he noted that range probably wouldn't be possible if the missile were fitted with a heavy nuclear warhead.The missile was launched from the west part of North Korea and is likely to have landed in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, according to Masaki Hikida, public relations officer at Japan's Ministry of Defense. Another image from Rodong Sinmun said to be of the latest missile launch.The flight time would suggest that this was a major ICBM test \"possibly in operational settings\" and should \"disabuse US officials from thinking military displays, sanctions, or threats are deterring North Korean tests,\" according to Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists. \"Today's test proves that Pyongyang still feels able to test at will,\" he told CNN, adding it also shows the Trump administration \"has to get serious about deterring an atmospheric nuclear test.\"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho had hinted in September that Pyongyang could carry out an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean, possibly by strapping a warhead atop a missile or dropping it from an airplane.CondemnationsSecretary of State Rex Tillerson strongly condemned the launch and called for redoubled international pressure on Pyongyang, saying that the US \"remains committed to finding a peaceful path to denuclearization.\" But he added a lightly veiled warning about limited US patience. \"Diplomatic options remain viable and open, for now,\" Tillerson said. JUST WATCHEDGraham warns of war with North KoreaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGraham warns of war with North Korea 01:42Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that, \"If we have to go to war to stop this, we will. If there's a war with North Korea it will be because North Korea brought it on itself, and we're headed to a war if things don't change.\" On Wednesday, a North Korea official reiterated comments made to CNN in October that there would be no diplomacy until the country has proven its nuclear capabilities.The official added the two steps needed to achieve this goal were the \"testing of a long-range ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile)\" capable of reaching the US, followed by an above-ground nuclear detonation. \"Before we can engage in diplomacy with the Trump administration, we want to send a clear message that the DPRK has a reliable defensive and offensive capability to counter any aggression from the United States,\" the official said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Prior to today's launch, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle had warned of devastating consequences if the US takes military action against North Korea. Pyongyang can batter Seoul with a barrage of conventional weapons, putting millions of South Koreans and more than 28,000 US troops stationed there within range.     Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking from Tokyo, issued a warning of his own. The latest missile launch, he said, \"significantly undermines the strong determination of the international community's peaceful resolution of the issue.\"International diplomacy swiftly kicked into high gear, with US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley requesting an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council with her counterparts from South Korea and Japan. That meeting is set to take place Wednesday afternoon. Carrots and sticksMeanwhile, Tillerson announced that the US and Canada will convene a meeting of nations that contribute military forces to the UN Command that supports South Korea to discuss \"how the global community can counter North Korea's threat to international peace.\" For decades, multiple US administrations and international coalitions have tried and failed to curb Pyongyang's nuclear program, whether they've used carrots or sticks. Sometimes, North Korea has taken the carrots -- aid and greater access to the international system -- and still continued its program.Sanctions, the latest round of which the US announced on November 22, seem to have made little difference in curbing North Korea's resolve to obtain nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.JUST WATCHEDDefector recovering after daring escape ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDefector recovering after daring escape  03:23The Center for International and Strategic Studies, which closely monitors North Korean launches through its Beyond Parallel initiative, said historical data shows that Pyongyang is set to significantly ratchet up its testing in the first half of 2018.South Korea demonstrated some of its efforts to prepare for North Korean hostilities on Tuesday. The country's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the South Korean military had carried out a \"precision missile strike drill\" just minutes after North Korea's launch.The precision missile strike matched the flight distance of the North Korean missile and landed in waters off the east coast of South Korea, effectively showing North Korea it can hit the exact location where Pyongyang launched the Hwasong-15. \"Our army, navy and air force jointly fired three missiles (a ground-to-ground missile, a ship-to-ground missile and an air-to surface missile) and hit the same target around the similar time to show its ability to target North Korea's origin of provocation,\" said Park Soo-hyun, a spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Park added that Moon and Trump spoke on the phone for about 20 minutes. 'On hair trigger alert'The point, Mattis told reporters in Washington, was \"to make certain North Korea understands that they could be taken under fire by our ally.\" Mount of the Federation of American Scientists said the South Korean goal was to show the North that \"it has the ability to hit the North's mobile missile launchers or leadership targets.\"\"It is a measured and pointed response but also a reminder that the peninsula remains on hair-trigger alert,\" he told CNN. \"In this situation, provocations or even mistakes could quickly escalate out of control.\"White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Twitter that Trump \"was briefed, while missile was still in the air, on the situation in North Korea.\" JUST WATCHEDMysterious 'ghost ships' wash ashore in JapanReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMysterious 'ghost ships' wash ashore in Japan 01:55North Korea has launched missiles at an unprecedented rate in 2017, testing two in July that also demonstrated intercontinental range.Before Wednesday's test, North Korea had fired 22 missiles without active warheads during 15 tests since February. US officials say North Korea is continuing to develop its missiles, rocket fuel and engines, as well as targeting and guidance systems. The US and South Korea believe Pyongyang may be able to put a miniaturized warhead on a missile sometime in 2018 -- giving it the theoretical capability to launch a missile with a warhead atop it that could reach the US.It is currently testing a more advanced version of its existing ICBM, a US official told CNN earlier this month.CNN's Barbara Starr in Washington, CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo, CNN's Vasco Cotovio in London and CNN's Richard Roth in New York contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US military has begun referring to the North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile launched Tuesday as a \"KN 22\" -- a new designation signaling that the US is increasingly seeing the recent launch as involving a new type of ICBM, according to two US defense officials. The two launches in July were categorized as KN-20s.North Korea has said that that Tuesday's test involved a new type of ICBM -- designated the Hwasong-15.The missile was topped with a \"super-large heavy warhead\" and is capable of striking the US mainland, according to reports from North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency.

Operating beneath the ocean's surface, a submarine's strategic value is often tied directly to its ability to navigate in or near enemy waters without being detected to conduct reconnaissance or attack missions.For years, the United States has maintained a technological edge over the submarines developed by rival nations, but recent advances made by Russia and China have sparked concerns of an emerging threat to American undersea superiority. Christened earlier this month, the nuclear-powered USS South Dakota marks the US Navy's latest effort to maintain that edge and provides a technological blueprint for future development. Virginia-class submarines currently cost roughly $2.7 billion each.Read MoreThe Navy's 70-boat submarine fleet is made up of three major types of boats: ballistic-missile submarines, attack submarines, and cruise-missile submarines.

The Ohio and three other guided-missile subs -- USS Florida, USS Michigan and USS Georgia -- were originally built and deployed as ballistic-missile subs, but were converted to guided-missile platforms beginning in 2002 after the Navy concluded it had a surplus of the boomers.Hide Caption 7 of 8 Photos: U.S. Navy's submarine fleetThe Los Angeles-class attack submarine USS Hampton surfaces through Arctic ice in March 2014. The Los Angeles-class is the biggest in the Navy's sub fleet, with a few dozen in commission. These subs displace 6,900 tons and are 360 feet long. The class was introduced in 1976.Hide Caption 8 of 8The Navy currently fields 17 Virginia-class fast attack submarines, which are built to operate in the world's littoral and deep waters.Virginia-class submarines can launch torpedoes at other submarines and at ships. They can also launch missiles at ground targets, gather intelligence, and deploy Navy SEAL units for special operations.\"Their inherent stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower directly enable them to support five of the six maritime strategy core capabilities -- sea control, power projection, forward presence, maritime security and deterrence,\" the Navy said.Incorporating \"acoustic superiority\" that is expected to provide unparalleled stealth capability, the USS South Dakota will be used as a \"demonstrator to prove out advanced technologies,\" according to Navy spokesperson Lt. Seth Clarke.Lessons learned from South Dakota will be incorporated into later Virginia-class submarines -- \"increasing our undersea domain advantage, ensuring our dominance through the midcentury and beyond,\" Clarke said. The nuclear-powered USS South Dakota marks the US Navy's latest effort to maintain undersea superiority.\"Stealth capability is one of the crucial advantages of submarines ... the Virginia-class brings capability and capacity that is so crucial as we head into potential peer conflict down the road.\" according to Randy Forbes, a former US representative who served as chairman of the Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee while in Congress.The 360-foot USS South Dakota is scheduled to officially enter the fleet in August 2018.The Navy plans to upgrade its Virginia-class boats while developing the next-generation, nuclear-armed Columbia-class.  One of those upgrades includes outfitting Virginia-class submarines with additional \"Virginia Payload Modules\" for Tomahawk or next-generation missiles to provide more strike capacity.      Most Virginia-class submarines currently feature two Virginia Payload Tubes, each capable of launching six Tomahawk cruise missiles, according to the Navy.Expected to be operational by 2024 or 2025, that added firepower will help fill the gap as the Navy plans to retire several of its aging fast-attack and ballistic-missile submarines in coming years, according to Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.  Brewing submarine rivalryForbes said the United States has traditionally been able to track foreign submarines but recent advancements made by the Chinese and Russians highlight the need for developments like those seen on the USS South Dakota to maintain American undersea dominance. Russia has invested heavily in developing its own underwater stealth capabilities in recent years and their submarine technology is approaching the level of the US fleet, much like the peer-to-peer comparison seen during the Cold War, according to one congressional aide familiar with the issue.Russia flaunts military might across the world with Navy Day celebrationsWhile the Russian military is not necessarily building a large quantity of submarines, it is developing boats with advanced quieting capabilities that are \"very competitive\" with those in the US fleet, said Hendrix. \"Russia is modernizing its existing fleet of Oscar-class multipurpose attack nuclear submarines and producing their next generation Severodvinsk Yasen-class,\" US Pacific Command chief Adm. Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year. \"The Russians are making a leverage investment ... with submarines you don't have to build a lot of them,\" according to Hendrix.The United States has also recently noticed an uptick in Russian submarine activity -- conducting \"spurts\" of heavy patrols across various regions, according to the aide and a US Navy official. \"They can't maintain the presence we do with 24/7 operations, but this activity is meant to push the boundary and to see what the US reaction will be,\" the aide said. But while the United States continues to monitor foreign submarine activity, the increase in Russian patrols is widely viewed as presence and testing maneuvers that do not pose an immediate military threat.It's something the United States should be reacting to but not overreacting to, the congressional aide told CNN.CNN visits nuclear submarine as deep-sea tensions with Russia growIn 2016, US Navy commanders told CNN that Russian submarines had become increasing assertive in the Atlantic Ocean and that their undersea activity was reaching levels unseen for decades.The commander of the USS Missouri submarine, Fraser Hudson, assessed at the time that the renewed Russian activity is not just \"a political statement but the Russians are seeking to gain experience in case hostilities were ever to break out between it and the United States.\"Honestly, I think it's operational experience. You maintain the experience in those (areas of responsibility) so that if anything were ever to happen, they have experience,\" he said last year.A Russian sub also turned up off the coast of Florida in 2012, and the USS Missouri was called on to track it.JUST WATCHEDU.S. Navy alarmed by Russian submarine buildupReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHU.S. Navy alarmed by Russian submarine buildup 03:01In addition to flexing their military muscle in an attempt to show \"they still are or want to be a dominant super power,\" the Russians are also trying to test whether their submarines can travel for long periods without being detected, according to the aide. \"The Russians are probably at about 80% of the capacity they were at during the Cold War,\" according to Forbes, who also noted that they are constantly pushing the envelope in terms of capability.China, on the other hand, is opting for a quantity over quality approach when it comes to building up its own submarine fleet. China's navy expands reach: Ships in Baltic for drills with Russia\"The Chinese are not as advanced but are getting there and they are producing diesel submarines in numbers,\" the congressional aide told CNN. \"In the end, numbers are a capability in themselves.\"Hendrix also noted that there is no indication the submarines being developed by China are close to being as advanced as those in the US arsenal but warned their approach of producing a large number of boats does pose a threat.\"Quantity can have a quality,\" Hendrix said. In addition to adding to the size of its submarine fleet, Harris warned earlier this year that they are also advancing their undersea capability.JUST WATCHEDNavy sub emerges from under Arctic iceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNavy sub emerges from under Arctic ice 00:55\"China is improving the lethality and survivability of its attack submarines and building quieter, high-end diesel and nuclear-powered submarines,\" he said.Both China and Russia have also increased their presence in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, where Harris said 230 of the world's 400 foreign submarines are operating. Roughly 160 of those 230 submarines belong to China, North Korea, and Russia, according to Harris. Forbes said the United States must also develop a strategy to counter Chinese and Russian activity in \"gray zones\" where they are incrementally expanding their presence by strategically \"fighting and competing\" through military posturing.China's claims in the South China Sea represent one glaring example as to how they've been able to successfully implement this type of strategy in a way that allows them to expand their military reach without engaging in direct confrontation, according to Forbes.US destroyer in South China Sea called 'provocation' by BeijingForbes also explained that the United States has yet to develop a coherent strategy to counter Russian and Chinese gray zone activity -- a challenge that will require both the Navy and Congress to reconsider the way it utilizes American sea power. \"Major strategy is not some secret play you pull out in the fourth quarter of a football game,\" Forbes said, adding that if US military leaders don't articulate a strategy to Congress there is no way a plan will be implemented. Emerging challenges By most accounts, the United States still maintains the most capable submarine fleet in the world, but while the addition of the USS South Dakota represents a leap forward in technological advancement, some argue the Navy still faces challenges.Despite President Donald Trump's request for additional defense spending, years of budget cuts and continuing resolutions have had a severe impact on the Navy's maintenance and shipbuilding efforts. The Navy plans to build 30 Virginia-class submarines and replace its 14 aging Ohio-class boats with 12 Columbia-class submarines, the first of which is expected in fiscal year 2021.In March 2016, the Government Accountability Office reported that total program acquisition costs will be about $97 billion, including $12 billion for research and development and $85.1 billion for procurement.There are also discussions about extending deployments and service lives for existing submarines to help make up the difference.But even if the Navy is able to achieve its goal of producing two or three new fast-attack boats per year, the service will only have 41 attack submarines by 2029, according to the Navy's FY17 30-year plan.An attack submarine inventory of 41 boats falls well short of the 65 to 70 boats needed to effectively maintain undersea dominance, according to Hendrix.  North Asia on a knife's edge: Whose position is strongest?Harris told the House Armed Services Committee earlier this year that he agrees with assessments indicating a need for 66 fast attack submarines.The need to continuously upgrade submarine stealth capabilities also presents a challenge for the Navy, according to Forbes, who said there comes a time when the cost for another decibel of quietness becomes too expensive.Increased costs and the development of new detection techniques that do not rely on the sound a submarine makes could change the way the US Navy thinks about undersea warfare, according to Forbes. \"If we can't make up the numbers we will have to move to a different way of fighting,\" Forbes said, adding that the current strategic mindset revolves around \"one-on-one\" submarine combat. \"In the future, submarines may have to fight more like an aircraft carrier,\" he said, describing a system in which submarines are complemented by a variety of unmanned platforms.",

La David Johnson was recovered nearly 48 hours after his 12-member team was ambushed by 50 ISIS fighters in Niger. \"The US military does not leave its troops behind and I would just ask that you not question the actions of the troops who were caught in the firefight and question whether or not they did everything they could in order to bring everyone out at once,\" he told reporters.Joint Staff Director Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie told reporters Thursday that US, French and Nigerien forces \"never left the battlefield\" until Johnson was found.Three senior US officials told CNN on Wednesday that Mattis wants answers regarding the ambush in Niger two weeks ago.JUST WATCHEDMattis: We do not leave troops behindReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMattis: We do not leave troops behind 00:52Mattis is dismayed at the lack of detailed information he has received about about the attack, but there is no indication he is trying to unduly hurry the investigation being carried out by US Africa Command, according to all three officials -- all of whom are in a position to have knowledge of how Mattis views the situation. Read More\"This was a hard fight, this was a very tough fight,\" Mattis told reporters last week -- providing little detail about what multiple US officials have described to CNN as a scene of confusion on the ground during an unexpected firefight. Veterans dismayed by Trump's urge to 'punch back' in feudThe investigation will be an effort \"to get all the facts correct,\" an administration official familiar with the review has told CNN.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders was asked Wednesday whether Trump was satisfied with the information he has received about the mission and ambush.\"I believe they're still looking into the details of that,\" Sanders replied. \"But I don't think that the President can ever be satisfied when there's loss of life from men and women in uniform.\"What we know Details related to the deadly military breakdown remain murky two weeks after the incident in Niger as investigators work to determine precisely what happened, a US official has told CNN. Experts working for Africa Command are trying to establish an hour-by-hour timeline of what happened as part of a comprehensive investigation that includes all the military branches and elements of US intelligence agencies that were involved in the mission. Officials who have spoken to CNN have cautioned that as the investigation continues new information is likely to emerge and their understanding of what happened could change.Very little has been said publicly, but the information that has emerged in the wake of the attack paints a troubling picture of what transpired.Here is what we do know:Four US soldiers were killed and two wounded: In what is the deadliest combat mission of Trump's short presidency to date, the Defense Department has identified all four service members killed in the ambush that occurred near the Niger-Mali border by up to 50 fighters from ISIS in the Greater Sahara, a US official said.Sgt. La David Johnson, Staff Sgt. Bryan Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah Johnson and Staff Sgt. Dustin Wright died as a result of the October 4 attack, after helping local forces in Niger combat terrorists.Initial reports suggested the 12-member US team was leaving a meeting in unarmored pick-up trucks when they began taking fire from small arms, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, according to a US defense official.Niger mapWith window glass exploding all around them, the service members, including multiple Army Special Forces soldiers, exited the vehicles, ran for cover, and began returning fire, killing some of the attacking militants.But later officials said the 12-man Green Beret-led team were actually not in the trucks having just completed a meeting with local leaders and were walking back to the unarmored pick-up trucks when the unexpected ambush resulted in a firefight that lasted 30 minutes until French Mirage jets arrived overhead to fly low passes in an attempt to disperse the attackers.Sgt. La David Johnson was separated: A large-scale search-and-rescue operation involving US, French and Nigerien troops was launched soon after US officials realized one of the US service members was unaccounted for.Johnson was later identified as the fourth service member killed in the attack.Sgt. La David T. Johnson who was part of a joint U.S. and Nigerien train, advise and assist mission. Sgt. Johnson, 25, of Miami Gardens, Florida, died October 4, 2017 in southwest Niger as a result of enemy fire.His body was recovered in a remote area of the northwestern African country by Nigerien troops nearly 48 hours after he was discovered missing in the wake of the attack, according to US officials.US, French and Nigerien forces engaged in the search operation remained on the battlefield until Johnson was found, McKenzie told reporters on Thursday, emphasizing the fact that he was separated and not left behind.\"The search continued until he was found. We never left the battlefield until he was found,\" he said.Johnson's body was returned to Dover Air Force Base on October 7.Intel rated it \"unlikely\" US team would face opposition: One official has told CNN that the military's intelligence said it was \"unlikely\" that the team would run into enemy forces.\"This was not expected,\" US Africa Command spokesman Army Col. Mark Cheadle said.\"Had we anticipated this sort of attack we would have absolutely devoted more resources to it to reduce the risk and that's something we are looking at right now,\" he added.ISIS affiliate likely responsible: CNN has reported that 50 fighters of the regional ISIS in the Greater Sahara were responsible for the attack. The Pentagon has claimed the group emerged in Niger because of defeats suffered by ISIS in Syria and Iraq.Sen. John McCain was pressed Wednesday on whether the administration was being up front about the ISIS-affiliated attack, McCain answered bluntly: \"No.\" \"We do have information on the group that did it, their nature, their disposition and so on and so forth and appropriate organizations within the United States military are digging deeper into that and will take appropriate action if required,\" Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, told reporters last week.There are about 800 US troops in Niger and the US military has maintained a presence in the northwest African country for five years, with small groups of US Special Operations Forces advising local troops as they battle terrorist groups, including ISIS in the Greater Sahara, the ISIS-affiliated Boko Haram.Private contractor conducted evacuations: A US private aviation contractor conducted evacuations of US and Nigerien troops after they were ambushed, according to US Africa Command spokesperson Robyn Mack. Mack said that US private contractor Berry Aviation was \"on alert during the incident and conducted casualty evacuation and transport for US and partner forces.\" US officials previously told CNN that French military Super Puma helicopters also evacuated the wounded Americans along with those killed in action while also providing covering fire. The wounded were first flown to the capital Niamey and later to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany.McCain wants answers: Sen. John McCain said Thursday that he might seek a subpoena in order to receive the information he wants surrounding the attack.\"It may require a subpoena,\" McCain told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux on Capitol Hill when asked what steps he would be willing to take to receive the information he's demanding on the attack.McCain argued Wednesday that the Trump administration is not being forthcoming about the attack in Niger.McCain: Administration not being up front about Niger attackAsked if he thinks Congress should launch an investigation into the attack, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee told reporters that first he would like to get the information that his panel \"deserves and needs.\"\"Then you decide whether a quote investigation is needed or not,\" he said.The Arizona Republican did not go into detail about what kind of information he was looking for, saying only that he was interested in \"all the specifics.\" Calls for Benghazi-like investigation: The incident is already raising the prospect of a Benghazi-like investigation similar to when Congress looked into the attack an on American diplomatic compound in Libya that resulted in four US deaths in 2012.Asked about the prospect of hearings similar to those following the attack in Benghazi, Sen. Mike Rounds said: \"In the Benghazi incident you had a case of where there was clear testimony information coming out saying there were hours of activity going on. If similar facts were to be determined in this particular case, you may very well see the same type of a demand for a review.\" What we don't know (but the military might)Missed indicators that ISIS was operating in the area?: CNN has previously reported that the fighters who carried out the attack were part of an ISIS-affiliated group called ISIS in the Greater Sahara but the Trump administration is yet to mention ISIS as the responsible party. Officials familiar with the initial after-action reports say there was confusion and uncertainty on the ground after what was a completely unexpected attack. The team was particularly vulnerable because it was in two separate locations when the attack began. Some were walking back from a meeting with local villagers. Others were waiting outside, guarding the vehicles that the US troops were using.US launches investigation into deadly Niger ambush and confusion that followedUS officials assess that terrorist groups view Chad, Niger and Mali as being particularity important as they serve as bridges between north and sub-Saharan Africa, saying that local al Qaeda and ISIS affiliates use control of these transit routes to gain revenue that helps them recruit, expand and export attacks. ISIS uses these North-South transit routes to move fighters northward, where they can more easily access Europe and the West.One official told CNN that ISIS is attempting to illegally infiltrate the gold mining industry in Niger to sell on the black market and finance world terrorism. Why did it take so long for Trump to mention the casualties?: Perhaps wary of the political ramifications President Donald Trump has still not publicly stated that an ISIS affiliated group was responsible. White House officials prepared and circulated internally a statement to be issued on the President's behalf the day after the attack. But the statement, obtained Wednesday by Politico and confirmed by CNN, was never officially released.It wasn't until nearly two weeks later that the President, an avid Twitter user, mentioned the deaths when he asked about them during an impromptu news conference Monday in the White House Rose Garden.Commenting for the first time Monday on the attack, Trump said he had written letters to those families over the weekend and they were being sent out that night.The ambush occurred amid news that ISIS self-declared capital in Raqqa, Syria was on the verge of collapse meaning Trump may have been inclined not highlight an attack showing ISIS's staying power abroad.There is also the issue that Trump allowed US troops to be in a country that does not allow offensive air operations. Sources: Kelly didn't know Trump would publicize that Obama didn't call when his son diedWhile French Mirage jets arrived overhead within 30 minutes of the firefight to fly low passes in an attempt to disperse the attackers, the aircraft did not have permission to drop bombs, multiple US officials told CNN. Trump has received criticism for his long silence following the attack and handling of the aftermath -- particularly his public feud with Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, over Trump's phone call with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson.After multiple visits to the area, why was there an attack at this time?: Last week, Joint Staff director Lt. Gen. Kenneth Mckenzie  said the patrol that was attacked had completed 29 patrols in the area without contact with hostile fighters over the previous six months or so and there was no indication an attack would occur on October 4.How did Sgt. La David Johnson become separated?: It is unclear how Johnson became separated from the rest of the advisory team during the firefight. None of the other soldiers with Johnson witnessed him being captured or taken away by enemy forces.The US military initially said it did not believe Johnson ever fell into enemy hands and had reason to believe he might be alive. Military officials launched an urgent search-and-rescue mission, but officials now say initial reports they received electronic signals that indicated Johnson might have been alive in the field were inaccurate. The lives of the 4 US soldiers killed in NigerWhile French helicopters were able to get the team to safety, the critical failure to find Johnson for another 48 hours has not been explained. His body was eventually found in a nearby area, but military investigators do not know why he was separated and if he was alive even for a short period of time, US officials tell CNN.Questions remain about how and when Johnson was killed. Were aircraft contractors in full communication with the French?: While CNN has reported that both a private contractor aircraft and French military helicopters took part in the evacuation mission it remains unclear if both parties shared all necessary information related to the operation. Private contractor used to evacuate US forces in Niger ambush\"The wounded were airlifted out by the French and the service members killed in action were evacuated by contract air,\" the Pentagon told reporters on Thursday.The failure to anticipate an attack and the fact there were no US rescue and recover assets close by meant nearly an hour went by before the evacuation of the two wounded and three dead US troops by French helicopters could be completed.Mattis said the rescue was timely stating: \"I completely reject the idea that that was slow.\" But he did say an investigation will determine if changes are needed. \"We will look at this and say was there something we have to adapt to now? Should we have been in a better stance.\"UPDATE: This piece has been updated to include Thursday's Pentagon briefing, comments from Sen. McCain, Secretary Mattis and CNN's latest reporting on what happened in Niger.CNN's Ryan Browne contributed to this report",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Pentagon will soon issue a new policy on cluster bombs, abandoning a previous plan that mandated the military ditch older versions of the controversial weapons by 2019, according to a copy of a Defense Department memorandum signed by Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and obtained by CNN.\"The Department will retain cluster munitions currently in active inventories until the capabilities they provide are replaced with enhanced and more reliable munitions,\" the memorandum said.The memo called the weapons \"an effective and necessary capability.\"Cluster bombs -- which not only deliver an initial explosion on impact but also contain multiple smaller bombs that spread over a wide area -- are largely condemned by the international community due to the risk of civilian casualties when they're used in populated areas.Over 100 countries, including most members of NATO, have called for a ban on the controversial weapon and human rights groups have expressed concerns over civilian casualties resulting from cluster bombs. Read MoreThe United States is one of several nations -- including China, Israel, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Saudi Arabia -- that have rejected a ban on the sale or use of cluster bombs.Rights group: Saudi Arabia used U.S. cluster bombs on civiliansIn 2016, Human Rights Watch accused the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen of using American-made cluster bombs in civilian areas, an action that not only would have violated US export laws but also would raise further questions as to why lawmakers and military officials condone the sale and use of the weapon.The Saudi government has denied using cluster bombs in populated areas. In 2008 then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ordered the military to cease using older types of cluster bombs by Jan. 1, 2019, and to retain only newer versions of the bombs that explode at least 99% of the time or have advanced safeguards that would automatically defuse unexploded ordnance, reducing the risks of injuring civilians.In April, Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Patrick Leahy of Vermont introduced a bill that would have banned funding for cluster bombs that do not meet a 1% unexploded ordnance standard.   The Defense Department memo also calls on the Pentagon to purchase only the newer, safer version of the bombs and bans exports of the older versions.\"This was a hard choice, not one the department made lightly,\" Tom Crosson, a Department of Defense spokesman, told CNN.While the new policy removes the automatic ban on the older version of the munition, Crosson said \"the new policy remains committed to the same end-state of the 2008 policy: acquiring safer and more reliable weapons that ensure both effectiveness on the battlefield and minimal risk of noncombatant and friendly casualties.\"\"Ultimately, it was clear to DoD's senior leadership that removing use of current stocks would have created a critical capability gap for our forces, risking much greater military and civilian casualties in a conflict, and weakening our ability to deter potential adversaries,\" Crosson added.  The new policy was first reported by Reuters.",

War of wordsThe ongoing war of words between the two nations also saw several new fiery salvos on Saturday, a day on which the US military, in a show of force, flew bombers in international airspace over waters east of North Korea and the detection of mysterious seismic activity refueled concerns over the rogue nation's nuclear ambitions.Speaking at the UN on Saturday, Ri said that Trump had made a missile attack on the US mainland inevitable by insulting the dignity of North Korea.\"None other than Trump himself is on a suicide mission,\" Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly. \"In case innocent lives of the US are harmed because of this suicide attack, Trump will be held totally responsible.\"Trump took on Twitter Saturday night to respond to Ri's remarks.Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017\n\"Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!\" Trump wrote.  The US and North Korea exchanged a series of verbal volleys last week as the UN met in New York. In his speech Tuesday, Trump threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea if the US was forced to defend itself or an ally. He then tweeted on Friday that Kim was \"obviously a madman\" who would be \"tested like never before.\" The last resort: How a US strike on North Korea could play outKim responded to the US President's speech in a rare televised statement in which he said Trump would \"pay dearly\" for the threats and accused him of being \"mentally deranged.\" Shortly after Kim's televised address, North Korea's foreign minister said his country could test a powerful nuclear weapon over the Pacific Ocean in response to Trump's threats of military action.Military posturing The US military also sent its own message to Pyongyang on Saturday as B-1B Lancer bombers from Guam and F-15C Eagle fighter escorts from Okinawa, Japan, flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea, according to the Pentagon.

        "content": "(CNN)The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a US-drafted resolution to impose new sanctions on North Korea on Monday -- a move that comes just one week after the rogue nation carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test. The resolution is designed to accomplish six major goals: cap North Korea's oil imports, ban textile exports, end additional overseas laborer contracts, suppress smuggling efforts, stop joint ventures with other nations and sanction designated North Korean government entities, according to a US official familiar with negotiations. \"Today, we are saying the world will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea, and today the Security Council is saying that if the North Korean regime does not halt its nuclear program, we will act to stop it ourselves,\" US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said following the vote Monday.\"We are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing, we are now trying to stop it from having the ability to do the wrong thing,\" she added.Although the new sanctions are the harshest yet, they could have been a lot tougher.  A full oil import ban and sanctions on Kim Jong Un himself were dropped at the last minute, in a possible attempt by the US to gain the support of Russia and China.Read MoreAs of Tuesday afternoon in Pyongyang, most North Koreans had not been informed about the new sanctions, according to CNN's Will Ripley, who is in the North Korean capital.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korea celebrates Foundation DayReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korea celebrates Foundation Day 02:24However, North Korean officials told CNN that increased pressure from the US could mean Washington faces \"a very strong response, with unbearable consequences.\" \"Hostile sanctions are like a delusion tantamount to expecting foolishly that the ocean would dry up,\" one official told CNN, while emphasizing that the government had not yet released an official response.\"As long we have a very powerful nuclear arsenal, we can ensure the security and peace of the homeland and its people,\" the official added. The news came as South Korea conducted its latest live fire drills with the US military on Tuesday, in a display of military might featuring tanks and helicopters.Joint US and South Korean live fire drills are held in Pohang, South Korea, on Tuesday, September 12.Intense negotiations When the US first circulated a draft resolution it called for a full ban on exports of oil to North Korea and an asset freeze on leader Kim Jong Un, the Worker's Party and the government of North Korea.But later, the US put forward another draft that removed the full oil embargo, asset freeze, travel ban for Kim and softened the language on foreign workers and other issues. Why North Korea wants nukes and missilesNorth Korea has long maintained it wants nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to deter the United States from attempting to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang looks at states such as Iraq -- where Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the United States, and Libya -- its late leader, Moammar Gadhafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the United States intervened in his country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the US mainland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop American military intervention.Many experts say they believe North Korea would not use the weapons first. Kim values his regime's survival above all else and knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war he could not win, analysts say. \"These are by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea,\" Haley said. \"They give us a much better chance to halt the regime's ability to fuel and finance its nuclear and missile programs, but we all know these steps only work if all nations implement them completely and aggressively.\"Russia and China both have veto power as permanent members of the Security Council and had expressed skepticism over the initial sanctions proposal. But China said after Monday's vote it supported the resolution.\"China is consistently committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, to the peace and stability of the peninsula and to the solution of the issue through dialogue and consultation,\" said Chinese Ambassador to the UN Liu Jieyi after the vote. \"The resolution adopted by the security council today reflects this principle of three commitments and demonstrates the unanimous position of the international community of opposing DPRK's development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\"Ahead of the vote, North Korea warned the United States that it would pay a \"due price\" if harsh sanctions were passed by the Security Council. The sanctions were welcomed by Japan, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe telling local media Tuesday they impose \"an unprecedented high level of pressure on North Korea.\" \"It is up to the international community to see that these resolutions are implemented,\" he warned. In the wake of the sanctions' passage, Peru's foreign ministry said it had ordered North Korea's ambassador to leave the country within five days, joining Mexico in ejecting Pyongyang's representatives in recent weeks. JUST WATCHEDWhy does North Korea keep launching ICBMs?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy does North Korea keep launching ICBMs? 01:14Oil imports, textile exports, smuggling and overseas workersSpecifically, this resolution will result in a 30% decrease in total oil imports by cutting off over 55% of refined petroleum products going to North Korea, the US official told CNN. \"Oil is the life blood of North Korea's effort to build and fund a nuclear weapon,\" Haley said. It will also ban the export of all textiles, the official said, noting that in 2016, the North Korean regime earned $760 million through those sales -- making it the largest economic sector that UN Security Council had not yet touched. Additionally, the new measures will prevent overseas workers from earning wages that finance the North Korean regime -- over $500 million each year -- in addition to cutting off foreign investments, technology transfers and other economic cooperation, according to a statement from the US mission to the UN.North Korea's 2015 exports\nSource: Observatory of Economic Complexity These additional measures were also included to limit North Korea's ability to smuggle products like coal and iron -- particularly on the high seas. But despite the US assessment that these are the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea, some experts said that their impact will only be effective if paired with additional sanctions. \"These UN resolutions only work when complemented by robust US sanctions which is exactly what happened with Iran,\" said Anthony Ruggiero, a former deputy director of the US Treasury Department and an expert in the use of targeted financial measures for Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\"The difference here is we have wide-ranging UN sanctions that go beyond what we had on Iran,\" he said. \"We also have US sanctions that go beyond the UN sanctions. The Trump administration has already used US sanctions against China and Russia, and Washington should do more like fines against Chinese banks and targeting additional firms and individuals facilitating sanctions evasion.\" The restrictions are modeled on the previous restrictions on coal, in this area the US will have to build to a UN embargo, but remains unclear if Beijing will agree to one, according to Ruggiero.US proposes UN resolution to ban oil exports to North Korea\"The textile ban, inspections paragraphs, and joint ventures language are strong,\" he added. \"The other sectoral restrictions rely on China and Russia implementation, which has been a challenge. The US should continue to use US sanctions against China and Russia to ensure implementation,\" Ruggiero told CNN. French ambassador to the UN Francois Delattre stated his support for the US-drafted resolution ahead of Monday's vote. \"Our deep belief is that only a firm reaction of the council can open the path towards a political solution to this crisis. Make no mistake about it, our firmness today is our best antidote to the risk of war, to the risk of confrontation, and our firmness today is our best tool for a political solution tomorrow,\" he said. After the vote Russia's Ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia explained why his country supported the resolution: \"Russia does not accept the claims of DPRK to become a nuclear state and has supported all of the security council resolutions demanding an end to the nuclear missile programs of Pyongyang in the interest of de-nuclearizing the Korean peninsula. Therefore, we supported and are supporting the sanctions contained in the resolutions aimed at compelling the DPRK to meet the demands of the Security Council.\"North Korea nuclear testsThe US and its allies have been calling for stern measures against North Korea since the September 3 nuclear test.     The test sent powerful tremors across the region, suggesting the device used was the most powerful the nation has ever tested. Pyongyang claims it tested a hydrogen bomb capable of sitting atop a ballistic missile. Hydrogen bombs have a far larger yield than traditional weapons, meaning devices can be smaller while providing greater devastation.Making them small enough to fit on a missile is a challenging task, and one that North Korea claims to have achieved. Experts are not so sure, but as long as Pyongyang claims to have the technology, the working assumption is that it's true.CNN's Laura Ly and Ben Westcott contributed to this report.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US military gave North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a rare sneak peek at its fighter jet of the future this week when four F-35 Joint Strike Fighters equipped with a full payload of live bombs and missiles conducted a training flight over the Korean peninsula.Along with its fifth-generation counterpart -- the F-22 Raptor -- the F-35 is widely considered the most advanced fighter jet in the skies but the US military is planning to upgrade both aircraft with even more firepower and combat capability amid a growing demand for US air power around the world. US fighter jets stage mock bombing drill over Korean PeninsulaThe F-22 and F-35 have long been touted as the future of US aerial dominance -- the expectation being that the Raptors's air-to-air combat capabilities will work in concert with the multi-role F-35's advanced long-range sensors to maintain an advantage over emerging competition from foreign rivals like China and Russia. Both aircraft have flown training missions over the Korean peninsula in recent months despite ongoing efforts to expand their combat capabilities.Cloaked with the world's most advanced stealth coating, the F-22 and F-35 would likely be called upon to lead a potential air campaign against North Korea should the situation escalate to the point of using military force.Read MoreWhile the North Korean military maintains capable anti-air weaponry, their radar systems would be unable to detect the stealth fighters before a strike on those defensive systems.        While the F-22 Raptor has been involved in combat missions since 2014, the Air Force is planning to equip the fifth-generation aircraft with new missiles, upgraded sensors and perform key maintenance on its special stealth coating.    Scout Warrior was first to report the planned F-22 upgrades. The Air Force is also in the early stages of improving the F-22's software and on-board sensors so that it will be able to seamlessly connect and share information with F-35 aircraft.  But while the F-22 is set for a face-lift to maintain its competitive edge, the Pentagon could decide against upgrading the F-35s that have already been delivered once the program's latest weapons and software capabilities are fully developed in early 2018.

It has two of these jets in the active force.Hide Caption 24 of 24Delays during the F-35's development stage caused the aircraft's manufacturer Lockheed Martin to initially deliver 108 aircraft equipped with less advanced software and weapons compatibility. The plan had been to retrofit those jets with updated systems to maximize the F-35's combat capability.But as the F-35 program prepares to ramp-up production with more than 900 aircraft expected for delivery over the next five years, the Pentagon could choose not to update its current inventory of 108 planes as a cost saving measure, according to recent comments by Vice Adm. Matt Winter, the F-35's program executive.If current F-35s are not retrofitted with the next round of upgrades -- which includes more weapons, stealth modifications and added sensor fusion capability -- it would mean that they will never achieve their maximum combat potential. \"The US is planning to buy more than 2,300 F-35s and does not need all of them to be combat capable,\" according to Joe Dellavedova, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office.\"Each service will be able to decide whether they want all their planes to have full capability or if some can be used for training or other purposes,\" he said, adding that the money saved could be used toward other initiatives. But critics of the F-35 program's \"buy before you fly\" mentality told CNN that the need to upgrade aircraft that have already been delivered points to a larger issue with the way new weapons systems are developed and purchased. \"This is an object lesson in why we shouldn't buy any weapons system in quantity before it is tested,\" said Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight. \"If we are talking about the 108 planes bought in the earliest lot that means the most expensive aircraft that were purchased will never be fully ready for combat.\" The F-35 is already the most expensive weapons system in history with costs exceeding $400 billion over nearly 20 years of testing and development. The plane with a \"brain\"Often called a \"flying computer,\" the F-35 requires significantly more coding than the F-22 to operate its high-tech sensors and radar meaning upgrades could cost millions of dollars per plane.President Donald Trump has taken a personal interest in the F-35 program, slamming the costs as \"out of control\" and then getting involved in the Pentagon's contract negotiations with Lockheed Martin. He took credit for generating $700 million in savings in the $8.5 billion contract for the latest batch of F-35 fighters.First squadron of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters cleared for active combatThe Air Force's version of the F-35 fighter jet was declared combat ready last year, and F-35s have now deployed to Japan and Europe.The F-35B Marine Corps variant was declared combat-ready in 2015, and the F-35C Nary variant is supposed to be combat operational next year.But the jets that have already been delivered would require several modifications to achieve the next planned stage of combat standards as they currently employ a less sophisticated software and hardware systems than those currently being developed. If the Pentagon opts not to upgrade the software on the F-35s that have already been delivered, those aircraft would likely be designated for training purposes rather than made available in the military's already shrinking inventory combat-ready planes.The Pentagon is hoping to expedite the software modernization process for both the F-22 and the F-35 by tapping into the expertise of commercial Silicon Valley companies to cooperate with traditional defense contractors like Lockheed and Boeing. \"We want to deliver a product to market faster than the competitor,\" said Louis Duncan, head of modernization for the Air Force's F-22 office. \"Here our competitor is the threat.\"          F-22 upgrades The F-22 is already known for speed and stealth -- able to travel at twice the speed of sound and hard to spot on radar.

By 2019, the Air Force and Lockheed Martin also hope to upgrade the F-22 to carry advanced AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced air-to-surface target location capabilities. What will the upgrades do?The F-22 Raptor began taking part in combat missions against ISIS in September 2014 after years of cost overruns and mechanical issues.It was originally designed to complement the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and replace other attack aircraft in the US military's arsenal.But the F-35 is only now beginning to be deployed and is not battle tested like the F-22.The Raptor is better at air-to-air missions than the F-35 which has superior air-to-ground capability, according to the F-35 website. U.S. F-22s fly low in a show of force over South KoreaBoth planes have had their own widely reported sets of development challenges.But due to the F-22 program's early issues, the Air Force acquired only 188 of them from aerospace maker Lockheed Martin and doesn't plan to have any more produced.Today, the Air Force has 187 of the fighters after one crashed in 2010, killing the pilot. A subsequent report by the Pentagon watchdog found the Air Force initially blamed the crash on pilot error when in fact a mechanical error was at fault.Problem-plagued plane hits ISIS: F-22 goes into combatDespite past challenges, \"the F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft,\" said the Air Force's fact sheet for the Raptor, each of which costs about $143 million.The F-22 has earned its stripes fighting ISIS during the air campaign in Syria where its primary role has been to protect other military resources by taking down enemy aircraft if they threaten the US assets. \"It has also acted as a bit of a quarterback ... helping lead older fourth-generation aircraft into the fight and showing them where the threat is,\" according to Merchant, who said the F-22's combination of stealth, radar and sensor technology allows it to see further into the fight than less advanced planes.   Congress looks at re-starting the F-22 Raptor programThe Air Force hopes to further enhance the F-22's ability to integrate with older aircraft in the fleet by 2021 -- upgrading its current verbal-based communication platform with a datalink system that would allow the aircraft to transmit information to other pilots automatically. \"We've learned that the F-22 is a big vacuum cleaner for data and it would be valuable to share that data with other aircraft,\" said Merchant, whose team is working to develop that capability. Moving forward, the Air Force will be faced with the challenge of upgrading the F-22's software and on-board sensors to address future threats, according to Lockheed Martin, who are in the early stages of designing these new platforms with the goal of enabling the F-22 and F-35 to better connect with one another. US F-35 fighters to train near RussiaThat immediate exchange of information -- such as targeting data -- is also expected to give the US an advantage against a variety of emerging future threats around the world.  In the short term, upgrades to the F-22's weapons package and stealth capabilities will enhance its effectiveness within on-going combat operations, according to Lockheed Martin. Already in the fight While the F-22 is currently engaged in the air campaign against ISIS, it has also been deployed in support of NATO partners to counter potential Russian aggression and has been used to intercept foreign aircraft flying too close to US borders. US F-22s intercept Russian bombers, fighters near AlaskaIt can also be used as an \"instrument of national power,\" according to Merchant, who said the strategic placement of F-22s can send a similar message as a traditional show of force executed by an aircraft carrier. \"It is changing the way you show your sword,\" Merchant said, noting that he could see the US military using joint deployments of F-35s and F-22s to make a statement in other parts of the world. And as tensions rise between the US and North Korea, the F-22 would serve an important role in a potential military strike option.  The last resort: How a US strike on North Korea could play outThe F-22 stealth fighters would be a key part of any US pre-emptive strike on North Korea designed to neutralize the country's defensive and counterstrike capabilities, Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told CNN earlier this month.Countering North Korea's relatively formidable surface-to-air missile defense capabilities, stealth American F-22s, F-35 Joint Strike fighters and B-2 bombers would likely lead a joint air campaign with the help of Japanese and South Korean F-15 or F-16 fighters, he said.",

JUST WATCHEDSirens sound in Japan after second missile threatReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSirens sound in Japan after second missile threat 00:56Speaking after the launch, the first since North Korea's sixth nuclear test, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the launch was \"totally unacceptable\" and went against \"the international community's strong, united will for a peaceful solution.\" Read MoreFriday's missile test follows the release of a statement Wednesday, in which the North Korean state news agency KCNA threatened the \"four islands of the (Japanese) archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche,\" referring to the ruling ideology of North Korea. The launch also seemed to be intended to send a message to the US, flying a distance equivalent to that from North Korea to Guam, the US territory that has come under threat from Pyongyang in recent weeks.      Furthest intermediate range missile testNorth Korea's latest missile was fired from the district of Sunan in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, home to the country's main airport, the South Korean military said.Initial US assessments suggested North Korea fired an intermediate-range ballistic missile, similar to that fired over Japan last month. The missile flew about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached an altitude of 770 kilometers (480 miles) before landing in the Pacific Ocean. Guam is 3,380 kilometers (2,100 miles) from North Korea.Friday's missile flew the furthest of any North Korean intermediate-range missiles, though previous launches have used lofted trajectories, where missiles fly much higher over a shorter distance. By comparison, an intercontinental ballistic missile launched in July flew 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) high and traveled a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).A South Korean Hyunmoo II ballistic missile is fired during an exercise at an undisclosed location on September 15, 2017. In response to North Korea's launch, South Korea carried out a \"live fire drill\" that included a missile launch which the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said was capable of striking the Sunan airport launch site near Pyongyang used for today's launch.CNN Special -- Secret State: Inside North KoreaCNN takes you to parts of North Korea rarely seen. Watch the documentary on CNN and CNN International:10 p.m. ET, Friday September 1511 a.m. JST. Saturday, September 1612 p.m. AEST Saturday, September 16The South Korean missile, which was launched from the country's east coast while the North Korean missile was still in the air, was \"a show of force in response to North Korea's latest provocation,\" a South Korean official told CNN.A second missile that was fired at the same time failed and \"sank into the sea off the east coast,\" an official said. Park Soo-hyun, spokesman for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, said the country's military had been ordered \"to prepare a stern measure that can effectively counter North Korea's increasing nuclear and military threats.\" \"North Korea's firing of yet another ballistic missile is a clear violation of (UN Security Council) resolutions and a very serious and grave challenge to international peace and security,\" the South Korean government said in a statement.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the launch was \"another reckless breach of UN resolutions\" and a \"major threat\" to international peace and security \"which demands a global response.\" In regularly scheduled press conference Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reemphasized Beijing's \"resolution\" on pushing for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  \"China has strictly and comprehensively implemented the resolutions of the UN Security Council,\" Hua said, adding the country has \"paid a great price and made sacrifices.\" JUST WATCHEDThe weapon that makes N.

Ethiopian Ambassador Tekeda Alemu is the current UN Security Council president.Need for more pressureThe launch came just hours after North Korea responded to the United Nations Security Council's unanimous approval of additional sanctions by threatening to \"sink\" Japan and reduce the US mainland into \"ash and darkness.\"Those sanctions were prompted by North Korea's sixth nuclear test that occurred on September 3, which Pyongyang said was a successful test of a hydrogen bomb.That explosion created a magnitude-6.3 tremor, making it the most powerful weapon Pyongyang has ever tested.     The nuclear test prompted discussions inside South Korea about the the redeployment of US tactical nuclear weapons in the country, an idea that the majority of the country's citizens approve of, according to recent polls.But on Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in dismissed the possibility, warning it could \"lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia.\"Both Abe and Tillerson called for an intensifying of pressure on North Korea, including the full implementation of the new UN sanctions. \"These continued provocations only deepen North Korea's diplomatic and economic isolation,\" Tillerson said.\"United Nations Security Council resolutions, including the most recent unanimous sanctions resolution, represent the floor, not the ceiling, of the actions we should take. We call on all nations to take new measures against the Kim regime.\"He singled out Chinese oil supplies and Russia's use of North Korean migrant workers as two areas in which the two countries could take \"direct action\" against North Korea.Speaking Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua said it was \"irresponsible and unhelpful to blame others,\" adding those parties directly involved in the dispute \"should shoulder the responsibility\" for it.JUST WATCHEDPaula Hancocks interviews S. Korean presidentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPaula Hancocks interviews S. Korean president 02:39Rapid pace 2017 has been a year of rapid progress for North Korea's missile program.Less than six years into his reign, Kim Jong Un has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined. And this year has been no exception.Prior to its most recent launch, the country has fired 21 missiles during 14 tests since February, further perfecting its technology with each launch.There's also a political aspect to the tests, analysts say.Why North Korea wants nukes and missilesNorth Korea has long maintained it wants nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to deter the United States from attempting to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang looks at states such as Iraq -- where Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the United States, and Libya -- its late leader, Moammar Gadhafi, gave up his nuclear ambitions for sanctions relief and aid, only to be toppled and killed after the United States intervened in his country's civil unrest -- and believes that only being able to threaten the US mainland with a retaliatory nuclear strike can stop American military intervention.Many experts say they believe North Korea would not use the weapons first. Kim values his regime's survival above all else and knows the use of a nuclear weapon would start a war he could not win, analysts say. \"This new missile test ... is both a reaction to the stringent UN sanctions of Monday evening and a wake-up call about the limits of sanctions and military threats as a way to change North Korea's behavior,\" said George A Lopez, a former member of the UN Security Council panel of experts for sanctions on North Korea.He said Trump should use his speech to the UN General Assembly next week to \"demonstrate US leadership in loyalty to all allies in the region and state our commitment to developing new and vibrant security guarantees for all states, including (North Korea), that are not based on the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\"The White House has been pursuing a strategy of what it calls \"peaceful pressure\" in dealing with North Korea -- trying to build a global coalition to squeeze North Korea's revenue and isolate it diplomatically so it will eventually put its missiles on the negotiating table.China has been key to that strategy, as Beijing accounts for nearly 90% of all of North Korea's imports, according to recent data from the United Nations.Hours before the launch, Trump touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and their collaboration in addressing North Korea's rapidly escalating missile and nuclear programs.\"We have a very good relationship with China and with the President of China. We are working on different things,\" Trump said. \"I can't tell you, obviously, what I'm working on. But believe me, the people of this country will be very, very safe.\" CNN's Taehoon Lee, Junko Ogura, Paula Hancocks and Richard Roth contributed to this report",

        "content": "Story highlightsLaunching a devastating preemptive strike against North Korea is almost unanimously considered a last resortMillions of innocent citizens could be caught in the crossfire if the US and its regional allies were to initiate a first strikeWashington (CNN)It's the no-win situation that can only be imagined by US military officials tasked with preparing for a worst-case scenario -- conducting a preemptive strike on North Korea.    With little time to evacuate, millions of innocent citizens would be caught in the crossfire if the US and its regional allies were to initiate a first strike, that would almost certainly result in high casualties on both sides. Friday morning, President Donald Trump warned on Twitter that \"Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded,\" though he said \"hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!\"A military operation would consist of a swift and multi-dimensional attack, as the fight would be defined by the first minute of combat, according to Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.Why it could take months for the US to get ready for war with North KoreaWhile Hendrix has not been briefed on the specifics of a possible preemptive strike option, he told CNN that the operation would likely include several strategies aimed to neutralize North Korea's defensive and counterstrike capabilities. Read MoreCountering North Korea's relatively formidable surface-to-air missile defense capabilities, stealth American F-22s, F-35s and B-2 bombers would likely lead a joint air campaign with the help of Japanese and South Korean F-15 or F-16 fighters, he said.Unmanned aircraft could also be used to limit risk to pilots.JUST WATCHEDThe U.S. military's $400B fighter jet (2016)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe U.S. military's $400B fighter jet (2016) 02:27The US would likely move additional aircraft to the region in the event of an imminent strike, but also maintains two major air bases in South Korea -- Osan with F-16 fighters and A-10 \"tank killers,\" and Kunsan with F-16s.Heavy airpower can be called in from the Pacific island of Guam, through which the US rotates B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers.As US and allied aircraft take out priority targets from the sky, American warships would launch a barrage of Tomahawk missiles concentrated on North Korean missile sites, air defense systems and response corridors capable of launching a retaliatory nuclear weapon, Hendrix said. The US Navy has 10 guided-missile cruisers and destroyers based in Japan. The ships are armed with Tomahawk missiles for offensive purposes and the Aegis missile defense system that could be used to intercept North Korean launches.     The US could use cyber attacks to disrupt Pyongyang's weapons programs -- though experts say that would only delay, rather than stop them.Urgent efforts to take out priority targets like air defense systems, retaliatory missile launch sites and service facilities -- coupled with assumptions that the US-led offensive would be met with heavy resistance -- are likely to take a toll on the US' inventory of bombs and missiles, warned Hendrix. \"What is the plan to resupply?\" he said.The US would need to ensure it had enough bombs, missiles and electronic warfare planes to destroy or disable North Korea's air defenses before deploying its heavy bombers, likely B-1s stationed in Guam, needed to strike North Korea's fortified nuclear weapons sites, according to Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.US B-1B Lancer bomberEngines: four turbofans with afterburnerWingspan: 137 feet (41.8 meters) extended forward, 79 feet (24.1 meters) swept aftLength: 146 feet (44.5 meters)Height: 34 feet (10.4 meters)Weight: 95 tons (86,183 kilograms)  Speed: 900-plus mph Ceiling: more than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters)Payload: 37.5 tons (34,019 kilograms)Weapons: Joint Direct Attack Munitions. JDAMs are tail sections with GPS navigation capabilities that are attached to 2,000-, 1,000- and 500-pound bombs.Source: US Air ForceWithin minutes of initiating the attack, US aircraft and artillery assets would also be forced to coordinate with allied forces to destroy the thousands of North Korean missile tubes pointed directly at the South Korean capital of Seoul.    And that would just be the beginning. \"The problem is not hitting North Korea, its what happens next,\" Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshare Fund, an organization working to stop nuclear proliferation, told CNN.\"You strike North Korea, they are going to strike back and they have a devastating conventional arsenal built up on the border that could lay waste to Seoul,\" he said. \"Estimates are that hundreds of thousands of South Koreans would die in the first few hours of combat -- from artillery, from rockets, from short range missiles -- and if this war would escalate to the nuclear level, then you are looking at tens of millions of casualties and the destruction of the eleventh largest economy in the world.\"\"That's what you are going to roll the dice on,\" Cirincione added.Rising tensionsWhile launching a devastating preemptive strike against North Korea is almost unanimously considered a last resort for the US and analysts said there are currently no signs that the US is planning a first strike, the concept of preemptive military action is, at very least, being considered as an option.  Trump remains committed to keeping \"all options on the table\" amid tensions with Pyongyang.Claims that Pyongyang is considering a missile strike near the US territory of Guam, coupled with Trump's warning that any further North Korean threats will be met with \"fire and fury,\" have also fueled concerns of possible conflict.The US would surely use military force in response to any North Korean strike against American or allied targets, but two US defense officials told CNN on Thursday that there are no signs of any imminent launch activity from the rogue state.Trump on North Korea: Maybe 'fire and fury' comment 'wasn't tough enough'On Thursday, Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he has discussed the issue of North Korea in great detail with Trump and could see a scenario where the US carries out a \"preemptive action to enforce the policy of denial of capability to hit the homeland.\" While all war game scenarios show the US winning a military confrontation, that victory could come at the cost of hundreds of thousands of deaths, mostly in South Korea where millions of innocent people -- and nearly 30,000 US troops -- are already in range of North Korea's current missile capabilities.According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, North Korea can field 21,000 artillery pieces. Many of those are within range of the 25 million South Koreans living in the Seoul metropolitan area.      \"The scenario of a US preemptive strike is one that acknowledges our diplomacy has failed -- and our policy for last 25 years has failed,\" said Hendrix. \"The only reason this would occur is if there is a calculation that concludes the long-term threat would result in more casualties than what would be suffered during a military operation.\" But it is the job of Trump's top military commanders to prepare for the day they hope will never come.North Korea says Guam strike plan ready within daysWhile current and former military professionals are \"repulsed\" by the potentially catastrophic consequences of a full-scale military strike, Hendrix told CNN that \"we imagine these scenarios all the time because what we fear more is an irrational actor with a nuclear weapon that can reach the US.\" Defense Secretary James Mattis has consistently said that he prefers to resolve issues diplomatically but reminded Pyongyang on Wednesday that the \"regime's actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates.\"Anatomy of a preemptive strikeWhile the US and its allies regularly flex their joint military might in North Korea's backyard, the proposition of conducting a full-scale preemptive attack remains a uniquely complex and risky undertaking.If Trump were to order the planning of such an operation, logistical preparations for a successful battlefield campaign against North Korea would take weeks or even months to put in place, according to analysts.The first challenge would be ensure Japan and South Korea are completely integrated in any plan for military action, according to Hendrix. China and North KoreaChina is North Korea's primary ally and trading partnerTrade between the countries was worth $2.6B in the first half of 2017China has supported stringent UN sanctions against the North Korea But experts say Beijing fears instability in North Korea more than anythingThe collapse of Kim Jong Un's regime could lead to a flood of refugees into ChinaWhile a unified Korea -- ruled from Seoul -- could mean US troops on China's border\"The US would also need to, at very least, inform China of any potential strike -- putting them in a position where they know military action and communicating the expectation that they have to stay out of it,\" he said.Mark Hertling, a retired US Army general and CNN analyst, said the tens of thousands of US civilians, many of them military dependents, would first need to be evacuated from South Korea.\"When you see dependents beginning to leave South Korea and Japan, then you realize that North Korea is very close to crossing red lines,\" Sen. Graham said on Thursday.  Photos:  Photos: F/A-18 Hornets fly above the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis in the Pacific Ocean.

It has two of these jets in the active force.Hide Caption 24 of 24According to Hertling and Hendrix, the US and its allies would need a couple of weeks of airstrikes to take out that artillery. And the US would need the planes, bombs, fuel and support personnel in place to carry out that campaign, they said, comparing it to the country's Desert Storm operation against Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 1991. Hertling also said at least two US Navy aircraft carrier strike groups would need to be in the waters near Korea before any US attack.Once the priority targets are neutralized, the US and its allies would have to keep up sustained operations for a fairly long period of time to maintain constant pressure on Pyongyang until all designated military targets are destroyed or the operation facilitates a change in regime or policy, according to Hendrix.      Ground forces could have a role to play in the next wave of the campaign. Experts say between 90,000 and 200,000 US troops would be needed to secure the nuclear sites in North Korea.According to the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon, North Korea has dozens of bases containing nuclear materials -- most of them deep underground -- meaning it could take time to locate and neutralize them. And facing a North Korean military with an estimated one million troops, South Korea would likely be called upon to contribute a portion of its 500,000-troop standing army.Rising military tensions in Asia Pacific: how do the major players compare? Ultimately, experts suggest that a military strike could set North Korea's missile and nuclear missile programs back a year or two, but note that any limited military action will yield little long-term strategic benefits. \"There is this sort of rational dictator theory going around Washington that we could strike him with a measured strike and warn Kim Jong Un that if he retaliated we would come back tenfold -- that idea is absurd,\" Cirincione said. \"That completely underestimates Kim Jong Un's strongman image -- if he allows his country to be attacked by the United States, if he sits back and takes it, his days in office are numbered.\"There is no military solution, there's only a negotiated one,\" he said.

The new mandate follows a foiled terror plot in Australia, which revealed a senior ISIS commander had shipped partially assembled components of a bomb on a commercial cargo plane from Turkey to Australia, according to Australian law enforcement.\"The incident in Australia just a few short weeks ago was an ominous reminder for TSA and all of our aviation partners, to include cargo carriers, that we need to continue our efforts to keep our skies secure,\" Gregory noted.Prior to the new guidance, screenings for cargo from Turkey had been voluntary.Read More\"In cooperation with our colleagues at US Customs and Border Protection, this security directive/emergency amendment is in response to evaluated intelligence and necessary to ensure that cargo flying from Turkey to the United States is subjected to enhanced protections based on the latest advances in cargo security,\" Gregory said.  The TSA said the world needs to \"raise the baseline on global aviation security and implement these measures to effectively protect the traveling public.\"CNN reported last month that the TSA was reviewing its screening procedures for cargo flown into and within the United States because of concerns that potential security vulnerabilities could be exploited by terrorists. Bill Flynn, former deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at Homeland Security, said the heightened focus and concern over \"emerging\" threats shows that the intelligence points to cargo as a potential target. \"Based on the way the government is reacting to the Australia plot it seems like that was kind of a game-changer in the way the 2010 cartridge bomb plot was,\" Flynn said last week. \"We can't just be waiting on a vulnerability to come up. ... We have to try to stay ahead of the threat and mitigate it, but there is no complete answer.\"CNN's Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

USS Kearsarge sets sail in 2016.The Oak Hill, a smaller dock landing ship, will bring supplies and join the Kearsarge in supporting \"federal, state and local authorities ongoing relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey,\" according to the Navy.Air Force and Navy helicopters began flying rescue missions in Texas on Monday night, according to a US defense official, marking the first use of active duty military assets in the hurricane rescue efforts. The helicopters used included six Navy MH-60s and three Air Force HH-60 rotary wing aircraft. On Tuesday, US Northern Command deployed nine search-and-rescue helicopters, two fixed-wing aircraft and pararescue teams to Joint Reserve Base, Fort Worth. These teams have been actively assisting in rescue operations. This file photo shows a U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter on a training mission in 2011.Military helicopters are being used alongside Coast Guard helicopters, but the Coast Guard has taken the lead on coordinating air operations, the defense official said.More than three dozen additional aircraft have been identified for use in rescue operations if the state asks for additional help.A US Navy P-8 surveillance airplane flew its first mission on Tuesday night to provide imagery to FEMA of the impact area, according to a defense official.When used in combat zones the aircraft provides high resolution imagery, reconnaissance and surveillance data. But in civilian emergencies such as the Texas flood, the focus is on assessing widespread areas for rescue and recovery. National GuardWith the entire Texas National Guard now activated, 16 aircraft have been deployed and personnel are conducting day and night wide-area search-and-rescue missions along the Texas coast, from Corpus Christi to Houston. The New York Air National Guard has provided one C-130 aircraft, three HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, and two C-17 cargo planes. There are also six helicopters from Utah, the Nebraska and North Carolina Army National Guards.The Texas National Guard is also using about 200 Humvees and 200 high-water vehicles.Coast Guard The US Coast Guard has 39 helicopters and seven airplanes stationed at two operating bases in New Orleans and Houston available for rescue response efforts in Texas and Louisiana, according to a tweet from the service on Tuesday.

US and South Korean fighter jets take part in a mock surgical strike Thursday.They conducted a mock bombing drill, which simulated a surgical strike of key enemy facilities, over the Pilsung Range in the eastern province of Gangwon. Read MoreIn a statement, US Pacific Command said the flyover was a \"direct response to North Korea's intermediate range ballistic missile launch.\"\"North Korea's actions are a threat to our allies, partners and homeland, and their destabilizing actions will be met accordingly,\" said Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander of Pacific Air Forces.North Korea labeled the flyover \"a rash act,\" according to KCNA, the country's state news agency.It said that the \"wild military acts of the enemies\" were as a result of the county's recent ballistic missile launch. Show of forceThursday's flyover follows North Korea's latest weapons test, the first ballistic missile fired over Japan, though various stages of rockets carrying satellites have landed to Japan's east and south.North Korea has been test-firing missiles at a rapid clip this year. With each launch, experts say Pyongyang can further refine and perfect its missile technology.The bomber flights are a common response to North Korean actions that the United States and its allies perceive as hostile.Next target Guam, North Korea saysB-1s flew over the Korean Peninsula following both of Pyongyang's successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the type of weapons designed to deliver nuclear warheads to far-off locations such as the US mainland.The bombers flew from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, the closest US territory to North Korea and the target of North Korean threats in recent weeks.The state-run Korean Central News Agency said that Tuesday's missile launch was \"a meaningful prelude to containing Guam,\" which it called the \"advanced base of invasion\" for US forces.In a follow-up statement Thursday, the agency promised future launches \"targeting the Pacific, where the US imperialist aggressor forces' bases are stationed.\" \"It should not be forgotten even a moment that the whole of South Korea can turn into ruins,\" the statement said. A US B-1B bomber is seen during an exercise over the Korean Peninsula on Thursday.South Korea and the United States are currently engaged in joint military exercises, which kicked off last week. The annual exercises always infuriate Pyongyang, and some have called for them to be called off or scaled back as a show of good faith that might bring North Korean leader Kim Jong Un back to the negotiating table.At a news conference Thursday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying seemed to be referring to the largely simulated drills when she said the situation in the Korean Peninsula \"is not like a movie script or computer game.\" \"It is real. It exists,\" she said. \"It is an important and serious issue that directly affects people's safety in the South and North. And it also affects the peace of the whole region. We hope every side makes rational judgments and wise decisions in a responsible manner for the people and regional peace and stability. \"JUST WATCHEDNorth Koreans watch missile launchReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Koreans watch missile launch 02:19Advanced fighter jetThe F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the most expensive and one of the most controversial weapons systems in US history, is held out as \"the cornerstone\" of US defense in the Pacific.JUST WATCHEDThe US military's $400B fighter jetReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe US military's $400B fighter jet 02:27Based at a US base in Iwakuni, the first of 16 fighters arrived in Japan in January, showing Washington's \"commitment to the defense of Japan with the most capable and modern equipment in the US inventory,\" a US Marines official told CNN at the time. According to the Marines, the deployment of the fighters to Japan was ordered under the Obama administration, and was not related to ongoing tensions with North Korea. Nevertheless, analysts said the fighters' presence in Japan sends a strong message, and the country's Ministry of Defense claimed they increased Japan's deterrent capability amid an \"increasingly severe\" security environment. Following North Korea's recent missile launch, President Donald Trump called Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and said the \"US stands with Japan 100%.\" \"I would like to make the utmost effort to protect the lives and assets of the Japanese people under a strong alliance between Japan and US,\" Abe recounted Trump saying after the call. US F-35 fighter jets take part in an exercise with South Korean jets. The F-35 stealth fighters would be a key part of any US pre-emptive strike on North Korea designed to neutralize the country's defensive and counterstrike capabilities, Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told CNN earlier this month. Countering North Korea's relatively formidable surface-to-air missile defense capabilities, stealth American F-22s, F-35s and B-2 bombers would likely lead a joint air campaign with the help of Japanese and South Korean F-15 or F-16 fighters, he said.Corey Wallace, a security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, told CNN the use of the F-35s out of Japan showed the United States had various options for potentially striking North Korea. \"(Washington has) platforms from Guam and Japan linking up and operating together over South Korea with South Korean assets, with all of the governments supporting this,\" he said.

Investigations revealed that a senior ISIS commander shipped partially assembled components of a bomb on a commercial cargo plane from Turkey to Australia, according to Australian law enforcement. Two men in Australia assembled the parts into a functional explosive device, police said. The plan was to place it on an Etihad Airways passenger plane on July 15 at an Australian airport and detonate it, according to police.The plot involved a cargo plane -- the one that carried the components -- and the passenger plane that the extremists intended to target, but \"at no stage did (a bomb) breach airline security,\" according to Australian authorities.Read MorePolice have not elaborated on why the attack did not proceed as planned, but they arrested two men in late July and charged them in August with terror-related offenses.  Foiled plot to blow up plane, unleash gas revealed in AustraliaThe do-it-yourself bomb assembly method, referred to by some terrorism experts as \"IKEA-style,\" has raised concerns for US officials. Partially assembled bomb components mean amateur bomb-making extremists no longer have to make the bombs from scratch by themselves. The US official said, \"Anytime you have an aviation terror plot anywhere in the world, it forces TSA to look at whether that could happen here.\"In a written statement to CNN, TSA said it is working to \"raise the baseline on transportation security domestically and internationally and cargo security is a part of that effort.\"\"While there is no specific or credible terrorist threat to the US, we're working closely with our partners in law enforcement and the shipping industry to ensure our nation's ports and cargo facilities are secure,\" the statement said. \"Intelligence is one of our best tools to protect Americans from attacks. Every day, with our colleagues in the intelligence community, we evaluate and reevaluate intelligence to ensure we're doing everything in our power to address all threats to transportation security.\"As the TSA continues to study its current cargo screening protocols, it is unclear if or when it might implement any changes.But an airport security official told CNN that new safety protocols and additional resources may not close all the gaps that exist in airline cargo security.\"Cargo is a vast area with lots of access points -- you can never get it completely right,\" said Mark Hatfield, chief security officer at Miami International Airport. \"It's something that keeps us up at night,\" he added.",

Held every four years, the exercise can even develop its own mythology: Much of the Western coverage said that the 2009 exercise ended with a simulated nuclear attack on Warsaw, Poland, even though there is no evidence at all from unclassified sources to suggest this was the case, Giles said.\"In Poland, Lithuania and especially Ukraine, some fear this year's Zapad could provide cover for preparing another Russian military adventure,\" Giles wrote in a recent op-ed for CNN. But the US and its NATO partners have closely monitored Russian military maneuvers since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and routinely engage in military chest-thumping to deter potential Russian aggression. Wednesday's announcement comes as President Donald Trump considers sending defensive aid to Ukraine. Defense Secretary James Mattis is expected to meet with the Ukrainian defense minister in Kiev on Thursday.  Tensions between the West and Russia have increased in recent years, in large part because of Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.In June, the US Air Force deployed long-range B-52 bombers and 800 airmen in support of joint exercises with NATO allies and partners taking place across Europe.US F-35 fighters to train near RussiaThe nuclear-capable B-52 Stratofortress took part in a series of joint exercises on Russia's doorstep -- specifically in the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and along Russia's border with several NATO partners.The 185,000-pound B-52 is one of the oldest active aircraft in the US Air Force, having first entered service in the 1950s during the height of the Cold War. They were originally designed to serve as long-range, high-altitude intercontinental nuclear bombers that could strike deep into the Soviet Union.The planes have been modified heavily since the end of the Cold War and have been upgraded with precision-guided missiles, electronics and high-tech sensors.

Featuring a series of photos depicting B-1B Lancers deployed to the US territory, the tweet from US Pacific Command said: \"B-1B Lancer #bombers on Guam stand ready to fulfill USFK's #FightTonight mission if called upon to do so.\" #USAF B-1B Lancer #bombers on Guam stand ready to fulfill USFK's #FightTonight mission if called upon to do so https://t.co/O3oVeFrNrG pic.twitter.com/IAm2qLwcWY\u2014 U.S. Pacific Command (@PacificCommand) August 11, 2017\nA key part of the US military's \"tip of the spear,\" US B-1 bombers have been seen regularly over the Korean Peninsula in recent months amid escalating tensions with Pyongyang -- running regular training flights with Japanese and South Korean fighter jets that often provoke the ire of the North Korean regime. On Tuesday, Trump warned Pyongyang not to make any more threats against the United States or they will \"face fire and fury like the world has never seen.\" Soon after Trump's comments, North Korea issued a statement saying it was \"examining the operational plan\" to strike areas around the US territory of Guam in the Pacific, including the Andersen Air Force base where the US B-1 bombers are stationed. Read MoreWhile it was released Wednesday, the statement was dated Tuesday and didn't make any reference to Trump's comments. It did, however, express anger over a US flyby of B-1B bombers on Monday.Another statement was issued by North Korean state media Wednesday warning the US that a \"preemptive strike is no longer the monopoly of the US.\"US B-1B Lancer bomberEngines: four turbofans with afterburnerWingspan: 137 feet (41.8 meters) extended forward, 79 feet (24.1 meters) swept aftLength: 146 feet (44.5 meters)Height: 34 feet (10.4 meters)Weight: 95 tons (86,183 kilograms)  Speed: 900-plus mph Ceiling: more than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters)Payload: 37.5 tons (34,019 kilograms)Weapons: Joint Direct Attack Munitions. JDAMs are tail sections with GPS navigation capabilities that are attached to 2,000-, 1,000- and 500-pound bombs.Source: US Air ForceThe highly versatile, supersonic B-1 is considered the backbone of the US long range bomber fleet and carries the largest conventional payload of any aircraft in the US Air Force. The US is currently rotating six B-1s through Andersen Air Force Base in Guam which would serve as a key aerial assets should Trump order a military strike on North Korea either preemptively or as a quick response to escalation from Pyongyang. While the US would likely use stealth aircraft such as the F-22s, F-35s and B-2 bombers to lead an initial strike targeting North Korean air defense systems, B-1s would likely be dispatched from Guam once those defensive capabilities were disabled -- utilizing its heavy payload to strike North Korea's fortified nuclear weapons sites, according to Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.Launching a devastating preemptive strike against North Korea is almost unanimously considered a last resort for the US and analysts said there are currently no signs that the US is planning a first strike.The US would surely use military force in response to any North Korean strike against American or allied targets, but two US defense officials told CNN on Thursday that there are no signs of any imminent launch activity from the rogue state.But the concept of preemptive military action is, at very least, being considered as an option as Trump remains committed to keeping \"all options on the table\" amid tensions with Pyongyang.Claims that Pyongyang is considering a missile strike near Guam, coupled with Trump's warning \"military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely,\" have fueled concerns of a potential conflict. On Thursday, North Korean state media KCNA said military leaders were working on a proposal to launch four intermediate-range Hwasong-12 missiles into the sea less than 25 miles off Guam's coast.KCNA said the plan would presented to Kim by mid-August.The last resort: How a US strike on North Korea could play outGuam's Homeland Security Advisor George Charfauros said Friday it would take 14 minutes for a missile fired from North Korea to reach Guam.\"It's a 14-minute flight time if all the factors are successful and if it gets through all the US defense layers in place,\" Charfauros told CNN. North Korea had previously said the flight time would be 1,065 seconds, or just under 18 minutes.On Thursday, Trump replied to North Korea's threat to hit Guam with a threat of his own.\"Let's see what he does with Guam,\" Trump said in apparent reference to Kim. \"He does something in Guam, it will be an event the likes of which nobody has seen before.\"\"You'll see, you'll see. And he'll see,\" he said.",

        "content": "Story highlightsNorth Korean threat against Guam comes after US bomber sorties over Korean Peninsula Guam government says threat level has not increased following statement in North Korean state media (CNN)North Korea's military is \"examining the operational plan\" to strike areas around the US territory of Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic missiles, state-run news agency KCNA said early Wednesday local time.Specifically, the statement mentioned a potential strike on Andersen Air Force Base designed \"to send a serious warning signal to the US.\" The base is one of two on the Pacific island, which are the closest bases on US soil to North Korea, and represent the westernmost tip of the country's military might.The North Korea comments were published after US President Donald Trump warned Pyongyang that if it continued to threaten the US, it would \"face fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"      'No threat to our island'Read MoreGuam's governor, Eddie Baza Calvo, released a video address Wednesday, reassuring the island's residents that there was no change in the threat level resulting from North Korea.\"I want to reassure the people of Guam that currently there is no threat to our island or the Marianas,\" he said. \"I also want to remind national media that Guam is American soil and we have 200,000 Americans in Guam and the Marianas. We are not just a military installation,\" he added.Speaking from Guam, journalist Robert Santos said local reaction to the threats was mixed.\"Some people are who are confident we are safe with the US bases here and others who are not so sure,\" he said.\"Some people believe (Trump and Kim) are clashing personalities and they speak recklessly. But here are some people who believe... that we are completely safe regardless of what happens.\" However, he added that an attack on Guam \"won't just be against the US military, it will be against the people.\"      Key military installationDubbed the \"tip of the spear,\" Guam is a key to the US military's forward deployed presence in the Pacific and is home to thousands of American service members and their families.Its importance has declined since the Second World War, given the creation of military bases in Japan and South Korea, says Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center. Now it is essentially a staging area, which sees rotations of bomber groups coming through. \"Guam is the western most US territory that has major military bases. If you (were to) pull (the US) out of Japan and South Korea it's the next best location in the Pacific,\" says Schuster.While it is around 1,500 miles further out from the Korean peninsula than its next closest base in Japan, it's \"still strategic because of its location\" and its ability to host long-range bombers.There are, however, political complications in launching attacks from US bases hosted by allies closer to Pyongyang, should the US retaliate to Kim's latest threats. Should US allies refuse to let the military to launch strikes from their territory, Guam would be the most likely place from which to launch airstrikes on North Korea, Schuster says, adding that this is how Kim will regard it.A US attack using its bases on Japan's main islands or Okinawa, for example, would bring Japan into any conflict, says Schuster.However, \"Guam's importance is reliant on the behavior of our allies. If South Korea and Japan say we could (launch attacks) out of there, taking out Guam becomes almost meaningless.\" Defensive shieldGuam's Homeland Security Advisor George Charfauros told CNN that despite Guam's strategic importance and the North Korean threats to strike it, he remains confident of the island's defenses. \"They've slowly developed their capabilities but we stand in high confidence with the US (Defense Department's) ability to not only defend Guam and the surrounding areas but also the continental US... There are several layers of ballistic missile defense.\"Trump, Kim ramp up rhetoricTrump's credibility crisis goes nuclearNorth Korea ups the rhetoricOPINION: 2 things Trump should know about North KoreaBefore a war with North Korea, we'd see thisPyongyang threatens to strike GuamTrump promises 'fire and fury'Asian markets wobble on newsOPINION: Trump's fiery rhetoric plays into Kim's handsUS lawmakers slam Trump's commentsTrump could disrupt careful diplomatic messagingWhat 'fire and fury' might signifyOne of these systems, he said, is THAAD, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles.\"Two years ago a permanent deployment of that missile system was placed on Guam,\" he said. He added that the US \"routinely uses\" Aegis-equipped warships around the island chain of the Marianas, of which Guam is the largest. The US Department of Defense reiterated its capability to counter North Korean aggression.\"We always maintain a high state of readiness and have the capabilities to counter any threat, to include those from North Korea,\" spokesman Johnny Michael told CNN.JUST WATCHEDHow advanced is North Korea's nuke program?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow advanced is North Korea's nuke program? 01:26Escalating tensionsNorth Korea ramped up the rhetoric in a new statement issued Wednesday, sourced to a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA), which said a \"preemptive strike is no longer the monopoly of the US.\"Pyongyang's initial threat to Guam came after the US flew two B-1B bombers over the Korean peninsula on Tuesday local time. Two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancers flew from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, for a 10-hour mission near Japan, the East China Sea and the Korean peninsula, August 7.The bombers flew out of Andersen Air Force Base in Guam as part of the US Air Force's \"continuous bomber presence,\" according to an Pacific Air Forces spokesman. The bombers were joined by Japanese and South Korean aircraft during their mission. \"In the morning of August 8 the air pirates of Guam again appeared in the sky above South Korea to stage a mad-cap drill simulating an actual war,\" the KCNA statement read.The flights with Japan and South Korea were designed to demonstrate solidarity between the nations, the US said.Pyongyang did not develop its nuclear capability to be the aggressor in a war with the US, says CNN Military Analyst Rick Francona. However, its most recent statements suggest that North Korea is taking a more aggressive stance -- suggesting that it might attack before the US has a chance to strike. \"The North Koreans did not develop their nuclear weapons to drop on the US,\" Francona told CNN. \"They developed these weapons to prevent an attack from the US. Or at least that's the rhetoric coming from Pyongyang.\"Now you're looking at a possible strike on American territory (like) Guam, and also the mainland of the US.\" Poll: Americans uneasy about North Korea, doubt Trump's ability to handle situationThe latest: North Korea advances its nuclear capabilitiesCNN's Jim Sciutto and Taehoon Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.",

Kennedy (CVN 79), is scheduled to launch in 2020Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)Perched 50 feet above the USS Gerald Ford's massive flight deck, Petty Officer 1st Class Jose Triana has a clear view of the horizon from his padded captain's chair in the pilot house of the world's most advanced aircraft carrier. \"This ship can basically drive itself,\" Triana said, pointing to a touch-screen navigation display that has replaced the traditional throttle system used to power and steer the US Navy's older carrier classes. The one-of-a-kind control system is just one of many state-of-the-art upgrades aboard the $13 billion USS Gerald Ford that was commissioned into active duty on July 22 after eight years of construction, development and testing.

Hide Caption 6 of 6As the first new carrier design in 40 years, the 1,100-foot Ford incorporates advanced technology and operational systems that will allow aircraft take off and land more quickly, a smaller crew and improved survivability against projected threats, according to the Navy.\"One primary difference is the crew composition,\" said the ship's executive officer, Capt. Brent Gaut.Read More\"We've worked a great deal to automize a lot of what we do,\" he said, highlighting that the Ford maintains a crew of 2,600 sailors -- 600 fewer than its predecessors in the Nimitz-class.State-of-the-art electromagnetic catapults and advanced arresting gear have been coupled with new structural designs -- including a larger flight deck to improve aircraft maneuverability and a repositioned \"island\" (the tower where the captain sits) for better visibility.These systems are expected to streamline flight operations and allow the Ford to launch 33% more aircraft than older carriers in the fleet -- meaning it will be able to pack a bigger punch.\"The more bombs I get over the target area the more lethal I am,\" said Commanding Officer Capt. Rick McCormack.\"Certainly we've taken a hard look at the technology,\" said Capt. Gaut, McCormack's second-in-command. \"We are always trying to stay a step ahead of the adversary and I think we've done that with this carrier.\" Photos: US aircraft carriersSailors spell out #USA with the American flag on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Persian Gulf in late June 2015.

The Navy was granted a waiver as it waited for the USS Gerald Ford to be completed. The next carrier in the Ford class, the USS John F. Kennedy (CVN 79), is scheduled to launch in 2020. That ship was 50% complete as of July.The third Ford-class carrier, the USS Enterprise (CVN 80), is set to begin construction in 2018.A checkered past The first of three Ford-class carriers ordered by the Navy -- whose combined cost is expected be close to $42 billion -- the USS Gerald Ford's innovative features have been touted as one of its biggest assets but testing those unproven systems has, at times, yielded growing pains. Early testing of the carrier's electromagnetic catapult failed in 2015 -- just one of several setbacks for a program that has been criticized by some lawmakers for a series of schedule delays and cost overruns. A 2016 memo from Michael Gilmore, the Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation, said the most expensive warship in history continued to struggle launching and recovering aircraft, moving onboard munitions, conducting air traffic control and ship self-defense as recently as last year.At the time, the Ford was already two years behind schedule and the memo's release came just days before the Navy announced the carrier would not be ready before November 2016 as was previously promised.   The USS Gerald Ford docked at Naval Station Norfolk next to the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, slammed the latest delay as \"unacceptable\" and \"entirely avoidable.\" President Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to increasing the Navy's carrier fleet from 11 to 12 ships earlier this year during a speech aboard the USS Gerald Ford but just a few months later directly attacked the Ford's electromagnetic catapult system in an interview with Time magazine.\"It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital? And it's very complicated, you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out. And I said -- and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers. I said, \"What system are you going to be-- \"Sir, we're staying with digital.\" I said, \"No you're not. You going to goddamned steam, the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it's no good,\" Trump said. However, the carrier's commander said he is confident in the new technology.\"It's really about the envelope. It's opening the envelope for future aircraft and future capabilities of the Navy and we'd otherwise be contained with a steam catapult system,\" McCormack said.\"With all new technology there are risks,\" he said. \"But that's why we're here -- to go out there and shake them down.\"Despite delays to the Ford's delivery, the Navy said that the Ford-class carriers will yield a $4 billion reduction per ship cost as compared to its predecessor.First of its kind Despite the challenges that come with developing and testing a carrier that is first in its class, commanding officers touted the expertise demonstrated by the Ford's crew members in operating its advanced systems. \"These sailors onboard are experts in the equipment ... they are the ones who are testing and evaluating it for the future of Ford-class carriers,\" said Command Master Chief Laura Nunley, the highest-ranking enlisted sailor on the carrier. \"That alone brings a huge sense of ownership and I couldn't be any prouder of the crew,\" she said. JUST WATCHED$13 billion warship is first of its kindReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH$13 billion warship is first of its kind 01:40Many of the crew members have been with the carrier since the earliest stages of development -- supplementing a lack of experience out at sea with a deep breadth of knowledge about the new technology that is expected to set the standard for the future of the Ford-class. \"They've had to learn this stuff sometimes without a book,\" Nunley said. \"It's not something that's been proven so they've had to learn it from the beginning.\"The crew has also played a key role in helping many of the commanders get up to speed on the intricacies that differentiate the Ford from the Navy's other carriers. \"It's been a little bit of a fire hose to the mouth trying to absorb all the information I need to absorb, but it's been an amazing experience,\" said Gaut, who joined the ship nearly a month and a half ago and has never been part of the pre-commissioning process for another ship.Gaut said he has leaned heavily on the crew's understanding of the Ford's advanced systems since coming aboard. While the Ford's commissioning ceremony represented a major milestone, the crew and commanding officers stressed that there is more work to be done to prepare the carrier for its first deployment.The 1,100-foot USS Gerald Ford docked in Norfolk , Va ahead of its commissioning ceremony.The Ford's propulsion and basic systems were tested during a first round of sea trials in recent months, but one major remaining hurdle will be to test the carrier's electromagnetic catapult's ability to launch actual aircraft.To date, the system has successfully launched \"dead-loads,\" which are sleds meant to simulate the weight of an aircraft, but the first tests using live planes won't occur until sea trials scheduled to take place in the weeks after commissioning. \"The biggest challenge is to test the systems ... in theory they are incredible, but we need to test them and make sure they do what they are supposed to do, which is allow us to put the ship in harm's way and fight the fight,\" said Gaut. Following its commissioning, the Ford will now undergo months of additional testing to correct any remaining deficiencies and integrate the 75-plane air wing before its first deployment scheduled for 2020.",

But if you remove China -- Pyongyang's biggest trading partner -- from the equation, the breakdown reveals North Korea spent more on luxury goods than it did on licit imports from the rest of the world combined, according to UN data processed by the MIT Media Lab's Observatory of Economic Complexity.North Korea's 2015 imports\nSource: Observatory of Economic Complexity Read MoreSo how can the leader a country that in March of last year warned its citizens to prepare for possible famine and severe economic hardship afford to live in such luxury?Experts say these types of purchases are made using Kim's personal piggy bank, filled by Pyongyang's illicit dealings across the globe. North Korea has been accused of crimes such as hacking banks, selling weapons, dealing drugs, counterfeiting cash and even trafficking endangered species -- operations that are believed to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars.That money also helps pay for the country's nuclear and missile programs, both of which Pyongyang believes it needs in order to deter any US-led attempt at regime change, experts say. North Korea's nuclear aspirations have progressed forward rapidly despite sanctions, and Pyongyang has resisted any US attempts at negotiation that mandates de-nuclearization up front.\"North Korea has blatantly violated international law with their nuclear testing, illicit sales, and the ramping up of their nuclear program,\" said Republican Representative Doug Lamborn, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a leading advocate for missile defense in Washington.It's nearly impossible to track these illicit funds accurately, as they're likely hidden away. But a 2008 Congressional Research Service report said Pyongyang could generate anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in profits annually from its ill-gotten gains.\"North Korea will sell anything to anyone as long as they pay,\" Anthony Ruggiero, a former deputy director of the US Treasury Department and an expert in the use of targeted financial measures, said at a panel sponsored by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies last week.That money funds Pyongyang's pursuit of a long-range nuclear weapon and the lavish lifestyle of the country's elite, keeping them happy as sanctions cripple the economy, according to analysts CNN spoke to.     In the end, it's an important way for Kim to cement his power and prevent challenges to his authority, experts say.\"That's income that goes directly into the pockets or the bank accounts of the North Korean leadership. (Taking it away) can actually have a disproportionately large impact compared to trade flow,\" said Sheena Greitens, a professor at the University of Missouri who has been studying North Korea's illicit finance activities for the last 10 to 15 years.In order to really pressure Kim until he's desperate enough to get to the negotiating table on the US' terms, US President Donald Trump may need to go after that money, analysts say.But cutting off that revenue may prove difficult, like playing a game of international whack-a-mole.\"This is a regime that's really good at finding new, creative illicit ways to earn hard currency and sometimes that's coming up with new activities and sometimes it's a matter of shifting geographic locations of those activities,\" said Greitens. \"If you wanted to try to pressure and contain North Korea's ability to earn from these illicit activities, you'd have to also close off its ability to adapt.\"'A pressure campaign'Kim's perceived flair for the dramatic -- South Korean intelligence alleges he's conducted anti-aircraft gun executions and complex assassination plots -- is something he shares with his late father, Kim Jong Il.The elder Kim was a noted cinephile and James Bond fan, and analysts say his fondness for spy thrillers appeared to influence his leadership -- South Korea says he tried to assassinate enemies with a pen, kidnapped movie stars in order to boost the country's own film industry and created of what's known as \"Office 39.\"The US Treasury Department says Office 39 is the bureau that \"provides critical support to North Korean leadership in part through engaging in illicit economic activities and managing slush funds.\" The money basically hides in plain sight, according to Harvard-based North Korea specialist John Park.\"North Korean overseas networks have been extremely adaptive to the combined pressures of international sanctions, in large part due to their ability to nest and disguise their illicit business within the licit trade,\" according to Park.Though the Obama administration tried to target it with sanctions, Office 39 is still believed to be in operation.  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States will try to further stymie North Korean operations by punishing third parties that help Pyongyang skirt sanctions.\"It's a pressure campaign that has a knob on it,\" Tillerson told State Department employees on May 3. \"I'd say we're at about dial setting five or six right now.\"Though Tillerson did not specify how those third-country sanctions would work, part of the strategy involves asking countries around the globe to scale back their diplomatic relationships with Pyongyang.\"What we are more appropriately asking them to do is to take a look at the diplomatic relations that they have with North Korea ... North Korea, in many countries, has a diplomatic presence that clearly exceeds their diplomatic needs,\" W. Patrick Murphy, the US State Department's deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters on a phone call. Keeping them high and dryNorth Korean diplomats around the world have been accused of using their diplomatic privileges to conducted crimes such as smuggling gold and running guns.Embassy staff are useful to North Korea because they are mobile and can provide diplomatic cover for shady dealings, the United Nations says.To cut off the illicit money, the US likely needs to deny North Korea the opportunity to use embassies as fronts for criminal operations, something the United Nations accused the country of doing in 2016.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korea linked to more bank hacksReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korea linked to more bank hacks 02:45\"North Korea has been quite wily in recent years in trying to evade the UN Security Council resolutions ... using diplomatic cover for some of its activities,\" Murphy said.That creativity may have been on display in recent years in Southeast Asia, where local and international authorities have accused diplomatic staff in connection with a potential assassination plot and an intricate arms smuggling operation.To that end, one partner the United States says it's pursuing to deal with North Korea is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who's serving as the chair of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN).ASEAN membersThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations has 10 members:BruneiCambodiaIndonesiaLaosMalaysiaMyanmarPhilippinesSingapore ThailandVietnamOf the 10 states that belong to the regional organization, eight host North Korean embassies, according to the National Committee on North Korea. Another 39 countries around the world also host a North Korean embassy.\"If you think about strategy for attacking illicit sources of finance and pressuring illicit sources of finance, you'd actually want to go to some of the places that are flying under the radar,\" Greitens said. Whether US pressure works remains to be seen. \"The United States has been pressuring a number of Southeast Asian states for years now to crack down or reduce the extent of their relationship with North Korea,\" said The Diplomat's Prashanth Parameswaran. \"Southeast Asian states maintain these links with North Korea out of various considerations -- diplomatic, cultural links, economic links. And they've proven that they want to keep this going on ... these countries will make their own determinations with respect with what to do with North Korea.\"China factorThe US will need more than just buy in from Southeast Asia for the strategy to work, analysts say. They'll need China too. Beijing accounts for about 85% of Pyongyang's imports, according to UN data. That's a lifeline for the North Korean economy, one which prevents the US from really putting the squeeze on North Korea.\"You certainly want to cut off all areas of revenue but it's really just sort of nibbling around the edges when you're going to eventually have to come back to what you're going to do about China,\" Ruggiero, the former Treasury Department official, told CNN.Convincing China to take comprehensive action that not only targets its own companies but could disrupt the power balance in the region will be no easy feat, according to David Cohen, former deputy director of the US Central Intelligence Agency. China is most worried about destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and has proven they will act in their own best interest, Cohen said. But Pyongyang's reliance on Chinese entities also reveals an area of vulnerability, according to a recent study from C4ADS, a non-partisan Washington-based research group focused on exposing illicit trade networks.\"From 2013 to 2016, there were only 5,233 companies within China that either imported goods from, or exported goods to, North Korea. To put that number in perspective, as of 2016, 67,163 Chinese companies exported to South Korea,\" the report said. \"Targeting specific key nodes can have a disproportionate impact.\"JUST WATCHEDChina and North Korea: A complicated relationshipReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChina and North Korea: A complicated relationship 01:13President Trump has been courting Chinese President Xi Jinping for his help with North Korea. He hosted Xi at his luxurious South Florida Mar-a-Lago estate in April for a two-day summit, during which North Korea was discussed.Trump's language toward Beijing -- on the campaign trail he said China was raping the United States -- has softened since the meeting. Experts say Beijing's seriousness about cracking down on its unruly neighbor may be the key to stopping Pyongyang's illicit activities.\"It all comes down to China,\" said Ruggiero. \"In the end it's going to require going after Chinese banks and Chinese companies that are complicit in North Korea's sanction evasion.\"Follow Joshua Berlinger on Twitter CNN's James Griffiths, Richard Roth, Paula Newton and Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report",

That helps prevent flames and heat from the engine from damaging either the  submarine, submersible barge or any nearby equipment used to launch the missile. Carried out on land at Sinpo Naval Shipyard, Sunday's ejection test is the third time this month -- and fourth this year -- that North Korea has conducted a trial of the missile component that is critical to developing submarine launch capabilities, according to the US defense official.North Korea tested its longest-ranging missile. Now what?North Korea latestNorth Korea fired a second long-range, intercontinental ballistic missile on FridayExperts believe if the projectile had been fired on a standard trajectory, it could have threatened cities on US mainland US President Donald Trump said Saturday that China, North Korea's most important ally, isn't doing enough to rein in its neighbor.The US said Sunday it flew stealth bombers over North Korea in response to the testTop US official says \"time for talk is over\"US officials also noted that a North Korean Sang-O submarine was operating in the Yellow Sea and the length of its deployment was notable. Two Romeo submarines were detected in the waters off Japan -- each one operating in the area for about a week.Read MoreCoupled with reports of increased submarine activity, news of another ejection test comes amid concerns over North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears to have the range to hit major US cities on Friday. Experts believe if Friday's test had been fired on a flatter, standard trajectory, it could have threatened cities like Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago.President Donald Trump told reporters at his second full Cabinet meeting that his administration will be able to take care of North Korea but offered no specifics about what he plans to do.\"We will handle North Korea. We are gonna be able to handle them. It will be handled. We handle everything,\" Trump said after a reporter asked him about his strategy.Asked if the US would strike first, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that \"all options are on the table,\" adding that Trump would not \"broadcast\" his decisions.Democrat Sen. Mark Warner said on \"Erin Burnett Out Front\" Monday that Trump showed \"enormous naivet\u00e9\" by suggesting the nuclear threat from North Korea could be handled so simply.

Two US defense officials told CNN at the time that the North Korean Romeo-class submarine was engaged in \"unusual deployment activity\" in the waters off the coast of Japan and was patrolling farther that it has ever gone, sailing some 100 kilometers out to sea in international waters. The submarine's activity was different than the typical training activity usually observed closer to shore, according to the officials.North Korea tested its longest-ranging missile ever on Friday. Now what?That activity caused US and South Korean forces to slightly raise their alert level, according to one official.The US military pays close attention to North Korean submarine activity following the 2010 Cheonan incident where a North Korean sub torpedoed a South Korean Naval vessel.Last summer, North Korea conducted what experts believed was its first successful submarine missile test, firing a missile called the the KN-11 or Pukguksong-1.CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsNORAD determined the launch did not pose a threat to North AmericaNorth Korea has accelerated its intercontinental range ballistic missile programWashington (CNN)President Donald Trump condemned North Korea's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday.\"Threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people.\" Trump said in a written statement. \"The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.\" The United States detected an intercontinental ballistic missile launch out of North Korea at approximately 10:45 am ET on Friday, the Pentagon confirmed to CNN -- Pyongyang's second such test this month.The North Korea threat. What can Trump do?The missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and traveled about 1000 km before splashing down in the waters off the Japanese coast, according to the Pentagon, which is working with interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.Read More\"Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation,\" a statement from the Pentagon said. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Japanese broadcaster NHK: \"I have received the first report that North Korea again launched a missile and it possibly landed inside the exclusive economic zone.\"Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile launched by North Korea possibly flew for approximately 45 minutes. Suga told reporters there is no damage to any vessel or aircraft.South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said they estimate that the intercontinental ballistic missile is more advanced than one launched last month based on the range it traveled.  \"The altitude is about 3,700 km and the flying distance is about 1,000 km. It is estimated that it was a more advanced type of an ICBM compared to the previous one based on the range,\" a statement to CNN said.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., and the commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, called the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Lee Sun Jin in the wake of North Korea's test to express the US' \"ironclad commitment\" to its alliance with South Korea and discuss military response options.Hours after that call, the US and South Korean military conducted a live fire exercise as a show of force in response to the missile test, according to Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis. The exercise included firing missiles into the ocean. Both militaries conducted a similar show of force, after North Korea's first ICBM test in early July.New US intelligence on North Korea missile program  The ongoing assessment from the US intelligence community in recent months has been that North Korea has accelerated its intercontinental range ballistic missile program.The US believes that North Korea will be able to launch a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by early 2018, a US official familiar with the latest intelligence assessment confirmed to CNN Wednesday.That would be an acceleration of two years from previous estimates that put Pyongyang three to five years from fully developing long-range missile capabilities.Why North Korea still hates the United States: The legacy of the Korean WarThe official clarified to CNN that while North Korea can currently get a missile \"off the ground,\" there are still a lot of undetermined variables about guidance, re-entry and the ability to hit a specific target.CNN reported earlier this month that US intelligence indicated that North Korea was making preparations for another ICBM or intermediate range missile test.Two administration officials familiar with the latest intelligence at the time confirmed they'd seen indicators of test preparations.\"In all honesty, we should not be surprised anymore: North Korea is slowly morphing into a nuclear and missile power right before our very eyes,\" said Harry J. Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korea.      2017 has been a year of rapid progress for North Korea's missile program.Pyongyang has carried out 12 missile tests since February and conducted its first-ever test of an ICBM on July 4 -- which it claims could reach \"anywhere in the world.\"\"North Korea will continue to test over and over again its missile technology and nuclear weapons in the months and years to come in order to develop the most lethal systems it can,\" Kazianis said. \"You can bet every time they do tensions will continue to rise. This is what makes the situation on the Korean Peninsula as dangerous as it is.\" Less than six years into his reign, Kim Jong Un has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined. What are President Donald Trump's options?North Korea's latest test has spurred calls for a response from the Trump administration. \"North Korea's latest missile test shows the Trump administration's actions are not changing North Korea's behavior and it's time for the President to articulate a comprehensive strategy to the American people -- so far he's failed to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu told CNN on Friday.Trump administration officials have warned that \"all options are on the table\" but a clear path forward has yet to materialize. Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in foreign policy, told CNN that North Korea's missile launch shows Pyongyang is \"absolutely committed to their missile programs\" and not interested in tempering their activities.Bandow, who visited North Korea just last month, said the regime is convinced that developing its missile program as a nuclear deterrent is absolutely necessary -- a mindset that continues to put pressure on President Donald Trump, who finds himself in a situation with no good choices, according to Bandow. Those choices are further complicated by the unpredictable nature of Kim Jong Un, according to Lieu, who also told CNN he \"does not know\" if Kim would be willing to use a long-range nuclear weapon should he acquire that capability.Trump has often cited China, North Korea's longtime ally, as a key player in reining in North Korea's quest to have long-range nuclear missiles.But diplomatic efforts calling for China to put pressure on Pyongyang or enforce meaningful sanctions on North Korean revenue streams used to fund its missile program have proven ineffective to date. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has put countries on notice that if they or their companies help North Korea -- also known as the DPRK -- they'll face penalties. That mostly means China, which accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade.That doesn't seem to be working yet.Lawmakers in the US House and Senate have overwhelmingly passed a bill that would expand economic sanctions on North Korea, but the White House has not definitively said Trump will sign the sweeping measure that also tightens restrictions on Iran and Russia.   Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, implored Trump to sign the bill following North Korea's missile test on Friday.\"These missile tests must be met with consequences. Earlier this week, I voted to increase sanctions against North Korea. The Senate has since taken the same action. I urge the President to quickly sign these sanctions into law to thwart further escalation of North Korea's missile systems,\" a statement from Turner said.Even if Trump does sign the bill there is no guarantee that additional sanctions will slow North Korea's march toward a long-range nuclear missile.  Pyongyang's nuclear aspirations have progressed forward rapidly despite previous sanctions, and Kim's regime has resisted any US attempts at negotiation that mandates de-nuclearization upfront.The secrets behind Kim Jong Un's personal piggy bankEarlier this year, Beijing called on Pyongyang to suspend its nuclear and missile tests while calling on the US to stop military exercises on and near the Korean Peninsula, which North Korea sees as a threat to its sovereignty.But neither the US nor North Korea has shown any willingness to compromise as the situation has escalated in recent months. Last month, CNN reported that the US military updated its options for North Korea with the goal of giving Trump plans for a rapid response, according to two US military officials at the time.Officials said the options, which include a military response, would be presented to the President if Pyongyang conducted an underground nuclear or ballistic missile test that indicates the regime has made significant progress toward developing a weapon that could attack the US.But a US preemptive attack continues to be highly problematic option because the Pentagon has long believed North Korea would in turn attack South Korea.As US military flexes, North Korea marches toward nuclear capabilityCIA Director Mike Pompeo said last week that the Trump administration needed to find a way to separate Kim from his growing nuclear stockpile.\"As for the regime, I am hopeful we will find a way to separate that regime from this system,\" Pompeo said. \"The North Korean people I'm sure are lovely people and would love to see him go.\"Those comments were met with harsh rhetoric from North Korea, which threatened a nuclear strike on \"the heart of the US\" if it attempts to remove Kim Jong Un as Supreme Leader, Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Tuesday.KCNA reported that a spokesman from the North Korean foreign ministry said, \"The DPRK legally stipulates that if the supreme dignity of the DPRK is threatened, it must preemptively annihilate those countries and entities that are directly or indirectly involved in it, by mobilizing all kinds of strike means including the nuclear ones.\"\"Should the US dare to show even the slightest sign of attempt to remove our supreme leadership, we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the US with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time,\" the foreign ministry spokesman added.Earlier this year, Trump said he would be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"under the right circumstances\" to defuse tensions over North Korea's nuclear program.No sitting US president has ever met with the leader of North Korea while in power, and the idea is extremely controversial.But some lawmakers now say they would support direct diplomacy with the North Korean regime.\"Sanctions without direct diplomatic engagement has been tried for over a decade and failed,\" Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement. \"Pressure cannot bring North Korea to the table until we are willing talk to them. Now is the time for President Trump to clearly state his diplomatic engagement strategy, how he intends to use unprecedented sanctions pressure to bring North Korea to the table, and allow American diplomats to talk directly with North Korean diplomats so long as they freeze testing of their nuclear and missile programs,\" he said.Lieu, a member of the House foreign affairs committee said he would also support engaging the Kim regime directly.\"If the choice is between military conflict or talking, I would support talking,\" Lieu told CNN.
