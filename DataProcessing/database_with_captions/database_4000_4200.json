        "content": "Story highlightsNorth Korea's latest missile could have range to hit Los Angeles and Chicago, experts sayUS should regard the launch as a \"grave warning,\" Pyongyang says  (CNN)North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile Friday that appears to have the range to hit major US cities, experts say, and prompted a fresh round of condemnation from the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.A combination of US, South Korean and Japanese analyses of the launch from Mupyong-ni, near North Korea's border with China, shows the missile flew about 45 minutes, going 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) high and for a distance of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).If the missile were fired on a flatter, standard trajectory, it would have major US cities such as Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago well within its range, with the possible ability to reach as far as New York and Boston, according to David Wright, a missile expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists.However, early analysis of Friday's test cannot determine how heavy a payload the missile was carrying in its warhead, Wright said. The heavier the payload, the shorter the range.

Experts had said that test showed Pyongyang had the ability to hit Alaska.Read MorePresident Donald Trump condemned the missile launch and said the United States would act to ensure its security.\"Threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy and deprive its people,\" Trump said in a written statement. \"The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.\"Kim calls weapons program a 'precious asset'Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency said Saturday that the latest missile launch was a Hwasong-14, the same missile tested earlier this month.Friday's test was designed to show the Hwasong-14's maximum range with a \"large-sized heavy nuclear warhead,\" it said, adding that Washington should regard the launch as a \"grave warning.\"North Korean state media was quick to tout the missile test as a success, with video and stills showing leader Kim Jong Un overseeing the launch and celebrating with the troops involved. North Koreans hailed the test-firing, the news agency said. Kim Yu Chol, a researcher at the State Academy of Sciences, called the achievement \"another great victory which dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialists and its vassal forces.\" Jo Son Hyang, a resident of Pyongyang's Rangnang District, said the \"future of the country is bright\" now that it has a \"powerful sword for keeping peace.\"JUST WATCHEDExpert: North Korea will continue to improveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExpert: North Korea will continue to improve 04:34Kim was quoted as saying \"the whole US mainland\" is now within North Korea's reach. He called Pyongyang's weapons program \"a precious asset\" that cannot be reversed or replaced, according to the agency.In the wake of the test, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., and Adm. Harry Harris, commander of US Pacific Command, called the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Lee Sun Jin, to express \"ironclad commitment\" to the US alliance with South Korea and discuss military response options.Hours after that call, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-fire exercise as a show of force in response to the test, according to Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis. The exercise included firing missiles into the ocean. Both militaries conducted a similar show of force after North Korea's first ICBM test in early July.If North Korea's assertions about Friday's test are true, Pyongyang may be even more advanced in its missile program than previously thought. Earlier in the week, a US official told CNN the United States believed that North Korea would be able to launch a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile by early 2018.The official said that while North Korea can currently get a missile \"off the ground,\" a lot of undetermined variables remain about guidance, re-entry and the ability to hit a specific target.China condemns launchChina, a longtime North Korean ally, issued a statement Saturday condemning the missile launch and asked Pyongyang to \"stop taking actions that would escalate tensions\" on the Korean Peninsula.North Korea's missile tests by the numbers\"The UN Security Council has clear regulations on North Korea's launch activities that use ballistic missile technologies. China is opposed to North Korea's launch activities in violation of UN Security Council resolutions and against the will of the international community,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.Beijing's statement reiterated its long-held position on North Korea's missile program.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said China and Russia need to do more to stop North Korea.\"As the principal economic enablers of North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,\" Tillerson said in a statement.After speaking Saturday with Tillerson, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said Tokyo would join Washington in new appeals to those countries to stop North Korea.The missile splashed down about 200 kilometers (120 miles) west of the Shakotan Peninsula of Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, well within Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, Kishida said. Not everyone agrees that North Korea launched an ICBM. The Russian Defense Ministry said its tracking indicated the weapon was a \"medium-range ballistic missile,\" Russian state news agency Tass reported Friday.     Nuclear-capable missile?Michael Elleman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated a range of at least 9,500 kilometers (5,900 miles) for the missile, according to Reuters news agency -- less than that estimated by Wright, but still potentially putting Los Angeles within reach.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korean missile classified as 'brand new'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korean missile classified as 'brand new' 02:10\"The key here is that North Korea has a second successful test in less than one month,\" he said. \"If this trend holds, they could establish an acceptably reliable ICBM before year's end.\"North Korea has seen a year of rapid progress in its missile program.Pyongyang has carried out 12 missile tests since February and conducted its first test of an ICBM on July 4 -- which it says could reach \"anywhere in the world.\"\"North Korea is slowly morphing into a nuclear and missile power right before our very eyes,\" said Harry J. Kazianis, director of defense studies at the Center for the National Interest and an expert on North Korea.\"North Korea will continue to test over and over again its missile technology and nuclear weapons in the months and years to come in order to develop the most lethal systems it can,\" Kazianis said. \"You can bet every time they do tensions will continue to rise. This is what makes the situation on the Korean Peninsula as dangerous as it is.\" Trump urged to respondLess than six years in power, Kim has tested more missiles than his father and grandfather combined.The North Korea threat: What can Trump do?The latest test has spurred calls for a response from the Trump administration. \"North Korea's latest missile test shows the Trump administration's actions are not changing North Korea's behavior and it's time for the President to articulate a comprehensive strategy to the American people -- so far he's failed to do that,\" Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu told CNN on Friday.Administration officials have warned that \"all options are on the table\" but a clear path forward has yet to materialize. Doug Bandow, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in foreign policy, told CNN that North Korea's missile launch shows its leaders are \"absolutely committed to their missile programs\" and not interested in tempering their activities.Bandow, who visited North Korea last month, said the regime is convinced that developing its missile program as a nuclear deterrent is absolutely necessary. It's a mindset, he said, that puts pressure on Trump, who finds himself in a situation with no good choices.CNN's Zachary Cohen, Barbara Starr, Junko Ogura, Steven Jiang, Taehoon Lee, Spencer Feingold and KJ Kwon contributed to this report.",

Currently, the Justice Department and both chambers of Congress are investigating whether there were improper contacts between those in the Trump orbit and Russia during the 2016 election. Here is a summary of known connections between Trump associates and Russia.The latest development comes as fired FBI director James Comey prepares to testify publicly in the Senate on June 7, where he will confirm bombshell accusations that President Donald Trump pressured him to end his investigation into a top Trump aide's ties to Russia.Comey will appear before the Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year's presidential election.Read MoreThe committee released Comey's prepared testimony ahead of the hearing. Read the full comments here. CNN has also learned that Russian government officials discussed having potentially \"derogatory\" information about then-presidential candidate Trump and some of his top aides in conversations intercepted by US intelligence during the 2016 election.One source described the information as financial in nature and said the discussion centered on whether the Russians had leverage over Trump's inner circle. The source said the intercepted communications suggested to US intelligence that Russians believed \"they had the ability to influence the administration through the derogatory information.\"But the sources, privy to the descriptions of the communications written by US intelligence, cautioned the Russian claims to one another \"could have been exaggerated or even made up\" as part of a disinformation campaign that the Russians did during the election.Sources have also told CNN that then-FBI director Comey knew that a critical piece of information relating to the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email was fake -- created by Russian intelligence -- but he feared that if it became public it would undermine the probe and the Justice Department itself.As a result, Comey acted unilaterally last summer to publicly declare the investigation over -- without consulting then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- while at the same time stating that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of classified information. His press conference caused a firestorm of controversy and drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.Comey's actions based on what he knew was Russian disinformation offer a stark example of the way Russian interference impacted the decisions of the highest-level US officials during the 2016 campaign.The FBI's criminal probe is also increasingly touching on the multiple roles of senior White House adviser Jared Kushner on both the Trump campaign and the Trump transition team.Points of focus that pertain to Kushner include: the Trump campaign's 2016 data analytics operation; his relationship with former national security adviser Michael Flynn; and Kushner's own contacts with Russians, according to US officials briefed on the probe.That news came on the heels of CNN's reporting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not disclose meetings he had last year with Russian officials when he applied for his security clearance, according to the Justice Department.Sessions, who met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at least two times last year, didn't note those interactions on the form, which requires him to list \"any contact\" he or his family had with a foreign government or its representatives over the past seven years, officials said.To obtain a security clearance, a federal official is not required to list the meetings if they were part of a foreign conference he or she attended while conducting government business.  Sessions' meetings, however, do not appear to be tied to foreign conferences.Sessions is just the latest in a growing list of current and former Trump associates who have come under fire for being less than forthcoming about their past links to Russia. Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn continues to make headlines despite saying he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights rather than comply with a subpoena and disclose records about his meetings with Russian officials.The House Intelligence Committee has issued subpoenas to Flynn and Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen -- seeking their testimony, as well as documents from their businesses.The leaders of the Senate's Russia investigation said they will continue to pursue critical documents from Flynn, issuing two additional subpoenas to a pair of businesses Flynn ran.Previously, lawmakers have said the panel was reviewing a range of options to compel Flynn hand over the documents, including holding him in contempt. Committee chairman Sen. Richard Burr said the panel \"could\" call for Flynn to assert his right against self-incrimination in a public session.RELATED: How Michael Flynn lost his job in 23 days     People to know   See CNN's list of the growing and diverse cast of characters who have played a role in this story.How we got hereHere is a timeline with everything you need to know about the key players in the Russia-White House story and their roles in some of the most pivotal moments so far.The firing of now-former FBI director James Comey was one of the most high-profile moments. Here is how it played out.The latest Secret document: The Washington Post published a story May 24 claiming that a secret document that officials said played a key role in then-FBI director Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation \"has long been viewed within the FBI as unreliable and possibly a fake.\" The Post's story sites anonymous sources \"familiar with its contents.\"FBI documents detail how the Russians try to recruit spiesExplosive testimony: Former CIA Director John Brennan and Trump's Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats also made headlines as Brennan told lawmakers there was clear contact between Trump campaign aides and Russian operatives. At almost the same time, Coats said he would be willing to discuss later whether Trump leaned on him to push back against Russia reports. Here is more on what we learned from their congressional testimony May 23.Mueller and the secret Comey memos: CNN broke the story May 22 that Robert Mueller -- the former FBI director now overseeing the Department of Justice's investigation into Russia's election-year meddling and contact with the Trump campaign -- has been briefed on the contents of some of the memos that former FBI Director James Comey kept to document his conversations with Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter.Team Trump's \"war room\": Axios recently reported that the White House is preparing to establish an internal, war-room-like operation aimed at developing a rapid-response and communications strategy in an attempt to keep up with the special counsel's Russia investigation.Manafort turns over documents: Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, turned over more than 300 pages of documents to the Senate intelligence committee related to its investigation of Russian election meddling, according to a source familiar with the Senate probe. Read CNN's story here. Trump asked intelligence officials to deny evidence: The President asked two of the government's top intelligence chiefs to publicly deny evidence of cooperation between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, multiple current and former US officials confirmed to CNN on May 23.

But it was also a sign that drug smugglers continue to use known waterway routes and transit zones to move illegal substances into the US despite Trump's emphasis on border security. Trump's border wall pledge and realityThis unabated challenge has amplified questions around the President's call to allocate major funding toward a wall along the southern US border -- a project that is estimated to cost between $12 billion and $22 billion. Specifically, two major issues concerning the wall and drug smuggling have been raised: Will it actually reduce the flow of illicit substances into the US? And will money used to pay for its construction siphon off needed resources from other drug enforcement arms? Read MoreBased on the results of a presidential election that embraced the chant \"build that wall!,\" Trump supporters have made their priority known.White House press secretary Sean Spicer reiterated Trump's dedication to building the wall several times last week despite the project being left out of a spending bill to fund the government through September.\"Make no mistake, the wall is going to be built,\" and the President \"wants it done as soon as possible,\" Spicer told reporters on Monday. But evidence suggesting that drug traffickers will continue to find ways to move their products into the US even if a wall is eventually constructed raises a broader point about Trump's immigration approach and funding priorities. On immigration, Trump has plenty to show in 100 daysTrump has managed to make a palpable difference in US immigration enforcement through sharp rhetoric and executive actions that, according to analysts, has at least partially contributed to a sharp drop in apprehensions of individuals illegally crossing the southwest border in both February and March. There were roughly 12,000 total apprehensions at the southwest border in March, according to numbers obtained by CNN. That represented a 35% drop from this February and a 63% drop from March 2016.7 unanswered questions about Trump's immigration plansYearly drug seizures at the US-Mexico border have also declined slightly since January 2017, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House has often touted similar trends to back Trump's promise that a wall \"will get built and help stop drugs (and) human trafficking.\"  But law enforcement officials and experts told CNN that building a wall wouldn't solve the problem of illegal drugs entering the US, just displace it -- a point of view that the Department of Homeland Security recently acknowledged. \"Down doesn't mean stopped,\" David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, told reporters last week. \"Part of the reason that drugs come through waterways is because they're looking for other ways around where we have good defenses.\"  Photos: Views from the borderThe US-Mexico border spans 1,933 miles. It runs from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. President Trump's pledge to build a wall along the border was a key part of his campaign.

Hide Caption 20 of 20The rate of drug seizures on its own can't be used as a definitive measure of success in stopping the flow of drugs, since it's impossible to gauge how many illicit substances still made it through the border and how many traffickers decided not to move their product in the first place out of fear of apprehension. But it's a widely used indicator of the trend lines in drug trafficking at various ports of entry.Halfway through fiscal year 2017, US Customs and Border Protection has recorded 5,258 combined drug seizures along the Mexican border, on track for slightly less than the 11,459 documented in 2016.\"If we've created a barrier to drugs coming a certain way, they're going to find another way to do it,\" Lapan said. \"So just because drugs are down in border patrol doesn't mean that we've gotten control or that it has stopped.\"Some experts warn that the focus on building a wall without improving security at existing entry points will do nothing to stem the flow of drugs into the US overall.\"The wall will redirect the nature of smuggling but will prove to be spectacularly ineffective when it comes to actually stopping the flow of drugs,\" predicted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow for global drug policy at the Brookings Institution.Despite these criticisms, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly has supported the project. But he stopped short of Trump's claim to the Associated Press last month that, \"We'll stop all of it. ... The wall will stop the drugs.\"In congressional testimony in April, Kelly acknowledged that illegal drugs coming across the Mexican border \"mostly come through the ports of entry\" and other routes that would not directly be impacted by the construction of a blockade.Air and water vs. landFor years, the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, Drug Enforcement Agency and other federal and local law enforcement agencies have confiscated large quantities of drugs headed to the US by air and water -- channels that would remain unimpeded by a wall. Drug seizure statistics for nearly every agency involved in this coordinated effort have fluctuated in recent years, but they do indicate certain trends about how different drugs are moved in different ways.The amount of cocaine seized via sea and air is significantly higher than the amount along land-based routes -- the Coast Guard intercepted 228,564 pounds of cocaine from October 2016 through March 2017 compared to 2,899 pounds of cocaine confiscated by border agents at land-based ports of entry along the southern US during that same time.In 2016, the Coast Guard also seized dramatically more cocaine than its colleagues patrolling land-based entry points along the southern border, preventing over 400,000 pounds from entering the US compared to 4,000 pounds collected en route via land from Mexico. JUST WATCHEDWhat history tells us about Trump's wallReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat history tells us about Trump's wall 01:22Additionally, the air and marine branch of the US Customs and Border Patrol reported that it seized 18,653 pounds of cocaine moving through routes in the Caribbean over that period. While air and sea routes seem to be the preference for moving large quantities of cocaine to the US, agents at the southern border have confiscated dramatically more marijuana than did law enforcement in other regions. The more than 500,000 pounds of marijuana seized by land-based border patrol agents through March of fiscal year 2017 dwarfs quantities collected by any other major law enforcement group.  However, Kelly told NBC last week that marijuana \"is not a factor in the drug war,\" and instead placed higher importance on methamphetamines and heroin, as well as cocaine.Law enforcement groups have seized more methamphetamine and heroin along the US-Mexico border than other smuggling routes -- but they've intercept significantly fewer shipments, and in total smaller quantities, of those drugs overall than marijuana and cocaine. White House drug policy office facing massive cuts, draft memo saysHalfway through fiscal year 2017, border patrol agents have intercepted more than 4,000 pounds of methamphetamines and nearly 500 pounds of heroin along the Mexican border -- amounts that are comparable to those recorded in 2016 and 2015 but pale in comparison to the haul of more than 500,000 pounds of marijuana and over 200,000 pounds of cocaine seized across all law enforcement departments.Kelly highlighted Mexico as the primary source of foreign methamphetamines and heroin entering the US.But a wall may do little to stop the flow of these substances, since Mexican drug cartels tend to hide their product in legal cargo and drive it through checkpoints at the border, Felbab-Brown said -- points of entry that will continue to exist no matter how high a wall might be. And more than 350,000 vehicles, 135,000 pedestrians and 30,000 trucks move through 167 border crossings every day, according to the General Services Administration, which operates land-based ports of entry. At that volume, it is nearly impossible for agents to catch even a large portion of illegal shipments or to know how much drug cargo is getting through. \"Law enforcement is never a complete solution,\" according to Jim Plitt, a deputy special agent working for Homeland Security's investigative arm in San Diego and primarily focused on targeting the groups directing smuggling operations into the US.A tall billTrump's plan to add thousands of additional border agents could help combat the flow of these substances through these checkpoints, but hiring could take five to 10 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.Trump admin looks at ways to hire more border agentsDespite congressional approval of a bill that would add $1.5 billion for broader border security through September 2017, finding enough future funding for a wall in addition to 5,000 more border agents and immigration officers, increased detention capacity and more immigration judges remains a tall task.DHS has limited ability to move money around in its budget, and would almost certainly be unable to fund most of the Trump administration's border enforcement plans on its own.GOP leaders have already been put on notice by members of their own party that more spending had better come with a way to pay for it -- a point that likely means lawmakers will be forced to make significant cuts to other federal departments or choose between a wall and beefing up additional border measures. Outside of broad cost estimates, few details are known about the wall save that the administration intends to pay for it with significant cuts in other areas.Early versions of Trump's spending bill indicated the wall would partially be paid for by cuts to the Coast Guard -- the lead federal agency for maritime law enforcement -- but that proposal sparked criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and is not a part of the bill that negotiators have drawn up to keep the government open through September 2017. JUST WATCHEDThese Americans would live in shadow of a Trump wallReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThese Americans would live in shadow of a Trump wall 03:32But neither is Trump's wall.Bipartisan congressional negotiators opted not to allocate any money towards the project in the $1 trillion spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday.Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, testified in February that DHS needs not only additional resources at these land-based checkpoints but also to intercept cargo along water routes and tunneling systems.Whatever budget ends up passing, law enforcement will have to cope with it -- a reality that will endure whether or not a wall is built -- said Plitt. He noted that law enforcement groups are tasked with taking the resources they are given and using them to the maximum effect.\"While criminals wake up and say 'what do we want to try,' law enforcement wakes up every day and says 'what do we have,'\" he told CNN. He called it a constant challenge to move resources to \"where criminals are or where they are going to be.\"CNN's David Shortell and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.",

Jeff Davis said.The 10-hour mission was carried out by two US Air Force B-1B Lancers assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron from Dyess Air Force Base, Texas, a US military official told CNN.Read MoreThe bombers flew from Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in the vicinity of Kyushu, Japan, the East China Sea, and the Korean peninsula.They were joined by Japanese and Korean F-15s performing two separate bilateral missions, the official said.US bombers have maintained a presence in the Pacific since 2004.US military flexing Tuesday's bomber flight is just the latest demonstration of US military might in recent months aimed at sending a message to North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un -- and the sixth B-1 bomber flight conducted by the US since April 1.Despite a consistent US military presence in his backyard, Kim has defiantly continued to march toward developing a long-range nuclear missile.US B-1 bombers fly over Korean PeninsulaEarlier this year, Beijing called on Pyongyang to suspend its nuclear and missile testing while calling on the US to stop military exercises on and near the Korean Peninsula, which North Korea sees as a threat to its sovereignty. But neither the US nor North Korea has showed signs of compromising.As US military flexes, North Korea marches toward nuclear capabilityNorth Korea continues to test missiles at an unprecedented rate, while US warships and aircraft have maintained a consistent presence in the region for months.Trump's confusing North Korea tweetWhile the US conducts bomber flights in the region on a routine basis, Tuesday's joint training mission is particularly noteworthy as it comes just one day after the death of Otto Warmbier -- a 22-year-old American who was detained in North Korea for 17 months.The North Korean government handed Warmbier over to US authorities in a vegetative state last week and his death has spurred calls for a US response from several lawmakers.  Trump: Warmbier 'should have been brought home a long time ago'Trump called Warmbier's death at the hands of North Korea a \"disgrace,\" and took to Twitter on Tuesday to offer additional thoughts about China's role in reining in Pyongyang: \"While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!\"Multiple US officials told CNN they are checking on what the President meant by \"not worked out.\" One Trump administration official said bluntly they didn't know what the President was referencing when asked what the tweet meant. Another said there was no meeting earlier in the day that they feel could have spurred this comment or that that tweet foretold some sort of action against North Korea.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Tuesday offered few details about how the US plans to respond to Warmbier's death, promising only that the US will \"continue to apply economic and political pressure\" to change North Korea's behavior.\"The President has spoken very clearly about how he and the first lady and our country feels about the loss of this American,\" Spicer said.Spicer said the US is continuing to work with China to apply pressure on North Korea and said the US has seen \"positive movement\" with China. The US will \"continue to work with them and others to put the appropriate pressure on North Korea to change the behavior of this regime,\" Spicer said.Asked whether Trump would still consider meeting with Kim Jong Un given the right conditions, Spicer said: \"Clearly we're moving further away, not closer, to those conditions being met.\"No sitting US president has ever met with the leader of North Korea while in power.CNN's Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe two most recent sightings occurred late Wednesday and on ThursdayRussian aircraft have also been spotted recently flying near the coastline of US allies, including JapanWashington (CNN)Russian military aircraft were spotted flying off the coast of Alaska for the fourth time in as many days, a spokesperson for the North American Aerospace Defense Command told CNN on Friday.The two most recent sightings occurred late Wednesday and on Thursday, with the first involving two IL-38 maritime patrol aircraft and the second involving two Tu-95 nuclear-capable Bear bombers.Russian aircraft never entered US airspace but US F-22s and Canadian CF-18s jets were dispatched to perform an intercept during Thursday's encounter, according to NORAD. \"Obviously -- we are aware of it,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Friday. \"This is not highly unusual ... but we monitor everything.\"On Thursday, the bombers entered the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone 700 nautical miles southwest of Anchorage -- significantly farther from the US coastline than two other encounters that occurred on Monday and Tuesday. Read MoreThe Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone is a designated region of international airspace, primarily surrounding the US and Canada, that is meant as a buffer to allow for the identification of aircraft heading towards North America. While these flights pose no real military threat, US defense officials are taking notice of the high frequency at which they've occurred this week.There is \"no other way to interpret this other than as strategic messaging,\" one official told CNN.While the Russians have not conducted flights of this nature since 2015, another senior defense official stressed that they are \"not a concern\" and attributed the uptick to a recent lack of available Russian aircraft and need to boost training. \"We haven't seen this sort of level of activity for a couple of years,\" said John Cornelio, a NORAD spokesperson, though he emphasized it was not \"unprecedented\" or \"unusual.\"This \"shows the value of NORAD and that binational US and Canada relationship,\" he said, pointing to the two nations working together to identify and intercept the Russian long-range aircraft.Earlier in the week, US defense officials called recent sightings of the bombers \"nothing out of the ordinary\" -- itself an indication that both nations are toeing the line between routine military posturing and escalating provocation.On Monday, US F-22 fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers in international airspace 100 miles from Kodiak Island, Alaska.

Fox News was first to report the incident. Meghan Henderson, a spokesperson for European Command (EUCOM), confirmed to CNN that an intercept took place while the US aircraft was \"flying in international airspace over the Baltic Sea\"The Russian Knights aerobatic demonstration team fly in their Sukhoi SU-27s on February 9, 2013.\"Due to the high rate of closure speed and poor control of the (Russian) aircraft during the intercept, this interaction was determined to be unsafe,\" she said.

The vast majority of these encounters have been safe and professional, the official added -- a point that adds to the significance of Monday's incident. \"Russia is certainly within its right to exercise within international airspace, but we want them to respect international standards for safety to prevent accidents,\" said US Navy spokesperson Capt. Jeff Davis.\"The vast majority of interactions we have, intercepts that occur when we fly and that are intercepted by the Russians are safe. This is an exception, not the norm, but we were again operating in international airspace and did nothing to provoke,\" Davis said.This latest intercept also occurred amid rising tensions between the two nations in Europe and the Middle East. First on CNN: US shoots down another pro-regime drone in SyriaOn Monday, Russia warned that US aircraft operating in specific regions in Syria would be considered \"air targets\" for its forces after a US Navy jet shot down a pro-regime fighter jet. While both the US and Russia say their forces are in Syria to fight ISIS, Russia has allied itself with the regime of Syrian President Bahsar al-Assad while the US-led coalition has aligned with groups that oppose both the Assad regime and ISIS.Against backdrop of uncertainty, US B-52 bombers deploy to EuropeEarlier this month, the US Air Force deployed long-range B-52 bombers and 800 airmen to the United Kingdom in support of joint exercises with NATO allies and partners across Europe.Those exercises have primarily taken place in the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and along Russia's border with several NATO partners.Over the weekend over 1,000 US and NATO troops conducted a defensive drill in the Suwalki Gap in the border area between Poland and Lithuania.

        "content": "Story highlightsThe 10,000-ton USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal collided early SaturdayJapanese coast guard revises its crash time estimate to 1:30 a.m.Washington (CNN)Nearly an hour passed before the crew of a container ship reported its collision with a US destroyer, according to the Japanese coast guard, raising more questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the death of seven American sailors.  The 10,000-ton USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal, a 29,000-ton container ship flagged in the Philippines, collided early Saturday local time off Japan's Izu Peninsula, officials said. The area sees heavy maritime traffic, with 400 to 500 vessels crossing it daily.  Initially, the Japanese Coast Guard said that the distress call from the ACX Crystal came at 2:25 a.m. on Saturday -- five minutes after it crashed into the USS Fitzgerald at 2:20 a.m.But after interviewing the ACX Crystal's crew, the Japanese coast guard revised its crash time estimate to 1:30 a.m.Japanese officials say a delay of 50 minutes or more between when the collision occurred and when it was reported would not be unusual for the merchant ship, as the crew could be busy determining damage to the vessel and avoiding other craft in the busy shipping lanes.Read MoreThe US 7th Fleet is maintaining that the collision occurred at 2:20 a.m. -- and both US and Japanese officials have declined to explain why there is a discrepancy regarding timing.The US Navy guided missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald arrives at the US Naval base, Yokosuka, in the Japanese prefecture of Kanagawa on June 17. Timing will play a critical role in determining exactly how the collision happened, particularly as the shipping data from Marinetraffic.com appears to indicate that the ACX Crystal made a sharp right turn at close to 1:30 am -- the time that the Japanese coast guard said the crash occurred. On Sunday, Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the US 7th Fleet, would not speculate on how the accident occurred, but said there would be multiple investigations into the collision, including one by the Navy's Judge Advocate General and one by the US Coast Guard.Other investigations could come from the Japanese and Philippine authorities, because of where the accident took place and the Philippine registration of the container ship.Japanese officials say the investigations are expected to take months, if not years.      The US guided-missile destroyer suffered severe damage to its starboard side, while the container ship sustained light damage. A 7th Fleet statement said the collision caused \"significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room.\"Searchers found the bodies of the seven missing sailors on Sunday in the ship's flooded berthing compartments.President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Monday to offer his condolences. \"My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the 7 @USNavy sailors of the #USSFitzgerald and their families,\" Trump tweeted.

The warship was towed back to Yokosuka, escorted by a Japanese coast guard ship, naval officials said. It arrived at port late Saturday, when divers began inspecting the damage.Earlier, the ship's commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors. All three are in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan.Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said. US and Japanese aircraft also were involved.No one hurt on merchant shipThe merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said. It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by Dainichi-Invest Corporation, NYK said.A photo from shipping company NYK shows damage from the collision.No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. NYK and the ship's owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said. \"Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected,\" NYK said.The ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the ship had left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p.m. local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company.Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow.Damage to the Philippine container ship ACX Crystal is seen after it collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the waters off Izu Peninsula, this photo released by Japan's coast guard shows.Shipping zone can be precariousThe area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said. About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said.The last known fatal incident there was in September 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japan's coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead. The area has seen two other major collisions in the past five years.     In such a busy shipping lane, the ships may have been in a \"restricted navigation\" situation, meaning they would have had o observe strict rules for movement and positioning in relation to other vessels in their vicinity, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor.Those rules leave vessels little room to maneuver, as turning away from one ship could place a vessel at risk of an even more serious incident with another, Schuster said.The Fitzgerald is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer with a crew of approximately 330 sailors. The 10,000-ton vessel is 505 feet long.It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the service said.The 29,000-ton container ship, which handles general cargo, includes a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long.The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said.An injured USS Fitzgerald crew member is carried by US military personnel, left, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force members upon arriving Saturday to the US Naval Base in Yokosuka Japan.The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said. That could account for the missing sailors, who may have been on deck on watch or even just relaxing in the night air, he said.Sailors also could have been trapped in compartments below deck, Schuster said, pointing out that container ships have a bulbous bow below the water line, which may have plowed into the US warship.Experienced commander in chargeBenson, the Fitzgerald's commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ship's executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month.Cmdr. Bryce Benson The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University. He commanded the minesweeper USS Guardian, operating out of Sasebo, Japan, from 2008 to 2010, before taking shore assignments in Washington and with US Pacific Command.The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month. On May 9, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula.No injuries were reported in that incident, which a Navy official said occurred when the fishing boat's crew did not have a radio to hear warnings from the US warship.The guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in late January while anchoring near Yokosuka, damaging its propellers and discharging 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil into the bay.Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of the commanding officer. He was transported by medevac for treatment.  CNN's Zachary Cohen, Steve Almasy, Barbara Starr, Tammy Kupperman, Michael Callahan and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsAir Force officials have vowed that there were no plans to retire the entire A-10 fleetThe Air Force has paid for new wings for 173 aircraft, but doesn't have funding for another 110Washington (CNN)The US Air Force is telling Congress to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to upgrading the venerable A-10 Warthog fleet.As the service rolled out its budget this year, Air Force officials vowed there were no plans to retire the entire A-10 fleet -- despite previous attempts -- but that doesn't mean all of the planes in the fleet are safe.The Air Force has warned Congress that more than a third of the 283 A-10 attack aircraft fleet may have to be permanently grounded unless Congress increases the Air Force's budget to restart the production line that makes new wings for the planes.The Air Force has paid for new wings needed to extend the life of 173 A-10 aircraft, but does not have the funding for the other 110 in the fleet, and about 40 would have to be grounded by 2021 unless additional funds are allocated, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.The Air Force didn't include money for the extra wings in its latest budget request. But it did drop in a $103 million request on its so-called \"wish list\" for A-10 wings.Read MoreThe wish lists, known officially as unfunded requirements, are provided to Congress to request money for programs that didn't get funded in the military's budget request.The military has a wish list for Congress -- and it's more than $31 billion longBoeing, which made the new wings for the A-10, has since shut down their plant line. The Air Force's $103 million request, along with $20 million provided in the current fiscal year, would pay for opening a new line and the production of four new wings, an Air Force official told CNN.Defense budget experts say the move to include the plane's wings on its unfunded requirements list resembles a tactic often employed by the military to push Congress to add in funding for politically popular programs, giving the services more room to maneuver within the budget request.\"It's a classic budgetary tactic to not include funding for something you know Congress is going to make you fund,\" said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It effectively puts the onus on Congress to find an offset rather than the Air Force. The Air Force is hoping that Congress will pay for this by giving the Air Force additional funds and cutting something elsewhere in the budget, but there is no guarantee of that. If it was truly a high priority, it would have made it into the regular budget request,\" Harrison said.Air Force gives new life to the A-10 Warthog For years, the Navy included F/A-18 fighter jets on its unfunded requirements list but not the budget, which Congress then added into the final appropriations bill.The issue of the A-10 wing funding came to a head last week during congressional testimony.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, an Air Force acquisition official, testified to Congress that the Air Force was committed to maintaining six of its nine A-10 squadrons flying through 2030.\"Additional A-10 force structure is contingent on future budget levels and force structure requirements,\" Bunch wrote in his written testimony.Rep. Martha McSally, a former A-10 pilot who has been one of the most vocal defenders of the aircraft in Congress, pressed the Air Force to explain why it was considering dropping to just six squadrons.\"It's the first time you've publicly said that you're going to go down to six squadrons,\" McSally said. \"I'd really like to know what those planning assumptions are of the six squadrons.\"Her questions, however, were only submitted for the record, since the hearing was ended due to House votes.Lawmakers have wrestled with how to replace the A-10 for years -- a tall task due to the aircraft's continued effectiveness despite making its first flight in 1975.The Air Force had originally planned for its version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to replace the A-10.But unlike the multi-role F-35, the A-10 is the only airplane in the Air Force specifically designed for close-air support, a function that has become urgent in the fight against ISIS, according to Air Force officials.The A-10 is able to target enemy forces up close without risking friendly fire casualties because the pilots are flying slow enough to visually distinguish between enemy and friendly forces.Last year, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said there were plans to defer the A-10's retirement until 2022, at which point it would be replaced by the F-35.Air Force looking to replace A-10 WarthogBut while the first wave of F-35s are currently being deployed for combat, the program's history of delays and cost overruns has caused the Pentagon to consider extending the operational life of the A-10 to meet the demands of the counter-ISIS mission.Air Force officials are also downplaying the idea that the retirement of several A-10 squadrons is imminent pointing out that the service is still evaluating options for funding additional wings.

The Pentagon sent the 97,000-ton USS Carl Vinson with an escort of a guided-missile cruiser and two destroyers after the latest missile test by North Korea last week.JUST WATCHEDTensions build between US and North KoreaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTensions build between US and North Korea 01:55On Wednesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the deployment was routine. Speaking to reporters in Moscow, he said there was \"no particular objective\" to its current course, adding that he \"would not read too much\" into its recent deployment to the waters near the Korean Peninsula. Read MoreAt the same time, the deployment is a military show of force, signaling to North Korea that the US military can operate at sea in areas where the regime might engage in ballistic missile operations or other military provocations, according to US military officials.But it's a signal with limited military utility. An aircraft carrier would not be military significant in operations against North Korea because of the vulnerability of its fighter jets in North Korean airspace.Some of the carrier's communications suites could be used to command an operation if it came to that, but contingency plans have generally focused on US and South Korean commanders running any operations from shore.Analysis of North Korean statement \"While at face value harsh and aggressive, the North Korea statement issued Tuesday is no more confrontational than usual, probably more in the range of 7 or 8 on North Korea's rhetorical volume knob.But that does not dilute their message, or express a sign of willingness to compromise. The language states the DPRK's viewpoint quite simply, without any sign of softening or hardening of their already very firmly stated positions.This is not the first, second or even third time the Carl Vinson has visited these waters over the years. The current tasking of the aircraft carrier group will not have any success in persuading Pyongyang to halting or even slowing down its nuclear weapons program, everything points to it having the opposite effect.\"-- Tim Schwarz, CNN Beijing Bureau chief, writing from PyongyangIt is the destroyers and cruisers, as well as a fast-attack submarine accompanying the carrier, that could be called into action if there was an operation against a North Korean ballistic missile launch. But officials emphasized the US and Japan always maintain some anti-missile capability in the western Pacific prepared to deal with North Korea.The strike group has been at sea since January and conducted military exercises with other nations in the western Pacific, including Japan and the Republic of Korea.The carrier group is now conducting some training with Australian forces and may also do additional training with Japanese forces as it heads further north, officials said. The Navy usually does not discuss ship locations in detail before they arrive. To some extent, US commanders are ensuring they have the right assets and top level personnel on duty if there is a North Korean provocation, given the rising rhetoric from the regime there.In another sign of US military concern, Gen. Vincent Brooks, the top US commander in South Korea, has decided skip long-planned congressional hearings and remain in the country.\"All decisions regarding the schedules of USFK leadership are based on our alliance priority to maintain readiness at all times,\" said Col. Robert Manning, a US military spokesman.Even that move is not unprecedented, however. In 2013, the US commander at the time also skipped congressional hearings due to tensions in the region.Complicated scenario Carrying more than 5,000 sailors and 60 aircraft, the USS Carl Vinson is escorted by guided-missile destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and USS Michael Murphy and the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain.The group's ships and air wing provide significant firepower and strike capability, but balancing the available military options with the potential of retaliation from North Korea presents a complicated scenario for President Trump.China -- North Korea's closest ally -- has pressed the US to engage in direct diplomatic negotiations with North Korea. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that Beijing understands how dangerous North Korea's nuclear program has become and agrees action must be taken to stop it, but China hasn't signaled any change in its approach to Pyongyang since a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi last week.US allies South Korea and Japan, which has seen previous North Korean missile tests fall within 200 miles of its coast, both supported the deployment of the Vinson group.South Korea said the group's deployment was recognition of the \"grave situation on the Korean Peninsula,\" while Japan said it was \"important to secure the power of US deterrence.\"The White House faces a tough task in convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear program, retired Gen. Michael\u00a0Hayden, a former head of the CIA and National Security Agency told CNN's \"New Day.\"     \"No matter what we do there is this move by North Korea to build missiles and put weapons on top of missiles,\" Hayden said.\"This is what they count on for regime survival. ... The best we can do is box it where it is right now,\" he said. \"I don't think we can make them give up the program.\" Missile interceptMany analysts believe the movement of US warships is likely defensive in nature, setting the stage for a scenario in which the Vinson strike group could be called upon to perform a missile intercept. The three escort warships traveling with the Vinson have more than 300 combined missile tubes and are outfitted with the Aegis anti-missile system, according to Bruce Bennett, senior defense analyst at the think tank Rand Corp. \"If North Korea were to test some number of ballistic missiles by firing them into the East Sea/Sea of Japan, these warships would have the potential of intercepting the North Korean test missile,\" Bennett said.     Intercepting a long-range rocket test passing overhead would send a clear message to Kim and would be justifiable as the rockets would possibly be on course to pass over Japan, according to Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Brisbane, Australia.\"The Carl Vinson group is commanded from Hawaii, rather than the US military base in Japan, so it's a clear American initiative not a Japanese or South Korea one,\" Layton told CNN. \"That may defuse attempts to link Japan and South Korea and thus limit the possibility of any North Korean aggression against them.\"While the carrier group has been deployed to the Korean Peninsula in the past, lawmakers are wondering how the US warships will be directed to respond to another North Korean missile test.  \"Are we going to try to shoot that intercontinental ballistic missile down? Are we going to let the test go on unpaid on unimpeded? Republican Rep. Will Hurd asked on CNN's \"New Day.\" \"These are questions that should be asked of Congress.\"JUST WATCHEDUS strike group headed toward Korean PeninsulaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS strike group headed toward Korean Peninsula 02:06Offensive strike capabilitiesThe Trump administration has floated the idea of carrying out preemptive strikes against North Korea, but the scope and method of potential offensive actions remain unclear. The Vinson's air wing, made up of more than 40 F/A-18 Hornets, provides the offensive capability to attack enemy targets with bombs or missiles while the carrier's E/A-18G Growler aircraft have the ability to jam enemy radars, disrupt enemy electronic surveillance and provide \"cover\" for attacking aircraft.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Justice Department and both chambers of Congress are all now investigating alleged Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 elections and whether President Donald Trump's associates colluded with Moscow -- an ever-evolving saga that is showing no signs of slowing down despite the firing of the man who long found himself spearheading the probe, now-former FBI director James Comey. CNN has compiled a list of the growing and diverse cast of characters amid news that a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser has pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with Russians who had close ties to the Kremlin, the campaign's clearest connection so far to Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.US officialsSeveral US lawmakers and agency heads have emerged as visible, and at times controversial, figures in the investigations into connections between individuals in Trump's orbit and Russian hacking of Democratic Party groups including the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta. Robert Mueller -- The Justice Department named Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election after the firing of Comey on May 9. The former FBI director has a long history with investigations and prosecutions. Mueller was former Comey's predecessor.Read MoreThe longtime litigator was the second-longest FBI director in history, only behind iconic and controversial director J. Edgar Hoover. Congress passed legislation in 2011 to extend Mueller's term from the usual 10 years, giving him a 12-year tenure.Mueller, 72, oversaw the FBI from September 4, 2001, just days before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, until September 4, 2013.He is widely seen as a nonpolitical, dogged investigator, respected on both sides of the aisle. The extension of his term passed the Senate 100-0, and he was also initially confirmed in 2001 unanimously, 98-0.JUST WATCHEDRecap: Comey hearing in less than 3 minutesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRecap: Comey hearing in less than 3 minutes 02:41James Comey -- The now-former FBI director was fired abruptly by Trump, but seemed to have a knack for finding himself in the middle of high-profile political controversies while serving as the nation's top law enforcement officer. Months after weathering criticism from both parties over his handling of the investigation into Hilary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, Comey once again is front and center in another political storm. Most recently, he dropped a bombshell before the House Intelligence Committee when he told lawmakers that the bureau was investigating not only Russian hacking and other alleged interference in the 2016 vote, but whether there was any coordination between Trump figures and Moscow as part of its intrusions. JUST WATCHEDNSA chief denies British spying accusationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNSA chief denies British spying accusation 01:00Mike Rogers -- Late last year, Rogers was simultaneously a candidate to be promoted to Director of National Intelligence under President-elect Trump and on the hot seat to be fired as director of the National Security Agency by then-President Barack Obama. Eventually, Rogers remained in his role as the director of the NSA under Trump and now finds himself among those agency heads testifying before Congress as an authority on cybersecurity as it relates to hacks by suspect Russian-relate groups.Rogers played a key role in last week's House hearing with Comey when he joined the FBI director in refuting Trump's claim that Obama had had his phones tapped during the campaign. He in particular batted down the notion that the Obama administration requested that the British eavesdrop on Trump, an unfounded assertion made on Fox News cited by the Trump White House.JUST WATCHEDSpicer: I hope Yates testifiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSpicer: I hope Yates testifies 00:52Sally Yates -- A holdover from the Obama administration, the most memorable moment of Yates' short tenure as acting Attorney General may have been her firing in the early days of the Trump administration after she refused to implement the President's orders barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.Yates also briefed Trump's White House counsel on former national security adviser Michael Flynn's meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, communications that ultimately led to Flynn's resignation. Her scheduled testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on ties between Russian agents and Trump campaign officials was abruptly cancelled by committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The White House rejected allegations that it had sought to prevent Yates from testifying.JUST WATCHEDClapper denies Trump wiretap claims ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClapper denies Trump wiretap claims  00:46James Clapper -- The director of national intelligence under Obama has never been shy in offering criticism of Trump, clashing with him over the latter's public disparagement of intelligence officers, wiretapping allegations and views on Russian hacking. Clapper, along with Comey and then-CIA Director John Brennan, briefed Trump on Russian hacking during the election campaign just hours after the President-elect doubled down on his dismissal of the threat as an artificial and politically driven controversy, calling it a \"witch hunt.\" He has also had been invited to testify by Congress. John Brennan -- Nearly three years ago, John Brennan, acting CIA director at the time, found himself apologizing to the Senate intelligence committee and acknowledging that the CIA had spied on senators' computers after previously vehemently denying the claims. Now, Brennan, who has been out of the role since January, is testifying about his own concerns about espionage from Russia via possible contacts with the Trump campaign.Dan Coats -- Less than two months into his tenure as Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats is being thrust into the public spotlight -- asked to testify before Congress amid an investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 election.It is a potentially precarious situation for the former US lawmaker and diplomat who is now serving as Trump's principal adviser on intelligence matters and head of US intelligence efforts.Confirmed to his new post in March, Coats now finds himself involved in an investigation looking into possible collusion between a foreign power and members of the campaign that helped elect the man who picked him for the post.Members of CongressMike Conaway -- Rep. Mike Conaway has been given the reins to the House intelligence committee's fractured Russia investigation following chairman Rep. Devin Nunes' announcement that he is temporarily stepping aside --- but who is the man now tasked with getting things back on track after weeks of partisan conflict?A seven-term Republican representing Texas' 11th Congressional District, Conaway is the chairman of the agriculture committee in addition to serving as a member of the intelligence committee and Armed Services Committee.He has also chaired the House ethics committee during his time in Washington.A member of the House intelligence subcommittee that oversees the National Security Agency and CIA, Conaway has expressed skepticism over the intent of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. JUST WATCHEDWho is Devin NunesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho is Devin Nunes 02:17Devin Nunes -- The man once charged with leading the House's investigation into possible connections between Trump associates and Russia's hacking of the 2016 election stepped asied after becoming the focus of controversy. Nunes worked on Trump's transition team, publicly supported Flynn just hours before his resignation as national security adviser and downplaying Trump's wiretapping allegations against Obama by suggesting they shouldn't be taken literally.Nunes particularly provoked Democrats after he disclosed evidence to the press and White House -- before informing Democrats on his committee -- that the Trump team's communications may have been picked up in \"incidental\" collections by US surveillance of conversations with foreign nationals who were being lawfully monitored.JUST WATCHEDSchiff: Nunes should recuse himself ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSchiff: Nunes should recuse himself  01:14Adam Schiff -- The Democratic \"yin\" to Nunes' Republican \"yang,\" Schiff is his party's most senior member on the House Intelligence Committee and has been one of the most visible lawmakers on the Russia investigation. Though the committee has historically been one of the more discreet on Capitol Hill, Schiff hasn't held back his criticism of Trump or, increasingly, the committee chairman. On Monday, Schiff called on Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation in a stunning split between the two top investigators of a committee with a reputation for bipartisanship. Schiff has repeatedly maintained he's seen additional evidence that is more than circumstantial proof of collusion between Trump aides and Russian entities.JUST WATCHEDRep. Cummings: Flynn has lied over and overReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRep. Cummings: Flynn has lied over and over 01:04Elijah Cummings -- The representative from Maryland is the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. Cummings was one of the first lawmakers to call for an investigation into Russian meddling in the US election. Cummings wrote a letter to committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz in November 2016 calling for a bipartisan commission, similar to the one that investigated the 9/11 attacks, and the Democratic effort to have an independent investigation is only gathering steam as the acrimony on Capitol Hill rises.Cummings has also gone beyond calls for Nunes to recuse himself, suggesting he be investigated after his comments disclosing the surveillance that may have picked up conversation of Trump associates. And he has also sharply denounced Flynn, brandishing emails that show the former national security adviser was paid by Russian entities for a trip there during the campaign, raising legal and regulatory questions.Richard Burr NC Senate Richard Burr -- The North Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee is leading a separate investigation into Russian efforts to tamper with the US election.  So far it has been a low-key process, as he's stayed out of the limelight while interviewing witnesses in private. Some of that will change Thursday, when the Senate Intelligence Committee hosts its first public hearing for its Russia investigation.Trump associatesInvestigations by the FBI and congressional committees have included several aides to the Trump campaign and their communication with key foreign entities and, in some cases, Russian operatives. Others have cropped up in headlines because of their dealings with the longtime US adversary. Several of these individuals have volunteered to testify before House and Senate Intelligence Committees to clear up questions about their actions and associations.JUST WATCHEDPaul Manafort's Russia connectionsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPaul Manafort's Russia connections 06:11Paul Manafort -- A Republican strategist and longtime Washington operator, Manafort joined Trump's campaign team last spring and was elevated after campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was fired in June. But with just under three months to go until the presidential election, Manafort resigned amid questions over his campaign role and extensive lobbying history overseas, particularly in Ukraine, where he represented pro-Russian interests.Manafort's connections to Russia faced fresh scrutiny earlier this year after current and former US officials told CNN that high-level Trump campaign advisers, including Manafort, regularly communicated with Russians known to US intelligence. Manafort called the allegation \"100% not true\" and said he didn't \"remember talking to any Russian officials, ever.\"Manafort has turned over hundreds of pages of documents to the Senate intelligence committee. Manafort and Rick Gates, long-time business associates who served together on the Trump campaign, were indicted in connection with Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on 12 counts that included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign principal. The charges do not cover any activities related to the campaign, though it's possible Mueller could add additional charges.Manafort and Gates entered not guilty pleas before a federal magistrate judge.FILE - In this July 21, 2016 file photo, Rick Gates, campaign aide to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.  Rick Gates -- Gates' fate has long been tied to the fortunes of Paul Manafort.Manafort served as Trump's campaign chairman, and he ran the Trump campaign for several months with Gates serving as his deputy. Gates stayed on the campaign after Manafort was ousted amid questions about his work in Ukraine. But Gates was ousted from a pro-Trump advocacy group earlier this year amid mounting questions about Manafort.The pair's relationship goes back years. Gates joined Manafort's lobbying firm in the mid-2000s when he handled projects in Eastern Europe, including in Ukraine.Gates has denied any wrongdoing. \"Everything was done legally and with the approval of our lawyers,\" Gates said in a June interview with The New York Times. \"Nothing to my knowledge was ever done inappropriately.\"George Papadopoulos -- A former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with Russians who had close ties to the Kremlin.In recently unsealed court records, the FBI said Papadopoulos \"falsely described his interactions with a certain foreign contact who discussed 'dirt' related to emails\" concerning Hillary Clinton.Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents \"about the timing, extent and nature of his relationships and interactions with certain foreign nationals whom he understood to have close connections with senior Russian government officials,\" according to the complaint. Mueller signed a 14-page statement regarding Papadopoulos' offense, which lays out of the facts of the case.Papadopoulos' guilty plea brings the Mueller probe into actions that occurred during the 2016 campaign.Papadopoulos graduated from college in 2009, before moving to London to get a master's degree in security studies. He worked for the Hudson Institute from 2011 through 2015 in Washington, and was also briefly a foreign policy adviser to then-GOP candidate Ben Carson -- now Trump's secretary of Housing and Urban Development -- before he joined the Trump campaign.He lists his current profession as an oil, gas and policy consultant on his LinkedIn page.Papadopoulos' name first was raised in connection with the Trump campaign when Trump listed him as one of his foreign policy advisers during a Washington Post editorial board interview.A former Trump campaign official said Papadopoulos interacted with the campaign \"a significant amount\" during the 2016 election cycle.\"He was a foreign policy adviser,\" the official said. But the official described Papadopoulos as an adviser who was in contact with the campaign staff via email and not a familiar face around Trump Tower.This official said Papadopoulos exchanged emails \"constantly\" on foreign policy matters with the Trump team during the campaign. Still, this official placed Papadopoulos in the same category as Carter Page who felt more like a \"hanger-on\" to the campaign staff.When asked about Papadopoulos' role in the campaign, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters his role was \"extremely limited\" and called it a \"volunteer position.\"JUST WATCHEDMichael Flynn in 60 secondsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMichael Flynn in 60 seconds 01:59Michael Flynn -- Flynn has courted controversy since before he became an early supporter of Trump's campaign. In 2014, he was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in Obama's Pentagon. Flynn said it was because he raised alarm bells on Islamic terrorism, but four US officials serving at time told CNN it was because of his contentious management style.His reputation for outspokenness and criticizing Washington figures led to raised eyebrows inside the Beltway when Trump tapped him as national security adviser. His tenure in any case didn't last long, as he resigned after acknowledging that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador in Washington, Sergey Kislyak. He had initially denied that they had discussed sanctions recently imposed by the Obama administration. It is illegal for unauthorized private citizens to negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of the US, though the FBI has said that it has no intention of bringing charges against Flynn. At the time, Flynn did not hold a public office in the US government which technically qualifies him as a private citizenHis financial ties with Russia and other foreign countries have also attracted attention, including the emails obtained by Cummings showing that he was paid by a state-run Russian TV outlet from which he had originally denied receiving funds.JUST WATCHEDKushner to testify on Russian banker meetingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKushner to testify on Russian banker meeting 03:51Jared Kushner -- The 36-year-old businessman-turned-political operative played a crucial role in his father-in-law's presidential campaign and has carved out a role for himself as one of Trump's key White House aides. After amassing billions of dollars in properties over his decade in the New York real estate market, he now finds himself frequently assisting the President in matters of foreign policy.That has led to questions in certain arenas, including a recently disclosed meeting he held in December with a Russian banker appointed by President Vladimir Putin. The White House maintains that Kushner met with the banker in his role as a Trump adviser while the bank said it met with Kushner as a private developer.Kushner volunteered to testify before senators because of his role in arranging meetings between top campaign advisers and Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.JUST WATCHEDFormer Trump adviser volunteers to testifyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Trump adviser volunteers to testify 01:47Carter Page -- Page worked for seven years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch, which his biography said took him to London, New York and Moscow for three years in the mid-2000s, before Trump last year listed him as a foreign policy adviser in response to a question from The Washington Post.Page has regularly espoused views at odds with much of the foreign policy community in Washington, in particular questioning the US approach toward Russia and called for warmer relations between the two countries.His reported meeting with Kislyak during the Republican convention in Cleveland is one of his interactions with Russian officials that has caught the attention of the FBI. Page has denied any wrongdoing and volunteered to speak to the House Intelligence Committee about his role in Trump's campaign. Page, who the White House has said was only loosely connected to the Trump campaign, emphasized last week that he was not a campaign insider. JUST WATCHEDFormer Trump adviser met with Russian at RNCReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer Trump adviser met with Russian at RNC 02:50J.D. Gordon -- A former Pentagon spokesman under Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, Gordon contributed to a variety of media outlets before working as a national security adviser to the Trump campaign.Gordon disclosed earlier this month that he was among the Trump advisers who had met with Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July. Gordon told CNN that he told Kislyak that he would like to improve relations with Russia. Gordon added that at no time did any inappropriate chatter come up about colluding with the Russians to aid the Trump campaign.JUST WATCHEDLawmakers want answers from Roger StoneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLawmakers want answers from Roger Stone 02:56Roger Stone -- The eccentric former Trump adviser and self-described, master of political dark arts has been labeled as the \"dirty trickster\" of delegate fights. He has worked with the campaigns of Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Stone repeatedly claimed throughout the final months of the 2016 campaign that he had backchannel communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and that he knew of the group's forthcoming document dumps, which disseminated the materials hacked from the Democrats. Later, Stone walked back those tweets. His attorney maintains he has done nothing wrong. Wikileaks also denies any connection with Stone.Roger Stone also has been forced to defend contacts with hacker Guccier 2.0 on Twitter. While Stone said his messages to the hacker alias are of no consequence, he is the first person in Trump's orbit to have acknowledged any contact with a hacker -- not to mention one that claimed responsibility for hacking the DNC.Stone's attorney said the longtime Trump confidant has complied with the House Russia investigators' request for him to provide the identity of his intermediary to Assange.But Stone's attorney, Grant Smith, would not say whether that meant Stone had in fact revealed the identity of his WikiLeaks go-between to the House intelligence committee.Michael Cohen -- Trump's personal lawyer has been a staunch defender of his client, often serving as a media surrogate during the campaign. During a CNN interview in February, Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Artemenko said he had discussed a pro-Russian peace plan for Ukraine with Cohen over dinner in January. Ukraine would vehemently oppose the idea that the White House would consider formalizing Russian control of Crimea. Cohen told CNN that they never discussed a peace plan and the White House has flatly denied any knowledge of the proposal.Foreign connectionsConnections between Trump campaign aides and notable foreigners have fueled suspicions of possible coordination with Russia. Specifically, the US officials told CNN last week that it has information that indicates Trump associates communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton's campaign. JUST WATCHEDWhat to know about Sergey KislyakReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat to know about Sergey Kislyak 01:14Sergey Kislyak -- The Russian ambassador to the US is seemingly ubiquitous around town, having gained extensive experience during a career spanning both the Soviet and Russian Federation eras. Not only did the veteran diplomat meet multiple times with Flynn, drawing scrutiny, but his meetings with then-Sen. Jeff Sessions led to the attorney general recusing himself from any potential investigations.Kislyak has also held several meetings -- or at least photo-ops -- with Democrats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (who has joined the calls for Nunes to recuse himself) claimed to have never met with Kislyak, but a photo surfaced showing the two individuals in the same room. Current and former US intelligence officials TELL CNN that Kislyak is a top spy and recruiter of spies, an accusation that Russian officials have dismissed.JUST WATCHEDWho is Julian Assange?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho is Julian Assange? 01:53Julian Assange -- The founder of Wikileaks, the self-styled \"radical transparency\" organization with the stated goal of exposing the secrets of the powerful, Assange has cast a wide, blurry shadow over the center of US politics from his seclusion in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remains holed up to avoid facing sexual assault charges in Sweden and a potential extradition to the United States.Assange spearheaded the release of nearly 20,000 internal DNC emails last July, which US intelligence bodies unanimously concluded were hacked by the Russians. WikiLeaks also began to serially release emails from Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, in October. WikiLeaks has denied that Russia was the source for its disclosures, and the Russian government has emphatically denied any connection with the theft as well.The Daily Beast revealed, and CNN confirmed, that the head of a data firm employed by the Trump campaign emailed WikiLeaks head Assange hoping to gain access to 33,000 emails that had been on Clinton's server. US intelligence officials believe many of the hacked emails Assange released were obtained as part of a Russian hacking campaign.JUST WATCHEDHacker 'Guccifer' targets Hillary ClintonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHacker 'Guccifer' targets Hillary Clinton 02:35Guccifer 2.0 -- The hacker otherwise known as \"Guccifer 2.0\" burst into the national conversation after claiming responsibility for a hack of the Democratic National Committee last year. US officials believe with \"high confidence\" that \"Guccifer 2.0\" was actually a front for Russian military intelligence and was part of the effort to influence America's elections.Roger Stone has been forced to defend contacts with the online persona via Twitter. While Stone said his messages to the hacker alias are of no consequence, he is the first person in Trump's orbit to have acknowledged any contact with a hacker -- not to mention one that claimed responsibility for hacking the DNC.JUST WATCHEDWho is dossier author Christopher Steele?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWho is dossier author Christopher Steele? 06:15Christopher Steele -- A former officer with MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, Steele compiled a dossier of unsubstantiated allegations related to Trump's personal and business ties to Russia before he became president. Steele initially had been hired by a Washington research firm working on behalf of Trump's political opponents -- initially in the Republican primary and then later Democrats.The FBI obtained a version of Steele's dossier last summer and investigators compared it to some of their own work related to Russia's attempts to influence the US election. His file contained claims that Russian operatives had compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Trump has consistently denied the claims, dismissing them as \"phony\" in January, though Schiff and others drew on some of them in the Comey-Rogers hearing earlier this year. US investigators said they have corroborated some of the communications in the dossier, but CNN has not been able to verify many of the specific allegations in the documents.CNN's Dylan Byers, Marshall Cohen, Thomas Frank, Jeremy Diamond, Barbara Starr, Pamela Brown, Evan Perez, Jim Sciutto, Gloria Borger, Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

Those scheduled training drills were expected to primarily take place on Russia's doorstep -- specifically in the Baltic Sea, the Arctic and along Russia's border with several NATO partners.A Russian Ministry of Defense statement in a TASS report also said that a Russian MiG-31 fighter jet intercepted a Norwegian P-3C Orion aircraft on Tuesday in international waters over the Barents Sea.\"The interceptor plane's crew approached the target at a safe distance and visually identified it as a P-3C Orion anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft of the Norwegian Air Force.

        "content": "Story highlightsThe military services have sent Congress their annual \"unfunded requirements\" listsThe services say restoring readiness is their highest priority Washington (CNN)The military has a wish list for Congress -- and it's more than $31 billion long.The military services have sent Congress their annual \"unfunded requirements\" lists, known as the military \"wish lists\" around Capitol Hill. The lists, obtained by CNN, ask for additional planes, ships, tanks and money for training and manpower that they could not include in their budget request but still would like Congress to fund if money wasn't an object.     President Donald Trump's defense budget, unveiled last month, is seeking a 9.8% increase over the Fiscal Year 2017 request, the wish lists ask for increased spending on top of that. In recent years, congressional Republicans have used the wish lists as blueprints for what to add to the defense budget.Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served under both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, tried to put a stop to the wish lists, arguing the services used them to circumvent the Defense Department's budgetary wishes.Read MoreBut the lists came back under Gates' successors and have been issued every year since.This year, they include big requests: The Army is seeking another $12.7 billion, the Air Force is asking for $10.7 billion, the Navy wants an extra $4.8 billion and the Marine Corps $3.2 billion.The unfunded requests are sure to fuel calls from defense hawks -- who complained that Trump's budget failed to strengthen the military as much as they would like -- to boost the defense budget above the $603 billion request and up to the $640 billion that Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry are seeking.Here's a look at what's included in the military's wish lists:Readiness and trainingThe services say restoring readiness is their highest priority.The military has warned that it has slashed training and readiness programs in recent years in order to grapple with budget constraints, cutting training for units that aren't immediately deploying and deferring maintenance for ships, planes and more.The Navy's list includes maintenance for a host of items, while the Air Force says training is its top unfunded requirement. The Air Force list includes $79 million for battlefield airmen training, and $83 million for additional F-35 maintenance training instructors.The Army, meanwhile, says it's asking for an additional $590 million in training dollars.Additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters The Air Force: $1.7 billion for 14 F-35sThe Marines: $616 million for four F-35Bs jets and another $260 million for two of the Navy's F-35C models. The Navy: $540 million for four additional F-35 fighters.The fighter jet has been in development for nearly 15 years and is touted as the most advanced weapons system of the modern era, combining stealth capabilities, supersonic speed, extreme agility and state-of-the-art sensor fusion technology.It comes in three variants. The A version is flown by the US Air Force, the B version by the Marines, and the C version will become part of the US Navy's fleet.All three services are anxious to integrate the F-35 into the fleet despite the fact the jet is still in development.Another 17,000 Army soldiersThe Army is asking for $3.1 billion in order to pay for an additional 17,000 soldiers. The $3.1 billion for \"increased capacity,\" as the Army puts it, would pay for 10,000 additional active soldiers, 4,000 more in the Army National Guard, and 3,000 in the Army Reserve.Munitions and helicoptersThe Army is seeking an assortment of new equipment, including additional missiles, ammunition and helicopters.A patriot missile is launchedThe Army wish list seeks $2.3 billion for munitions, including $1.3 billion for Patriot surface-to-air missiles and an additional $800 million for ammunition.The service's modernization wish list nearly tops $4.9 billion. The request asks for an additional nine AH-64E Apache helicopters, three UH-60V Black Hawk helicopters and nine CH-47F Chinooks.The Army is also seeking funds for 33 more Bradley Fighting Vehicles, 29 Abrams Tanks and 35 Hercules Recovery Vehicles.Navy aircraft: 10 F/A-18 Super Hornets: $739 millionAs it waits for the F-35 to become operational, the Navy hopes it can add more F/A-18 Super Hornets to help update its aging air fleet. The Navy already included funding for 14 Super Hornets in its initial FY18 budget but is asking for 10 additional aircraft.Boeing has continuously updated the Super Hornet with new electronics, bigger fuel tanks and new stealth features.The Navy estimates a portion of their current F/A-18 fleet will remain in use through 2030.

        "content": "(CNN)When US President Donald Trump took office on January 20, the new administration's policy on North Korea was unclear. More than seven months on, Pyongyang has tested two missiles capable of reaching the United States, while the US ambassador to the UN has declared \"the time for talk is over.\" Here's how events have unfolded.JanuaryThe day before Trump recited the oath of office on the Washington Mall, the North Korean leadership had already prepared its own unique welcome for the incoming President. On January 19, US intelligence satellites picked up signs of activity at North Korea's Chamjin missile factory southwest of Pyongyang, in an apparent readying of a test of two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Read MoreTen days later -- January 29 -- as Defense Secretary James Mattis prepared for his first visit to Asia, it was reported that the country was preparing to restart a plutonium reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, according to analysis of new satellite imagery from 38 North, a North Korea tracking project. FebruaryThe Trump administration kicked off the month with Mattis' East Asian jaunt, landing February 2 at the Osan Air Base outside Seoul. Top of the agenda was a key component of South Korea's defenses against its northern neighbors' aggression -- the THAAD missile interception system. Three days later, February 5, the US and its East Asian ally Japan successfully downed a test medium-range ballistic missile with a new interceptor launched from a guided-missile destroyer.North Korea didn't take long to respond. On February 11, it reported it had successfully completed the launch of a new ballistic missile, the previously unknown Pukguksong-2, according to state media. It was the North's first missile test of the Trump era. Things took a twist worthy of a movie plot, when, on February 14, alleged North Korean agents reportedly murdered Kim Jong Un's half brother, Kim Jong Nam, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) with VX nerve agent.Shortly after, in the wake of the DPRK's missile test and the resultant growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, China banned imports of Chinese coal for the remainder of the year. China's Ministry of Commerce said the decision was made to comply with a UN Security Council resolution that China helped draft and pass last November.JUST WATCHEDWhat is THAAD?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat is THAAD? 00:48MarchMarch was an even busier month for the Korean Peninsula. It kicked off, on March 6, with North Korea's firing of four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea) in what Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe described as \"an extremely dangerous action.\"The missiles, three of which landed within 200 miles of Japan's coastline in its exclusive economic zone, were fired as part of a drill targeting American military assets in Japan by North Korea's Hwasong artillery units, North Korean state media KCNA said.On the heels of the multiple launch, South Korea's US-built THAAD missile defense system -- which China vigorously opposes -- arrived on the peninsula. As it was delivered, China's top diplomat, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, warned that the US and North Korea are set for a \"head-on collision\" with neither side willing to give way. On March 14, the US, along with allies South Korea and Japan, responded to the North's earlier missile tests, dispatching high-tech missile defense ships to the same area where Pyongyang had previously fired the four missiles. The Aegis warships began exercises to improve their capability to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles, the US Navy said in a statement.The maneuvers came as US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson embarked upon his first Asian trip, landing in Japan on March 15.Five days later, Pyongyang again ratcheted up tensions by testing a rocket engine, one which showed \"meaningful\" signs of progress, according to South Korean officials. Meanwhile, in the face of the looming threat from North Korea, Japan begins to hold evacuation drills to prepare for any potential North Korean missile launched aimed at the country. The North Koreans launched another missile just days after the engine test, but it exploded \"within seconds of launch,\" according to US Pacific Command. As March wound down, Pyongyang once again went back to its engine tests -- technology could possibly be used in an eventual ICBM. In a separate move, the US announced that the US Marines deployed F-35B aircraft to South Korea for the first time as part of an exercise.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korea celebrates rocket engine testReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korea celebrates rocket engine test 02:20AprilTrump began the month by declaring, on April 2, that the US would be willing to go it alone to restrain North Korea's nuclear weapons program should China fail to change the situation. Two days later, as Trump prepared to meet his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, North Korea fired another ballistic missile off the coast of the Korean Peninsula, US and South Korean officials said. As the two leaders sat down to steak and pan-seared sole at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump made the decision to pull the trigger on a missile strike in Syria -- the biggest military action of his presidency and a possible declaration of intent for Pyongyang.Shortly after, North Korea issued a forceful response to the deployment of a US naval strike group, including the 97,000-ton carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, to the region April 10, saying it would counter \"reckless acts of aggression\" with \"whatever methods the US wants to take.\"JUST WATCHEDUS warships sent to Korea: What to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS warships sent to Korea: What to know 01:32Days later, monitoring group 38 North said its analysis had concluded that North Korea's Punggye-ri nuclear site is \"primed and ready\" for a sixth nuclear test. Also on April 13, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the country may already have the capability to deliver missiles equipped with sarin nerve agent. Meanwhile, the US waded again into military action, dropping a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB), the US military's largest non-nuclear weapon, on an ISIS hideout in Afghanistan, the first time this type of weapon has been used in battle, according to US officials.Two days later, at an annual military parade in Pyongyang, the North Korean regime showed off a bevy of new missiles and launchers at its annual military parade.Part of the display were two new ICBM-sized canisters as well as North Korea's submarine-launched ballistic missile, and a land-based version of the same for the first time, according to analysts.

After the attempted test, US Vice President Mike Pence, visiting the South Korean side of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) on April 17, warned North Korea not to test the resolve of the US \"or the strength of our military forces.\" North Korea's UN deputy representative, Kim In Ryong, responded, warning that the US actions and rhetoric have \"created a dangerous situation in which thermonuclear war may break out at any moment on the peninsula and poses a serious threat to world peace and security.\"After boasting that the USS Carl Vinson strike group was being dispatched to the Korean Peninsula in a \"show of force,\" the US was forced to walk back the claims after it emerged that the ships in question were actually on their way to participate in military exercises in the Indian Ocean, some 3,500 miles in the opposite direction.The Pentagon announced on April 18 that it would conduct two major tests of its ability to shoot down missiles launched out of North Korea in May.On April 19, the UN Security Council tried to address North Korea's latest missile launch with a proposed statement that would have condemned the test, but Russia used its veto to torpedo the motion. The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing was \"gravely concerned\" about North Korea's recent nuclear and missile activities. Lu also praised recent US statements on the North Korean issue.On April 20, the UN Security Council formally condemned North Korea's latest missile launch, demanding that it \"immediately\" cease further actions that violate resolutions. Russia denied it had previously blocked the action, saying that it wanted to add language to the document.North Korea launched a missile April 29 that blew up over land, a US official said. The missile failed to reach the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.It was later confirmed that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier had finally arrived in Korean waters, ready to begin drills with its South Korean counterparts.To wrap up a tense month on the Korean Peninsula, Trump praised the North Korean leader, saying he had come to power at a young age and was a \"smart cookie.\"MayTrump began a new month of relations with North Korea on a more positive note, saying on May 1 he would be \"honored\" to meet with Kim Jong Un \"under the right circumstances.\"On the same day, US officials confirmed the controversial THAAD system was finally deployed and operational in South Korea.The North Koreans fired a ballistic missile May 14 that landed in water 60 miles south of Russia's Vladivostok region, a US official told CNN.It was the first provocative move from North Korea since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office on May 10. Moon has advocated for engagement with North Korea to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The launch came as Chinese leader Xi Jinping and multiple world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, attended a major trade and infrastructure summit in Beijing.Within a week of the previous test, North Korea launched another missile on May 21, described by state media as a \"ground-to-ground strategic ballistic missile.\" That test was followed in quick succession by another launch on May 29, a short-range ballistic missile that traveled an estimated 248 miles before landing in Japan's exclusive economic zone. JuneFollowing multiple missile launches in May, on June 2 the UN Security Council voted unanimously to introduce new sanctions against North Korea targeting Pyongyang's nuclear and missile program.  On June 8, North Korea fired four anti-ship missiles into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula. The move came less than 24 hours after Seoul announced it was suspending deployment of the THAAD missile defense system pending an environmental assessment. US military officials said on June 30 that revised military options on North Korea had been prepared and would be shown to President Trump if Pyongyang were to conduct an underground nuclear or ballistic missile test that indicates it has made significant progress toward developing a weapon that could attack the US.July On the July 4 US Independence Day holiday, North Korea said it conducted its first successful test of a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can \"reach anywhere in the world.\" The milestone launch came days after Trump spoke with Japanese and Chinese leaders about the North Korea threat and just before the G20 summit in Hamburg.The US and South Korea responded by holding a joint missile drill to counteract North Korea's \"destabilizing and unlawful actions,\" a US Army statement said.North Korea conducted a second ICBM test on July 28, which South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said was more advanced than the July 4 launch. Experts believed if this missile were fired on a flatter, standard trajectory, it would have major US cities such as Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago well within its range. Kim Jong Un was quoted as saying \"the whole US mainland\" is now within North Korea's reach. He also called Pyongyang's weapons program \"a precious asset\" that cannot be reversed or replaced, according to the agency.The United States responded by holding live-fire drills with South Korea and flying two stealth bombers over North Korea in a show of force.President Trump condemned the launch and reiterated his call for China to do more to help rein in North Korea, but told reporters \"we will handle North Korea.\"CNN's James Griffiths, Paula Hancocks, Joshua Berlinger, Ben Westcott, Ivan Watson, Yoko Wakatsuki, Hidetaka Sato, Eli Watkins, Dana Bash, Barbara Starr, Richard Roth, Tim Schwarz, Zachary Cohen, Jeremy Diamond, Steve Almasy, Nicole Chavez and journalist Taehoon Lee, contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe prime ministers of Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Denmark all placed their hands on a European soccer ballNordic leaders depicted in the image said it was not meant to intentionally reference or mock TrumpWashington (CNN)Top leaders of five Nordic countries are rejecting claims that they \"trolled\" President Donald Trump by posing for a photo that is drawing comparisons to the US leader's now-infamous moment with a glowing orb during his trip to Saudi Arabia.The photo, which was first reported by The Hill, shows the prime ministers of Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Denmark all placing their hands on a European soccer ball -- an image that would most likely have been viewed as benign had it not surfaced just days after one of the most memorable moments from Trump's first foreign trip to the Middle East and a NATO summit in Brussels.Taken during a meeting between several European leaders in Norway this week, the image set social media ablaze when it was posted by the Norwegian Prime Minister, alongside another viral photo taken just days before of Trump and Saudi Arabia's King Salman holding an illuminated globe in Riyadh.The caption of the Facebook post also seems to reference Trump, saying: \"Who rules the world? Riyadh vs Bergen. Don't know what they're on the top photo was thinking. On the bottom photo is the five Nordic Statsministerne that holds a ball with b\u00e6rekraftsm\u00e5lene. We hope they'll be a road map for the future.\"  Trump touches orb in Saudi, lights up internetSide by side, there are undeniable parallels between the two photos, but several of the Nordic leaders depicted in the image said it was not meant to intentionally reference or mock the US President.Read More\"This time Twitter has jumped to conclusions that aren't correct,\" said Mary Gestrin, a spokesperson for the Nordic Council of Ministers. \"There was no intentional reference to the picture with President Trump and therefore there is absolutely no intended parody either.\"\"This football, with the globe printed on it, is commonly used in connection with the campaign for the UN 2030 agenda, which was a topic on the prime minister's meeting,\" Gestrin said in a statement.Sweden's prime minister also denied any connection between the two photos in a emailed statement to CNN. The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The first photo featuring Trump was taken when he attended the opening of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology this month alongside his host, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.As the lights dimmed, Trump and the two leaders officially \"activated\" the new center by placing their hands on an illuminated globe, and a four-minute introduction video displayed on large screens behind them, according to local media.State photographers were on-hand to capture the moment, which quickly spawned memes from social media users who likened the US President to everything from comic book characters to blockbuster movie villains.trump 100% made a wish when he touched the orb pic.twitter.com/S0TlxgxtBY\u2014 KRANG T.

This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,\" he said.Denmark, Iceland and Norway are NATO members, while Sweden and Finland work in close concert with the alliance on a variety of issues including cooperation in the Baltic region amid concerns of Russian military activities. U.S. Air Force to send F-15 jets to FinlandU.S. F-15s deployed to IcelandDuring a 2016 visit to the White House with then-President Barack Obama, CNN reported that the Nordic nations were anxiously monitoring the US presidential election as Trump, a GOP candidate at the time, signaled doubt about the importance of the US commitment to the NATO alliance, particularly as Russia continued a military build-up along its western borders.And Trump has reiterated that campaign theme throughout the early months of his presidency -- repeatedly criticizing key European allies on matters ranging from defense to trade to climate change. Without mentioning Trump by name, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated a coming shift in relations between Europe and the US following Trump's remarks at the NATO meeting.\"The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent, over,\" Merkel said at a beer hall rally to support her campaign on Sunday.

Earlier this week, President Donald Trump said he was sending \"an armada\" to Korean waters potentially to deal with threats from North Korea.In the face of recent saber-rattling from North Korea, Trump had said the USS Carl Vinson carrier group was being deployed to waters off the Korean Peninsula.Read More\"We are sending an armada. Very powerful,\" Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo. \"We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you.\"It turns out the carrier group was never actually steaming toward the peninsula, but rather heading to joint exercises with the Australian navy. US officials insist it's now on its way to the Sea of Japan, known in South Korea as the East Sea. It\u00a0still hasn't arrived.On Thursday, the US Navy announced it was extending the Vinson's deployment by 30 days \"to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\"Often described as the backbone of naval aviation, the various F-18 aircraft make up most of the service's strike fighter fleet.The F/A-18 Super Hornet was designed to have a lifespan of roughly\u00a06,000 flight hours, but today, jets are being stretched to fly between 8,000 and 9,000 hours to fulfill mission expectations as a result of fewer operational aircraft, budget restrictions and delays to the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.Trump asked Congress for an additional $13.5 billion this year in part to build and modernize additional F-35s and F/A-18s.The Navy estimates a portion of their current F/A-18 fleet will remain in use through 2030.CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

Read MoreCommanders said delays to the USS Gerald R. Ford have resulted in extended deployments for the operational carriers in order for the Navy to meet its commitments around the world, placing additional stress on sailors and crew members.The report comes just days after the Navy announced the Ford will not be delivered before November 2016 due to unspecified testing issues, walking back testimony from April in which Stackley told Congress the Ford would be ready by September. It was first reported on by Bloomberg.Now that delivery date could be pushed to 2017, according to the Navy.\"Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System testing was successfully completed in May 2016 and testing of the Dual Band Radar, Advanced Weapons Elevator are projected to complete in time to support upcoming sea trials and first aircraft operations scheduled for early next year,\" a Navy official told CNN. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, slammed the latest delay as \"unacceptable\" and \"entirely avoidable\" in a statement earlier this month.\"The Ford-class program is a case study in why our acquisition system must be reformed -- unrealistic business cases, poor cost estimates, new systems rushed to production, concurrent design and construction, and problems testing systems to demonstrate promised capability,\" McCain said.The USS Gerald Ford is the first of three Ford-class carriers ordered by the Navy with combined cost expected close to $42 billion. \"After more than $2.3 billion in cost overruns have increased its cost to nearly $13 billion, the taxpayers deserve to know when CVN-78 will actually be delivered, how much developmental risk remains in the program, if cost overruns will continue, and who is being held accountable,\" he added.But officials from both the Navy and Department of Defense said the issues keeping the 1,100- foot supercarrier  from active duty are the result of decisions made when the Pentagon committed to building the advanced ship in 2008.\"The decision to proceed with these three systems was made many years ago, prior to their maturation, when transformational approaches to acquisition were a DOD policy,\" said Mark Wright, a Defense Department spokesman. \"This report from Dr. Gilmore clarifies concerns he had previously raised on this program.\"As the first new carrier design in 40 years, the USS Gerald R. Ford incorporates new technology and operational systems that will allow it to have a higher aircraft launch and recovery rate, reduced manning, and improved survivability against projected threats.JUST WATCHEDSee aircraft carrier tested at top speedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee aircraft carrier tested at top speed 00:45But choosing to integrate and test developmental systems \"compounded the inherent challenges of a first-in-class design,\" and significantly contributed the program's delays, according to a statement from the Navy.A comprehensive test program was developed to address the integration of these technologies through which \"steady progress is being made to retire technical issues,\" the Navy said. To date, construction on the Ford is 98 percent complete with 88 percent of the test program finished.  Despite delays to the USS Gerald R. Ford's delivery, the Navy says that the Ford-class carriers will yield a $4 billion reduction per ship cost as compared to its predecessor, the Nimitz Class.The next carrier in the Ford class, the USS John F.

Gen. Scott West, the director of current operations for the Air Force, airmen are flying some aircraft and bombers, like the B-52 Stratofortress, that are more than 50 years old.Military brass warn Congress there's a problemAs it presses aircraft back into service, the military is having to lean heavily on a smaller and aging air fleet -- a trend that has leaders across all four armed service branches concerned about combat performance and pilot safety. Appearing before a House Armed Services subcommittee last week, leaders from the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marines warned lawmakers that fiscal constraints, coupled with the critical focus on overseas operations, have seriously degraded training and readiness efforts. \"Twenty-five years of continuous combat operations ... coupled with budget instability and lower-than-planned funding levels, have contributed to one of the smallest, oldest and least ready forces across the full-spectrum of operations in our history,\" said Maj. Gen. Scott West, director of current operations, Headquarters for the U.S. Air Force.While each armed service branch has scrambled to find ways to fulfill its combat responsibilities in the short-term, military leaders said delays in the production of next-generation aircraft and shrinking budgets have put a strain on the condition of the current fleet, as well as the servicemen and women who fly and maintain them.   \"Fiscal constraints continue to force difficult trades in capacity and readiness for long-term capability improvements,\" said Rear Adm. Michael Manazir, the deputy chief of naval operations for warfare systems. The military commanders cautioned that they simply do not have enough aircraft ready for flight to keep up with the current pace of deployment and to safely train aircrews here at home.\"Today, there are not enough flyable aircraft -- our 'ready bench' -- if our nation were subjected to a crisis,\" Davis said. \"Today, I could fly 43% (443 of the 1,040) of the aircraft I should have on my flight lines.\"A lack of spare parts and maintenance personnel trained to repair damaged aircraft are two of the main factors contributing to the lack of operational aircraft, according to military brass. Describing military aviation as a \"fragile ecosystem,\" Davis emphasized the importance of keeping all requisite aspects of that system nourished to keep the entire network healthy.\"We are balancing the need to have our current fleet as ready and modern as possible, to train our pilots and maintainers, and to out match any current foe on the battlefield,\" he said. \"If any get out of balance for long, the whole system can begin to fray and collapse.\"RELATED: Will ISIS be easily pushed from Mosul?The need to improve readiness and training has been further amplified by the shrinking technology advantage that the U.S. holds over potential adversaries like China and Russia, according to Manazir. \"Provocations with state and non-state actors continue to cause instability in almost every region of the world,\" he told the subcommittee. \"We continue to face challenges associated with balancing readiness for today and modernization for tomorrow's fight. More of our force is being demanded, deployed longer than planned. Intended replacements are not keeping pace with attrition.\"With that in mind, the Pentagon has fought to extend the life of several aircraft, including the A-10 Thunderbolt, despite calls from Congress to eliminate the program in favor of allocating funding to other initiatives. But the lack of a clear replacement for the A-10, which specializes in performing close air support missions, has forced Congress to continue the use of the old warbird that first flew in 1975.Fears about pilot safetyAll four military leaders also repeatedly emphasized that the current lack of flyable aircraft could pose a significant risk to pilot safety.Despite no significant rise in serious mishaps or accidents resulting from any gaps in maintenance and lack of training, the four services noted that the potential for such looms in the near future.With fewer planes available, Davis said Marine aviators are receiving significantly less flight time. In the past, Marine pilots would receive 1,000 to 1,500 hours but today's aviators only have between 500 and 600 hours. \"I worry about my young aviators that aren't getting the number of hours they need to,\" Davis said. \"As a young guy, I had a couple of close calls. I do not know how I would do having the amount of flight time that my youngsters get.\"There has been an uptick in recent minor aircraft incidents resulting in billions of dollars in damage and, in some cases, loss of life, the military brass told Congress. Many of the incidents are still under investigation to determine whether they were caused by human error or an aircraft malfunction, but both lawmakers and military officials agreed that the limited training of pilots raises concern about the potential for future incidents.\"While it may not show itself directly today in the rate of mishaps, I do believe it exhibits itself in additional risk,\" said Rep. Robert Wittman, R-Va., the subcommittee chairman. \"There's a common theme here: We're pushing harder. We have fewer resources. We have fewer of the skilled people in the necessary positions to do all the things that we need to do to make sure that we are not just rebuilding that readiness but maintaining the current level of readiness,\" he said.",

John McCain leading charge for transparencyCritics say revealing price tag would help US enemies (CNN)Secrecy is the linchpin of a stealth aircraft's ability to carry out strikes deep within enemy territory, but when it comes to the tax dollars that are going to be spent on the U.S. Air Force's new B-21 bomber, some members of Congress say it is time pull the curtain back.The Air Force said it has no plans to publicly disclose the cost estimate for the aircraft touted as the \"backbone\" of the U.S.'s future strike and deterrence capabilities, arguing it would reveal too much information to potential adversaries and compromise a classified program.That's infuriated some lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain, who argue that the public deserves to see the price tag because so many defense projects have blown their budgets due to waste and fraud.B-21 artist renderingOfficials have been tight-lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the B-21, but indications are that it will be stealthy, able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons, and could possibly operate with or without a pilot.White House reveals number of civilian deaths from drone strikesRead More\"Releasing that [data], releasing other things that may be more insightful to our adversaries, I don't think helps the taxpayer and I don't think it helps -- certainly -- the warfighter,\" Randall Walden, program executive officer of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office, said at an event earlier this month hosted by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.\"All we're doing is putting in that risk and we're showing our hand of what we believe this nation and the states' workers can deliver this particular weapon system for,\" added Walden, whose office is responsible for procuring the bomber and other classified weapons systems.

It was disclosed that the B-21's per-plane cost is expected to come in at roughly $560 million, although that was a preliminary estimate made by the Department of Defense before Northrup Grumman had even won the contract to build the plane. The amount that the government is paying the defense contractor for the new stealth program is secret.The Pentagon also made public an artist's conception of the aircraft, which some lawmakers argue would be more useful to a foreign intelligence agency than the overall contract cost.

Gen. Duke Richardson said in a statement. \"However, we understand that no major procurement program is without challenges and the Air Force remains committed to ensuring all aircraft are delivered as technically required.\"Under its contract with the Air Force, Boeing, not the U.S. government or taxpayers, is responsible for any additional costs resulting from delays.CNN's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",

JUST WATCHEDU.S. ends decades-old arms ban with Vietnam ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHU.S. ends decades-old arms ban with Vietnam  03:07Why we are arming Vietnam?The rest of the top 10 included Turkey, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, India, Singapore, Iraq, and Egypt.Read MoreExperts believe the Middle East will remain a top destination for weapons for some time -- it currently accounts for about 40% of U.S. arms exports -- especially given the rise of ISIS.\"The dynamic of the [falling] oil prices has been overwhelmed by the deep insecurity these countries are currently feeling and the insecure future they feel they face,\" Andrew Hunter of the Center for Strategic and International Studies told CNN.Hunter, the director of the defense-industrial initiatives group, said that the countries in the region were \"prioritizing defense\" over other spending.The American exports include everything from small arms to fighter jet aircraft and tanks, to Patriot Missile batteries. Several Asian countries are also represented high up on the arms sales list, reflecting ongoing tensions with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs and China's stepped up military activity in the South China Sea.The tightening of U.S.-Vietnam relations comes as Vietnam has protested China's actions in its nearby waters, including an incident where China stationed an oil rig in disputed waters off of Vietnam's coast in 2014, an event that sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam.The day after the US. announced it would lift its arms embargo against Vietnam, Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that Vietnam needs the military equipment it will get in order to defend itself.Will U.S. lifting Vietnam arms ban raise South China Sea tensions?While most of the top importers use their own money to buy arms from the U.S., the U.S. also provides some countries with grants and loans -- separate from the arms sales -- to purchase defense equipment from American manufacturers, as part of a program called Foreign Military Financing.The State Department's 2017 budget request includes approximately $5.7 billion for Foreign Military Financing.In the proposed budget, the top five recipients of American foreign military financing will be Israel ($3.1 billion), Egypt ($1.3 billion), Jordan ($350 million), Pakistan ($265 million), and Iraq ($150 million).While Israel is supposed to spend this money on U.S. arms, some of that country's most expensive purchases, like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, have yet to be delivered and are therefore not reflected in SIPRI's statistics. While the Middle East tops the list, funding for African armies in 2017 will more than double from last year, likely a consequence of increased terrorist activity in places like Mali, Somalia, and Nigeria.Hunter said that U.S. defense companies were explicit in their desire to boost international exports in the wake of recent defense budget cuts.At a media day event in March, the CEO of U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, Marillyn Hewson, said, \"One area where we expect the majority of our growth potential to come from in the years ahead is our international customers.\"Opinion: 'Sham democracy' is fueling Africa's terrorismOther major arms exporters after the U.S. include Russia, China, France, and Germany.While Hunter said Russia will always have a market for its \"cheaper\" arms exports to countries that are accustomed to Soviet-era weaponry, he sees China as being increasingly active in the international market.\"You are seeing more and more Chinese at arms shows trying to compete with the U.S.,\" he said.China has upped its share of global arms exports by over 60% compared to the 2006-2010 period, according to SIPRI.One area where China has been particularly active is drone technology, with reports of China exporting drones to Nigeria, Iraq, and Pakistan.He added that China was facing challenges to growing its market share due to increased tensions over competing claims in the South China Sea, as many of the countries in the region, like Vietnam, are also amongst the fastest-growing markets for arms exports.",

The symbolism is more important.\"He said China would be watching the \"developing strategic partnership\" between the United States and Vietnam closely -- and said he expected it to contribute to peace and stability in the region.\"China should think twice over anything they can do to Vietnam or the South China Sea,\" he said. \"They should get the message.\"Human rights concernsObama defended the decision to lift the arms ban despite Vietnam's dismal record on human rights -- involving the jailing of dissidents and stalled political reforms -- saying sales would be evaluated on a \"case-by-case\" basis. However, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth said via Twitter that Obama was opting to \"arm Vietnam as (an) anti-China ally rather than care about its ongoing repression.\"Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said that Washington had squandered a key tool to pressure Vietnam to improve its human rights record.\"In one fell swoop, President Obama has jettisoned what remained of U.S. leverage to improve human rights in Vietnam -- and basically gotten nothing for it,\" he said. \"President Obama just gave Vietnam a reward that they don't deserve.\"In 2014, the United States eased restrictions of an arms ban that originally instated during the Vietnam War. Obama also thanked Vietnam for its continued aid in addressing what he called \"the painful legacy of war,\" referring to attempts to locate veterans missing in action, the removal of landmines and the cleaning up of Agent Orange.

The report also outlines concerns related to the lack of testing done to ensure the software will work properly by the time the Air Force plans to declare its version of the aircraft ready for deployment this August and the Navy reaches that milestone in 2018.  The Marine Corps declared the first squadron of its F-35 variant ready for combat in July 2015, with the intention of upgrading and resolving the software issues before its first planned deployment in 2017.

A new Pentagon report says the testing highlighted maintenance challenges for the F-35.Hide Caption 7 of 7But the GAO says there is no guarantee that this integral software component of what is already the world's most expensive weapons system will even be ready by 2019, when the program plans to move into full-rate production. With an estimated price tag of roughly $400 billion for 2,457 planes, the F-35 program has weathered half a dozen years of testing and experienced myriad hardware malfunctions and software glitches along the way. Estimated to cost approximately $16.7 billion over the aircraft's 56-year lifespan, the logistics software system is considered one of the three major components that make up the F-35, along with the airframe and engine. Unlike the airframe and engine, however, the software is not built into the plane itself. Instead, it runs on ground computers to support operations, mission planning, maintenance and sustainability.When it is fully functional, ALIS is intended to be a program that can be plugged into the aircraft and diagnose any parts that are not working properly in order to simplify the maintenance process. Think of it as a high-end version of the diagnostics your mechanic gets when he plugs your car into the shop computer.While the single seat F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can still technically fly without this software system working at full capacity, both the GAO and military officials agree that it is critical to the program's overall success and long-term sustainability. And with the program costs expected to exceed $1 trillion over the course of its lifetime, the Pentagon is banking on the streamlined maintenance capabilities provided by the F-35's logistics software system keep this pricey aircraft in the air for decades.  Are F-35s fit for combat? Pentagon doesn't knowJUST WATCHEDF-35 jets unveiled at Hill Air Force BaseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHF-35 jets unveiled at Hill Air Force Base 01:12But according to the GAO, the DoD does not have a plan in place that will ensure the software will be fully functional by the time the program moves into full-rate production -- a deadline that is generally a requirement for the sustainability and support systems of all weapons programs.  While the DoD has taken steps to address many of the software's smaller functionality issues in between launching major upgrades, the GAO says the Pentagon's tendency to respond to problems on a case-by-case basis, rather than with a holistic approach, could lead to further schedule delays and potential cost increases.  \"Program officials said that if ALIS is not fully functional, the F-35 could not be operated as frequently as intended, but a DoD commissioned plan found that schedule slippage and functionality problems with ALIS could lead to $20-100 billion in additional costs,\" the report said. F-35, the newest U.S. fighter jet, to tour airshows this summerAnother major concern highlighted by the GAO's findings is that under its current design, all the F-35 data produced by the entire U.S. fleet is routed to a single main operating unit that does not have any backup system or redundancy. If this main server were to fail it could take the entire F-35 fleet offline, according to the GAO report. However, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdon, the F-35 program's executive program officer, insisted that the GAO's findings were not a surprise and that the problems that were highlighted are in the process of being addressed.

Specifically, Bogdon outlined the Joint Program Office's commitment to developing a holistic plan to address issues with the logistics software prior to beginning full-rate production of the aircraft, conducting analysis to improve the reliability of cost estimates and developing a standard, program-wide ALIS training through the life cycle of the program.  Lockheed Martin, the lead defense contractor for the Joint Strike Fighter, said that the development of the F-35's logistics software and the program as a whole remain on pace to be ready in time for full-rate production.\"As ALIS development continues, our focus is on the warfighter and delivering the most effective, efficient fleet management system to sustain the F-35 over the next five decades of operations,\" said Sharon Parsley, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin. \"The recommendations by the GAO are in line with the actions already underway in preparation for full-rate production and worldwide sustainment.\"Air Force considers replacements for A-10 WarthogBut despite reassurances from military officials and defense contractors, critics of the F-35 continue to blast the program as a waste.

A consistent detractor of the F-35, Speier said she is finding it hard to be surprised each time a new problem is found due to the program's history of costly setbacks and delays. \"To continue pouring money into building planes that have ejector seat issues, cyber vulnerabilities, flawed aerodynamics, maintenance problems, an inability to fly at full speed while using weapons, and overheating issues is borderline malfeasance,\" she said. Despite the controversy that has swirled around the F-35' development, supporters still tout it as the most lethal and versatile aircraft of the modern era -- intended to conduct air-to-air combat, air-to-ground strikes, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.In addition to the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps, the fighter is also intended for use by 10 foreign countries.",

Last week, the U.S. took out the organization's No. 2, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, whom the Pentagon dubbed ISIS' \"finance minister\" and is just the latest target to disrupt the group's financial network.And in recent months, the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition has killed more than 10,000 fighters and 20 leaders, including al-Qaduli, according to Pentagon estimates.Altogether, the U.S. calculates that ISIS has lost 40% of the 34,000 square miles of territory it controlled in Syria and Iraq before the U.S. and a host of other nations ramped up military involvement in the region in 2014. Perhaps most significantly, Iraqi forces retook the city of Ramadi in December.The Pentagon has tried to draw more attention to the group's losses, which officials believe are considerable.  Read More\"We are systematically eliminating ISIL's cabinet,\" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said last week, using a different name for ISIS. He noted that al-Qaduli was \"the second senior ISIL leader we've successfully targeted this month.\"Asked whether the U.S. was turning the corner on the fight against ISIS, Carter responded, \"We're certainly gathering momentum and we're seeing that that momentum is having an effect.\"ISIS increasing attacks on Westerners?But could that anti-ISIS momentum on the ground in the Middle East be spurring the group to stage more terror attacks in Europe, such as the one Tuesday that claimed at least 35 lives in Brussels? Is the group looking to distract from its losses of territory and leadership and show that it still has the ability to inflict as much pain -- and is as dangerous to the West -- as ever?\"ISIS has definitely faced losses and has increased its use of unconventional tactics, like suicide bombings, in order to draw forces away from the front,\" said Harleen Gambhir, a counterterrorism analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.\"But linking the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels to ISIS' battlefield losses misses the point,\" she added, noting that ISIS has \"been attempting to execute a global campaign for years\" and \"external attacks are key to its ideology.\"Some of the land ISIS has surrendered has also been tactical, according to Gambhir, as the group has chosen to yield territory in the face of potentially heavy ISIS fighter casualties.Still, the fact that two mass casualty attacks of the scale of Paris and Brussels have occurred since coalition efforts have started reclaiming areas once considered part of ISIS' \"caliphate\" is telling, according to Nick Heras, a Middle East expert with the Center for New American Security.\"ISIS fancies itself as a state with the power to deter its strategic enemies and to coerce their behavior, and the external attacks in Europe work towards this goal,\" said Heras, pointing out that the group also understands that conducting these attacks in the West will potentially lead to more aggressive efforts from the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria.He continued, \"The West should expect that ISIS has developed a contingency strategy to authorize more attacks inside of Europe even in the event that its would-be caliphate is collapsing in Iraq and Syria, and that even in its dying days ISIS' proto-state will try to punish Western countries that hastened its end.\" The U.S.-led coalition long focused primarily on airstrikes but has recently expanded its efforts to take on ISIS more aggressively.The U.S. military's elite Special Operations forces began on the ground missions to target, capture or kill top ISIS operatives in Iraq last month.In the wake of the Brussels attack last week, Defense Secretary Carter vowed to further \"accelerate\" efforts to destroy the extremist group and its caliphate by conducting \"raids of various kinds, seizing places and people, freeing hostages and prisoners of ISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear that anywhere, anytime, it may be struck.\"Criticism of air strike strategyThe air campaign faced criticism that it was not doing enough to alter the trajectory of the anti-ISIS effort.Chris Harmer, a senior military analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, called the air campaign \"tactically spectacular but strategically irrelevant,\" adding that such strikes might have had a decisive impact if ISIS followed a strict organizational structure but that boots on the ground are the key.Yet targeting specific ISIS leaders is not intended to lead to the \"immediate, or direct, collapse of ISIS as an organization,\" Heras said.RELATED: Pentagon: ISIS finance minister killedWhile the local leadership in places like Iraq and Syria can regenerate itself and continue to operate on the ground, Heras argued that its abilities to launch mass-casualty terror attacks abroad was limited by taking out leaders, as the attacks on the West require a bigger, more sophisticated network and coordination.This significantly benefits the U.S. both because it disrupts attacks against Western civilians but also because it deflates the ISIS narrative that it has been able to deter the international community by launching and coordinating attacks in the West. \"The less ISIS looks like it can act like a state, and conduct attacks in the heart of the West, the weaker its narrative to would-be jihadists that it is the epochal caliphate and therefore worthy of their allegiance,\" Heras said.",

That's the cost to U.S. taxpayers and the Navy after the four-year-old littoral combat ship USS Forth Worth tried to operate its propulsion system without enough oil in January.The Navy announced Wednesday that the $360 million vessel would make a six-week-long journey this summer from Singapore, where it has been tied up since the incident, to San Diego for repairs to its combining gears, the hardware that transfers power from the ship's diesel and gas turbine engines to its water-jet propulsion system.\"The casualty occurred due to an apparent failure to follow procedures during an operational test of the port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines,\" said the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in a statement issued earlier this year.

Cmdr. Timothy Hawkins, a Navy spokesman. \"The insufficient flow of lube oil resulted in high temperature alarms on the port and starboard combining gears.\"The Navy's $23 million cost estimate for the USS Fort Worth covers already underway maintenance, transiting from Singapore to San Diego and scheduled repairs and maintenance once the ship reaches its home port, according to Hawkins. Read More\"Preparations are expected to take several months to complete necessary inspections, conduct lube oil system flushes and configure the engineering plant for safe operations,\" a Pacific Fleet statement said.The 388-foot, 3,400-ton Fort Worth will make the 8,900-mile trans-Pacific voyage using just the power from the gas turbine engines, meaning it will be slower and require several more refueling and supply stops that would normally be the case, the Navy said.Putting as bright a face as it could on the incident, the Navy said the Fort Worth's repair time in San Diego would coincide with a planned maintenance period in its home port.The incident cost the then-commander of the Fort Worth, Cmdr. Michael L. Atwell, his job in late March when the Navy announced Atwell was being reassigned to LCS squadron duties in San Diego.\"Sufficient findings of facts emerged during the investigation to warrant the relief of the commanding officer,\" the Pacific Fleet said in a statement at the time.The mechanical mishap on the Fort Worth came shortly after a similar mistake on its sister ship, the USS Milwaukee, which broke down in the Atlantic Ocean on December 10, less than a month after it was commissioned. The ship had to be towed 40 miles to Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story in Virginia.The Navy said at the time that metallic debris was found in filter systems in the ship, causing a loss of pressure in lubricant to gears that transfer power from the ship's diesel and gas turbine engines to its water jet propulsion system.JUST WATCHEDSizing up the U.S. NavyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSizing up the U.S. Navy 02:05Navy officials later explained what happened in an email to CNN.The Milwaukee \"is designed to operate with gas turbine and diesel engines, which can operate in tandem or independently,\" Navy Lt. Rebecca Haggard said. \"In the case of Milwaukee, when switching from one system to the other, a clutch failed to disengage as designed. Instead, the clutch remained spinning and some of the clutch gears were damaged.\"The Milwaukee has undergone repairs and in late February steamed from Virginia to Mayport, Florida, where the Navy said it would take on additional equipment for testing this spring before proceeding to its home port in San Diego.The Navy's littoral combat ships come in two variants: the monohull and the trimaran. The Fort Worth and Milwaukee are monohulls. With a draft of between 14 and 15 feet and a speed of 40 knots, the ships are designed to operate in littoral environments, or shallower coastal areas.",

        "content": "Story highlightsU.S. Air Force has used A-10 to support ground forces in close combat since 1975Retired Col. Avery Kay credited with launching concept of A-10, better known as WarthogFlyover at Arlington National Cemetery recently honored Kay, who died in October (CNN)The unmistakable roar of the A-10's powerful engines echoed throughout Arlington National Cemetery this month as four aircraft saluted retired Col. Avery Kay for the last time with a rare flyover of the historic burial site.Kay, 96, died on October 29 and was buried with full military honors.A highly decorated navigator who led some of the most dangerous bombing raids against Germany during World War II, Kay was also credited with launching the concept of the A-10 Thunderbolt, better known as the Warthog.Despite lacking the air-to-air combat ability of the F-15 Eagle and the high-tech stealth capabilities of the F-22 Raptor, the U.S. Air Force still uses the A-10 to support ground forces in close combat more than 40 years after its first flight in 1975. But if it hadn't been for Kay, this iconic plane may have been grounded before ever seeing battle. Read MoreAs an adviser to then-Air Force Chief of Staff John McConnell in the 1960s, Kay put his professional reputation on the line and led the fight to create a plane specifically designed to assist troops on the ground. \"Without Col. Kay, there would be no A-10 today,\" said Pierre Sprey, a former Pentagon official who helped Kay design the plane despite objections from many in the Air Force leadership.At the time, the issue of close air support was at the center of a contentious budget debate between the Army and the Air Force over how to divide funding for fixed-wing planes and helicopters. Army leaders often argued it took too long for the Air Force to respond to calls for assistance, specifically during the Vietnam War, and demanded control of budget funds to develop their own heavily armed helicopter that could better meet their needs.The Air Force, however, wanted control over the development of all fixed-wing aircraft and insisted that any type of plane could perform close air support. But in reality, the Air Force's top generals had little interest in dedicating budget dollars for improving support for ground troops, as they preferred planes that could carry out bombing missions deep in enemy territory. Spearheading negotiations between the two service branches, Kay proposed an agreement under which the Army would relinquish control of the development of all fixed-wing aircraft as long as the Air Force fulfilled its promise to build a plane that was able to provide the air support that was lacking during Vietnam. Using the very real threat of the Army's plan to build a helicopter to take over Air Force close support, Kay convinced McConnell that if the Army got its funding approved, he would go down in Air Force history as the chief that lost the close support mission and the money that goes along with it.To counter the Army's proposal, Kay pitched a plan to build an airplane dedicated to the close support missions that would be cheaper and more effective than any helicopter. McConnell approved the plan, but Kay quickly realized that he would have to circumvent the normal chain of command to fulfill his promise to the Army, as many of the Air Force's top generals still lacked interest in spending budget dollars on this cause.Rather than approaching the Air Staff and Tactical command offices, which normally facilitate the building of new planes, Kay reached out to Sprey, who was working for the defense secretary, to help make his plan for the A-10 become a reality. \"What he did at this point is he put his career on the line,\" Sprey recalled. Together, Kay and Sprey worked in secret to develop an aircraft that could cover ground troops from an enemy advance, buying time for grunts to regroup or get out with an aerial weapons strike.\"The entire A-10 community is basically due to his guts and his integrity,\" said Sprey, now an adviser for the Project on Government Oversight. \"If anyone deserves the title of 'father of the A-10,' Col. Kay definitely does.\" Photos: In the U.S. Air Force fleetB-52 Stratofortress \u2013 The first versions of this long-range heavy bomber flew in 1954.

And several lawmakers involved with military allocations believe other expensive undertakings -- such as finding ways to neutralize the deadly improvised explosive devices U.S. soldiers face in the Middle East -- are higher funding priorities.Looming over the debate is the sleek, super-high-tech, massively expensive F-35 Lightning, which was expected to replace the A-10 as the Air Force's primary close air support aircraft. Despite its potential, the F-35 has been riddled with setbacks and is still a long way from deployment.In January, Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force's vice chief of staff, told Defense News the rise of ISIS and the U.S. air campaign to fight the terror group has prompted the service to reconsider plans to retire the A-10.\"When we made the decision on retiring the A-10, we made those decisions prior to ISIL, we were not in Iraq, we were coming out of Afghanistan to a large extent, we didn't have a resurgent Russia,\" Goldfein said in an interview on \"Defense News With Vago Muradian.\"Goldfein's office confirmed the general's remarks to CNN.The retirement of the A-10 was not part of the Pentagon budget request submitted to Congress in February, but the plane's long-term future remains in question.",

The company applied for the patent in 1984, four years before Northrop Grumman publicly unveiled the first B-2 bomber. Zoltek later argued that Northrop Grumman purchased a small number of test sample carbon-fiber sheets in 1983, and used these samples to manufacture the stealth coating on the B-2.Despite paying Northrop Grumman $44 billion to produce 21 B-2s between 1987 and 2000, the U.S. government never compensated Zoltek for the use of its patented carbon-fiber method, according to the company.Read MoreThe 2014 ruling was based on expert testimony that argued part of Zoltek's method was already known to scientists in that field at the time, making the patent invalid.But the appeals court overturned that decision this month, saying the 2014 expert testimony was flawed based on evidence found in a 1987 letter from an engineer at Northrop Grumman, which built the B-2 bomber.In that letter, the engineer contradicted the expert testimony, saying he had never seen a material such as the one owned by Zoltek.JUST WATCHEDNever-before-seen video of B-2 Spirit stealth bomberReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNever-before-seen video of B-2 Spirit stealth bomber 00:56Describing Zoltek's patented method of developing carbon fibers as a \"quantum leap forward\" in defense technology and \"critical to the stealth capability\" of the F-22 and B-2, Dean Monco, a Chicago lawyer who has been representing Zoltek since the beginning of the case, said his client hopes to be recognized for the significance of its invention compensated monetarily for revenue that was lost while the Pentagon has claimed ownership of this technology. But despite this month's favorable ruling, Monco and the rest of Zoltek's legal team still face significant challenges in getting all the facts behind the case, as the U.S. government has invoked the military and state secrets privilege in an effort to prevent information about its aircraft and classified technology from being disclosed.In a 2013 letter to the court, then-Air Force Secretary Michael Donley cited national security concerns while disputing one of Zoltek's claims: that a fiber manufactured by defense contractor Lockheed Martin for the F-22 infringes on the patent. \"How stealth is achieved in the aircraft is considered one of the Air Force's most valuable secrets,\" Donley wrote, adding that providing the information Zoltek was seeking \"would assist foreign governments to develop measures to counter the advantages of the F-22 stealth technology.\"The assertion of this privilege highlights the conflict between the government's right to protect classified information and corporation's constitutional right to be fully compensated.\"This is an issue that has to be addressed,\" Monco said, addressing the secrets privilege, adding that he intends to persist even if the case requires further litigation before appellate courts, or even the Supreme Court.When asked about the case, Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to discuss specifics, noting only that \"the Justice Department is reviewing the opinion in this pending litigation.\" The Department of Justice serves as the legal representation for the U.S. government in this case.And while the courts have yet to agree on a ruling that clarifies the extent to which the government is protected from sharing information related to secret defense programs, they have made several key smaller rulings since the initial suit was filed.Among those decisions was one that determined that Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of the F-22, would not be included in the legal proceedings.Excluding Lockheed Martin from the case reaffirmed a U.S. statute that says the government is liable for any compensation if the court finds that a contractor used a patented invention.Monco said the fact that Zoltek's case, now in its third appeal, has bounced between a Federal Claims Court and an appeals court in Washington for so long is very unusual.In fact, the case has gone on for so long that much of the evidence used in the 2014 hearing to determine the patent's validity was from \"witnesses who are either deceased, advanced in age, or who otherwise were unable to appear live at trial,\" according to the judge's opinion.The inventor of Zoltek's patented method, George Boyd, died in 2006, and the patent expired on March 1, 2005.Zoltek was sold before a final verdict could be rendered on its complaint, bought in 2014 by Toray Industries in Japan.But Monco, who was 45 when the case started and is now 65, said the length of the legal process does not deter him from seeking compensation for his client.\"We intend to complete the task,\" he said.",

        "content": "Story highlightsLittoral combat ship USS Milwaukee was damaged less than a month after commissioningNavy officials say a clutch failed to disengage when the ship was switching between propulsion systems (CNN)Imagine you just got that brand-new top-of-the-line sports car and you take it out for that first road trip and -- you blow the clutch.Now imagine that your hot new ride is a $360 million warship.Well, that's about what happened to the USS Milwaukee, one of the U.S. Navy's newest littoral combat ships.The 388-foot, 3,400-ton Milwaukee broke down in the Atlantic Ocean on December 10, less than a month after it was commissioned. The ship had to be towed 40 miles to Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story in Virginia.The Navy said at the time that metallic debris was found in filter systems in the ship, causing a loss of pressure in lubricant to gears that transfer power from the ship's diesel and gas turbine engines to its water jet propulsion system.Read MoreNavy officials on Tuesday explained what happened in an email to CNN.The Milwaukee \"is designed to operate with gas turbine and diesel engines, which can operate in tandem or independently,\" Navy Lt. Rebecca Haggard said. \"In the case of Milwaukee, when switching from one system to the other, a clutch failed to disengage as designed. Instead, the clutch remained spinning and some of the clutch gears were damaged.\"Haggard said quick action by the crew prevented more serious problems and the damaged clutch was repaired in Virginia.The Navy had not yet put a price on the damage and repairs, Haggard said.Last Friday, the Milwaukee completed a two-day-plus voyage from Virginia to Mayport, Florida, its first journey since the mishap.JUST WATCHEDSee U.S. Navy warship at top speedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee U.S. Navy warship at top speed 01:07The Navy said while at the shipyard of BAE Systems, a Navy contractor, in Mayport, the Milwaukee would take on additional equipment for testing this spring before proceeding to its home port in San Diego.The Navy's littoral combat ships come in two variants: the monohull and the trimaran. The Milwaukee is a monohull. With a draft of between 14 and 15 feet and a speed of 40 knots, the ships are designed to operate in littoral environments, or shallower coastal areas.The past few months have been rough ones for the Navy's LCS program.Just a month after the Milwaukee mishap, its sister ship, the USS Fort Worth (LCS 3), was tied up at a dock in Singapore with what the U.S. Pacific Fleet called \"a casualty to the ship's combining gears.\"\"Based on initial indications, the casualty occurred due to an apparent failure to follow procedures during an operational test of the port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines,\" said a statement from the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.The Navy is looking into what brought on the January 12 incident on the Fort Worth so corrective actions can be taken.\"Several options for the repair are under review. No decision has been made yet,\" Lt. Cmdr. Matt Knight said Tuesday.While the ships are having their onboard problems, they are also facing a lack of support at the Pentagon, specifically from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.In December, Carter ordered the Navy to cut its projected fleet of the ships from 52 to 40, saying resources that would have been devoted to the 12 proposed LCSs would be better expended on Navy ships with better firepower, as well as submarines and aircraft.",

However, we have never had F-15s conduct a training deployment to Finland,\" Klinkel said.Russia's increasingly aggressive behavior over the past several years has prompted several countries across Europe to re-examine their defense capabilities and expand cooperation with other nations who share their concerns, according to Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow of Russian studies at the Council for Foreign Relations. Read More\"This is a strong trend in Scandinavia in particular, where countries like Norway and Denmark, which have been in NATO for decades, and others, like Sweden and Finland, which are traditionally neutral, are asking themselves: How can we work together if we come under pressure from Russia?\" Sestanovich said. \"And they are asking the U.S.: Will you help us send a message to Moscow?\"About 100 airmen from the Oregon base will accompany the jets for the May 9 to 22 deployment, said Master Sgt. Jennifer D. Shirar of the Oregon Air National Guard. The U.S. troops will operate out of Kuopio, Finland, which is about 100 miles west of the border with Russia.The exercise was first reported last week by Finnish public broadcaster YLE, which called it large by Finnish standards.\"A training session of U.S. military aircraft of this scale has not previously taken place in Finland,\" YLE reported.The May deployment is just the latest of U.S. aircraft to Europe as part of Atlantic Resolve. F-22s, A-10s and F-16s have been part of previous exercises along with F-15s.News of the Finland deployment comes just days after the Department of Defense announced it was quadrupling money $3.4 billion for the European Reassurance Initiative in an effort to deter Russian aggression against NATO allies.Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev highlighted the strained relationship between his nation and the West on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.\"NATO's policy with regard to Russia has remained unfriendly and opaque. One could go as far as to say that we have slid back to a new Cold War,\" Medvedev said. \"Almost on an everyday basis we are called one of the most terrible threats either to NATO as a whole or to Europe, or to the United States.\" NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, Gen. Philip Breedlove, told CNN that the allied group does not agree with Medvedev's assessment. \"We at NATO do not want to see a Cold War,\" he said. \"We do not talk about it. It's not what we want to happen or anticipate to happen. ... We're a defensive alliance who are arraying ourselves to face a challenge ... [from] a nation that has once again decided it will use force to change internationally recognized borders and so we take those appropriate actions to be able to assure, defend and deter.\"Tensions between the West and Russia have increased in recent years, in large part -- at least in the view of the West -- because of Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its support for separatists elsewhere in eastern Ukraine.But the increased in military cooperation between the United States and various European nations is also a direct result of other Russian military activities such as its intervention in Syria and stepped-up submarine presence in Scandinavian waters, Sestanovich said.\"European governments don't like what they see, and they are trying to tell the Russians to cool it,\" he said.",

Troubles for the ships, which cost around $360 million apiece, began in December, when the USS Milwaukee (LCS 5), broke down off the East Coast and had to be towed 40 miles to a naval base in Virginia. The 388-foot-long, 3,400-ton Milwaukee was on its way to its home port of San Diego after commissioning in November.The Milwaukee became disabled in the Atlantic when metallic debris was found in filter systems in the ship, causing a loss of pressure in lubricant to gears that transfer power from the ship's diesel and gas turbine engines to its water jet propulsion system.The cause of the issue has yet to be identified, and an investigation continues, said Lt. Rebecca Haggard, a Navy spokeswoman.Just a month after the Milwaukee mishap, its sister ship, the USS Fort Worth (LCS 3), is tied up at a dock in Singapore with what the U.S. Pacific Fleet calls \"a casualty to the ship's combining gears.\"Read More\"Based on initial indications, the casualty occurred due to an apparent failure to follow procedures during an operational test of the port and starboard main propulsion diesel engines,\" said a statement from the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.Issues involving standard operating procedures are very rare, said Lt. Cmdr. Matt Knight, a Navy spokesman, who said that before this incident, the Fort Worth had been a \"model of reliability\" while deployed in the U.S. 7th fleet over the past year.The Navy is also looking into what brought on the January 12 incident on the Fort Worth so corrective actions can be taken. It has not determined how long the investigation will take.\"It is too early to speculate on costs or repair timelines,\" Knight said. \"We have the right resources in place to conduct the necessary inspections, determine the extent of the damage and required repairs, and return Fort Worth back to operational status.\"  But even without all the facts, Navy officials said that evidence does not suggest a link between the two incidents that would reflect a systemic issue in the LCS program.

Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, a Navy spokesman. Unlike the Milwaukee, which broke down just days after it was commissioned, the Fort Worth is a fairly tested ship that has participated in nine exercises with navies around the world and conducted operations in the South China Sea without issue, he said. This successful track record lowers the chances of a common thread between the problems it experienced this month and those of the brand-new USS Milwaukee.Defense secretary has ordered cuts The Navy's littoral combat ships come in two variants: the monohull and the trimaran. With a draft of between 14 and 15 feet and a speed of 40 knots, the ships are designed to operate in littoral environments, or shallower coastal areas.The Fort Worth and the Milwaukee are monohull ships, as is the USS Freedom (LCS 1). Trimarans on active duty are the USS Independence (LCS 2) and USS Coronado (LCS 4).While the ships are having their on-board problems, they are also facing a lack of support at the Pentagon, specifically from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. In December, Carter ordered the Navy to cut its projected fleet of the ships from 52 to 40, saying resources that would have been devoted to the 12 proposed LCSs would be better expended on Navy ships with better firepower, as well as submarines and aircraft.\"This plan reduces, somewhat, the number of LCS available for presence operations, but that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities and posture to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries,\" read a December 14 letter from Carter to Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus.Carter's plan isn't being heartily embraced by the Navy's top uniformed officers, who are offering some defense for the LCS.\"It's got survivability and lethality ... and it has a terrific role to play across that entire spectrum of operations,\" Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, is quoted as saying by Breaking Defense.\"LCS fits right in the middle of the modern warfight, great powers or not,\" Rear Adm. Peter Fanta, the Navy's director of surface warfare, is quoted as saying in the same article.Role of the LCS overseasAnd less than a year ago, the Navy was touting the role the LCS would play in regions like the South China Sea, where China is building facilities on reclaimed land sites in the Spratly Islands, and where the ship now idled in Singapore, the Fort Worth, made an important show-the-flag patrol last May.\"Routine operations like the one Fort Worth just completed in the South China Sea will be the new normal as we welcome four LCSs to the region in the coming years. Deployment of multiple LCSs to Southeast Asia underscores the importance of this 'region on the rise' and the value persistent presence brings,\" Capt. Fred Kacher, commodore of the Navy's Destroyer Squadron 7, said in a news release at the time.Despite experiencing two incidents in as many months, Hawkins said, the Navy's long-term strategic plan for using littoral combat ships has not changed.\"The Navy still plans to rotationally deploy four littoral combat ships to Singapore by 2018 as part of a broader effort to base the most advanced and capable naval forces in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region over the next four years,\" he said.",

Brian Chontosh and his platoon drove into an ambush of mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons fire while traveling on a highway toward Baghdad.Realizing the road ahead was blocked and taking heavy fire, Chontosh ordered his vehicle to drive directly at the enemy position.According to his Navy Cross award citation, Chontosh exited the vehicle and began to engage the enemy with his rifle and pistol. He repeatedly exhausted his ammunition but continued to press forward using discarded enemy weapons and eventually led his platoon through the ambush.\"When his audacious attack ended, he had cleared over 200 meters of the enemy trench, killing more than 20 enemy soldiers and wounding several others,\" Chontosh's Navy Cross citation reads.Several years have passed since Chontosh returned home from Iraq, but the fight on Capitol Hill continues over whether he and several other U.S. soldiers who served during Operation Iraqi Freedom deserve consideration for the Congressional Medal of Honor.Read More Photos: 100 moments from the Iraq War Photos: 100 moments from the Iraq WarU.S. Marines in northern Kuwait gear up after receiving orders to cross the Iraqi border on March 20, 2003.

But to date, no living veteran of the war in Iraq has been presented the medal and only four have been awarded posthumously -- and some of those who served in the conflict are asking why.World War II, Korea and Vietnam brought hundreds of Medals of Honor: 472, 146 and 258 respectively. Twelve Medals of Honor have been given to veterans of the war in Afghanistan and the 13th will be awarded on Thursday.Retired Army captain to receive Medal of Honor for Afghanistan heroismRep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, argues that the actions of several Iraq veterans deserve the distinguished recognition as well. Hunter wrote letters to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking for Iraq war veterans, including Chontosh, to be considered for the Medal of Honor to no avail.JUST WATCHEDMeet the Medal of Honor RecipientReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the Medal of Honor Recipient 02:36\"The fact that there's not a single living recipient of the Medal of Honor from the war in Iraq is a mystery,\" Hunter said.\"There are countless examples of extreme valor during intense, close-quarter combat, but for some reason, starting with the (George W.) Bush administration, there was a concerted effort to not recognize acts of courage with the Medal of Honor,\" he said.In a 2010 interview with CNN's Barbara Starr, Gates said the decrease in medals reflects a change in warfare.\"I think part of the reason is the nature of war today in the sense, our enemies generally use weapons at a distance from us. So, there's less hand-to-hand or in-close combat than there has been in previous wars,\" Gates said, referring to the type of actions that have traditionally been honored in past conflicts.Hunter, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, strongly rejected this reasoning.\"To say that there is not one act of valor that is consistent with the requirements for the Medal of Honor is a real disservice to every service person who fought and sacrificed,\" Hunter said.According to military standards, the Medal of Honor is awarded to an individual who performed a deed of \"personal bravery\" that was \"beyond the call of duty\" and \"involved risk of life\" during a conflict against an enemy of the United States. \"This is a process that has become overly politicized and while this administration has at least gone to greater lengths to recognize courage in Afghanistan, we still don't have a single living recipient from Iraq, and it's definitely not because they don't exist,\" Hunter said.Last year, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel launched a comprehensive review of the process for awarding medals, which his successor, Ashton Carter, is expected to complete.JUST WATCHEDA new image for wounded warriors ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA new image for wounded warriors  02:32Michael Stokes shows wounded warriors in a new lightMany Iraq war veterans say they don't measure or compare wars based on the number of medals awarded, however, and see the Medal of Honor as purely an individual designation of the highest level of heroism.\"There is no 'conflict quota' for medals,\" said Sgt. Thomas Barnes, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq's Anbar province in 2009. \"The command elements are concerned with achieving mission objectives, and everything else is secondary.\"\"We recognize excellence when we see it and if no one is recognized for a particular award, then the standards simply were not met,\" said Barnes, reflecting the way many of his fellow Marines and soldiers in Iraq feel about the nation's highest military honor.\"Just because a service member acts heroically doesn't mean they deserve the Congressional Medal of Honor,\" he said.Rather than focusing on which wars' veterans are being honored, Bill Rausch, a former Army major who served in Iraq, said the veteran community values the selflessness demonstrated by those who are recognized and the example their heroism sets.\"Regardless of an individual's experience in or out of uniform, the Medal of Honor symbolizes being true to one's military values and being willing to put one's life on the line for something they believe in,\" said Rausch, now political director for the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, an organization of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he added that he would be happy not to see any more medals awarded, despite their deep meaning. \"We'd all love to see zero Medals of Honor awarded because that would mean we would no longer be at war,\" Rausch said.Sign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics.Follow @CNNpolitics",

The Pentagon's focus on developing a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" aircraft, while rival countries build technology capable of sinking American carriers, could make these expensive warships ineffective in the coming years, according to the naval expert who authored the report.The rise of new powers now threatens to push the Navy farther from shore and beyond the range of the aircraft the carriers hold, according to the report written by naval expert Jerry Hendrix of the Center for New American Security. \"This push back would limit the service's ability to project power and thus undermine the credibility of the United States.\"The U.S. carrier fleet and its air wings, or the aircraft on board, have been considered the foundation of American naval power since the end of World War II.Read More Photos: US aircraft carriersSailors spell out #USA with the American flag on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Persian Gulf in late June 2015.

That hurts U.S. power projection and its ability to contemplate regime change strategies that have dominated many modern American wars.Russia, North Korea and Iran are also investing in similar anti-ship technology in an effort to re-impose the strict naval territories that existed in the decades prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, he added.But the Navy said it is confident in the capabilities of its air wing and that the aircraft carrier will remain relevant despite the efforts of rival nations. \"A carrier is the only maritime force capable of executing the full range of military operations necessary to protect our national interests,\" Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Marks told CNN.\"The Navy remains committed to maintaining a carrier force, and associated carrier air wings, that provide unparalleled responsiveness and flexibility to operational commanders across the full range of military options,\" he added.JUST WATCHEDSee U.S. Navy warship at top speedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSee U.S. Navy warship at top speed 01:07To counter the emerging threat posed by advanced anti-ship missile systems, the Navy has outfitted its newest destroyers and cruisers with advanced ballistic missile defense systems and is modernizing its ships and planes to include sensors and targeting systems that allow commanders, pilots and ship crews to share data with one another in real time.  READ: Size matters: Is the U.S. Navy really too small?The systems allow the group to \"detect, track and destroy an approaching target from distances hundreds of miles over the horizon,\" Marks said.But Hendrix contended that upgraded defense capabilities may not be enough, suggesting the Navy reassess the types of planes it plans to buy and restore more balance to its air wing by investing in alternatives that have more range.\"New capabilities in the areas of unmanned systems, stealth, directed energy, and hypersonics could be combined to provide the range required to perform deep strike missions,\" said Hendrix.Another recent report, this one by the Hudson Institute's Center for American Sea Power, also said the Navy must increase the striking range of its planes in order to protect aircraft carriers in an increasingly dangerous environment.This group of researchers also concluded that the emerging threats posed by evolving anti-ship technology only increase the need to invest in aircraft carriers, provided they have the proper enhancements in capability.Dakota Wood, who served in the U.S. Marines and is a defense expert with the D.C.-based Heritage Foundation, agreed with Hendrix's assessment that the U.S. Navy must adjust its thinking about aircraft carriers as the anti-ship capabilities of rival nations improve.However, any argument that aircraft carriers are no longer viable is premature, he said, as only a few countries currently possess weaponry precise enough to pose a lethal threat to carrier fleets.\"I think aircraft carriers will exist in their current form for several more years,\" Wood said.Follow @CNNpolitics",

However, the fifth generation stealth fighter jet may still have a number of maintenance and reliability problems that \"are likely to present significant near-term challenges for the Marine Corps,\" according to a complete copy of a recent memo from the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), released in a report by the nonpartisan government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight (POGO).   While military officials promoted the F-35's performance during Marine Corps operational test trials aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp in May as a success and proof that the $400 billion fighter is ready for real-world combat deployment, the POGO report tells a very different story.

A new Pentagon report says the testing highlighted maintenance challenges for the F-35.Hide Caption 7 of 7Not only did the six F-35Bs used in the demonstration, referred to by the Marines as Operational Test 1, fail to achieve the number of required flight hours necessary to be declared combat-ready, but, in fact, the DOT&E found the trials, \"did not -- and could not \u2014demonstrate that Block 2B F-35B is operationally effective or suitable for use in any type of limited combat operation, or that it was ready for real-world operational deployments, given the way the event was structured,\" the report says. To qualify as a true operational test with results that would allow the Department of Defense to determine whether or not the F-35B is operationally effective and ready to be deployed, testing would have to be conducted under conditions more representative of real-world operations, the report says.  Read MoreHighlighting artificial advantages present during the USS Wasp trials, such as a relatively empty flight-deck, \"non-operationally representative (supply system)workarounds\" to support the aircraft's unreliable logistics system and \"significant assistance from embarked contractor personnel\" to help with maintenance, the report concludes that the flight tests aboard the Navy ship failed to simulate the realistic combat conditions necessary to show whether or not the F-35B is ready for actual deployment.  \"This report indicates exactly what some of us have been warning about all along,\" said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and a consistent critic of the F-35 program. \"The services are rushing to declare the F-35 ready for combat, ignoring clear readiness issues in order to show that the program is 'back on track,' but just saying something doesn't make it so. The jets currently can't perform many missions in the real world because of mistakes made throughout the development and procurement process,\" she said.While the event aboard the USS Wasp did not qualify as a true operational test in the eyes of the DOT&E, the report says the trials did serve as a useful training opportunity for the Marines assigned to F-35B units and highlighted a number of issues, particularly with the aircraft's integration with existing ships and maintenance challenges, that were important to identify before its first deployment.  Squad of F-35 fighters cleared for combat dutyThe Marine Corps said it does not agree with all of the conclusions and opinions outlined by the DOT&E in the POGO report, due to what it called a lack of context and qualifying information, according to a statement provided to CNN.   \"During OT-1, we wanted to prove that non-test F-35B aircraft could be operated and sustained aboard an L-class ship,\" the Marine Corps said in a statement. \"We successfully did that. The two weeks of operational testing assessed the aircraft's integration with the U.S. Navy ship and crew, operating a wide array of flight and deck operations.\" The Marine Cops also said that the extensive testing done verified expected F-35B capabilities: successful missile shots; successful steel-on-steel, air-to-ground deliveries; and three successful sea-trials.   \"At IOC, the F-35B targeted in real time, talked to forward air controllers over the radio and data-link, and put weapons on target. The F-35B can provide close air support in threat environments where our current platforms would not survive, and the synthetic aperture radar gives us a through-the-weather targeting capability where the majority of our legacy targeting systems are simply ineffective,\" the Marine Corps said. Despite the fact that the observations outlined by the DOT&E within the POGO report contradict those made by defense contractors and military officials last month, the Marine Corps says F-35B's ability to carry more fuel than the legacy fighters currently in use and weapon payload, coupled with the completion of the installation of Block 3F software on all Marine Corps F-35Bs in the 2017 time frame, means the jet will surpass anything the U.S. has in its arsenal today.  \"Data collected and lessons learned during OT-1 will lay the groundwork for F-35B deployments aboard U.S. Navy amphibious carriers now that the U.S. Marine Corps' F-35B Lightning II aircraft reached initial operational capability (IOC) on July 31, 2015,\" the Marine Corps said.

            "The U.S. Marines' version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was declared ready for combat this year, but the Navy and Air Force are still waiting for the finishing touches to be made on their jets. The fighter jet has been in development for nearly 15 years and is touted as the most advanced weapons system of the modern era, combining stealth capabilities, supersonic speed, extreme agility and state-of-the-art sensor fusion technology. The price tag for all these benefits, however, is nearly $400 billion, making the program the most expensive weapons system in world history. To maintain and operate the JSF program over the course of its lifetime, the Pentagon will invest nearly $1 trillion, according to the Government Accountability Office. The Pentagon is scheduled to purchase 2,443 F-35s, but criticism over the affordability of the program has prompted several lawmakers to reaffirm their desire to purchase the full order of aircraft.",

The KC-46A Pegasus is designed to carry passengers, cargo and injured military personal and can \"detect, avoid, defeat and survive threats using multiple layers of protection, which will enable it to operate safely in medium-threat environments,\" according to Boeing. The new KC-46A completed a successful first flight in September 2015, but the program has been criticized for schedule delays and cost overruns since the contract was awarded in 2011. Boeing plans to build 179 KC-46 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force. Amid criticism over schedule delays and cost overruns, several lawmakers have pledged to keep the program on track to deliver the planned amount of planes.

Originally designed and built to replace other fighter and ground attack aircraft in the U.S. military's arsenal, the radar-evading F-22 is an evolutionary dead end. The Air Force acquired only 188 of them from aerospace maker Lockheed and doesn't plan to have any more produced. However, some lawmakers have called for more F-22s to be built.",

Officials have been tight-lipped as to the specific capability expectations for the LRS-B, but indications are that it will be stealth, able to carry conventional and nuclear weapons, and could possibly operate both with and without a pilot. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the new long-range bomber will have the ability to launch from the United States and strike any target around the globe to counter advancements in air defense systems by rival nations and emerging threats posed by potential adversaries. Along with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the KC-46 tanker, the LRS-B is one of the Air Force's top modernization priorities.",

Better known as the Warthog, the A-10 has fought pitched battles with Iraqi insurgents, the Taliban and, more recently, ISIS fighters. But the most dangerous foe the aircraft has is budget sequestration and shifting Air Force priorities. Right now, the venerable warbird is only surviving year to year and may soon be eliminated. The Pentagon leadership thinks the A-10 is too expensive to maintain under the current spending limits when other aircraft can fill similar roles.

The nuclear-powered Ford uses all electric utilities, meaning the steam catapults used to launch planes on the current Nimitz-class carriers are replaced with electromagnetic rails. The Ford is expected to be able to launch its aircraft at a rate 33% higher than Nimitz ships. While the Navy says the massive carriers will be the backbone of the fleet for decades to come, some critics say improved weapons technology from U.S. adversaries could make them expensive vulnerabilities.

Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through fiber optic data lines through signal processors to the control center,\" the Navy says. The North Carolina is the fourth of the Block I variant of the Virginia class. The Navy has six Block II variants of the Virginia class in service. Block II subs were built in four sections, rather than the 10 sections used in Block I subs. The Navy says this brought costs down by $300 million per sub.

Sgt. Jeffrey Baskin, 192nd Maintenance Squadron crew chief, in an Air Force press release.Rather than try to clear the bees from the jet themselves, crew members realized that honey bees are at risk of extinction and contacted local beekeeper and retired US Navy veteran, Andy Westrich, who proclaimed the hive the largest he had ever seen after being escorted to the aircraft.Westrich used vacuum hoses to wrangle the thousands of bees into several large buckets and safely relocate the colony.Read MoreBeekeeper Andy Westrichwas called to remove and relocate the bees to a safe place.Before transporting the bees to their new home at a local beer production facility, Westrich took them to his house and found that the hive weighed nearly eight pounds in total, according to the Air Force release.But how do nearly 20,000 bees, weighing a collective eight pounds find their way onto the exhaust pipe of a fighter jet? They likely came from a much larger bee hive somewhere else on the base, according to Chief Master Sgt.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Lawmakers in both parties are expressing frustration over the extended fortification of Capitol Hill as tension between the need to address security failures of January 6 and restoring some to semblance of normalcy threatens to kick off a contentious debate over how to protect the Capitol complex. The thousands of National Guard troops still in Washington and the razor-wire fence surrounding the Capitol are both physical reminders of how security concerns continue to linger more than two months after the January 6 attack. Members of Congress have sought clarity from US Capitol Police and the Pentagon as to why the deployment of Guard troops was extended this week through May but have not been given a clear explanation, according to a source familiar with the outreach.  The current understanding, the source told CNN, is that US Capitol Police does not have the staffing to provide security post-January 6 even with a reduced threat, so the National Guard is bridging the gap. It also remains unclear where the National Guard troops would come from, the source added, noting that the Pentagon has deferred to the National Guard, which is in contact with governors about the issue. The resistance to the extended security situation comes as lawmakers consider new recommendations for how to permanently safeguard the Capitol. This week a task force appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed a host of security changes, including hiring hundreds of new Capitol Police officers, installing a retractable fence at the Capitol and even conducting background checks on all congressional staff. Read MoreThe long-term security posture at the Capitol itself is the first of a host of politically thorny issues lawmakers will have to tackle, and if their current sentiment is any indication, it will not be an easy debate. Mitch McConnell on Capitol security: 'I think we've overdone it,' compares Capitol to Kabul \"I think we're way overreacting to the current need,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. \"I'm extremely uncomfortable with the fact that my constituents can't come to the Capitol. With all this razor wire around the complex reminds me of my last visit to Kabul. This is the capital of the United States of America. ... It looks terrible to have the beacon of our democracy surrounded by razor wire and National Guard troops.\" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, echoed a similar sentiment Tuesday.  \"It has to change ... what we have now, that's just unacceptable to me, currently 10-foot fences with razor wire on top of that, Durbin said. \"It's just ghastly, it's an embarrassment. If there's a better way to protect us, I want to see it. I want to work to get it. We can't assume any longer that the good old days are going to return when it comes to security on Capitol Hill. The insurrection mob on January 6 proved that.\"  The recommendations from the task force, led by retired Lt. Gen. Russell Honore, were the first formal effort to address the security failures, and many of them are likely to be taken up in a security supplemental funding bill from the House Appropriations Committee, according to Democratic aides.  Additional recommendations could be addressed by the House Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police Board, one senior aide said, while some of the proposals requiring more systemic changes might need additional legislation.  But it's still unclear whether Democrats will get buy-in from Republicans for making changes recommended by the task force. Some of the proposals, like hiring additional officers, are likely to attract bipartisan support, but recommendations like conducting background checks could face opposition from Republicans who have chafed at Democratic charges of an \"insider threat\" to the Capitol. Republicans have also already started questioning the potential price tag of a supplemental security package.  GOP critical of task force chief Commanding General District of Columbia National Guard Major General William J. Walker testifies on March 3, 2021 in Washington, DC. While some Republicans have praised Honore's recommendations, several have attacked his appointment by Pelosi over comments made before his appointment about the January 6 attack. \"It is a partisan one-sided report by a person that had already shown a bias, so I think we should discount it appropriately,\" Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, told CNN Wednesday. Issa said that Honore's task force called for \"a lot of requests for money, not a really comprehensive plan at all.\"  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Honore of having a partisan bias, saying it \"raises the unacceptable possibility that Speaker Pelosi desired a certain result: turning the Capitol into a fortress.\"  Several Republicans praised the report. GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said he liked how it addressed manpower and physical security improvements needed. \"I think his recommendations seemed reasonable and I could tell that he was putting mission over partisanship in my mind. And so I think he tried to do a good faith effort,\" Bacon said. Rep. Rodney Davis, the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, said many of Honore's recommendations were \"spot on.\" But he questioned the suggestion of an \"internal threat\" inside the Capitol to justify some of the security decisions that Pelosi has made, such as installing magnetometers outside the House chamber doors. \"They still have not relayed to me what an internal threat is within the Capitol. And I think it's taking precious resources away from our brave Capitol Police officers who need a break. They need to be able to go to their families\" Davis said.   No end date yet for Guard deployment Members of the National Guard gather outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, March 4, 2021. National Guard troops still roam the halls of the Capitol, and it's not clear whether this week's latest two-month extension will be the last.  On Wednesday, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby again declined to speculate about the duration of the National Guard deployment past the new May deadline but told reporters that the Secretary of Defense is confident in his decision to approve the USCP extension request. \"We're comfortable that we're going to be able to source this on May 23, and we'll see where we are in a month or so. Whatever it looks like going forward, I certainly wouldn't speculate one way or the other,\" Kirby said. \"It is about capacity, which has a lot to do with numbers and augmenting the Capitol Police right now, in this new environment we're all living in post-January 6.\" Both Democrats and Republicans have expressed frustration with the extended Guard deployment and the lockdown of the Capitol, long a symbol of open government. \"I don't think there needs to be a continuing massive presence, because I do think it sends the wrong message, and one of the best things we did on the Sixth was go back and do our work,\" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. \"And I think the sooner we can return to normal, wide-eyed, the better. ... But if there is real intelligence -- that there's real threats out there -- we need to overreact instead of under react.\" Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in an interview there needed to be a balance struck between the desire for an open campus and preventing another attack.  \"I think it's absolutely essential that we have that balance. I don't like seeing the wall around the Capitol that we have now, the barbed wire we have on top of that, that's not what we should have here,\" Peters said. \"The Capitol is the 'People's House' and having the Capitol accessible to Americans is essential in my mind.\"  'Partisan fight in everything' The U.S. Capitol, which saw boosted security, after officials warned of an attack plot by extremists, two months after supporters of former president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building.At the Capitol, lingering tensions remain over the events of January 6, which some Democrats have suggested some of their GOP colleagues were complicit in either directly or indirectly. Several Democrats have expressed skepticism Republicans will help to address the security problems with additional funding.  \"We can't count on them for anything at all,\" said one House Democrat. \"Somebody has to be the grown up in the room, make tough choices.\" At the same time, some Republicans have accused Democrats of using January 6 as justification for refusing to work with their colleagues across the aisle over their vote not to certify the election results, creating gridlock on a host of issues where bipartisan cooperation would typically be expected.  \"There's a partisan fight in everything here right now, everything,\" Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, said when asked if the response to Honore's recommendations could be bipartisan. \"You actively have members of the Democrat Party ... saying they're literally not working -- not cosponsoring, not doing anything -- with anybody that didn't vote the way they wanted to on January 6.\" Republicans have questioned the need to keep up the security posture at the Capitol when there hasn't been a threat like the one posed on January 6. Davis said the House's decision to leave early due to intelligence concerns about a plot on the Capitol on March 4 wasn't warranted, noting the Senate continued to hold votes.  \"I think what happened on January 6 is not likely to recur again,\" said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee. Costly solutions  The U.S. Capitol dome is seen beyond a security fence on January 17, 2021. Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence and Pentagon official, said that Honore told lawmakers threats against them have only accelerated this year. Honore's report recommended enhanced security for all 900 congressional district offices. \"People are worried about their security when they're here in Congress, particularly after the National Guard leaves,\" Slotkin told CNN. \"I don't think it's abated in anyway, and certainly in my own experience -- we just had an indictment against someone who has been threatening my team -- so it hasn't gone down for those of us who are members of Congress, certainly not.\" Honore's report did not include a price tag, but House Appropriations Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro said this week she expected a \"substantial investment\" in security. Draft recommendations, first reported by CNN, indicated that the price tag for simply hiring hundreds of additional USCP officers could approach costs of $100 million, let alone the costs of installing new retractable fencing and other measures.  Plus, Congress will need to address the costs of the thousands of National Guard troops at the Capitol and the fencing that currently surrounds it. House Appropriations GOP spokeswoman Sarah Flaim said Republicans were \"reviewing the report to determine the best path forward to secure the Capitol and protect Members and staff while also maintaining public access.\" Honore's report recommended that the Capitol use a mobile and retractable fencing system as a more permanent security solution. In the report, Honore touched on the debate over security and openness that's likely to drive Congress' decision-making on security in the coming months. Retractable fencing, the task force wrote, \"could enable an open campus while giving security forces better options to protect the complex and its Members should a threat develop.\" CNN's Geneva Sands, Manu Raju, Kristin Wilson and Jessica Dean contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The unprecedented second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump will take place under extraordinary security inside the US Capitol -- a physical reminder that federal officials still believe threats to lawmakers and federal buildings are possible more than a month after the January 6 insurrection.  Members of the National Guard still patrol the exterior of the Capitol complex -- in some cases along 8-foot, non-scalable fences topped by razor wire.  Within the halls of the building, all nine House Democratic impeachment managers are flanked by a security detail as they walk to votes and take meetings around the Capitol. The managers were also assigned a security detail during last year's impeachment trial. In addition, enhanced security measures around the US Capitol will remain in place due to the ongoing potential for violence by domestic extremists, in part due to the heightened political tension surrounding the trial itself, sources familiar with the plans told CNN. Access to the Senate will also be tightly regulated, as it was during Trump's first impeachment trial.  Trump tells aides he thinks he'll be acquitted as he remains fixated on 'accountability' for GOP lawmakers who voted to impeachFederal law enforcement officials say they are not currently tracking any \"specific and credible\" threats to the Capitol surrounding the Senate impeachment trial, which is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, but relevant agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, remain on high alert. They're using all the tools at their disposal to avoid the security and intelligence failures that occurred leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack.  Read MoreThe FBI continues to conduct surveillance on a number of people in the US, in cases where there is enough probable cause to do so -- monitoring for any signs that they are planning something specific around the impeachment trial and in the weeks that follow, according to a law enforcement official.  Law enforcement officials have also reached out to some of the suspects in an effort to discourage them from facilitating unrest or violence, the official said.  As part of that effort, officials are closely tracking threats against individual members of Congress, which have continued to mount in recent weeks. Ensuring the safety of lawmakers in Washington and as they travel back to their home states has become a particular area of focus, sources have told CNN.   Security precautions in placeMultiple congressional sources familiar with Capitol security operations told CNN that lawmakers have not been briefed on any imminent threats surrounding the impeachment trial but noted enhanced security precautions will be left in place out of an abundance of caution, and additional steps have been taken to protect lawmakers with prominent roles in the proceedings. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats last week that additional security has been provided for lawmakers when they are traveling.  \"The Sergeant at Arms (SAA) and U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) are partnering with the Transportation Security Administration, Federal Air Marshal Service and Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority to increase security for Members while traveling to and from Washington,\" she wrote in a letter to members. \"Among other steps, USCP will be stationed at BWI, IAD, DCA and Union Station to provide extra security on days with increased Member travel,\" Pelosi added, using acronyms for the airports that serve DC. \"Given the serious and ongoing security threats facing Members and the Congress, it is clear that there is a need for an emergency supplemental funding bill to meet institutional security needs.\"   A TSA spokesperson declined to comment on what additional security measures would be afforded lawmakers while traveling to and from Washington. Nationwide, detainment memos filed by federal prosecutors show officials are treating the threat of organized violence as not only possible, but also likely. Prosecutors are urging judges to consider the potential for similar events when deciding whether riot defendants should remain behind bars. Friday, Department of Justice attorneys argued that a Seattle member of the right-wing extremist group the Proud Boys should stay in custody.   Pelosi says part of Capitol Hill security issue is 'the enemy is within the House of Representatives'\"There is no reason to believe that Defendant, or any of his Proud Boy associates, are any more interested in 'complacency,' or any less interested in fomenting rebellion, than they were on January 5,\" prosecutors wrote. \"If nothing else, the events of January 6, 2021, have exposed the size and determination of right-wing fringe groups in the United States, and their willingness to place themselves and others in danger to further their political ideology. Releasing Defendant to rejoin their fold and plan their next attack poses a potentially catastrophic risk of danger to the community.\" The likelihood of planned gatherings or protests in the District throughout the week is minimal.  Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, told CNN in an email that the agency was reviewing only two applications for permitted events in DC this week: one a free speech demonstration calling for Trump to be convicted and another to protest the political situation in Myanmar.  A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department said the agency hasn't issued any permits for events. But law enforcement officials are acutely aware that extremists could be inspired by rhetoric from lawmakers or online narratives that emerge during the trial and in the weeks that follow.  Those concerns echo warnings issued by the Department of Homeland Security in a threat bulletin last month, which officials say reflects a clear shift in how the agency is prioritizing the issue of domestic extremism under President Joe Biden in a way the Trump administration did not. \"If you've been to the Capitol in the last three weeks it's like an armed fortress here. And so I'm not personally worried about my physical security here and about the security of the building and the institution right now,\" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, chair of the House Intelligence Counter Terrorism Subcommittee, told reporters last week when asked about concerns related to impeachment.  Another major event for US Capitol PoliceThis week also marks another major event for the US Capitol Police since the rally-turned-riot at the Capitol on January 6. In a YouTube video posted Friday, US Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said the department is working side by side with the National Guard during upcoming congressional events.  \"We have taken steps to ensure the operational tempo and the posture of the department conforms with the available intelligence,\" Pittman said in the video.  US Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment regarding security around the impeachment trial. Shell-shocked and angry: Inside the Capitol Police force a month after the deadly attackThe department approaches the trial with officers still nursing visible and invisible injuries.  According to Pittman, 125 officers were assaulted during the riot, leaving 70 injured. She noted some officers within the department are still struggling. Sources within US Capitol Police told CNN that following the riot they are physically and mentally exhausted and worried that leadership is not equipped to usher the department through the heightened threat environment. While several congressional sources agreed that they are not overwhelmingly concerned about threats specifically tied to the trial, there are varying opinions about how to address security around the Capitol and for lawmakers long term.  Federal and state officials have previously made clear that the increased security posture in the nation's capital will extend into March due to several concerns, including possible threats around the impeachment trial.  Capitol security officials are also looking at what the security posture should look like months after the trial, as Republicans and Democrats are already raising concerns about some of the precautions becoming permanent. The final assessment made by retired Lt Gen. Russel Honore, a former Army commander who has been tasked with conducting an independent review of security measures around the Capitol, will be factored into that decision, according to Pelosi, who has largely deflected when asked about changes to the Capitol security posture after the trial.  Proposal to build permanent fence around the Capitol meets resistance Asked about security around the impeachment trial, including additional protection for members and their families, a congressional aide echoed what Pelosi and her staff have said in recent weeks, telling CNN: \"Honore is looking into member security and will make recommendations about this that the House will review.\" \"I will say it will be interesting to know what the plan is longer term,\" Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, said last week. \"You know, the Michigan National Guard is back participating in protecting the Capitol right now, our National Guardsmen will not be here and should not be here forever. These gates and fences should not be here forever. So do we have a security situation that's better than January 6, especially given the hell that the Capitol Police has gone through as an organization since then? That's definitely something I'm interested in.\" Slotkin also told reporters her committee will be focused on addressing the threat of domestic terrorism \"writ large, not just against the Capitol, which of course is symbolic and important, but also in our local communities.\" CNN's Jeremy Herb, Josh Campbell and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)New satellite imagery obtained by CNN reveals North Korea has recently taken steps to conceal a facility US intelligence agencies believe is being used to store nuclear weapons, a move that could add to the growing sense of urgency from critics who argue the Biden administration needs to articulate a clear strategy on how it will deal with Kim Jong Un going forward.The image, captured by Maxar on February 11 and analyzed by experts at the Middlebury Institute, shows North Korea built new structures at its Yongdoktong site over the course of 2020 -- an effort researchers say is likely intended to obscure a pair of underground tunnel entrances that lead to the facility where nuclear weapons are stored. \"Images released by Maxar show the pair of tunnel entrances as late as December 2019 and a new building-like structure visible by February 2021,\" according to Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, which specializes in open-source intelligence.Yongdoktong has been previously identified by US intelligence as a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons storage facility and is still believed to be used for that purpose, a US intelligence official told CNN.Tunnel entrances seen on December 5, 2019.New structure over tunnel entrance on February 11, 2021The satellite images obtained by CNN reaffirm what has been widely known among US national security officials and experts for years: North Korea continues to actively develop nuclear weapons at sites around the country while taking further steps toward hiding the stockpile it has already accumulated. Read MoreRecent construction at the site will certainly catch the attention of US intelligence agencies as they carefully monitor sites suspected to be part of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, according to two former intelligence officials and congressional lawmakers. Lawmakers and key US allies are eagerly awaiting details about President Joe Biden's North Korea policy, which they expect will be announced publicly in the coming weeks when the administration has completed a policy review, according to multiple sources familiar with the internal discussions. The clear evidence North Korea's nuclear program is continuing adds to the urgency of the situation, with critics arguing that a policy review that goes on for too long risks developments occurring that will further complicate achieving the administration's goal of denuclearization.\"No matter how comical the effort, North Korea continues to upgrade its nuclear weapons facilities and makes efforts to conceal them,\" Lewis said, referring to the fact that US intelligence agencies have been watching the site for years. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon, citing intelligence matters, declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the new imagery. Biden mulls options as North Korea employs 'deception and denial'Beyond stressing a commitment to work alongside regional allies, the Biden administration has said little about its plans for engaging with North Korea during its first weeks in office, with top officials only offering vague statements reaffirming the US commitment to \"denuclearization\" but offering few specifics. \"The President's view is --- without question that North Korea's nuclear ballistic missile and other proliferation related activities constitutes serious threat to the international peace and security of the world and undermine the global non-proliferation regime,\" said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki last month.Rep. Andy Kim and other former US officials told CNN that they hope the Biden administration moves quickly to engage with North Korea before they conduct another missile test or take other provocative steps later this year that may make diplomacy more difficult. \"I think there's an opportunity for us to really push on a number of fronts ... and not just have everything live or die based off of denuclearization. I think that if we go down that route again, we will be hit with the same problems that we've had time and time again. I do hope the Biden team takes a different tack this point,\" Kim, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees, told CNN in a recent interview. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he still believes the Biden administration should continue to work towards a \"nuclear-free North Korea\" but acknowledged there are no easy answers as far as how to pursue that goal. \"Deposing Kim Jong Un is not realistic right now and it shouldn't be our state of policy. Korean reunification is probably not very realistic, so how do we prevent a nuclear war from breaking out or North Korea from using their supposed of nuclear capability as a way for leverage,\" he told CNN. Close up view of building over tunnel entrances. February 11, 2021Close up view of tunnel entrances before shelter. November 16, 2019 The timing of the movements at Yongdoktong is noteworthy but requires some examination because North Korea's actions can never be taken at face value, said a former senior US intelligence official. If North Korea is seeking to speed up engagement with the Biden administration and does not want to use a provocation like a missile test this move could be undertaken to catch the attention of the US. Former intelligence officials say recent efforts to obscure the view of American spy satellites could be intended to remind the Biden administration that work on these programs continues even as the White House deliberates on a diplomatic path forward.North Korea's tactic to try to use \"deception and denial\" is not something new, one former official explained. North Koreans are known to use the tactic to draw US attention to a matter, allow miscalculation, and deny that they are doing it.Biden team looks to increase pressure and use diplomacyWhile the details of Biden's plan for North Korea are being developed by the administration, the White House is not counting out the possibility of direct engagement down the line. Trump broke the mold when it comes to broaching the intractable challenge of North Korea. Instead of working in lockstep with US allies in the region, he prioritized developing a personal bond with Kim Jong Un. The leaders exchanged frequent letters and met in person three times. Yet, despite this unprecedented engagement, North Korea is more dangerous today than it was when Trump took office. As Biden's national security team begins to develop their North Korea policy, they will face the challenge of shaping a nuanced approach that rejuvenates a commitment to allies, avoids simply reverting back to the pre-Trump North Korea strategy characterized as \"strategic patience\" during the Obama administration, and can produce results on the ultimate goal of denuclearization.New satellite imagery shows activity at suspected North Korean nuclear facility Secretary of State Tony Blinken said the administration will both consider how to increase pressure on Pyongyang and how to draw them in with diplomacy, adding that nothing can be done without consulting with allies.\"We intend to review the entire approach in policy toward North Korea, because this is a hard problem that has plagued administration after administration after administration and it's a problem that has not gotten better. In fact, it's gotten worst,\" Blinken said during his confirmation hearing. He added that they will look at options \"that can be effective in terms of increasing pressure on North Korea to come to the negotiating table as well as what other diplomatic initiatives may be possible.\"Anthony Ruggiero, who previously served as the National Security Council Director for North Korea during the Trump administration, also said he believes the Biden administration can use sanctions as leverage for negotiations. \"Sanctions need to be at a level where it can provide leverage for negotiations. The sanctions toward the end of the Trump administration on North Korea were sporadic at best, and in some cases non-existent, so they do need to spend some time rebuilding some more of the pressure to allow productive negotiations,\" according to Ruggiero, who is currently a senior fellow at the Washington-based think-tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.The Biden administration is also expected to begin publicly speaking out against any future North Korean provocations unlike the approach in the latter part of the Trump administration, current and former administration officials tell CNN.Trump offered Kim Jong Un a ride home on Air Force One following Vietnam summit, source saysProvocations from North Korea, which traditionally mark the beginning of every administration, could be delayed due to the pandemic, former US officials told incoming Biden officials during transition meetings. They believe that the pandemic has put North Korea in a delicate position where it cannot afford further sanctions and cannot engage in diplomacy.But Kim Jong Un hates being out of the spotlight and it is likely that he will want to test the incoming team, making it virtually impossible to predict how the despot will act in the early days of Biden presidency. Some North Korea experts believe that the Biden administration should send a direct signal to North Korea to demonstrate willingness to engage, sooner rather than later. \"It is a moment of opportunity,\" said Gen. Vincent Brooks, a retired US Army general who commanded United States Forces Korea during the Trump administration. \"I hope they will seek communication early on. It may begin through backchannels first but there must be a conduit of communication directly to Kim Jong Un.\"",

According to the source, the crew picked up Tarrio from a DC jail the day before the riot and filmed all of his activities that day, including marching around the Capitol and a chance encounter with Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, who is facing federal charges, where the pair talked briefly.

        "content": "Washington (CNN)Nearly three weeks into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is still assessing the most effective way to get military aid into the country without triggering a wider war. While administration officials say the effort to provide Ukrainian forces with American-made weapons such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles has been largely successful, the White House is under intense pressure to do more. Specifically, both Congress and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have pressured Biden officials to help broker the transfer of heavier Soviet-made weaponry to Ukraine, including MiG fighter jets and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. It's a message that Zelensky could echo on Wednesday when he addresses Congress.  Putin's inhumanity sharpens Biden's historic dilemmaBut so far the Biden administration has not helped provide those heavier, Soviet-made weapons systems. US officials continue to grapple with concerns about how Russia might respond if certain weapons transfers are approved. Officials have also raised questions about how useful MiG fighters would be, and whether they are worth the risk.The State Department has been working to identify which countries currently have the Soviet-made S-300 air defense systems and is examining how they could be transferred to Ukraine, sources said. But it remains unclear how the US would backfill those countries' supplies of surface-to-air missiles, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.Read MoreA similar problem arose last week, when Poland indicated it would be willing to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the US telling Poland it would be unable to backfill the jets quickly.But a Republican Senate aide told CNN on Monday that Congress had solved that problem for the White House when it passed a long-delayed $1.5 trillion spending bill last week. That package included more than $13 billion in money to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including funding to directly backfill allies and partners who have delivered weapons to Ukraine from their own stocks.\"That's where we should urge the administration to work with allies and partners, not just in Europe but potentially around the globe, who are in a position to deliver more munitions for things like the S-300 or other advanced air defense systems that we can work with to backfill their own capabilities,\" the aide added.Top House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to the State and Defense departments on Tuesday calling on the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with Soviet-made air defense systems and fighter jets.The lawmakers said that the new funding Congress approved in an emergency supplemental should be used to deliver the military aid to the Ukrainians and help reimburse US allies who have also provided equipment and depleted their own stocks.Lack of visibilityAlmost all of the $350 million in weapons the Biden administration approved for Ukraine in late February have been delivered, according to multiple sources familiar with the status of the arms shipments. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved an additional $200 million military aid package for Ukraine, which includes more Javelin and Stinger missiles, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Smoke rises from a Russian tank destroyed by the Ukrainian forces on the side of a road in Lugansk region on February 26, 2022. US officials have told Congress that the weapons they are sending to Ukraine are getting where they are supposed to go, according to sources familiar with the matter. But two sources tell CNN that the NATO alliance has very little idea what percentage of the military assistance is actually getting into the hands of Ukrainian forces after it crosses NATO and European territory.NATO doesn't know because, deliberately, these shipments are being arranged by countries bilaterally -- directly with Ukraine -- and not through the alliance, the sources said. Nations have been told not to discuss with one another what they are sending and how. This is partly for security reasons, because Western officials don't want Russians to target the convoys, and informing the 30-country bloc of the transit points would increase the risk of such information leaking. But it also allows NATO to credibly say that as a bloc, it is not providing lethal assistance to Ukraine.Weekend strikeJUST WATCHEDStriking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are deadReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHStriking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are dead 01:01Funneling weapons into Ukraine may also prove to be more complicated going forward as the Kremlin made clear over the weekend that Russian forces will now target US shipments flowing into the country.That warning, coupled with Russia's recent strike on a military base in western Ukraine, is raising concerns about Moscow's willingness to target aid shipments crossing the border from neighboring countries. NATO still does not believe, however, that Russia would target shipments still inside NATO or European Union member countries.Targeting arms shipments would be difficult for Russia, a source familiar with the intelligence added. It would need exact information on when and where the shipments are entering the country -- and have to cope with the added challenge that many are likely being transported under cover of darkness.Dozens killed as Russian forces strike targets in western UkraineStill, the strike appeared to be part of a messaging campaign by Russia, the source said, warning the West against continuing its military assistance to Ukraine. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the base was not being used as a transit point for shipments of weapons and US efforts to provide security assistance were not disrupted. But a second NATO source told CNN that the strike was concerning to the bloc, due to its proximity to Western countries that are sending materials into Ukraine.With the latest strike \"it certainly appears as if the Russians are broadening their target set,\" Kirby added, noting the weekend attack is just the latest sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only sending a message about shipments of weapons into the country but also that he \"clearly has the occupation of Ukraine in mind.\"As a result, the Biden administration now faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ways to expedite weapons shipments to Ukraine and address another concerted push by lawmakers to provide additional defense capabilities, including the S-300.Pressure from the HillIn the meantime, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are urging the Biden administration to step up its efforts to deliver more weapons to Ukraine. On Monday, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, told CNN he got an earful from Ukrainian American constituents this past weekend over the Biden administration's decision to oppose providing Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine. \"I went to a rally yesterday where that was the number one issue with the Ukrainian Americans, to give back the skies to the people of Ukraine and stop it,\" Durbin said. \"And I had to think in the context, as President Biden said in Philadelphia and said to us here in Washington, he doesn't want to risk world war III. It's a terrible, terrible decision that he faces, but I'm going to stand by him and work with him to do the right thing.\"US officials eye Russian reliance on unsophisticated but brutal heavy weaponry in UkraineOne lawmaker said the public attention in Congress pushing for the Polish MiG-29 jets has been misplaced, arguing that Ukraine already has planes it isn't flying, it doesn't have enough pilots to fly more planes and the country's runways have been damaged by Russian attacks. \"The controversy over the MiGs is a classic case of Congress focusing on the shiny object instead of what will actually matter,\" the lawmaker said. \"The things that will really matter are the S-300s, SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) and drones. DoD is looking at ways to get them from allies, since we don't have any we can give directly.\"Senators have been publicly pushing for the Biden administration to change course on the Polish fighter jets since the opposition was announced last week. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who was in Poland on Sunday on a congressional trip just miles from the Ukrainian border, pushed back on the notion that the MiG-29 fighters would cause an escalation with Russia during an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I don't know why that would be true,\" Portman said. \"You know, the Russians have complained about everything. Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes.\"  Pressure is mounting for the Biden administraion to find a way to provide Ukraine with S-300 air defense systemsBut Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said the plan to provide Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets \"would not be effective.\" \"They already have approximately 30 aircraft. They have problems with maintaining and flying those aircraft,\" Reed said. \"The real advantage would be to move in air defense missiles, which I hope they will do, because particularly some of the older ones, Soviet-era, they understand how to use them, since they've trained on them.\"Operational security concernsThe source familiar with the intelligence also told CNN that providing MiG fighter jets does not make a lot of operational sense. The aircraft present a big target and they are hard to move, which creates a myriad of logistical, operational and security problems.Here's how we know sanctions are hurting RussiaThere are also operational security concerns around disclosing details about shipments of weapons to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, who told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon is being very \"careful and cautious about talking about this.\"\"We haven't put out specifics on the inventory. There are certain systems we still have not acknowledged ... that they're getting. We don't give out numbers, we don't give out timing of the shipments, we don't provide context on the locations or the ground routes on which it's arriving, because we want to keep that security assistance flowing as much and as fast as it can to assist them in the fight,\" the official said.This story has been updated.CNN's Ellie Kaufman, Manu Raju and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned Russia for killing civilians in Ukraine, raising the idea that Russia should be kicked off the United Nations Human Rights Council during a speech before the council Tuesday morning.Blinken told the UN Human Rights Council that Russian strikes \"are hitting schools, hospitals and residential buildings.\"\"They are destroying critical infrastructure, which provides millions of people across Ukraine with drinking water, gas to keep them from freezing to death, and electricity,\" Blinken said. \"Civilian buses, cars, and even ambulances have been shelled. Russia is doing this every day -- across Ukraine.\" The remarks by the top US diplomat come after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of war crimes for bombing the city of Kharkiv. Over the past two days, Russian attacks have hit civilians, suggesting a shift towards a far more aggressive bombing campaign. Earlier Russian attacks were more focused on military targets.Read MoreUS intelligence agencies make understanding Vladimir Putin's state of mind a top priorityOn Tuesday, at least 10 people were killed and 35 injured in rocket strikes by Russian forces on the center of Kharkiv, according to Ukraine's Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko.

The UN says that at least 102 civilians have been killed across the country and 304 injured, though those figures are likely to underestimate the true toll.A senior US defense official said the Russian military is showing signs of being risk averse with its own troops, but they're not with civilians, noting the Russian defense ministry was openly admitting it would target Ukrainian government infrastructure in Kyiv.\"We can't say definitively that they are deliberately targeting civilian population areas or civilians. We can't prove that,\" the official said Tuesday. \"But they certainly are not as risk averse when it comes to the impact they're having on the civilian population as they seem to be with their own troops.\"The UN Human Rights Council is made of up 47 member states elected by the UN general assembly, and Russia is one of the countries on the council.\"One can reasonably ask whether a UN member state that tries to take over another UN member state -- while committing horrific human rights abuses and causing massive humanitarian suffering -- should be allowed to remain on this Council,\" Blinken said.Blinken also criticized countries such as China who have not clearly stated that Russia is the sole perpetrator of this crisis.   Kyiv hit with rockets near TV tower hours after Russia threatened 'high-precision' strikes\"Council members should stop using language implying that all sides bear equal responsibility for the unprovoked attack of one side,\" he said. \"This isn't evenhanded -- it's wrong -- and fails to place accountability where it belongs. The same goes for members who argue, falsely, that denouncing human rights abuses is 'politicizing' the situation. It is failing to speak up about human rights abuses that politicizes the situation.\" Blinken challenged the UNHRC to come together to try and prevent an even more deadly war.   \"These are the human rights abuses this Council was created to stop. If we cannot come together now, when will we come together?\" Blinken asked.Zelensky also made an impassioned plea Tuesday for European leaders to \"prove\" their solidarity with his country.\"We are fighting for our life,\" he said in a speech to the EU Parliament earlier on Tuesday.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The US intelligence community has made evaluating Russian President Vladimir Putin's state of mind a top priority in recent days as it seeks to establish how that is affecting his handling of the rapidly escalating Ukraine crisis, according to two sources familiar with the effort.The efforts come as longtime Putin-watchers have publicly speculated that his behavior has become increasingly erratic and irrational. Since he launched Russia's invasion of Ukraine last Wednesday, senior US officials have asked intelligence agencies to gather any new information they can on how the Russian leader is faring and how his mindset has been impacted by the unexpectedly unified and tough response from European neighbors and allies around the world.The US intelligence community has spent decades decoding the former KGB officer, who has effectively ruled Russia since 1999. But while the United States has tremendous institutional knowledge of the man, it has a notoriously poor view into his day-to-day decision-making. The Kremlin remains what intelligence officials call a \"hard target\" -- incredibly difficult to penetrate through traditional espionage. There has not been any new comprehensive assessment that indicates a particular change to Putin's overall health, said one US official. And officials have been on guard for the possibility that Putin's strategy may well be to project instability, in an attempt to push the US and allies to give him what he wants for fear that he could do worse. Biden hoped to spark a political reset at home with his first State of the Union address. A war in Europe changed those plans.But the sudden burst of interest reflects a sense among some intelligence officials that Putin's decision-making in Ukraine has been out of character -- perhaps due to what some previous intelligence reports suggest has been protracted isolation during the Covid-19 pandemic.Read More\"Everything US has [is] in [the] realm of conjecture because Putin's decisions and statements don't seem to be making sense,\" said one source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic. \"For years, decades Putin has acted according to a pretty specific template.\"In a classified briefing for lawmakers on Monday evening, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, said the US intelligence community does not have good insight into Putin's state of mind, according to a lawmaker who was present. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who attended the Senate briefing, confirmed that Putin's state of mind had come up, but he declined to elaborate on what had been shared.He did say, however, that regardless of the briefing, he personally is worried about Putin's mindset.Scores of raw intelligence reportsThe intelligence community has produced scores of raw intelligence reports from sources as information pours in about the war. One such report that has circulated to more than a dozen agencies cites a source who has relayed that Putin's behavior has become \"highly concerning and unpredictable\" over just the last two days, according to a copy obtained by CNN.But in an indication of how difficult this information is to obtain directly, the description came secondhand to the FBI from a source who had talked to another, unknown source \"with excellent access.\" The report notes that this person had in the past provided information that intelligence agencies were able to independently corroborate.   The source behind the report told the FBI that Putin \"expressed extreme anger\" over Western sanctions put in place in response to his attack on Ukraine and \"felt that the sanctions had escalated the situation faster than he expected and beyond what he considered to be appropriate.\" Precisely which sanctions so infuriated Putin is unknown; that portion of the report is redacted.What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explainedThe report also notes that the circulation of accurate information about the war has been extremely limited within Russia, even at the highest levels of society.For example, many people and well-connected individuals with the means to leave Russia before airports and borders were closed have remained in the country, according to the report -- suggesting that they had not known about the closures in advance.  The report, which originated from the FBI, comes with some caveats: It acknowledges that the source who provided the information to the FBI \"may have provided the information to influence and inform\" US decision-making -- in other words, that it might be an information operation designed to manipulate the United States.And officials caution that raw intelligence should not be taken as fact. It has not been evaluated for reliability or analyzed for its implications. But the report has nevertheless caused other agencies inside the Biden administration to ask the FBI to follow up with its source for additional information. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA and the FBI declined to comment. A long historySpeculation about Putin's mental health began after he gave a speech on Thursday laying out a warped, revisionist history that purported to justify his intervention in Ukraine. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, tweeted on Friday that Putin \"has always been a killer, but his problem now is different & significant\" -- and suggested he was basing his assessment on intelligence briefings given to him as the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  \"I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it's pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin,\" Rubio wrote. \"It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago.\"For some, the boldness of Putin's decision to invade -- as well as his implied threat to use nuclear weapons -- is a break with the carefully calculated and far more limited military campaigns he has launched in the past. Video footage of the Russian President seated dozens of feet away from his senior military advisers during meetings and gleefully dressing down one of his spy chiefs on television have only underscored the image of an isolated leader, acting on his own counsel alone.US officials fear the worst is yet to come for KyivBy Sunday, the floodgates had opened. Former Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted that Putin had \"changed,\" and sounded \"completely disconnected from reality\" and \"unhinged.\" Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, who is a national security analyst at CNN, also called Putin \"unhinged\" and warned, \"I worry about his acuity and balance.\"  Other longtime Putin watchers argue that the Russian President's recent actions are relatively consistent with the man US intelligence has fixated on for decades, noting that he has long demonstrated a willingness to risk military defeat in operations that the United States thought offered no chance of success -- including ordering a second invasion of Chechnya in 1999, just three years after the Russian military had already been defeated there once.  \"This is not different than anything he's said before, he's just saying it all at once in a very stark way. And he's willing to do unspeakable things -- but he's always been willing to do unspeakable things,\" said Beth Sanner, a former briefer to then-President Donald Trump and a CNN national security analyst.Putin isn't \"insane or unhinged,\" Sanner said. Rather, she said, he is \"highly emotional right now because of what he was about to embark upon ... and he has been very, very isolated, which adds to that emotional sense. But I don't think he's crazy.\"One US official echoed that assessment to CNN, arguing that Putin is acting in a way that he has long signaled he was capable of. Rather than a change in his mental acuity, this person said, officials believe he's simply become enraged -- making it impossible for his senior advisers to give him frank assessments. Russia faces financial meltdown as sanctions slam its economyEven his command to put Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on high alert Sunday isn't unprecedented. In 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea, he also raised the possibility he might put his nuclear forces on high alert, which then as now raised the specter of nuclear weapons being introduced into the conflict. Russia's nuclear doctrine, published in 2020, also includes a first-use nuclear policy. The Kremlin \"reserves the right to use nuclear weapons,\" including \"for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies.\" Still, a source familiar with recent intelligence reporting on the topic said, it is \"difficult to achieve conclusion of any confidence regarding Putin's state of mind. Would need SIGINT of phone call/video of leader losing it on his cabinet or something like that.\"SIGINT, or \"signals intelligence,\" is an intelligence community term that refers to intercepted communications.\"Real-time communication between Russian cabinet leaders,\" this person said, is a \"very hard target.\"Ultimately, this official and others say, understanding Putin's recent behavior is a matter of analysis -- not intelligence. It's possible, officials say, that they may never have an answer. CNN's Kylie Atwood and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington (CNN)The Department of Homeland Security Inspector General is being investigated as part of a newly revealed probe looking into allegations of retaliation, according to documents shared with CNN.Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, who is responsible for oversight of DHS, is under scrutiny by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, a federal government umbrella group tasked with fielding allegations made against an inspector general. The probe stems from accusations of retaliation related to the authorization of an independent report by law firm WilmerHale that was concluded in late 2020 following complaints of unprofessional behavior by several top Homeland Security officials. Chronic leadership problems have plagued oversight of DHS inspector general's office, GAO finds Additional details about the CIGIE investigation, including its precise origins and who brought the complaint, have not been made publicly available.Cuffari, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, had a tumultuous start at DHS, and has been occasionally accused of looking the other way for political reasons regarding actions that involved the former administration, which he vehemently disputes.Early in his tenure, personnel issues plagued the inspector general's office, leading Cuffari's office to enlist the help of an outside law firm.Read MoreIn late 2020, WilmerHale completed its independent investigation into allegations that several senior employees engaged in an assortment of unprofessional behavior \"that was designed to undermine and contravene the authority of the two Inspector Generals (IGs) to whom they reported at DHS OIG from late 2017 to 2020.\"The heavily redacted report found an \"atmosphere of mistrust and unprofessionalism\" within the office and concluded: \"Their efforts created a culture of fear and retribution within the agency directed at employees deemed insufficiently loyal.\"Sometime after that, the CIGIE investigation was launched, and Cuffari said he was notified about it last spring, according to a written response to the House Homeland Security Committee in June that was obtained by the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), a nongovernmental organization that investigates government corruption and abuse of power.Two weeks ago, a top deputy in Cuffari's office sent an email to the workforce directing all staff to comply with the investigation.  Leaked audio and video show Border Patrol agents confronting Homeland Security secretary at meetings \"DHS OIG has been cooperating fully in the IC's investigation, and it will continue to do so. You are instructed to cooperate if you are approached by the assisting IG in this matter and are asked to provide records, documents, information, or testimony,\" Glenn E. Sklar, principal deputy inspector general, wrote to all employees in an email obtained by POGO and shared with CNN.  A DHS Office of Inspector General spokesperson said the office does not comment on pending investigations. CIGIE also declined to comment. Last April, Cuffari said he had \"worked diligently\" to build a senior leadership team and \"address the issues that have plagued our office.\"\"Our ship is heading in the right direction,\" he said at the time.The timeline of this investigation is unclear, but investigations are supposed to be completed within 150 days from the time its referred. Once completed, the watchdog submits a report and recommendation to the head of the agency, along with copies of its report to the relevant congressional committees of jurisdiction, the subject of the investigation and others. In a statement to CNN, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said he has \"longstanding concerns with the ability of the DHS Office of Inspector General to effectively fulfill its mission, due in part to persistent problems among its leadership. CIGIE's investigation appears to indicate further cause for concern.\"\"I urge full and swift cooperation with this investigation,\" he wrote. A congressional source told CNN there have been some steps towards progress at the inspector general office, but it's still early to see if they can make all the necessary changes, noting high turnover and outstanding recommendations for the office. In his June response to the top lawmakers on the House committee, Cuffari said CIGIE is \"trying to erase the historical record compiled by WilmerHale\" and \"attempting to undermine\" his attempts to \"clean up\" the Office of Inspector General.  \"I have never heard anyone dispute the findings that WilmerHale made after a comprehensive independent investigation carried out according to the highest standards,\" he wrote.  Cuffari added that, \"Sweeping WilmerHale's findings under the rug, as the CIGIE IC is attempting to do, will destroy DHS OIG.\"Both Cuffari and the DHS Office of Inspector General, predating his tenure, have been embroiled in controversies going back years, all while managing the day-to-day business of government oversight for a department of more than 240,000 employees, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the US Secret Service.Cuffari has previously told lawmakers that any suggestion that he \"pulled punches\" for political reasons is a \"complete falsehood.\"",

Navarro is just the latest former Trump official to be subpoenaed by the committee in its sweeping investigation but, like others, it remains to be seen if the panel will ultimately succeed in compelling his testimony. In its subpoena letter, the panel said it wants to speak to Navarro because of press reports that suggest Navarro worked with Trump ally and adviser Stephen Bannon, among others, to help develop a plan to delay the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appearThe panel also cited lines from Navarro's new book where he calls the plan to delay and change the outcome of the election as \"the Green Bay Sweep,\" and describes the effort as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\"In response to the subpoena, Navarro told CNN that the committee must negotiate his potential appearance with Trump's attorneys, claiming like others who have resisted subpoenas that the former President has asserted privilege.Read MoreNavarro has also said in the press that Trump was \"on board with the strategy\" along with \"more than 100\" members of Congress, which the panel also cited in its subpoena letter. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the panel, said in a statement with the release of the subpoena letter. \"He hasn't been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former President's support for those plans.\"In calling for Navarro's cooperation, Thompson stated that more than 500 witnesses have already cooperated with the panel's investigation.Navarro maintains in his new book that he was among the \"last three people on God's green earth who wanted to see violence erupt\" on January 6 -- counting himself among the likes of Trump and Bannon. Bannon has been indicted on criminal contempt of Congress charges after refusing to cooperate with the committee.Navarro, meanwhile, appeared on Bannon's podcast this week to criticize former Vice President Mike Pence for saying Trump was wrong to claim Pence had the authority to overturn the 2020 election.During that appearance, Navarro blasted Pence as \"never a pure Trump guy\" and \"the prisoner of Marc Short,\" a longtime Pence confidant and the former vice president's chief of staff who recently appeared before the House committee.\"Mike, you are dead politically,\" said Navarro, who has been a vocal champion of Trump's election lies.This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.CNN's Paula Reid contributed to this report.",

Herren -- then one of the most highly anticipated freshmen basketball players in the country -- left BC after only one game after a positive test for cocaine.Maybe it could have come a few years later, after he had transferred to Fresno State. Just days after one of the most brilliant games of his college career, he announced to a national audience at a news conference that he had once again failed a drug test. Or maybe rock bottom came in 2001, when Herren's family and friends joined the packed crowd at Boston's Fleet Center to witness Herren fulfill his childhood dream of playing for the Boston Celtics. Even though he was in the starting lineup, Herren was nowhere to be found among the players warming up on the fabled parquet floor.  JUST WATCHED'Basketball junkie' shares story of lossReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'Basketball junkie' shares story of loss 07:04JUST WATCHEDExplain it to me: AddictionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHExplain it to me: Addiction 03:11JUST WATCHEDAddict: 'I don't have a stop button'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAddict: 'I don't have a stop button' 04:13JUST WATCHEDHouston's death called teachable momentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHouston's death called teachable moment 02:04Instead, he stood in full uniform outside the Fleet Center in the pouring rain, waiting on a dealer just moments before the game. Herren shot heroin into his veins before his mother's funeral, bailed on his wife and newborn son in the hospital to get drunk, and even had to be brought back to life once after an overdose. But it wasn't any one of these moments that finally motivated him to get the treatment he needed to overcome his addiction. Herren did not have one singular moment of rock bottom. \"Addiction is rock bottom\" he said in a recent interview. \"I had 14 years of rock bottom.\"Now three-and-a-half years sober, Herren looks back at those dark moments of his life with glib honesty and an almost macabre sense of gratefulness.Making that buy on a street corner in his Celtics uniform? \"Just another normal day in the life of an addict,\" he said. Using heroin before a game? \"I couldn't play without it in my system.\" The overdose that almost killed him? \"It was a blessing.\" Burying his mother while he was on heroin? \"When I tell the story about getting high before my mother's funeral -- the looks of disgust people give me -- those looks mean everything to me now.\"Opinion: Addiction is not hopelessHerren said those looks of disgust help him stay on the straight and narrow because he had never before been on the receiving end of such confrontational shows of disapproval. No one had ever looked him in the eye and told him what he already knew: that he was a junkie. \"I used to tell myself that I was no good all of the time,\" he said. \"But it's much harder to look someone else in the eye and say the same thing.\"Chris Herren, center, launched a basketball clinic for kids the year after he got clean.When Herren was finally ready to dedicate himself to getting clean in 2008, he was met with a new challenge, one as daunting as kicking heroin, and one that he says helps perpetuate the cycle of addiction: the cost of effective treatment. \"Unless you have the very best insurance, you'll only get eight or nine days,\" he said. \"You can't expect someone to run the streets for 10 years and come out clean in 10 days.\" Herren knew effective treatment for him was going to need to last more than 10 days, and because he squandered all of his earnings to feed his addiction over the years, he also knew there was no way he could afford to overcome it himself. That's when Chris Mullin, his friend and former NBA mentor, emerged to give Herren the assist of a lifetime. Mullin, a Hall of Famer and a recovering alcoholic, arranged for Herren to spend nine months getting clean in the type of intensive rehabilitation that he knew Herren needed so badly. Although Herren still doesn't know exactly how Mullin made that happen, he is sure of one thing: \"If it weren't for Chris Mullin and his family, I probably wouldn't be here.\"  It was his inability to access effective treatment, combined with his desire to repay Mullin's kindness, that inspired Herren to launch his own nonprofit in 2011.  In one year, the Herren Project has already privately paid for more than 100 addicts to receive the treatment they otherwise could never have afforded on their own.Read more about addictionEffective treatment doesn't come cheap.  At Gosnold on Cape Cod, a place where Herren spent three of his nine months in recovery, treatment runs $17,500 a month, according to Gosnold CEO Raymond Tamasi.Herren is shown with his wife of 14 years, Heather, and their three children.But that doesn't deter Herren, who says that \"for some cases, we've paid for three months if it's needed.\" As part of his work with his foundation, Herren crisscrosses the country, visiting high schools, colleges and prisons to tell his raw and jarring tale. In 2011, ESPN Films wove together scenes from those assemblies for a documentary about him called \"Unguarded\" that chronicled his rise and fall from stardom amid his descent and emergence from the abyss of addiction.  That same year, Herren wrote \"Basketball Junkie,\" a memoir in which he refuses to spare readers a single anguishing detail about his harrowing journey.But if anyone thinks Herren wasted his talent or his life, he doesn't see it that way. \"People come up to me now and pity me, they call me a 'poor thing,' \" he said. \"I was a 'poor thing' for 14 years. My life is second to none now.\"  That life is in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, these days, where Herren, 36, spends his days marveling over the routine tasks of waking his children up for school every morning and putting them to bed every night -- a ritual he calls his proudest achievement. He also spends a lot of his time at a nearby gym, running his eponymous basketball clinics for boys and girls of all skill levels. Here is where Herren's life has come full circle. He spent 14 years using basketball to fuel his addiction. Today, his basketball clinics also have another purpose, this time a positive one: It might look like he is teaching kids the mechanics of a jump shot, or a pick-n-roll, or a full-court press, but what he is really doing is teaching them to discover their self-esteem.  And that's something Herren didn't get around to doing for himself until he got sober.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThere's an art to giving the perfect wedding toast and a whole lot of pitfalls as wellDon't: Try out your poetic stylings, use blue language or get too in-jokeyDo: Keep it short, sweet and from the heartAt the end of the wedding day, it's all about the couple, so let your toast reflect thatWhen Bill Murray delivered an impromptu toast to a rowdy bachelor party in Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend, he gave poignant and charming advice for everyone but the groom. If you \"have someone that you think is the one,\" he said, \"and travel around the world ... if when you come back ... you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.\"Murray's remarks were rewarded with thunderous applause, shouting and an \"Amen\" from one of the party-goers. As far as toasts go, he nailed it.   Delivering the perfect toast is a skill honed over time and with practice -- which is unfortunate, since you'll probably be tapped for this honor on only a few occasions over your lifetime.  Even more unfortunately, nothing can bring a wedding reception or rehearsal dinner to a grinding halt quite like a bad toast. We have both have been part of more wedding parties than we care to remember (and thanks to Champagne and open bars, more than we are able to remember). When it comes to the toast, we've seen them all: a few triumphs, some that were simply unremarkable and forgettable, and a lot of bombs. The types of best men and maids of honor are varied, but they all seem to fall into familiar categories -- as do the pitfalls of the toast they deliver. You've probably seen some of these yourself, and you might even be one of the offenders:   The Frat BroKevin Conlon delivers a wedding toast.Probably the only time you'll be exposed to these toasts will be at weddings occurring soon after college. This toast is easily recognized by the exclamations of \"dude!\" peppered throughout as well as the inappropriate recalling of drunken tales from freshman year.The Safety in NumbersPublic speaking is nerve-wracking, we get it.  But calling for reinforcements usually just highlights the disparity between speakers and winds up being a game of hot potato of bridesmaids passing the microphone back and forth awkwardly.  Go it alone, or don't go it all.The Edgar Allen NOPoems can be cute and poems can be cool, but giggling through a poem -- and proving you know how to rhyme -- only makes you sound like a tool.The Edgar Allen No/Safety in Numbers ComboStephanie Gallman toasts the bride.What's worse than a nervous bridesmaid giggling through a poem?  Two of them doing so as they alternate stanzas. Passing a piece of paper back and forth is distracting, and no matter how thoughtful the written message, it will be lost in the delivery.The Inside JokerThe inside joker doesn't seem to get that inside jokes work only for those who are in on the joke. Rule: If you have to say \"I guess you had to be there,\" then I guess you should leave it out.The Overly EmotionalThis \"always a bridesmaid, never a bride\" feels like she's losing her best friend while wearing a hideous dress and being reminded that she's nowhere close to walking down the aisle herself. She's understandably emotional but wants to uncomfortably choke through her remarks to let everyone know how incredibly happy she is for her friend. The Amateur ComedianDon't mistake the role of toast-giver for Roast Master General. You are not going to be discovered or tapped for \"Saturday Night Live\" based on your performance, so save the comedy routine for open-mic night. (Is this thing on?)The Wildly InappropriateNo blue language in front of anyone's GamGam, fellas. You're in a tuxedo, for crying out loud, so keep it classy. And whatever you do, don't get drunk beforehand. Need a little liquid courage to take the edge off? Fine, but know your limit. The bar will still be open afterward.So how do you avoid becoming one of these offenders?  Consider these \"do's\" and \"don'ts,\" and you can't go wrong: DO understand what is expected of youJUST WATCHEDKim Kardashian and Kanye West say I doReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKim Kardashian and Kanye West say I do 01:16 Photos: Photos: How not to act at a wedding   Photos: Photos: How not to act at a wedding  Movie wedding guests behaving badly \u2013 Everyone loves a good wedding movie -- especially when the guests are behaving terribly.

Find out before you arrive to each wedding function what your friends are expecting of you so that you can prepare ahead of time.  Ask the wedding planner or deejay if there will be a podium or a microphone so you can plan accordingly.DO keep it simple (and short)Remember, it's a toast, not a speech.  Speeches are for politicians and football coaches. Wedding toasts are short and sweet ways to honor others in a thoughtful but concise fashion. How do you pack in enough thoughtfulness and personality without lulling the room to sleep? Read on.DON'T be afraid to be creativeAnd if you are thinking that means a poem, see above.  Ideally, you'll want to tell a quick story or anecdote involving the people getting married. Don't have a sweet or funny one? Don't have one at all? Then exercise some creative license and go ahead and embellish if you need to; no one will fact check you.  It's the sentiment that's important.       DON'T read straight from notesReading straight from a script is unengaging, and you should be more thoughtful to the person who thought enough of you to tap you for this honor. If you aren't looking up at your audience, attention will quickly turn elsewhere, most likely to a plate of tough chicken or a wine glass. If having a piece of paper with bullet points helps calm your nerves, fine, but speak from the heart and directly to the happy couple, and you can't go wrong.DON'T announce how nervous you areWhat's the point of that?  If you are nervous, the heavy breathing, stammering and sweating will make that obvious enough -- saying it won't serve any purpose other than to tell the audience, \"This is going to suck. I apologize in advance.\" It takes the focus away from the couple and puts it on you -- and it's not about you.DO acknowledge the parents of both partiesThey're probably paying for that top-shelf bourbon you're headed straight for right after you're done.    DON'T be so specificDon't get tripped up on trivial details. Saying \"our friendship dates all the way back to 2007\" triggers calculations and runs the risk of eliciting a \"I've had relationships with bunions longer than you two\" from a cantankerous uncle. Quantifying or qualifying your relationship for the sake others serves no purpose; obviously, you are close to the betrothed. You wouldn't be up there if you weren't.DO speak slowly and enunciateWhen you are nervous, words come out a lot faster than you realize, and if people can't understand you, they are going to tune out.DO let moments breatheWhether they're laughs, applause or \"awwwwws,\" let them marinate for a few moments before moving on to your next line. Doing this will not only let what you just said to soak in, it will give you a second or two to glance down at your cheat sheet.DON'T be afraid to call an audibleNo matter how much you plan and practice, no matter how you think your toast is going to go ahead of time, there can always be circumstances beyond your control that you simply must embrace. Maybe the weather didn't cooperate, maybe a mother-in-law fainted, maybe the minister's fly was down during the ceremony. No matter what it is, be nimble enough to adjust as needed.At the end of the wedding day, no matter how nervous you are, think about this: It's nothing compared to what your buddy is going through. Years of Pinterest-pinning preparation, saving, spending, intra-family bickering, meetings, fittings and tastings have all been endured for this one day. People have traveled from far and wide to be there for them, to celebrate the happy couple. No one goes to a wedding because of who is giving the toast. When you look at it that way, your task becomes simple -- so don't screw it up.Got a formula for the perfect toast? We'd love to hear it in the comments below.",

The El Paso-based shelter is a frequent stopping point for migrants who've been released from government custody. Migrants who'd been held under the bridge told staff there they'd been held from three to five days and \"treated worse than dogs,\" Levy said.Photos and videos from the scene appeared to show migrant families sitting and at times sleeping on the gravel, with only thin space blankets between them and the ground.Read MoreUS authorities have drawn criticism for holding groups of migrants awaiting processing -- including children -- underneath the Paso Del Norte Bridge in El Paso.\"It was horrible there, because we slept under the bridge on top of the gravel,\" said Bartolo Tadeo G\u00f3mez, 25, who spent four nights under the bridge with his 7-year-old son. \"There was a lot of dust.\"They struggled to stay warm without blankets, he said. And the whole time, Tadeo said, he worried about his son, who seemed sick and wasn't eating. \"I was afraid he would die,\" Tadeo told CNN.Last week, US authorities said a rapid influx of migrants crossing the border forced them to use the space under the Paso del Norte border bridge as an emergency measure in the face of a humanitarian crisis. They described a tent set up under the bridge as a \"transitional shelter\" for migrants who had yet to be processed.CBP officials say caring for those in custody with dignity and respect is a paramount concern. Advocates accuse CBP officials of worsening the humanitarian crisis at the border, rather than helping it.Over the weekend, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint over the practice, calling it \"extreme and unprecedented.\"And the move also drew sharp criticism from the head of the Border Patrol's union, who called it \"flat-out wrong.\"Here's a look at the latest developments:The ACLU is calling for an investigationThe ACLU filed a complaint with Department of Homeland Security and CBP officials over the weekend, calling for the DHS inspector general to investigate what occurred and why.\"The detention of migrants for multiple nights in outdoor detention pens is an unprecedented and extreme violation,\" the complaint says. \"Although CBP has long violated the rights of migrants in its custody, the agency's decision to detain migrants, including children, in caged dirt filled outdoor areas is an escalation of this administration's cruelty. Without immediate attention and oversight, we will continue to risk the lives of those seeking refuge in our country.\"Other advocacy groups have raised concerns.On Sunday, Levy tweeted a photo that she said showed a 5-year-old's chapped hands. these are the bloody & chapped hands of a 5-yr-old child who spent 3.5 days detained by CBP under the bridge in El Paso, TX this past week. her 6-yr-old still has bruises from sleeping on the gravel. pic.twitter.com/jCIs1iZNjH\u2014 Taylor Levy (@taylorklevy) March 31, 2019\n\nAsked about the ACLU's complaint and allegations of children with bruises, a CBP spokesman said the agency is doing everything it can to deal with a humanitarian crisis that only Congress can solve.\"The care of those in our custody is paramount,\" CBP Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs Andrew Meehan said in a statement. \"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the United States Border Patrol (USBP) are devoted to the care and processing of the individuals in our custody with the utmost dignity and respect.\" For days, CBP officials have been defending the decision to hold migrants under the bridge.In a statement released to CNN El Paso affiliate KFOX, the Border Patrol said:\"The tent that is set up underneath the Paso Del Norte port of entry and adjacent to the Border Patrol's Processing Facility is a transitional shelter. Due to the large volume of apprehensions within the El Paso Station's Area of Responsibility, the agency has undertaken additional measures to facilitate processing. As illegal aliens arrive at the processing facility, they are placed at the 'tent' to await their turn to be processed. This tent serves only as a transitional shelter and is not a temporary housing facility. It was established within the last month.\"CBP described the area under the bridge as a \"transitional shelter.\"The Border Patrol union chief says the practice was 'flat-out wrong'National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd called the decision to detain migrants under the bridge \"flat-out wrong.\" He referred to the recent death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal in CBP custody.\"After what happened with Jakelin, you would have thought that this would have never happened again,\" he told CNN. \"You can't do that in my opinion.\"\"It's one thing to have overcrowding indoors, which is bad enough,\" he continued, \"but outside, in inclement weather, in my opinion that's just wrong.\"Jakelin died in December from a bacterial infection known as streptococcal sepsis, two days after she and her father were detained.  Advocates have raised questions about her care. The CPB said agents and emergency responders \"did everything in their power\" to treat the Guatemalan girl before she was hospitalized.Where are the migrants now?Some migrants have been released from custody, according to Annunciation House, and are starting to share their stories.Guatemalan immigrant Bartolo Tadeo G\u00f3mez, 25, says US authorities held him and his 7-year-old son for four nights under a border bridge in El Paso.On Sunday, a CBP official told CNN the migrants held under the bridge were being transferred to another location.CBP decided to relocate to another location with more space and shelter capability due to the steadily increasing number of migrant apprehensions in the area, the official said.The ACLU suggested other factors might have inspired officials to take action.Officials, the organization claimed, decided to move the migrants away from the outdoor detention area ahead of a congressional visit to El Paso.CNN's Kevin Conlon reported from El Paso.

Based on interviews with six unnamed female former staffers or consultants, Politico reported Bittel \"created an unprofessional workplace environment for women that include(d) persistent inappropriate comments, leering at young women and even inviting them on his private jet,\" and that, according to one of the women interviewed, \"it became a policy that women, especially junior staff, were never to be left alone with him in his office, plane or house.\"  One former Democratic Party staffer told CNN that she had experienced Bittel's inappropriate behavior firsthand for months before quitting. \"It didn't matter if a woman was a low-level aide or senior executive. He was inappropriate with all of us,\" said the staffer, who spoke to CNN only on the condition of anonymity. Bittel, who \"has been involved in progressive political activism for the past 40 years,\" according to his biography on the state party's website, sent a statement to CNN saying he was \"deeply sorry\" for his comments and actions. Read More\"Every person, regardless of their gender, race, age or sexuality, should be treated with respect and valued for their hard work and contributions to our community and if any of my comments or actions did not reflect that belief I am deeply sorry,\" he said. \"I have much to learn, but my goal is and has always been to make sure every member of our party has a safe environment in which to succeed. It seems I've not been successful in that goal, and I will do better.\"That apology was not enough for some, including the party's top contenders running to replace Republican Gov. Rick Scott. \"No one should have to work in an uncomfortable environment. Bittel's behavior and the atmosphere he has created is unacceptable. He must resign,\" said Gwen Graham, a former congresswoman who's the daughter of former Florida Gov. Bob Graham.I called Chairman Stephen Bittel this morning and told him that he should step down. No one should have to work in an uncomfortable environment. Bittel's behavior and the atmosphere he has created is unacceptable. He must resign.\u2014 Gwen Graham (@GwenGraham) November 17, 2017\n\n\"I hope Chairman Bittel does the right thing and steps down as chairman,\" added Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine. \"No individual should feel less than safe and comfortable in their workplace.\"I have zero tolerance for harassment in politics or the workplace. It's time to change the culture and it must start at the top. I hope Chairman Bittel does the right thing and steps down as Chairman. No individual should feel less than safe and comfortable in their workplace.\u2014 Mayor Philip Levine (@MayorLevine) November 17, 2017\n\n\"Stephen Bittel must step down as FDP Chair,\" Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum said in a statement. \"These courageous women came forward with disturbing stories of harassment, and it's our duty to stand in the gap for them and others in these situations. Although these allegations are not criminal, they clearly paint a picture of a hostile working environment for women.\"Bittel then issued a second statement, this time to announce his resignation. \"When my personal situation becomes distracting to our core mission of electing Democrats and making Florida better, it is time for me to step aside,\" he said. \"I am proud of what we have built as a Party and the wins we have had for Florida families, but I apologize for all who have felt uncomfortable during my tenure at the Democratic Party.\"pic.twitter.com/Ok7bJI4HPa\u2014 Florida Democrats (@FlaDems) November 17, 2017\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party said the party's first vice chair, Judy Mount, will take over on an interim basis until the State Executive Committee elects its new leader December 9.",

Now, when he goes out with his dog at night, he stays in the line of sight of the police who blanket the area.\"Everyone is on edge,\" he said. \"We are trying to maintain as normal of life as possible. We don't want to live in the shadows.\"In the last month, four seemingly unconnected people have been shot and killed in Seminole Heights not far from Haynes' home. The victims are separated by age, race and occupation, and each was killed -- but not robbed -- while walking alone at night within a half-mile area, police said.Officials have said the killings are connected in their methodology, leading to fears that a serial killer is on the loose. Nobody has been arrested for the killings. Read MoreTampa Police Chief Brian Dugan released blurry video in late October of a \"person of interest\" wearing a hood casually walking down a street near one of the killings. On Wednesday, Dugan released new video showing a similar-looking person with the same gait who was present near Tuesday's killing of 60-year-old Ronald Felton.The person in the video, he said, is now a suspect. Watch this video. Pay attention to the walk. Pay attention to the way he flips his phone.

We need names.\"Based on a witness statement, Dugan described the suspect as a black male between 6 feet and 6 feet 2 inches with a thin build and a light complexion. He was wearing all black and a black baseball cap and armed with a large black pistol, police said. Police said they believe the suspect also lives in the same neighborhood as the shootings and is familiar with the area.Police have received 2,300 tips in the case so far, he said, including 450 tips on Tuesday.'I just can't sleep'In the past month, police have swarmed the Seminole Heights neighborhood. Dugan and other Tampa officials have advised residents not to go outside alone, to be alert, to keep porch lights on at night and to set up cameras that might capture suspicious activity.Haynes said he has kept his lights on at night and noted that streetlights have been on as well. Police drive by every 15 to 20 minutes, and he also has seen officers on bicycles and horseback.\"We all appreciate the heavy police coverage,\" he said. \"This is unusual for this community. This is a low-crime area.\"Lindsay Ingraham, 35, said she doesn't go on morning runs anymore.Lindsay Ingraham, 35, said she no longer goes for morning runs and has her boyfriend meet her at her car when she returns home every evening. \"The police presence ... it's like nothing I've ever seen before,\" she said, sipping coffee on her front porch. Indeed, three parked police vehicles were in view from her porch, and at least four more passed by during a brief interview.Ingraham, who bought her Seminole Heights home in 2013, said the possible serial killer preying on her neighborhood has even cast a pall upon Thanksgiving. She is hosting the feast for the first time next week, but she has already had three cancellations due to the killings. \"I hope I can convince them to change their minds,\" she said.Shannon Lee and Carlo Troche wait at the bus stop in southeast Seminole Heights in Florida.Shannon Lee, 47, works until 11 p.m., so her boyfriend walks her from the bus stop to their home in the evenings. On this Thursday, Lee was at the bus stop on her way to work, escorted by her friend Carlo Troche, 56. On the night Monica Hoffa was killed, Lee said she walked right by her and didn't know it had happened. \"It could have easily been me,\" said Lee. \"That's scary to think about. My family is all freaking out.\"She used to not think twice about getting up in the middle of the night and going to the convenience store to buy cigarettes. But she doesn't do that anymore.\"It's not worth losing your life over somebody's anger, over something you have nothing to do with,\" said Lee. Tyqueisha Harris, 23, said she hasn't changed much about her routine in the last month, but she did drive her 16-year-old brother to high school Wednesday morning, out of an extra bit of caution.With such high stakes and so few answers, some residents have embarked on their own investigating.Reginald Pringley, 58, said he can't sleep because of the killings, so he took it upon himself to use his \"criminal mind\" and investigate what he thought might be the killer's steps.\"I just can't sleep,\" said Reginald Pringley, 58.Pringley found discarded socks in an alley nearby and told police about them, hoping they might lead to a break in the case, he told CNN.\"I think that he ran down the alley and was changing clothes,\" he said.The killings have all occurred in Southeast Seminole Heights, an area made up of about 1,450 homes and businesses. Home sales have yet to be canceled or affected by the killings, according to Stan Lasater, president of the Southeast Seminole Heights Civic Association.\"This is still the most desirable neighborhood in Tampa,\" he said.Serial killer?JUST WATCHEDTampa mayor: This killer will rot in hell ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTampa mayor: This killer will rot in hell  01:36The string of killings would seem to fit the definition that the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit used in a 2005 publication on serial murder: \"The unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events.\"Benjamin Mitchell, 22, was shot and killed in front of his home October 9. Monica Hoffa, 32, was shot and killed October 11. A city employee found her body two days afterward in a vacant parking lot half a mile from where Mitchell died.Anthony Naiboa, an autistic 20-year-old who had just graduated from high school, became the third victim when he accidentally got on the wrong bus and ended up in the neighborhood by mistake, police said.Ronald Felton, 60, was shot from behind as he crossed the street on Tuesday just before 5 a.m.Tampa police and officials have resisted using the \"serial killer\" term because \"we just don't have enough evidence,\" Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said in October.\"We're not afraid of that word. If we think that that's true, we'll be happy to say it, but we've got to connect the dots,\" he said.Police said this person is now a suspect in the killings.Dugan reiterated that position in a news conference on Wednesday. The videos released by police connect one person to two crime scenes, but that was the extent of their evidence at this point.\"We're not calling them a serial killer because we still can't say they've done all of the homicides. We're pretty convinced they've done at least two of them,\" Dugan said. \"We have very limited evidence.\"Despite how they're presented in popular TV shows like \"Dexter\" or \"Mindhunter,\" serial killers do not necessarily kill in bizarre rituals or out of sexual desires, according to the FBI's analysis.Dugan added that he didn't want that \"serial killer\" label to mislead people.\"I've been very specific because I don't want people to stereotype and box in their thinking,\" he said.Dugan said he was comfortable connecting the separate murders not because of forensic evidence, but because of their proximity, the timing of the deaths, and because each victim was alone.\"I'm convinced they are linked together. Whether we have all the evidence that says that, we don't have that,\" he said.The Tampa killings bear some similarity to killings in 2015 and 2016 in Maryville, Arizona, in which nine people were killed in separate shootings. The victims spanned all ages but all lived in the same neighborhood in west Phoenix. Police said most of the shootings occurred as victims walked down streets or stood in their yards. Aaron Juan Saucedo, 23, was arrested and charged with those shootings in May, police said.Rosa Flores and Kevin Conlon reported from Tampa. Eric Levenson wrote from New York.",

        "content": "Story highlightsMany Trump voters across the country say James Comey's firing doesn't change their opinion of the President\"I was hoping Trump would've done a lot better with his presidency so far,\" Kentucky business owner says (CNN)President Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. But many of his supporters aren't joining the outcry. CNN spoke to Trump backers across the country, and while some of them expressed surprise at Comey's ouster, few said it changed their image of the leader of the free world. Here's what they had to say:Jake Lee, business ownerLee, 46, of West Hollywood, California, said he believes Trump made \"the right decision\" in axing Comey.Read More\"As far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances. I think what became the last straw was when he (Comey) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on (Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's and her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner's) laptop. You can't have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules apply to everybody else. I think in my opinion that was part of (Trump's) decision. The guy likes to run a tight ship.\"As for concerns that Comey's firing could affect the investigation into Trump's ties to Russia, Lee doesn't see it as an issue. \"You know, I think (Trump's) a lot smarter than that. If he were to fire him and then later ... the news got out that he was actually involved with Russia -- which I don't believe so -- that would be even worse. The cover-up would be worse than the actual crime, and I don't think that he would put himself in that situation. The guy, in my opinion, is super smart.\"Scott Preisendorf, construction company ownerPreisendorf, of Windsor, Colorado, is an independent, but voted for Trump. The Comey firing is yet another incident reinforcing his regret over casting that ballot, he said. Preisendorf thinks Comey should've been fired in 2016 during the Clinton email flap and that it's obvious that Trump fired Comey \"just to protect himself. The way it was done and the timing,  I didn't think it was right. \"I don't think he's working for the people. Trump is using his position to make himself, his family and his friends money. It's blatant.\"\"I'm still doubting Trump will make it four years.\"Willie Standley, clothing store ownerStandley, 53, of York, Pennsylvania, says he has no issue with Comey's firing, although he was surprised by it and wonders what effect his ouster will have on the investigation into Trump's Russia ties. He also thinks the matter has become entirely too political. \"I think we should take the politics out of it. Get a special investigation to go out there and get the truth to go ahead and serve America, not the politicians.\"When a person is in office they should have people around them that are going to go ahead and support what they stand for. I own my own business, and if someone went ahead and undermined me and my business, I would fire them too.\"Standley, however, would like to see a special investigation into the firing. \"Something is definitely not right, because the timing and everything is not good. ...Something smells with Trump. I don't have blind loyalty -- no way -- because ... I don't trust politicians. And that's part of why I voted for (Trump), because he wasn't a politician. But once he stepped in there doing the things that he's done ... he's going at it like a politician, not a businessman.\"So, after the ordeal, is Standley still happy he cast his vote for Trump?\"I would say it's early on, but no. But I still think he's going to be better than Hillary would have been. Time will tell.\"Shawn Lewis, tattoo parlor ownerLewis of Whitesburg, Kentucky, says he doesn't know how to feel about the Comey firing. \"I think even if Hillary had been there, if Hillary had won, he (Comey) would have still gotten fired over ... everything that went through that. I guess he (Trump) could have handled it a little better ... (but) I don't think it's as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. Like most of the rest of the politics that's going on, man, it always gets blown out of proportion.\"It brings up questions of why, why did he fire him, you know? Then who's going to replace him? You know what I mean? Who's going to be replacing Comey? Because we do need a good strong FBI. Our country takes a lot to work, you know.\"I was hoping Trump would've done a lot better with his presidency so far. ... Truthfully, I don't think he's really made much progress, but I don't think he's going to be able to do as much as he wanted to do.\"Really, I'm glad I voted for him. A lot of Hillary's policies I just couldn't support. Clearly, we're diehard conservative here, so you know and I know where she stands against guns and a lot of the right wing.\"Darrell Scott, pastorScott, from Cleveland, made national headlines when he talked with Trump during a White House meeting in February about fixing the gang violence problem In Chicago, including comments he later revised on meeting with top gang thugs. (Scott, who later said he would meet with former gang members, said Thursday progress on the issue has been made, but some initiatives are in the early stages.)He told CNN that Comey was a \"national distraction\" and needed to be fired. He thinks the President tried to make it work. \"He should have fired Comey a long time ago. I think he should have fired Comey when he got into office,\" Scott said. \"He extended an olive branch to him.\" Scott dismisses the claim that the firing will affect the Russian investigation. \"Comey himself wasn't doing the investigating. Comey had field agents investigating and then turning their findings over to him. So, it's not like Comey's firing stops the investigation; because it doesn't.\" Dane Roche, project manager Roche, 25, of Greeley, Colorado, says he didn't vote for Trump so much as he voted against Clinton. Overall, he said, he's frustrated and feels the country is too divided -- and that the media is exacerbating that division. As for the Comey firing, Roche said it was unexpected. \"I wouldn't say it's the best way to do it, but I don't get to choose. ... I was surprised but not surprised. Nothing surprises me anymore.\"Asked whether he still supports Trump, he said the Comey firing didn't move the needle for him, and he remains pleased that Clinton is not head of state. \"There are too many things going on right now. Politics are a st show.\"Deborah Andrews, union memberAndrews, of Savannah, Georgia, is a member of the International Longshoremen's Association, and stands by Trump. She also thinks far too much is being made of the Russia investigation.\"He's done nothing but dig and work hard since he's been in office. If there's a weakness and he detects it, then they're gone. He's only going to surround himself with people who do their job.\"\"I think the timing (with the Russian investigation) is a coincidence. He was probably told that Comey wasn't an effective leader so he was out.\"John Corry, real estate brokerCorry, of Chicago, said he might have been surprised by Comey's firing a couple of years ago, but not now. \"Nothing surprises me anymore, particularly after what just happened in the election. ... There is no normal or status quo anymore, as much as the Democrats and Republicans try and cram it down our throats.\"   \"The situation with Comey is interesting because if you go back seven months the Democrats wanted to lynch him.  He had all these fireable offenses. ... \"Do I think he got a raw deal? Probably, but that's the nature of politics.\" The situation hasn't affected his opinion of Trump, although he does wonder why liberals don't see that their aversion to Trump is not so different from conservatives' feelings toward Barack Obama during his presidency.\"What's frustrating to me is that the left still doesn't get it, six months later. This isn't about Trump. It's about the vote. ... If you look at what happened with Obama, there was just as much pushback (to his actions), so the hypocrisy is right before everyone's eyes.\" Ingrid Mueller, spokeswoman for pro-Trump groupMueller of Beverly Hills, California, is one of Trump's Latina supporters and a spokeswoman for \"Make California Great Again.\"\"I think that James Comey should have been fired because he protected Hillary Clinton last year with the email scandal ... and didn't do anything about it then. I think he was paid not to do anything to her. I think he was overdue. I think President Trump did the right thing. (Comey) is not trustworthy ... since he didn't put her in jail or bring her to court with her email server. So how can you trust him in anything that he tries to investigate?\"On Trump appointing a new FBI director, she said, \"I really believe President Trump will appoint the best man for the job. He's going to do his best, because he's a man who always asks for opinions from other people. I think he will appoint a very good person.\"Dakota Wiseman, mover; Melissa Morton, law office workerWalking around a sunny downtown Charleston, West Virginia, during lunchtime, it was not hard to find a Trump voter, here in the state that gave the President his widest margin of victory in November.Dakota Wiseman, who at 20 years old cast his first ballot in a presidential race for Trump, was unabashed about the Comey decision.\"Good decision. He got fired for not doing the job right. You gotta do your job to keep your job,\" Wiseman said.Another Trump voter said decisions like this week's have made her think about hers last November.\"I'm starting to regret it,\" Melissa Morton, 51, said. \"I think about that decision a lot.\"His behavior,\" she explained. \"He's just classless.\"Evelio Medina, chamber president Medina, 53, of Miami, is a big Trump supporter who helped organize the Deplorables Inauguration Ball in Washington, D.C. earlier this year.\"I'm totally OK with the firing, not necessarily how it went down. I wish it had been a little more elegant,\" said the president and CEO of the Downtown Miami & Brickell Chamber of Commerce. \"Trump is unorthodox. I don't always have to agree with his form and fashion, but he's always gonna do it his way, just like the (Frank Sinatra) song.\"\"It was essential to bring back the role of the FBI. (Comey) took liberties he never should have. ... He became political, and once you became political you can win and you can lose. Comey lost,\" he said. \"The Democrats haven't accepted that they lost the election. ... They hated Comey, and now they love Comey.\"Asked whether he was concerned Comey's firing could have any affect on federal investigations into White House ties to Russia, Medina told CNN he feels the Russia issue is overblown. \"It became sexy all the sudden. I haven't seen any evidence of Russian collusion. Russia didn't pick me up, drive me to the polls and tell me which way to vote.\"Everett Stoner, retired meat cutterStoner, 80, is originally from Detroit but has lived in Greeley, Colorado, with his wife of 40 years for almost a decade. The Army veteran voted for Trump and thinks he's doing a good job, but he conceded no politician is perfect. In regard to firing Comey, Trump was \"well within his rights and should've done it a long time ago. ... We need new blood.\" He doesn't care for Comey because he thinks the former FBI director protected Clinton, which amounted, in his opinion, to Comey \"acting as a judge, not an investigator.\"He also appreciated the unexpected nature of Trump's announcement: \"Trump doesn't broadcast what he's gonna do; he just does it, and I like that.\"Nadia Larsen, Israeli immigrantNadia Larsen emigrated from Israel and now lives in Tucson, Arizona. \"I support my president 100% for firing Comey. He did a bad job, period.\"Joe Messina, school board memberThe Santa Clarita, California, resident said he is not a \"Trumper,\" but is a supporter of the President. He said the timing of the firing didn't bother him.\"If he would have came in and wiped everybody out in January you know everybody would have said, 'Well, it's a regime. He's going to wipe everybody out and bring in his own people.' Well doesn't every president do that? So no, the timing doesn't bother me.\"Messina didn't agree with the way the dismissal went down. He thought the White House should have waited until Comey was back in Washington.He added that the media was spending too much time on the firing.\"We've got stuff going on all over the world, and 90% of the media's questions are about this firing. 'Was it 12:01 or was it 1:15?'  Is that really what they're going to fixate on?\"",

The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning Sunday for a large swath of the region, including portions of New York state, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine --  an area that's home to more than 15 million people. The agency warned that Portland, Maine, could see as much as 26 inches of snow. \"That's the bull's-eye,\" said CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar, who added that the snow, which began falling Sunday afternoon, would continue into Monday.In anticipation of the winter storm, Portland International Jetport in Portland, Maine, canceled all flights for 24 hours, from Sunday at 8 p.m. to Monday at 8 p.m.Projected snowfalls for Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.Read MoreIn Boston, about 100 miles south, the city braced for as much as 16 inches of snow from Sunday into Monday -- with some suburbs along the north shore expecting up to 19 inches -- creating a potentially dangerous morning commute. \"The snow will be heavy and wet, and winds high, so power outages and downed trees are a concern,\" said CNN meteorologist Julie Martin. \"It is likely schools will be canceled again.\" Northeast U.S. bracing for another round of #wind & #snow Sun-Mon as strong Nor'easter develops off Northeast coast. https://t.co/GIrv1srJLh pic.twitter.com/EUJppoSDBR\u2014 NWS (@NWS) February 11, 2017\nBoston has already gotten almost 31 inches of snow this winter, so if the weather service's prediction is accurate the city will soon surpass its annual average of 43.8 inches for the entire year, according to Chinchar.  \"And it's only February,\" she added. Still, it would take quite a bit more punishing by Mother Nature to match the record-shattering 110.6 inches of snow that crippled Boston in the winter of 2014-2015. That snowfall was so vast that an enormous pile lingered until July before finally melting. \"I'm not sure we will get to that magnitude,\" Chinchar said, \"but we will certainly be well above average to finish this winter season.\"ThundersnowAcross the Northeast, residents this winter have experienced a rare weather phenomenon known as \"thundersnow,\" when thunder and lightning occur as snow is reaching the ground. Who's ready for more #Thundersnow? The setup looks favorable Mon morning for #MA & #RI as a coastal storm intensifies rapidly near Cape Cod!\u2014 NWS Boston (@NWSBoston) February 12, 2017\nFor this to happen, the air layer closer to the ground must be warmer than the layers above but still cold enough to create snow, meteorologists explain. It is fairly rare, because ground temperatures in the winter are usually too cold. Also, it's likely that this storm system could undergo another weather anomaly called \"bombogenesis.\" \"This happens when there is a large difference between a cold air mass and warm sea surface temps. High winds are a product of this and intense precipitation -- even blizzards,\" Martin said.

Wind gusts of 65 mph or more are expected for the coastal region.  On Cape Cod, a blizzard watch is in effect until Monday as temperatures drop below freezing. In New York City, no snow is expected Monday, but \"gusty winds over 40 mph could lead to a lot of travel troubles to start the workweek,\" Martin said. The storm is expected to move out by Monday night.West Coast gets drenched The West Coast continues to grapple with rapid snow melt and heavy rains in the Sierra mountains, which led to flooding in parts of Nevada and Southern California last week.

The fire department ordered residents and tourists to evacuate, some with only the clothes on their backs.   Some, however, were not able to get out. \"If you're a person of prayer, we could use your prayers,\" Greg Miller, the town's fire chief, said as the fires grew.'Everything is on the table'\"Everything is on the table,\" is how local prosecutor James Dunn categorizes the case against the juveniles, who remain unnamed publicly because of their ages. Among the unknowns are their ages, and whether prosecutors will charge them as adults.Because the law prohibits the dissemination of practically all information in juvenile cases, Dunn was left with little else to tell reporters at a news conference announcing their arrests.Perhaps that's why he repeated on four occasions: \"Everything is on the table.\"The only additional information Dunn has revealed was that both youths were set to have a bond hearing within 72 hours of their December 7 arrest. But more than a week later, the Sevier County Juvenile Court has not held such a hearing, nor has any been scheduled, according to Matthew Jones, the court's youth services officer.CNN reached out to the two defense attorneys who have, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel, been retained by each of the juveniles' families, but messages left for both have not been returned. 'This is pretty complicated'Although they've levied charges, authorities have ostensibly not yet determined what -- if any -- intentions they think the accused may have had, hence their leaving of \"everything on the table\" when it comes to the possibility of more \u2014 and more severe -- charges.  So, while authorities continue to investigate, here is a look at what could be \"on the table\" in the state of Tennessee:\"This is pretty complicated,\" says CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos. \"Depending on the facts of the case, even if they didn't intend to kill anyone, they still could be charged with first-degree murder.\"According to Cevallos, that's because the statute defining first-degree murder in Tennessee includes the \"killing of another committed in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate,\" several specific offenses, among them arson.In Tennessee, conviction of first-degree murder carries life in prison, life without the possibility of parole, or the death penalty. If authorities determine that the guilty party or parties did not intend to kill, but do not charge them with first-degree murder, then the two next most severe charges \u2014 second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter \u2014 would be off the table, according to Cevallos, because the former requires \"an intentional killing,\" and the latter an \"intentional killing with provocation.\"Should that be the case then \u2014 that the intention was not to kill \u2014 Cevallos says the next most severe charges available to Tennessee authorities after first-degree murder would be reckless homicide, which is punishable by up to 12 years in prison, or criminally negligent homicide, which is up to six years.Of course, for either to be tried on any of these charges, each would have to be tried as an adult.And that is something, according to Dunn, that is still on the table.",

        "content": "(CNN)China has touted its newly completed Olympic ski venue as an example of its commitment to making the Beijing Games the greenest and cleanest in history.But there's just one problem -- it was built in the middle of a nature reserve.Chinese organizers say the National Alpine Ski Center in Yanqing, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) from central Beijing, will be 100% powered by wind and solar energy. According to satellite images and official maps analyzed by CNN, the ski center tears through the former core area of Songshan National Nature Reserve, a park founded in 1985 to protect its dense forests, alpine meadows and rich biodiversity.By the time Beijing won the bid for the 2022 Winter Games in 2015, the boundaries of the reserve had been redrawn to exclude the area where the ski field is now built. The new boundaries cover a larger total area, but critics say that's unlikely to compensate for the loss of wildlife habitat and damage to the site's delicate ecosystem from building the venue.\n\n\nThe Chinese government redrew the boundaries of a nature reserve to make way for an Olympic ski venue\nThe National Alpine Ski Center has been built in the original core area of the Songshan National Nature Reserve.\n\nSelect a year\n201420152017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore area of the\nnature reserve\n\nSongshan National\nNature Reserve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed alpine ski\nvenue fell exactly within\nthe reserve's core area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew location of\nthe core area\n\n\nAlpine skiing venue\n\n\nOriginal location of \nthe core area\n\nNew location of the\nNature Reserve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: According to Chinese law, the core area of a nature reserve is selected for its intact natural ecosystems and concentration of rare and endangered animals and plants.\n\n\nSource: Songshan National Nature Reserve, Beijing Municipal Ecologyand Environment Bureau, Google Earth\nGraphic: CNN Visuals\n\n\n\n\n Read MoreThis apparent conflict with Beijing's green narrative comes amid mounting questions about the environmental cost of the Games. Given the city's arid climate, it will rely entirely on artificial snow -- which experts warn would be a drain on energy and water resources. And such environmental concerns won't end with the Olympics. As the Chinese government looks to turn Yanqing into an international skiing hotspot and build more ski slopes, conservationists fear it could cause further damage to the local ecology.The nature reserveFor decades, Songshan National Nature Reserve provided a sanctuary to many protected animal and plant species, including the golden eagle and rare orchids. Under Chinese law, nobody is allowed to enter the reserve's core area, except for scientific research with government approval. And a 2007 planning document obtained by CNN made it clear that development within the core area at Songshan was forbidden. So when Beijing won the bid to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, conservationists and nature enthusiasts were shocked to find that the proposed alpine ski site fell exactly within the reserve's core area on the Xiao Haituo mountain, the second highest peak of Beijing.A photo of the Xiao Haituo Mountain in 2014, before it was turned into the alpine ski venue for the Beijing Winter Olympics.The discovery sparked an outcry on social media, with many internet users questioning why the Olympics venue had to be built inside a nature reserve. Censors soon moved in, deleting viral posts that drew hundreds of thousands of clicks, but that only further fueled the anger.As pressure mounted, Zhang Suzhi, then executive deputy head of Yanqing county, told state newspaper the Beijing Daily in 2015 that the boundaries of the Songshan National Nature Reserve had been redrawn, and the Winter Olympic venues did not fall inside the reserve.That appears to be what Chinese organizers told the International Olympic Committee, too. In its evaluation report of Beijing's bid for the 2022 Olympics in June 2015, the IOC said the proposed ski area would be \"adjacent\" to the reserve.But it noted that the proposed site is \"part of the same mountain ecosystem\" as the reserve, adding: \"Ski resort development in this area would therefore require substantial ecological studies and mitigation measures to limit environmental impact.\"According to Zhang, the Yanqing official, the revised borders expanded the total area of the nature reserve by 31% and added more types of vegetation.\"After the adjustment, the nature reserve is richer in biological resources, more complete in ecosystem, stronger in water conservation and higher in conservation value,\" he told the Beijing Daily. But Zhang brushed over a crucial fact: the original core zone -- including the highest peak, which experts say has the most biodiversity significance -- was no longer part of the protected lands.'This is really a great pity'Chinese experts and environmental activists say expanding the reserve doesn't compensate for the loss of the original core area.\"This is really a great pity, because (the original core zone) is one of the very few places in northern Beijing that has alpine meadows,\" said a Chinese ecological expert, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions. \"Such a unique ecosystem was why it was included in the original nature reserve in the first place.\" And compared to other parts of the reserve, the core area also had a higher rate of wildlife sightings, according to a biodiversity monitoring study conducted between March 2013 and February 2014 by researchers at the reserve's management office.The Chinese ecologist criticized a lack of transparency in the government's decision-making. \"It did not release any environmental impact assessment for public consultation,\" the ecologist said.     When construction of the National Alpine Ski Center began in 2017, environmentalists tried to seek answers.Environmental advocate Shi Dianshuo urged the government to release detailed information on the boundary change. The government rejected his request on the grounds that the information \"involves state secrets,\" according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Environmental Protection posted by Shi online. Unconvinced, Shi took the ministry to court to have the decision overturned. A court date was originally scheduled for February 2018, but a source with direct knowledge of the case told CNN the hearing did not proceed, nor was it acknowledged by the government or mentioned anywhere in state media. Shi declined CNN's request for an interview.  To observe the disruptive impact of the ski slopes' construction on wildlife, researchers at the reserve's management office set up cameras throughout the new reserve in 2017 to monitor their activity.\"As the reserve is adjacent to the Yanqing competition zone, human activities have increased dramatically, and road transport and constructions have affected the population size and behavioral rhythm of wild animals in the area,\" the study noted.The researchers found that nocturnal animals, such as leopard cats and greater hog badgers, had become much more active during the day -- likely to avoid construction work at the ski slopes.The National Alpine Ski Centre is ready to welcome the world's top skiers at the Beijing Winter Olympics.In a Pre-Games Sustainability Report released this month, Chinese Olympic officials highlighted conservation efforts during construction of the Yanqing competition zone.They included setting up wildlife corridors and installing more than 600 artificial nests in the competition zone, as well as transplanting 11,027 plants and 24,272 trees to sites at the foot of the mountain. But experts noted that the Songshan National Nature Reserve went entirely unmentioned in the 130-page report.\"Nowhere is the word 'nature reserve' mentioned and nowhere is it said that the core area ... has been declassified and transferred to a new area,\" said Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg.\"If you're destroying the upper high-altitude mountain parts, it's no use to try and cue in the lower parts, because you have impacted the very, very sensitive ecosystem,\" she added.The Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment did not respond to CNN's request for comments about the boundary change.One of the world's steepest runs It's clear why Xiao Haituo mountain in the reserve was chosen to be the site of the Winter Olympic ski events -- its vertical drop of 900 meters (2,952 feet) made it an almost perfect location for what is now one of the world's steepest ski runs. To hold an Olympic downhill event, the proposed ski site must have a vertical drop of at least 800 meters (2,624 feet) -- a requirement that rules out most mountains in Beijing. Across the provincial border in Hebei, however, there are no shortage of sites that meet the Games' standards, according to Chinese experts. The starting zone of the National Alpine Ski Center has a maximum steepness of 68 degrees.The city of Zhangjiakou, for example, is already well developed for winter sports and a popular skiing destination in China.\"If it's just for holding the Olympics, a lot of ski resorts in Hebei are good enough, there's no need to touch the nature reserve at all,\" the Chinese ecologist said.Instead, he suspects, economic considerations may be at play. \"Beijing doesn't want the future winter sports revenue to be diverted to Hebei,\" he said.The Beijing Organizing Committee did not respond to CNN's request for comment over whether it was aware the ski center was built inside the former core area of the nature reserve. In a reply to CNN, the IOC said the development of the Yanqing zone is \"transforming the region -- a rural suburb of Beijing -- into a major four-season tourism destination, improving lives and boosting the local economy.\"The IOC -- which has pledged to make the Games climate positive by 2024 -- also praised China for delivering on its promise to hold a \"carbon-neutral\" Games. Saving wildlifeBeijing's ambitions for Yanqing are not limited to the Olympics. It has already announced plans to turn the region into an international skiing destination by the end of 2024. The goal is to expand its ski slopes to 100 hectares and welcome more than half a million visitors a year.However, conservationists fear that future development could cause even more damage to the surrounding forests and wildlife.  \"The increase in the number of people is what will cause great pressure on the local ecology, which is the biggest concern,\" said a Chinese expert who didn't want to be named due to fear of repercussions. Luo Shujin, a conservation biologist at Peking University, has been studying wildlife around Yanqing for years. She was tracking leopard cat droppings on another mountain in Yanqing in December 2018 when she saw the ski runs gleaming in the sun across the valley.Luo was excited: \"I thought about that famous pictures of a puma walking by the Hollywood sign in L.A., and I asked myself: can we get a picture of a leopard cat walking by the alpine ski course of the Beijing Winter Olympics?\"A leopard cat is caught on camera with the Olympic ski runs in the background.A ring-necked pheasant is caught on camera in the Songshan National Nature Reserve in 2019.Due to the pandemic, Luo couldn't access the mountain for more than a year. When she finally returned in 2021, she got the shot she wanted.In the photo, a leopard cat strolls casually into the frame of the camera, walking on snow, against a backdrop of white ski runs on Xiao Haituo mountain.It ended up going viral. Conservationists saw it as a sign that within miles of the ski resort, rare wild animals could still thrive. But their future remains uncertain. If Yanqing's ski slopes continue to expand, analysts say it could threaten the surrounding ecosystems -- including the existing nature reserve.\"A nature reserve should be protected exactly because it has a fragile ecosystem,\" the Chinese expert said. \"Given how close the skiing venue is to nature reserve, if a large amount of human activities go on for a long time, they are bound to cause great disturbance to the local ecology ... and might even break the balance.\"",

I wish we were able to find a way forward, but I think leaving the organization is best for all of us.\"The Washington Blade was first to report on Henry's resignation.In a statement to CNN, Charles Moran, a spokesperson for the Log Cabin Republicans, said Henry resigned on Monday and thanked her for her service to the group.\"The final date of her employment is undetermined at this time,\" Moran said in an email. \"The Board's Executive Committee will proceed with an orderly transition to ensure nothing falls through the cracks. We thank her for her service to our organization and wish her well in the next chapter of her career.\"Read MoreHenry's resignation is the latest in a long line of defections over the past few months, including Robert Turner, Jordan Evans, Rachel Hoff, Jennifer Horn, Eli Lehrer, Rich Tafel and Sarah Longwell. The group, which claims to be \"the nation's largest Republican organization dedicated to representing LGBT conservatives and allies,\" published an op-ed in the Washington Post last week endorsing President Donald Trump, which sparked Turner, Horn and Evans' departures.Horn, a longtime Republican operative, said of her resignation from the organization's board, that she could no longer represent a group who endorsed another four years of the Trump administration and his targeting of gay and minority communities.\"It's not just the LGBTQ community this President targets. When we look at immigrants, people -- anyone that he thinks he can somehow use to anger his base -- he doesn't care if he has to divide on racial lines, on ethnic lines, on educational lines,\" Horn told MSNBC. \"He will divide and damage and destroy this country in any manner he thinks he needs to advance his own political power.\"Henry, a lesbian Republican activist who fought for marriage equality as head of Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry, however, says her resignation wasn't just about the Trump endorsement. Instead, she has been frustrated with the group has been going as of late, a direction she described as becoming more like a social club that serves as a chapter of the Republican National Committee or Young Republicans. \"Log Cabin was once a civil rights organization with conservative principles,\" Henry said. \"That's why I joined on. Now it's mostly about happy hours.\"\"They weren't involved in the marriage fight at all,\" Henry said. \"When the Equality Act passed, and no one (from Log Cabin Republicans) said anything, I don't know if I was relieved -- because of what they might have said -- or disappointed that none of our chapter heads even noticed.\" When asked if she thinks the group can survive, she said, \"I'm not sure. My recommendation would be to shut it down, or just become the YR's of the gay community -- Republicans who just happen to be gay.\"",

Wandres Figueroa led a small group of uniformed men to the special security unit headquarters at approximately 2:50 a.m. local (1:50 a.m. ET). The incursion was registered on cell phone and distributed via social media. In the videos, Figueroa speaks to the camera and calls on Venezuelans to take to the streets.Small groups of demonstrators appeared on the narrow streets of the Cotiza neighborhood. The protests were contained with tear gas, according to a CNN team on the ground.National Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said the \"small group of assailants\" had been detained.\"The Bolivarian National Armed Forces categorically reject these types of acts, that with all certainty, are motivated by dark interests of the extreme right and are contrary to the elemental laws of military discipline, honor and traditions of our institution,\" Padrino's statement said.Read MoreVenezuela's Maduro starts another six-year term despite pressure from neighborsThe minister said the group stole two military vehicles and kidnapped four people and that the \"full weight of the law\" would apply to the individuals.The events took place just days ahead of a national call for protests issued by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, which said it does not recognize Maduro's second term and called for the leader to step down in order to clear the way for new elections.Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, issued a ruling in Caracas on Monday stating that the National Assembly is invalid and that any agreement presented by the leadership of the legislative body  after January 5 would be nullified.Judge Juan Jose Mendoza, one of the leaders of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, said, \"Under no circumstance can the (Legislature) assume the actions of the executive office.\"On January 15, the National Assembly accused the Maduro government of \"usurping power\" and started drafting an amnesty law that would shelter any defecting member of the armed forces from rebelling against the government.Trump considering recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader as legitimate PresidentNational Assembly President Juan Guaido tweeted that Monday's events are a reflection \"of the generalized feelings within the Armed Forces.\"\"The National Assembly is committed to bring forward all the guarantees for those members of the Armed Forces who actively help restore the Constitution,\" Guaido tweeted.Several countries, including the United States, said they would not recognize Maduro's second term. Three sources told CNN last week that US President Donald Trump was considering Guaido as the legitimate president of the country.Maduro has continued the huge social welfare programs and price control policies of Hugo Chavez, who steered the country toward socialism before dying in 2013. Through nearly a decade of mismanagement, Venezuela squandered its profound oil wealth, leaving its economy in tatters and Latin America reeling from an unprecedented mass exodus of migrants in search of food and medicine.

First aid was administered to few guests who complained of ear pain, bleeding nose etc.\" An official with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) told CNN affiliate CNN News 18 that the crew allegedly forgot to press a button to pressurize the cabin.\"During climb, crew forgot to select bleed switch due to which cabin pressurization could not be maintained, and oxygen masks got deployed,\" the official said.In the statement, Jet Airways said Flight 9W697 \"made an air turn back due to loss in cabin pressure.\" A spokeswoman refused to confirm the claim that the crew forgot to press the button.Panic situation due to technical fault in @jetairways 9W 0697 going from Mumbai to Jaipur.

Aircraft fly at an altitude where the air pressure is far lower than our bodies are used to, which also means there is less oxygen available for us to breathe. Because of this, aircraft are pressurized to simulate a lower altitude inside the cabin. As an aircraft climbs to a high altitude, the cabin is pressurized, and as it descends for landing, it is gradually de-pressurized.Low pressure air is thinner and drier, which can cause nosebleeds.",

A bus' headlights inch forward. Eugenia Szuszkiewicz can feel the anxiety balling up in her stomach.The doctor's stress levels are through the roof. This is a dangerous journey for children who need palliative care in the best of circumstances. Now 12 of them are doing it in a war.Small and frail bodies are hoisted up for the last time in weary mothers' arms as they descend from the bus. Some are gently handed over to waiting doctors and nurses. For others, their health is too delicate and requires extra help to safely transport them on to the train, which will take them to Poland. The medical staff hope to prevent any of the children from experiencing even more pain -- emotionally or physically. One of the child's health is in such bad condition that doctors tell us that he may not survive the journey.The medical team asks us to stay away, and not film or try to talk to anyone until the children are stabilized. One by one, they are gently lowered on to 12 little cots placed only a few inches off the ground. Read MoreEleven of the 12 came from hospices around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, once known for having the best palliative care in the country. Now it's one of the country's most bombed areas, with Russian forces targeting residential areas there over the last week, hitting civilian infrastructure such as schools, shops, hospitals, apartment blocks and churches.For days, Szuszkiewicz -- a pediatrician and palliative care specialist -- fielded phone calls from desperate parents of children stuck the Kharkiv area. The parents' plea for help came as bombs fell around them. One mother screamed that without a ventilator and pain killers, her child would die. \"I could only tell her if she found a way to Lviv (in western Ukraine) then I would be able to help her,\" Szuszkiewicz tells us, tears streaming down her face and her voice catching.She still doesn't know if the mother and child are alive. An agonizing journeyAboard the train to Poland, Ira caresses her daughters fingers locked in place. \"Yes sweetheart, everything will be fine,\" she tells six-year-old Victoria. She then pauses. \"I guess everything will be fine.\"Victoria has cerebral palsy and is unable to walk. Her mother Ira told us it's a \"miracle\" that they were able to get onto the train. \"It was unimaginably hard to get out,\" she says. To get onto the medical train, Ira first had to travel from her village outside of Kharkiv to the city of Lviv, where the families were instructed to meet. Ira cradled Victoria in her arms for the better part of three days to get there, through the panic of others trying to flee and trains so packed she could not even put her down. Victoria, 6, traveled to Poland on the train with her mother, Ira.Victoria breaks into a huge smile that lights up her eyes each time she hears her name, even if it's through her mother's tears.\"She smiles at everyone. Because on the way here we only met kind compassionate people.\" Ira says.The journey has made Ira love her country all the more -- as if it were even possible. It only makes leaving that much harder, she says.Long, stressful and exhausting: One family's escape from Kyiv \"Even when you're not expecting help, everyone helped. They (strangers on the train journey to Lviv) gave us food, drinks, roof of our heads, they accompanied us, guided us.\"\"I don't know how my legs were taking me,\" Ira says. \"And it's only because she's (Victoria) strong herself. She's helping me, giving me some king of strength, I guess.\" \"She won't live without me. I know that,\" she adds.A hospice on wheelsThere are nearly 200 children in palliative care in the Kharkiv region alone, according to Szuszkiewicz.Initially, Szuszkiewicz tried to organize a train or ground transport into Kharkiv itself. But that proved to be impossible. It was too dangerous, the city was practically under siege. Instead, the families had to figure out how to get to Lviv, before she could arrange transport to safety in Poland. She was in touch with the directors of local hospices who put together a list of who wanted to leave, and who realistically could. The parents of children on ventilators did not have a choice -- their children would not survive the long journey. Others were too sick to attempt it.  Some decided to chance it anyways. Szuszkiewicz says some parents told her that it would be better to die on the road than under a bomb.Szuszkiewicz was the main organizer, mobilizing a network of medical professionals inside Ukraine to help transport everyone to the Lviv meeting point. Around 50 people were evacuated in total.The Polish Government and Warsaw Central Clinical Hospital converted multiple train cars into a makeshift medical ward, including an operating room.Szuszkiewicz says \"as soon as I arrived and approached that bus and I said, 'we're here, soon you'll be saved, we'll take you out of this country at war ... You can relax now,'\" she was met with a sense of both disbelief and relief.Now, \"there's many words of gratitude, there's joy, there's hope for life,\" Szuszkiewicz says.Szuszkiewicz sits with six-year-old Sophia, who clutches a toy given to her by volunteers on the train.The children recieve medical care on the train.\"Each one of those parents says that they have left their city Kharkiv only temporarily, that each of them will come back when there is a chance, that they will rebuild that city from scratch as soon as war stops there, as soon as they can live there again. They say it with such love to their homeland.\"The doctor is no stranger to gratitude: She's heard parents thank her for saving their children. But this time, she says, is different, the words have a different depth to them.Borscht and Molotovs: How one Ukrainian woman is supporting her countryAs the train crosses Ukraine into Poland, Ira receives a video from a neighbor back in Kharkiv. \"They said, the entire town was destroyed within one hour\" she says, her voice trembling and her eyes filling with tears.\"There's not a single home. Do you understand? Not a single home. It's just a pile of bricks and that's all. It's not a war, it's annihilation. Annihilation of the people.\"Ira tries to call her husband, mother, father, sister. No one is picking up.\"What happens inside a person when their whole life is crumbling ... it doesn't become someone else's life, one just ...\" her voice trails off. \"One just doesn't want to believe it.\"As the train pulls into Warsaw, the flashing blue lights of ambulances reflect through its windows. They're not signaling a medical emergency, and it's not in response to a bomb. It is a sign they have arrived, saving what is left of their children's lives.Anna Odzeniak contributed to this story",

        "content": "(CNN)Turkey has officially labeled Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a war and says it will restrict some warships from passing through key waterways, in a move that experts said could potentially hinder some of Moscow's military activities in the region. On Thursday, Russian forces launched a land, sea and air assault on Ukraine in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.   Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey Vasyl Bodnar went on local television last week and appealed for the government in Ankara to close its key straits to Russian warships under provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention. Turkey said it could only do so if it officially recognized the conflict as a war, and on Sunday, that's what it did.  On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his government would \"use the authority given to our country by the Montreux Convention on ship traffic in the straits in a way that will prevent the crisis from escalating.\" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu later said that Turkey had warned both Black Sea and non-Black Sea countries not to pass warships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits, according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency.Read More\"There has been no request for passage through the straits [since the war started],\" Cavusoglu said.While Erdogan said he considered \"Russia's attack on Ukraine unacceptable,\" he also said Turkey would not abandon its ties with Russia or Ukraine. Here's what you need to know. What is the Montreux Convention? The convention gives Turkey certain control over the passage of warships from the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits that connect the Aegean, Marmara, and Black Sea.  In peace time, warships can pass the straits by prior diplomatic notification with certain limitations on the weight of the ships and arms they carry -- and depending on whether the ship belongs to a Black Sea nation or not. And at times of war, Turkey can bar the passage of the warships of belligerent parties from crossing. According to the convention, if Turkey is a party to the war or considers itself threatened with imminent danger, it can shut down the straits to the passage of warships. How does this affect Russia? Both Russia and Ukraine lie on the Black Sea, along with Romania and NATO members Bulgaria and Georgia. Turkey can limit the transit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea through its straits under the Montreux Convention, but the pact has a caveat: belligerent states' warships can cross if they are returning to their base of origin.   \"If the ship of the war country will return to its port, an exception is made. We will implement all the provisions of Montreux with transparency,\" said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, adding that the exception should not be abused.  The move would only be symbolic, said Mustafa Aydin, president of the International Relations Council of Turkey. \"Russia has enough firepower in the Black Sea that it doesn't make sense for NATO countries to [enter],\" he said. \"Russia has complete supremacy on the water.\"  But if the war drags on, Moscow may feel the heat, since Russia had already completed its naval buildup in the Black Sea by shifting units from the Baltic Sea ahead of the start of hostilities, said Serhat Guvenc, professor of international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. Earlier in February, six Russian warships and a submarine transited the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits to the Black Sea for what Moscow called naval drills near Ukrainian waters. \"They [Russia] probably have enough resources to sustain their naval power in the Black Sea for about two to three months,\" he said. \"But if conflict drags on, it'll be a different story.\" Why did Turkey declare the conflict a war? Guvenc said he hadn't expected Turkey to take a decision so soon, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"put Ankara on the spot\" by prematurely thanking Turkey on Twitter for its support.   I thank my friend Mr. President of \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 @RTErdogan and the people of \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf7 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of \ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\uddfa warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 are extremely important today. The people of \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 will never forget that!\u2014 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 (@ZelenskyyUa) February 26, 2022\nTurkey has said that it has historically respected the treaty and will continue to do so.  Guvenc said it's in Ankara's interest to do so because the treaty supports Turkey at times of war. Any exception made to please Russia could jeopardize the treaty's credibility in the long run. \"The United States is very interested in the idea of unrestricted freedom of navigation through the Turkish straits, as is the case with other waterways like the Suez and Panama canals,\" he said. A deviation from the convention would give the US \"a legitimate reason to question Turkey's status as the watchdog of Montreux.\" How could this affect Turkey's foreign relations? Turkey has a maritime border with both Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea and views both countries as friendly. Ankara relies on Russia for tourism and natural gas but also has close economic and defense ties to Ukraine and has, despite Russian objections, sold drones to the country. The Soviet Union, the Russian state's predecessor, was one of the original signatories of the Montreux Convention. \"Russia knows the intricacies of the politics and the law and would have been prepared for such an eventuality,\" said Guvenc. Moscow, however, may not have expected Ankara to act on the treaty so soon, he added. \"Turkey can sell this move as purely observing an obligation under international law,\" he said, but the move may be an indication of where Turkey may lean if the conflict drags on. \"Turkey has decided to align more with its traditional allies in NATO and the European Union, and a bit away from Russia.\" Other top Middle East news Iran rejects deadline, 'politically motivated' claims in nuclear talks Iran said on Sunday it will not accept any deadline set by the West to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and wants what it described as \"politically motivated\" claims by UN watchdog IAEA about Tehran's nuclear work to be dropped, Iranian state TV reported. Background: One of the sticking points in the indirect talks between Iran and the United States to revive the deal appears to be questions about uranium traces found by the IAEA at old but undeclared sites in Iran.  Why it matters: Media reports said that the US had set a deadline for the nuclear talks in the Austrian capital Vienna. Iran's chief nuclear negotiator was due to return to Vienna on Sunday evening for the talks. UAE not taking sides in Ukraine war, senior official says The United Arab Emirates wants to encourage a political solution for the Ukraine war and taking sides would only encourage violence, a senior UAE official said on Sunday. Background: The comment, posted by Anwar Gargash on Twitter, comes after the UAE abstained from a Friday vote  on a draft United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It did not pass because of Russia's veto. Read full story Why it matters: Gulf Arab states have so far taken a neutral stance between Western allies and Russia, with which they are partners under an oil producers' alliance known as OPEC+. Saudi Arabia and the UAE also have investment and business ties with Moscow. UN Security Council to vote on Houthi arms embargo The Security Council is due to vote Monday on a proposal by the United Arab Emirates to impose an arms embargo on Yemen's Houthis after the group claimed several drone and missile assaults on the country this year. Background: A year ago, the US revoked a designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization over concerns that it would worsen Yemen's humanitarian crisis. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and some US lawmakers are pressing the White House to return the Houthi movement to the US list of foreign terrorist groups over the recent Houthi attacks on the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Why it matters: The measure would expand a targeted UN arms embargo on several Houthi leaders to the whole group. The measure needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by any of the Security Council's permanent members -- Russia, the US, Britain, France or China. Around the region A view shows the ancient city of Hatra in Iraq, once destroyed by Islamic State militants years ago, during a ceremony revealing a renovation project on February 24. Iraqi archaeological authorities reopened a site at the ancient city of Hatra last week following the partial completion of a renovation project of the site once destroyed by ISIS militants years ago, Reuters reports. Officials say nearly 15% of the site was destroyed by ISIS militants, who took over large swathes of the country. Images published online in 2015 allegedly showed what is described as ISIS militants destroying statues and artifacts at the site with sledgehammers and pickaxes. The renovation project is carried out in cooperation with the Italian International Association for Mediterranean and Oriental Studies (ISMEO). Only 5% of the destruction has been renovated and the rest of the project is underway, officials added. Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site, was among many sites destroyed by ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria, including the 2,700-year-old city of Khorsabad famed for its colossal statues of human-headed winged bulls. ISIS once ruled a self-declared caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria which contain some of the richest archaeological treasures on earth, where ancient Assyrian empires built their capitals, Greco-Roman civilization flourished and Muslim and Christian sects co-existed for centuries.

Our land, our animals and our house. What else do we have anyway?\"Hundreds of miles west, in the tourist hotspot of Bodrum, more than 1,000 people were evacuated by boat on both Sunday and Saturday to escape the wildfires. At least eight people have died in more than 100 blazes that broke out earlier this week, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The flames have been fueled by scorching summer temperatures and conditions that experts say have been worsened by climate change.Seven people were killed in the fires in Manavgat, Antalya Province, and the eighth victim died in Marmaris, Anadolu reported. The latest victims include a Turkish-German couple who were found in a house, it said.A vehicle burned in the fire that broke out in Mugla's Marmaris district in Turkey on July 30.Read MoreTwo firefighters died battling the blazes on Saturday, according to the Turkish Agriculture and Forestry Ministry.The ministry said that 111 fires have burned across the country since Wednesday, while six fires are still burning in three different cities as of Sunday.Evacuation by seaOn Turkey's Mediterranean coast, more than 1,100 people were evacuated from the tourist resort of Bodrum by sea on Sunday for the second-straight day.\"We helped the evacuation of 1,140 people by 12 boats,\" Orhan Dinc, the president of the Bodrum Maritime Chamber, told CNN. \"We did evacuation by boats yesterday as well, but I have never witnessed something similar before in this region. This is the first time,\" he said.Dinc said that while roads remain open and evacuations continue by land, evacuation by sea helps keep roads clear for fire trucks and ambulances.  Bodrum also evacuated 1,100 people using more than 20 boats on Saturday, the city's Mayor Ahmet Aras said. Bodrum is a popular destination for both Turkish and foreign tourists. Plumes of smoke from a wildfire are seen near a residential area in the holiday resort of Bodrum, on Saturday July 31.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared parts of five provinces on Turkey's Mediterranean coast \"disaster zones,\" following a helicopter visit to the devastated areas. \"We will continue to take all steps to heal the wounds of our people, to compensate for losses and to improve opportunities to better than before,\" the president added in a tweet Saturday.'Gone, gone, it's gone'The largest fire, in Manavgat, killed at least three people, according to the Turkish Natural Disaster and Emergency Directorate.In the nearby village of Kacarlar, residents are grappling with seeing homes they built by hand burn to the ground.Gulay Kacar, 48, told CNN: \"Everything is going to burn. Our land, our animals and our house.\"\"My father's house burned down,\" said 48-year-old Gulay Kacar. \"Gone, gone, it's gone,\" Kacar said, before adding that she was \"running to let the animals loose.\"Namet Atik, a 37-year-old farmer from a neighboring village, said that he came to Kacarlar to help. \"Whatever this village needs ... we are here for them,\" he told CNN\"We get them water, our cars, tractors, saws,\" he added. \"We are forest villagers. Our livelihood is the forest. If this fire runs, there is no return.\"Around 4,000 personnel, along with hundreds of emergency vehicles, have been deployed by the government to help fight the flames this week. At least 77 houses have been damaged in the province of Antalya, and more than 2,000 farm animals have died, Turkey's Agriculture and Forestry Minister, Bekir Pakdemirli, told journalists on Thursday.Firefighters try to get the fire under control in Kirli village near the town of Manavgat, in Antalya province, early Friday July 30.A helicopter fights wildfires in Kacarlar village, near the Mediterranean coastal town of Manavgat, on Saturday, July 31.Scorching temperatures Hot and dry weather conditions had exacerbated the fires, Pakdemirli said on Thursday. He added that temperatures of 37 Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit), less than 14% humidity and winds around 50 kilometers per hour (31 m.p.h.) had helped spread the flames.Hikmet Ozturk, a forestry expert with the Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion, a nongovernmental organization that works to protect forests, told CNN that while 95% of fires in Turkey are caused by people, the spread of the fires is worsened by climate change.The area of the fires are within the Mediterranean Basin which is one of the most susceptible to climate change risks, Ozturk said. \"Typical weather conditions in the summer for the area is hot and dry, which means the risk of fires is already high, and climate change raises that risk,\" he saidThe wildfires come as parts of western Europe have battle severe flooding in recent weeks. Scientists have for decades warned that climate change will make extreme weather events, including heavy rain and deadly flooding, more likely.CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Arwa Damon reported from Turkey.

        "content": "(CNN)I love Baghdad. It's the city where I feel most at home. I can't quite explain it, perhaps it's because it's the place whose people, whose story -- tragic as it is -- has had the most influence on who I am today.I have a rolodex of memories, many of them fraught with the sort of pain that grips you by the throat. I'll never forget the piercing wail of a woman falling to the ground, her hijab tumbling off, her auburn hair spilling out, as she screamed with an agony the depths of which I had never heard. We were outside a hospital in Samarra in 2004; her brother was one of the dead inside, killed as the US military tried to take the city back from Sunni insurgents.I can still remember how speechless I was when one of our Iraqi staff walked into the bureau looking pale and shellshocked and told us how they found his cousin's decapitated body. I can see the bloody handprints on the wall in the back of a church, in a room where people tried to hide as armed men gunned them down.Read MoreMuch has changed in the last 18 years, and much has been done to create an appearance of change.The endless bombings, day after day, flesh splattered across buildings, hanging from lampposts and trees. The shock as Iraqis watched their country unravel, gripped by such violence and cruelty that neighbors turned on each other, families were ripped apart and friends became enemies, as fear and mistrust tore at the fabric of society they thought they knew so well. Amid the rubble of Mosul, Pope Francis declares hope 'more powerful than hatred'While Iraq still needs to reckon with that chapter of its dark history that has defined much of what the country is today, it does not define what its people mean to me, or to so many of us who spent years reporting from there. It is a history that has taught its people to find snippets of happiness in the smallest of things, to fully enjoy what others take for granted so that each moment is lived to the fullest because one never knows when it might end. Iraqis chase laughter, albeit often the product of a carefully crafted dark sense of humor that provides a brief escape from reality. Much has changed in the last 18 years, and much has been done to create an illusion of change. The younger generation, who do not remember much of life under Saddam Hussein, are fighting to smash that illusion and make it a reality. Each trip into Iraq will set off a rollercoaster of emotions for me.They are the ones whose lives are more defined by the US-led invasion, of Iraq's sectarian bloodletting of the country's faltering democracy project, of openness to the outside world through the internet and social media.I first met Noof Assi a decade ago when she was 21 years old. When she was in her teens the streets around her high school were regularly lined with corpses; in the end, she stopped crying when she witnessed death or saw the dead. That was not a price that she or any Iraqis were ever asked if they were willing to pay. She longed to sleep without medication, to wake up in a home that gave her love and hope, without the constant fear of ending up in a grave. And yet she fought for the Iraq she dreamed of, demonstrating to demand basic services and government reforms. Today, Noof says she has recovered her empathy, what she describes as her \"lost humanity.\" She has not given up on the fight for a better Iraq. We spoke in February standing in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, once the epicenter of the more recent demonstrations that broke out in 2019 and cost hundreds of lives, now permanently lined with riot police.Noof says: \"If you look at it overall, nothing has changed. But our lives, the way we look at things, our perspectives have changed... and the way that the system looks at us, the youth, the new generations, that has changed.\"One of Noof's friends was killed in Tahrir Square when a tear gas canister penetrated his skull. She constantly asks herself if it was all worth it -- losing all these people. She doesn't know the answer yet.  Iraqis, and those of us who cover Iraq, are also constantly asked: \"Was it better under Saddam or now?\" It's not a yes or no answer. To quote our dear friend and colleague Mohammed Tawfeeq, who was the cornerstone of our Iraq coverage before he got asylum in the US: \"Why do we have to choose between two nightmares? Why are these the only options? Why don't we have a third option?\" I know that each trip into Iraq will set off a rollercoaster of emotions -- a ride that Iraqis have been on for decades, one that I end up joining for a brief period of time. It will bring with it sorrow, whether it's in the stories that people share, or the frustration and anger at still having to fight for the life that they deserve, at broken dreams and promises, at corrupt politicians, outside interferences, militias and extremists groups. But it will equally bring with it moments of awe, sidesplitting laughter, and hilarious shenanigans in the most unexpected places.Noof Assi, one of the Iraqi activists we interviewed.I remember being under siege by ISIS in Mosul in November 2016 along with the Iraqi special forces unit we were embedded with, giggling and cracking inappropriate jokes with the matriarch of the house as we huddled under a pile of blankets. I remember the evening Iraq's soccer team won the Asia Cup in 2007, and going on patrol with the US military in a neighborhood controlled by militias, being sprayed with silly string by individuals who on any other day would likely have been spraying bullets.Iraqis cannot be put into neatly defined boxes -- such as sect or ethnicity -- that the US, Western powers and many expert analysts like to shove them into. They cannot be separated into black and white definitions, or even varying shades of gray. They are a complex tapestry of a million colors, woven together in a design that is, in many ways, yet to be defined. And I know that if ordinary Iraqis were ever given the chance, a real chance, of building the country that so many of them dream of -- that so many of them thought the fall of Saddam would bring -- that design would be spectacular.",

        "content": "Mosul, Iraq (CNN)For more than 28 hours, CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon and photojournalist Brice Laine were with Iraqi special forces during their push into ISIS-held Mosul. It was a new phase of the liberation operation -- switching from villages and open terrain to a dense city that a well-equipped ISIS is determined to defend. Their convoy was leading the operation Friday when it came under attack multiple times. Vehicles were destroyed, soldiers were hurt. Troops and journalists sought shelter in a succession of houses, calling for backup again and again. Inside the armored vehicles, hiding with families in houses, Arwa Damon kept notes amid the heat of the battle. Here is her account, with occasional strong language. It has been lightly edited for clarity. Friday, 9 a.m.Read MoreWe are in Samah, in the east of Mosul.Soldiers are spotting suspected ISIS fighters down side roads. A frantic radio call: \"Yellow car to the right.\" For more than 28 hours, CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon and photojournalist Brice Laine were with Iraqi special forces during their push into ISIS-held Mosul. Their convoy was leading the operation Friday when it came under attack multiple times. Here, on Friday at 9 a.m., soldiers make a frantic radio call: \"Yellow car to the right.\"\"Another two cars on the right -- a Kia and a white one,\" spots the soldier next to me. He sees a third car and calls it over the radio. \"Three cars, disappeared into the side streets.\" The gunfire is all over the place. It's nonstop. Our MRAP armored vehicle is filled with the smell of gunfire from all the shooting outside.Mosul's bloody streets could quickly derail Iraqi forces9:30 a.m.A voice comes over the ISIS radio frequency that the Iraqis are monitoring: \"I am surrounded.\" We have no idea where he might be. A bulldozer is with our convoy, heading up the side streets.9:54 a.m.Samah is now behind us. Hay al-Ulamaa is ahead of us.9:56 a.m. Some voice coming through on the monitored ISIS radio: \"Save me, need medical.\" The voice is very choppy, frantic.9:57 a.m.We're moving into Kirkukli neighborhood.The roads are quite narrow. There are some open lots, but the roads the convoy is winding through are narrow with low-hanging electrical cablesRadio call: There is a car bomb in Khadraa neighborhood.10:03 a.m.We just emerged onto a large road between two neighborhoods.The gunfire is much more intense -- a lot is outgoing fire. The incoming makes ping sounds as it hits the side of our vehicle. 10:37 a.m.We've stopped. \"Sniper on the right.\" I need to pee.A bearded man comes out of a house next to where we are stopped and hangs up a white flag.A white rag was hung outside a home next to where Arwa and her team are stationed.\"Do not allow the civilians to leave,\" comes the radio call. \"It's too dangerous for them.\" Gunfire is erupting again. It's the constant cacophony of war. From the monitored ISIS radio channel: \"Get ready to fire mortars.\" The soldiers radio a warning to the entire unit.11 a.m.There's a massive firefight down a street.We go into the house of the man who hung the flag. It's actually a rag he tied to a pole. His family cowers inside.The man's daughter, Nour, is 19. She can't stop crying -- afraid of the shooting and that the soldiers will take her father away.The man who hung the white rag on the pole walks back into his house after bringing out tea for the soldiers.The man gives the soldiers tea and biscuits. Outside, the shooting continues down a main road.We go out.Two soldiers drag a body back. It's a wounded man, an older man. No one knows who he is. He was driving a yellow taxi toward the troops. They ordered him to stop and then fired. Brice filmed the whole thing. He had stopped his car, started quickly walking towards us. One soldier shouted for him to stop, another to sit, another to come. Bullets fly. He falls into a ditch. One soldier screams: \"Why did you shoot him?\"The driver died shortly after.Two soldiers drag a wounded man across a road. The man was fired upon after driving a taxi toward the troops. The man later died.11:27 a.m. The shooting continues.The old man's body is wrapped in a pink floral blanket. The medic next to him is cutting and folding bandages. The body of the man who had been driving the taxi is wrapped in a pink floral blanket.The soldiers are chatting. Now that there is a break, they are asking us where we are from and if we are married. 11:46 a.m.Everyone scrambles for the vehicles.The gunfire just got too intense -- grenades thrown into the street right behind us. At least three of them. Second Lieutenant Wael Saheb-Ali is hurt -- a chunk of shrapnel flew across the back of the vehicle, lodging itself above his left eye. Just a minute earlier, he was telling Brice that he was recently engaged and wants to get married and have children as soon as the war is over.Brice films a gun battle down the street.Another jumps into the armored vehicle with some shrapnel to the thigh. Another explosion just outside the window. Another grenade. They want to make it across the street, where the shooting is heaviest, to treat the injuries, but we can't move.An ISIS radio voice asks for backup.A captain we are with takes a selfie with us, then yells for a route to be opened up so we can move out. He scrolls through pictures of his family, shows me a photo of his wife and his six kids. He was born in 1984. He tells me I look 46. For the record, I am 39.11:57 a.m We are about to cross the main road.Or not. We are still in the same spot. Air is thick with that smell of munitions. It sort of sticks in your nose; it's very distinctive.12:05 p.m.It's gone silent. Somehow that's creepier than the firefights. A couple of shots ring out. 12:11 p.m. We made it across the street, shots pinging off the armored vehicle.\"Did you see them?\" the men ask each other.\"Two or three, around 100 meters from us.\" 12:31 p.m.A massive flash of orange.A massive explosion just as we were stopped.My ears are ringing.The door to the vehicle couldn't come up fast enough.Everyone is coughing from the dust and dirt kicked up by the blast.Out the back window I saw a family running, a family with kids.It was a suicide car bomber, the soldiers said.I can't stop thinking about that family. And all the others. 12:36 p.m. Another massive explosion. I just saw the aftermath of the first one. A Humvee behind us is immobile. Soldiers are running for cover. One helping another who must be wounded.The aftermath of a suicide car bomb is seen through a window.12:40 p.m.Our communications are down. \"We are in a bad place,\" the driver says.That is not what anyone wants to hear. Something just went off in front of us. Now we can hear the hiss of incoming fire.12:45 p.m.Radio communications are back up.\"There are no aircraft. We are under heavy fire,\" the captain says into the radio. \"Mortars, grenades, suicide bomber.\" Our tire is shot out ... we hear the hiss of the air going out.We are trapped. All we can do is watch the street corners for car bombs. Wait for rockets, mortars, missiles.12:56 p.m.They need to evacuate the wounded, but they can't. Radio calls are getting a bit frantic. The battalion commander may have been wounded. 1:12 p.m. The Humvee a couple of vehicles down is on fire. The blaze is massive. There are small explosions coming from it. We don't know what caused the explosions. We're told that the soldiers inside managed to get out of it before it exploded.Two Humvees are moving up. 1:21 p.m.A commander is on the radio, trying to bolster morale. \"You liberated all of Iraq. A burning Humvee -- this should drive you forward. You are special forces. You are the heroes of Iraq. You freed all of Iraq. The entire world is watching you.\" 1:41 p.m.A motorcycle lays abandoned on the ground. The driver jumped from it while it was still moving and ran away. A motorcycle just came at the convoy. Soldiers fired. Brice sees it happening, the driver, in his mid-40s, long beard and traditional \"Afghan\" clothing, jumps from his moving bike and runs away. His bike is now lying on its side. The soldiers fear it is loaded with explosives, but it does not blow up. 1:55 p.m. This fight is nothing like that of the outskirts. This is in the side streets, against an enemy that knows them and rules the rooftops.Holy shit. That is the craziest crap I have seen. A white car just went flying down the side street in front of us. Right between the battalion. Then a rocket-propelled grenade came flying in.They keep calling for air power. This fight is nothing like that of the outskirts. This is in the side streets against an enemy that knows them and rules the rooftops. The rooftops of homes that have civilians inside. \"There is heavy incoming, heavy incoming,\" the captain calls on the radio. \"We need air power now! We are getting hit from all sides.\" 2:13 p.m.We just took a direct hit. I don't know what it was. My ears are ringing. Brice has a small wound on the side of his head.Brice sits with a head injury at a civilian house after their MRAP (Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected) vehicle took a direct hit.The captain has a head wound. One of the guys is hit in his shoulder.I have blood on me, but it's not mine.3:06 p.m.We are in a civilian house, crowded into a room with the family that lives here.The mother and five children are all huddled into a corner, almost as if they are trying to make themselves as small as possible.The guys we are with are here, too. They don't have vehicles to evacuate -- all their vehicles were ruined, there are only three left that are mobile.3:10 p.m. That was an airstrike, or so they said. There are two families here -- two neighbors. The women and six kids are all crammed behind the dresser.3:45 p.m.The family living in the house in which the team was stationed served everyone fried eggs and bread, despite their lack of food supplies.The family we are with made fried eggs and bread for everyone. Even in the worst of times people who have nothing will give everything. The jets are buzzing overhead now. 3:51 p.m.Radio call: \"The jets are overhead. It's almost over. They are almost finished in your area.\"Crazy outgoing fire again. I think backup may have finally arrived.4:05 p.m.A vehicle burns down the street.\"Is that my vehicle on fire?\" a soldier walks in and asks. There is gunfire everywhere again. One of the soldiers says ISIS is filming the burning vehicles. \"How do you know?\" I ask. There is a tall building, I am sure they are. They did this before, he says. They started to move the wounded, but there is too much incoming fire.\"Are you leaving with the wounded?\" I'm asked.\"Yes please.\" Brice notes that it will be dark in an hour and a half. The blood has dried on his face. 4:12 p.m.There is no backup yet. Time is going by very slowly. Explosions are shaking this house. 4:19 p.m.It's the counterterrorism guys. Or so they tell each other. The commander is here somewhere on this block. The backup unit is 100 meters away, they say, but can't get here. \"We don't even have vehicles to withdraw,\" one says. A radio call about an attack from the rear. And fire from the right and left. 4:29 p.m. There are still a lot of explosions. Some so powerful they are shaking the house. The kids are screaming.5:04 p.m.We have no other choice. We are surrounded. A soldier, himself just shot in the leg, came to clean up Brice. And then there was another explosion. And more wounded came in. They have a plan. They need to clear a couple of blocks to reach another of the units. \"We have no other choice. We are surrounded.\"5:38 p.m. We have been moved to another house, maybe 10 meters down the road. We had to jump into a Humvee. The guys are really looking out for us. We are now with the wounded in what feels like the last house standing. The entire road outside is littered with the wreckage of the convoy. Broken down and burnt-out vehicles. The gunfire is endless.There is another family here in the room next door. No one was under any illusion that the battle for Mosul was going to be easy or simple, but I think the ferocity of it is really driving home how tough this fight is going to be. Faces are somber. The men around us are all moaning in pain. 5:56 p.m.\"We should have split up and taken three or four roads, not all come down one. We should have secured the homes,\" says Lt. Ahmed, who treated Brice. It turns out he's not a medic but he's been helping everyone.We are sitting on a rickety, white metal swing. The sun has gone down and we can see the sliver of a crescent moon. They have moved some of the wounded to the entrance -- maybe help or transport is on the way. They have 20 or more wounded, Ahmed says. One dead. 6:05 p.m.They are moving the wounded. I think to up the street a little. And they said the major took two Humvees to get the Diyala battalion. Their communications are down. Our Thuraya satellite phone died hours ago. 6:20 p.m. The walking wounded are trading stories. About how groups of ISIS fighters, each with three to four men, are hiding in homes. Even homes with civilians in them. The commander comes in and tells the walking wounded they need to swap guard duty. \"Is backup coming or is it a lie?\" one soldier demands to know. 7:34 p.m.We just drove the gauntlet in a Humvee with the wounded and one body. We arrived at another house with the wounded. It's quiet back here. The family whose home it is has kind gentle faces.  I am calling the matriarch Umm Abdullah -- she doesn't want her identity disclosed, and the family doesn't want to be filmed. They are still scared ISIS might come back. We talk and laugh. We tell random stories. About how schools are closed so the boys haven't been to university but their mom still wants them to marry. About how the family hid their satellite dish from ISIS. About how the husband looks so much better clean shaven and wondering when ISIS will be guaranteed gone so he can get the beard off. The family feeds everyone even though they have so little. We talk about favorite foods, giggling over different accents and pronunciations. They have that dark but utterly charming Iraqi humor.\"Come, I will cradle you to sleep,\" Umm Abdullah says. \"But I am too fat! I might roll on you and squish you!\" Her daughter-in-law models the head-covering ISIS would make them wear. Then she asks why my hair isn't white yet. Her hair is, and she's 46. We joke it's the ISIS effect.11:15 p.m.It's going off again outside. This is supposed to the backup coming.\"We are fucked,\" a soldier says on the phone. \"We have been besieged for 10 hours. We have 20 wounded, we have no vehicles left.\"Brice asks if it's worth filming. He's sleepy and in pain.

We still have a full night of this?\"This family has nothing left. They sold their gold and car to make money. Why didn't you leave, I ask. The father worked at the electrical company. It was a good salary but then the salary stopped. By then it was too late. The kids don't flinch or cry. Everyone quickly falls back asleep. Saturday, 8:11 a.m.There is still no backup.Arwa and the team sit while waiting for backup.We keep being told that it's coming. The soldiers are hearing the same thing but everyone's reaction is similar. \"Yeah, yeah, they said that 20 hours ago.\" The guys are all talking. \"The men only have two magazines left, and they are one or two houses away from us.\" Then they saw a group of 10 moving across the rooftops. \"This is nothing,\" says a soldier. He's 25. \"We might spend three or four months like this.\" 8:20 a.m.They cleared some roads and then blocked them with the bulldozer, one man says. But overnight, ISIS removed the blockade. He laughs, wincing at the pain in his side -- he has two gunshot wounds, he says. 8:34 a.m. Suicide car bombs are spotted coming. It's gone mad outside.The mom of the family is crying. \"We aren't going to survive. We need to get out of here. Even if three or four of us die, the rest will survive.\" A machine gun is going off. \"Save the rounds, save the rounds,\" someone says. Umm Abdullah is praying under her breath. 8:39 a.m.Explosions shake the house. Umm Abdullah, who had stayed inside, not wanting to show the troops her face, now heads out to beg them for help. \"Don't worry, no one will get to you, we are here,\" she's told. We want to believe him. We -- us, the family, even the soldiers -- all want to believe him. 8:48 a.m.Time is crawling again. The family is crying, hiding under the stairs. They are begging to go to their neighbors. But each time they try to make a run for it, the fighting is too intense. The kids are crying. They don't want to die. 9 a.m.Three sand-colored Humvees are circling. The soldiers say they are not theirs; they are suicide bombs. A strike hits something massive. One of the Humvees in front of the house is hit. 9:15 a.m. More frantic calls telling commanders they are going to die, they are going to run out of ammunition. Anyone who can fight go to the roof, anyone who can fire -- to the roof. 9:30 a.m.A grenade or a mortar lands in the courtyard outside. More people are wounded. The guys want airstrikes. One soldier is angry.  \"ISIS uses the white flag and hides its fighters and they attack us. It happened twice yesterday.\"9:50 a.m.The guys are laughing again. Backup is here, finally, 22 hours later. Down one of the streets, they saw Iraqi counterterrorism vehicles, but they need to circle around. It was the walking wounded who held this position -- them and the handful of soldiers who survived unscathed.\"This is nothing,\" Lt. Ahmed says. \"In Baiji refinery we were like this for four months. They were air-dropping supplies.\"He has an able air about him that gives confidence to the men. He is calming and confident. Shot in the leg but still fighting. \n\n9:58 a.m. And then it kicks off again. The family is hiding in the small bathroom. The whoosh of a coalition airstrike. There have been a couple o",

In his role for the network, he has filed reports over the years from dangerous conflict zones, including Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.Hall currently serves as Fox's State Department correspondent. He is also the author of \"Inside ISIS: The Brutal Rise of a Terrorist Army.\"Iryna Venediktova, prosecutor general of Ukraine, said in a Facebook post that the attack on Hall was more evidence of Russia's violence against civilians. Venediktova said she intends to focus \"on those war crimes that have affected the citizens of our partner countries,\" according to a Google translation of her post.Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents Association, also spoke out Monday about the attack.\"We are horrified to learn that our fellow correspondent Benjamin Hall was injured as he covered the Ukraine war,\" Tandon said in a statement. \"We know Ben for his warmth, good humor and utmost professionalism.

        "content": "New York (CNN Business)Earlier this week, the right-wing organization Project Veritas released two undercover videos capturing Matthew Rosenberg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times, making a number of disparaging comments about his colleagues and the news media writ large. The videos caused a stir inside The Times due, in part, to the inappropriate comments Rosenberg made about his fellow reporters. But, according to people familiar with the matter, it was seen by many journalists at The Times as part of a broader harassment and intimidation campaign Project Veritas has waged against the newspaper for reporting extensively on the inner-workings of the group. The right-wing group, headed by conservative activist James O'Keefe, has over the past year targeted three reporters in particular: Adam Goldman, Mark Mazzetti, and Michael Schmidt. Those three reporters, all Pulitzer Prize winners themselves, stand out because they are the journalists at The Times who have authored a series of expos\u00e9s revealing how Project Veritas employs spy tactics and relies on ethically dubious reporting strategies to target perceived liberals.Mazzetti and Goldman first reported in March 2020 that Erik Prince, founder of the controversial private security company formerly known as Blackwater, had helped Project Veritas recruit former American and British spies to train the group's operatives.Read MoreThat story was followed by a series of others about the group, including one in which they reported that Project Veritas had executed so-called \"honey pot\" operations, a tactic that involves using an undercover agent who pretends to be romantically interested in someone, then exploits that relationship to extract information from them.In a November story, Goldman and Mazzetti, sourcing in part from internal Project Veritas legal memos the paper's journalists obtained, reported that the group has worked \"with lawyers to gauge how far its deceptive reporting practices could go before running afoul of federal laws.\"And Schmidt has separately authored stories with Goldman on how federal authorities who are investigating the theft of a diary belonging to President Joe Biden's daughter have executed search warrants targeting locations associated with Project Veritas.  The stories have evidently gotten under the skin of O'Keefe and his organization. Project Veritas sued The Times in late 2020 for defamation over an article written by a different reporter, a case that the newspaper has fought in court. Then late last year, after the publication of Goldman and Mazzetti's November story, the right-wing group asked the court to stop the paper from publishing memos prepared by Project Veritas lawyers, arguing that the newspaper had violated Veritas' attorney-client privilege by publishing such material.  The latest dispute has raised significant First Amendment concerns and is being closely watched by press advocates because a New York state judge had initially ordered The Times to cease publishing stories based on the Project Veritas documents it had obtained. An appeals court later stayed the order. The case remains ongoing in court.But while Project Veritas has been attempting to muzzle The Times through the judicial system, it has also executed what amounts to a public harassment campaign against Goldman, Mazzetti, and Schmidt. O'Keefe has even publicly signaled that he has trained his sights on the reporters, mocking them all in an on-screen graphic featured in a recent Project Veritas video that dubbed the journalists \"The NYT Hardy Boys.\" When O'Keefe publicly targets a journalist, it often \u2014 if not always -\u2014 prompts a flood of harassment against the reporter. The volume of harassment has the potential to discourage reporting about O'Keefe and Project Veritas, though it has failed to deter The Times reporters. People familiar with the matter told CNN that The Times reporters have continued to report on Project Veritas in the face of, as one of the sources described it, a \"barrage\" of \"constant\" harassment. But the Project Veritas campaign has resulted in heightened vigilance among prominent Washington reporters, the people said.That is, in part, because Goldman, Mazzetti, and Schmidt have all been prominently featured in videos that Project Veritas has released.In the latest video, released Thursday, O'Keefe confronted Mazzetti at a coffee shop where the journalist was working. O'Keefe proceeded to make a video in which he sat directly next to Mazzetti and made disparaging comments about him, Goldman, and The Times.Throughout the confrontation, Mazzetti attempted to ignore O'Keefe and continue working. Mazzetti eventually left the coffee shop, but O'Keefe followed him with a film crew and continued to pester him. Mazzetti remained silent, making it clear that he was not going to engage, but O'Keefe badgered him with a series of leading questions anyway. Screen shot from Project Veritas video that features the group's leader James O'Keefe (R) and the New York Times' Mark Mazzetti.In February, Project Veritas published a video in which Schmidt attempted to recruit as a source a person associated with Project Veritas. The video didn't capture Schmidt saying anything inappropriate. In fact, it showed Schmidt level with the person with whom he was speaking, telling him that his \"only goal\" was to report an accurate story. Nevertheless, O'Keefe used it as an opportunity to mock both Schmidt and Goldman. In a video released last March, O'Keefe boasted that The Times had issued a correction when Mazzetti and Goldman misidentified the age of a Project Veritas operative. She was 25 and the duo reported she was 23. (The article also carried a headline, The Times said in its correction, that \"misstated the origin of information about Erik Prince's role in recruiting a former spy.\" The Times said in its correction that \"the information came from source interviews, not documents in a lawsuit.\")O'Keefe said in the video that he had hung the correction above the Project Veritas office toilet so that when people \"take a poop\" it would be visible. The video also showed O'Keefe confronting Goldman, who was reporting a story on Project Veritas at the time, on a phone call and asking why he refused to be recorded. The Times views the targeting of Goldman, Mazzetti, and Schmidt as a harassment campaign that is aimed at retaliating against the journalists for their reporting, people familiar with the matter told CNN.A spokesperson for The Times did not provide a comment for the story. The spokesperson did not respond when asked if Rosenberg, Goldman, Mazzetti, or Schmidt had any comment. But Dean Baquet, executive editor of The Times, has previously denounced O'Keefe and Project Veritas. In 2017, Baquet said he found O'Keefe and Project Veritas to both be \"despicable.\" At the time, Baquet went so far as to say Project Veritas had committed a \"mortal sin\" when it sent a \"young woman\" to trick a young reporter into saying \"really stupid stuff\" on undercover film.In a statement provided to CNN, O'Keefe asserted that it was The Times that had harassed him and his organization. O'Keefe said that The Times is like \"an elite Ivy League frat house, which thinks it's above scrutiny.\" O'Keefe added in his statement, \"We have only just begun.\"O'Keefe has targeted other news organizations in the past, including CNN, which he is also suing for alleged defamation. That case, which CNN is aggressively fighting in court, remains ongoing.Project Veritas uses its stings against news organizations to fundraise. For instance, the blog post on the Project Veritas website featuring the Rosenberg video asked supporters to submit a donation \"to support our mission.\"The stings against news organizations also generate a lot of publicity and attention for Project Veritas. They have often been featured prominently on Fox and receive significant attention in the right-wing media universe.",

You can sign up for free right here.The traffic to the cancellation page for Spotify Premium has jumped in recent weeks as the audio streaming company faces a wave of backlash over its support for podcaster Joe Rogan, an analytics firm told CNN.The analytics firm, SimilarWeb, told CNN Tuesday night that it had seen traffic to the cancellation page spike 196% week-over-week in its most recent set of data.That set of data compared traffic from the week starting on January 17 to traffic from the week starting January 24. In the week of the 17th, 39,924 visits to the page were recorded. In the week of the 24th, 118,168 visits were recorded.Spokespeople for Spotify didn't return requests for comment.Read MoreSpotify Premium monthly fees start at $9.99 and go up to $15.99 for a family plan. There is also a free version. The company said in its most recent earnings report that it had hit 180 million paying subscribers, meaning that even if all the recent visits to the page represented actual cancellations for its paid product, it would likely not cause much damage to its bottom line. And there's no way to be sure, at least for now, how many of those visits to the cancellation page actually resulted in a cancellation.Still, the increased traffic to the page is notable.Seema Shah, who leads SimilarWeb's research team, told CNN that she hasn't seen something like this in Spotify's history.\"This is a huge spike,\" she said. \"It implies people were passionate about the issue and took immediate action. We'll see if it keeps rising.\"The traffic, which has shown no signs of slowing down, could also ramp up as Rogan continues to face criticism for having used racial slurs in episodes of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" years ago.Rogan, whose contract with Spotify is worth a reported $100 million, apologized on Saturday for using the slurs on Saturday, admitting he \"f*ed up.\"Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, additionally attempted to quell the controversy Sunday night by telling employees that his team had spoken to Rogan and that the episodes had been removed from the platform's library. Ek also said that the language did not represent Spotify's values.The controversy, however, is still roiling the company.Neil Young, who drew attention to the anti-vaccine rhetoric on Rogan's podcast by pulling his entire library from Spotify, this week encouraged more recording artists to leave the platform. Young's initial decision came after a group of more than 250 scientists, doctors, nurses and researchers wrote an open letter to Spotify to call out the Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories that Rogan promotes on his podcast.Young also encouraged Spotify employees to depart the company before \"it eats up your soul.\"\"Be free and take the good path,\" Young said.",

        "content": "(CNN)Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta says footballers are ready and \"waiting\" to take part in another social media boycott if companies don't clamp down on abuse on their platforms.Earlier this year, players, clubs in the Premier League, English Football League, Women's Super League and Women's Championship, along with the game's governing bodies and organizations such as Kick It Out, turned off their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts for three days.In a joint statement at the time, the group said the boycott hoped to \"emphasise that social media companies must do more to eradicate online hate.\"However, a number of players -- including Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka and Wilfried Zaha -- have since still be subjected to racist abuse on social media.When asked if another boycott was something players would consider, Azpilicueta replied: \"If we have to, yes of course. Social media is in our lives and as I said before, the clubs, Premier League, players, we are part of it. Read More\"We have millions of followers from everywhere, but if it's the only way that we can get the attention that we want and get the social media platform's commitment to make it better, of course. You know, we did it a few months ago and now we are waiting [if] we have to do it again.\"In that moment, when we decided to boycott, it was something really quick. So it's not something that you need a few months to work on. I think if the action is needed, yes [we will do it].\"READ: Chelsea Women's manager Emma Hayes fears social media abuse of players could lead to suicidesCesar Azpilicueta says he would support another social media boycott.\"No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't tolerate it on our apps,\" a Meta company spokesperson told CNN. \"We remove hateful content as soon as we find it and respond quickly to valid legal requests which can help police investigations.\"No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're continuing our work with the industry and Government to help keep our community safe from abuse.\"In a statement sent to CNN, a Twitter spokesperson said: \"It is our top priority to keep everyone who uses Twitter safe and free from abuse. \"While we have made recent strides in giving people greater control to manage their safety, we know there is still work to be done as our product, policy and engineering teams continue to work at scale and pace to build a healthier Twitter.\"Social media identificationAzpilicueta believes \"education of people is key\" to making social media a safer environment, but says some level of identification is needed immediately to help monitor racist abuse and make the police's job easier.Earlier this year, before changing its corporate name to Meta, Facebook said to CNN that requiring users to provide ID could lead to exclusion for disadvantaged social groups which do not have easy access to official documentation, while the ID standard and verification processes differ greatly from country to country.Azpilicueta says he understands that social media companies want as many people as possible using their platforms, but insists something needs to be done to make them safer now.\"As a parent talking, you know, my kids, they are already using technology, so they are very used to it and I wasn't when I was a kid -- who knows [what will happen] in a few years time,\" he says.\"So for me, identification on social media should be key, to at least to have your name, your details and then if you do some kind of abuse or hate, they can prosecute you \"This, I think, will reduce [abuse] a lot, because we have seen many users hiding with different names and they just send messages.\"I think we have to create an environment where everybody is safer,\" he adds. \"We've seen that on social media you have very young kids up to whatever age, there is no limit.\"READ: Romelu Lukaku urges social media CEOs to sit down with players to stop online abuseCesar Azpilicueta supports the idea of identification for social media users.The 32-year-old Azpilicueta wants companies to take players' views on board, as another boycott would be detrimental to the club's ability to utilize one of social media's greatest benefits -- reaching supporters all over the world\"I hope that they listen because as well as the clubs, players have a huge amount of followers,\" said Azpilicueta, who is involved in Chelsea's No To Hate campaign.\"We did the boycott for three days a few months ago, but of course we use our social media as a club and as players to reach fans from everywhere, which is fantastic. \"You can engage with fans from everywhere in the world, but ... they [social media companies] can do and they must do more to create a safe environment for not only the players, but even the fans.\"Sometimes we see abuse, hate between fans, which cannot happen.

        "content": "(CNN)With less than a year to go before the start of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, questions surrounding host nation Qatar's handling of humanitarian issues show few signs of abating -- specifically concerning the state's anti-homosexuality laws.Nasser Al Khater, the chief executive of the tournament's organizing committee, insists that Qatar has been treated \"unfairly and unjustly\" since it earned the right to host the tournament 11 years ago.\"We know that the World Cup brings with it a certain amount of scrutiny. We've seen it in the past,\" Al Khater told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies. \"But if it's something that's going to be catalyst for change, we're all for it.\"Among the most recent critics of next year's World Cup, the first to be held in the Middle East, is Australian footballer Josh Cavallo, the only current, openly gay player in men's top-flight football. Earlier this month, Cavallo said that he would be \"scared\" to play in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. Read MoreIn response to Cavallo's fears, Al Khater said: \"On the contrary, we welcome him here in the state of Qatar, we welcome him to come and see even prior to the World Cup ... Nobody feels threatened here, nobody feels unsafe.\"He added: \"The notion that people don't feel safe here is untrue. I've said this before and I say this to you again, everybody is welcome here. Everybody is welcome here and everybody will feel safe here. Qatar is a tolerant country. It's a welcoming country. It's a hospitable country.\"Al Khater stands in Doha's Khalifa International Stadium in 2017. In October, Welsh football fan James Brinning told CNN Sport that he \"wouldn't feel safe\" traveling to Qatar if Wales qualified for the World Cup due to his sexuality. \"That's really upsetting to think about because I should be able to be a part of such a huge moment in Welsh football history if it happens,\" he said.This is not the first time that anti-LGBTQ laws have been a concern around a major football tournament.In June, European football governing body UEFA declined a request to light up Munich's Allianz Arena in rainbow colors for the Euro 2020 match between Germany and Hungary following an anti-LGBTQ law passed by Hungary's parliament.Then ahead of the 2018 World Cup, the UK Foreign Office warned ahead of the tournament that members of the LGBTQ community face \"significant risk\" in traveling to Russia.  And football is not the only sporting community to raise concerns about Qatar's anti-homosexuality laws. Ahead of Formula One's Qatar Grand Prix on November 21, Lewis Hamilton, who would go on to win the race, was widely praised for wearing a helmet featuring the Pride Progress Flag -- a redesigned and more inclusive version of the traditional rainbow flag -- which was emblazoned with the words \"We Stand Together.\" A clock in Doha counts down the days until the start of the World Cup. Al Khater acknowledged that Qatar does have a stricter approach towards public displays of affection compared to other countries, and when pressed by CNN on the country's laws, Al Khater declined to say that homosexuality is illegal, saying only that \"like many countries,\" same-sex marriage is illegal in Qatar.\"In different countries, there is more leniency to public displays of affection,\" he said.\"Qatar and the region are a lot more modest, and Qatar and the region are a lot more conservative. And this is what we ask fans to respect. And we're sure that fans will respect that ... We respect different cultures and we expect other cultures to respect ours.\"Over the past decade, Qatar has also been under pressure regarding its treatment of migrant workers involved in constructing World Cup stadiums, with the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently saying that the state is inadequately investigating and reporting workplace deaths.JUST WATCHEDQatar 2022 organizers 'not worried' about potential player protestsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHQatar 2022 organizers 'not worried' about potential player protests 03:28Earlier this year, Barun Ghimire, a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepalese migrants working abroad, told CNN that the plight of Nepalese labor workers is \"particularly grievous in the Gulf.\"\"Migrant workers from the poorest of countries go to Qatar seeking employment,\" he said, adding: \"The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup -- the blood of migrant workers.\" Ghimire stressed, though, that blame shouldn't only be laid on Qatar. He said that the Nepalese government and other countries should also be held accountable for not providing workers with proper protection in their destination countries.In a report released this month, the ILO said that at least 50 of Qatar's workers died in 2020 as gaps in data collection by the country's institutions impeded the organization from presenting a categorical figure on the number of fatal occupational injuries.READ: Norwegian broadcaster slams treatment of its journalists reporting on World Cup but Qatar says they were trespassing illegallyJUST WATCHEDGianni Infantino sees 'great evolution' in Qatar human rightsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGianni Infantino sees 'great evolution' in Qatar human rights 03:59In a statement, Qatar's Ministry of Labour said that \"figures reported in media on migrant worker fatalities have been wildly misleading,\" while Al Khater also refuted that there are gaps in Qatar's reporting of working deaths.\"Our work sites are clear ... They have contractors, they have worker welfare teams on site,\" he said. \"If there was a fatality, everybody would know about it. It's not something you can hide.\"The Guardian reported earlier this year that 6,500 migrant workers have died in the country since Qatar won its bid to host the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat. The report, which CNN has not independently verified, did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects.Al Khater reiterated that he refutes the accuracy of the report, saying: \"I categorically deny The Guardian statements.\" He added: \"This is something that needs to be made absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. The number of fatalities on World Cup stadiums that are related to work are three fatalities. There is just over 30 fatalities that are non-work-related.\"READ: FIFA President Gianni Infantino sees 'great evolution' in Qatar amidst worker death reportsJUST WATCHEDRas Abu Aboud stadium: The World Cup venue designed to be torn downReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRas Abu Aboud stadium: The World Cup venue designed to be torn down 01:14The past few years have seen Qatar implement policies to reform its labor structure. The state's sponsorship system, known as the kafala, was dismantled last year, in part allowing migrant workers to change jobs before the end of their contracts without requiring consent from their employers.Qatar has also introduced a non-discriminatory minimum wage of $275 per month that applies to both migrant labor workers as well as domestic workers -- a policy it claims is the first of its kind in the region.\"The progress that's been made over the 10 previous years by the state of Qatar are not comparable to any progress that's been made anywhere around the world in such a short time frame,\" said Al Khater.\"Enacting legislation usually takes a very long time. It has been put through very quickly in the state of Qatar. They've been put on fast track to make sure that they're implemented.\"A number of national teams, including Denmark, Germany and Norway, have already spotlighted human rights issues ahead of the World Cup.Denmark is the latest to do so after announcing that two kit sponsors will give up branding space on the players' training kit in place of messages highlighting human rights issues in Qatar. The country's football union has also said that it will minimize the number of trips to Qatar to avoid promoting events around the World Cup.

No, I wouldn't say we're worried about it,\" said Al Khater.\"But I think there's a responsibility on these players and there's a responsibility on these federations to make sure that when people are taking positions, they're taking position that are accurate and reflect reality.\"Because regardless of what people feel are facts, people also need to recognize progress, they need to recognize the responsibility that the state of Qatar has taken on its shoulder to progress, to enact laws, to protect worker's rights, their welfare.\"Tuesday marks the start of the Arab Cup involving 16 teams from across the region. It will also see two World Cup venues -- Al Bayt Stadium and Ras Abu Aboud Stadium -- inaugurated on the tournament's opening day.For the Qatar 2022 organizing committee, it provides a chance to trial some of the World Cup venues in advance of next year's competition.\"It's going to be a big test and it's going to be a very useful test,\" says Al Khater.Next year's tournament, however, will be on a different scale to the Arab Cup, with more teams, more fans and more eyes watching around the world.In the meantime, 13 countries have now qualified for the tournament as the protracted countdown for Qatar 2022 rolls on.",

        "content": "(CNN)After becoming the most decorated US track and field athlete in Olympics history, Allyson Felix has cemented her legacy on the track. But the 35-year-old is not just content with excelling in her sport and wants to use her platform for social good. She recently partnered with Anthem, an insurance company that has conducted a study into the social drivers that affect people's health in the US. The campaign hopes to trigger a national conversation about well-being and improve people's awareness of the things in life that can have a negative impact on one's health.  \"It's been really interesting to me that there are these social drivers affecting our health and there are things that we don't really necessarily associate with health,\" she told CNN Sport's Amanda Davies.Read More\"So transportation and air quality and some of these things that you're just born into.\"It's really about taking a holistic approach to our health and, you know, figuring out how we spark conversations to create change for this.\" The study, called Driving our Health, also found racial discrepancies when it came to healthcare statistics, with people of color saying they were more negatively affected by social drivers of health.Felix wants to raise awareness in those communities, something she became passionate about after the birth of her daughter three years ago. In November 2018, the American struggled with preeclampsia and had an emergency C-section at 32 weeks to deliver her daughter. \"Obviously being an athlete and being healthy, living a healthy lifestyle, I never expected to find myself in that position,\" she added.\"And so to be there and to be, you know, so scared and really not feeling like I was educated about the circumstances, it's really opened my eyes to kind of the whole new world of health.\"And really not taking my own health for granted and really wanting to raise awareness around some of these issues.\" Allyson Felix wants to help start conversations about health. Finding her voiceFelix says that becoming a mother helped her find her own voice, and she has been one of the many athletes to speak out against injustice in recent years, notably for women's rights and for racial equality. She says she felt compelled to speak out after the death of George Floyd in 2020 and has continued to use her platform to fight for change.\"I think it can get frustrating sometimes, taking on some of the same issues,\" she said, adding that she was hopeful that she could continue to make a difference.\"But at the same time, I feel it's such a privilege to be able to speak on behalf of others and to really try to fight and to push for certain things.\"It's been a process to get to this point and I've really grown and come into my own. \"I think it was my own personal experiences that really allowed me to say: 'No, I need to come forward and I need to speak on things that are affecting not only myself, but other women and other people within my community.'\" Felix won two more Olympic medals at Tokyo 2020. Biles and OsakaWhile it took Felix until later in her career to speak out, she says she's been proud to watch younger superstars take control of the public narrative. She is particularly inspired by the likes of Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka, who both bucked the trend by addressing their mental health struggles this year.In many ways, Tokyo 2020 will be remembered as a cornerstone for athletes speaking openly about the pressures of competition and Felix says it's about time.  \"I think for a long time, you know, athletes have just been seen as invincible, and we're no different than anybody else and we go through struggles and challenges,\" she said, before explaining how she deals with the pressure. \"I think really making it a priority, making our mental health a priority and understanding when you're not OK and what are the steps and what works for you.\"I know when I have to lean into my support system, when I need to step away.\"Kind of what helps me to be able to thrive and taking that time and taking that space for myself.\"JUST WATCHED'You have to train your brain as much as any muscle'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'You have to train your brain as much as any muscle' 02:47'A real representation for women'Felix, however, enjoyed yet more Olympic success in Japan.She added two medals to her haul -- including a gold in the women's 400m sprint relay -- but such success didn't always look likely. In addition to the complications of returning to the sport with a young daughter, Felix was also forced to adapt her training schedule, practicing on empty soccer fields and beaches during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020.Her husband, Kenneth Ferguson, took leave from his job at Chrysler and the family moved to Los Angeles from Michigan so Felix could train with her coach, Bob Kersee, ahead of competition. Despite all the sacrifice, Felix says it was worth it.\"There were so many amazing moments, and I also felt like a real representation for women and for people who had been told that their journeys and their stories were over,\" she said about what will be her last Olympic Games. \"And so I knew that I would have mixed emotions. You know, it's been a part of my life for so long, but at the same time, there was so much joy and fulfillment in those moments.\"",

Skateboarding is beautiful,\" Brown said.\"There's no age -- just get out there and go for it. Have fun. Enjoy because you love it, take baby steps.\"Even if you're super old like even 80 years old -- there's people skating in Japan that I know that's 80 years old and even Tony Hawk -- he's 50 and he's still ripping it,\" added Brown, referring to the legendary US skateboarder.Sibling rivalry Skating quickly over the implication that 50 is old -- for Hawk's sake more than anyone's -- Brown also shed light on her remarkable Tokyo experience.Having made mistakes in her first two runs, Brown nailed a kickflip Indy en route to a flawless final run that saw the youngster pip 15-year-old Japanese skateboarder Misugu Okamoto to a history-making bronze.The gold medal winner was Okamoto's compatriot Sakura Yosozumi -- who Brown revealed is now one of her \"best friends\" after the Japanese skateboarder played a pivotal role in the Briton's recovery ahead of the final run.\"She [Sakura] is the one who really made me feel like I actually got it,\" Brown said.\"She was giving me a hug and said 'Look into my eyes ... Sky, you got it. We believe in you, we know you're gonna get this, just stick it.' And yeah, she just made me just want to stick it so bad.\"Brown is also an avid surfer with dreams of competing at the Paris Olympics in 2024, though the youngster's hopes of competing across two events may be complicated by the fact that the surfing event is set to take place over 9,000 miles away in Tahiti.

        "content": "(CNN)NATO announced on Monday that some member countries are putting forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to eastern Europe as the United Kingdom and the United States ordered diplomats' families to withdraw from Ukraine amid concerns of a Russian invasion.The developments underscore growing fears of a possible Russian incursion, following months of military maneuvering by Moscow that has set off a tit-for-tat series of escalations with NATO, a military alliance of Western powers. Russia has been building up forces and equipment near its border with Ukraine since last year, and is sending troops into neighboring Belarus for joint exercises next month that Ukrainian officials fear could serve as a \"full-fledged theater of operations\" from which to launch an attack.US intelligence officials have said they don't know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied it is planning to do so, but has argued that NATO support for the country constitutes a growing threat on Russia's western flank.Read MoreUkrainian soldiers in a front line trench near pro-Russian separatists take shelter from the extreme cold. After high-level talks between Moscow and Washington wrapped earlier this month without any breakthroughs over the tens of thousands of Russian troops amassed on Ukraine's border, prospects of de-escalation and future diplomacy have been cast into doubt. Now the Biden administration is weighing whether to deploy as many as 5,000 US troops, according to a senior defense official, to shore up NATO allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.  On Monday, both NATO and Russia pointed the finger at each other for the ratcheting tensions. \"Tensions are escalating due to concrete actions taken by the US and NATO,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to NATO's announcement.\"I mean the informational hysteria that we are witnessing -- it is generously framed by a huge amount of false information, just lies and fakes,\" Peskov added.Biden administration identifying troops for possible deployment to Eastern Europe amid Russia tensionsNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a Monday statement that the alliance would continue to take necessary measures \"to protect and defend all Allies, including by reinforcing the eastern part of the Alliance.\" He added: \"We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defence.\"The NATO statement said that in recent days, a flurry of member states had announced deployments to the region. They include Denmark sending a frigate to the Baltic Sea and four F-16 fighter jets to Lithuania, the Netherlands deploying two F-35 fighter aircraft to Bulgaria, France expressing its readiness to send troops to Romania and the US considering increasing its military presence in the East. Stoltenberg cautioned in a news conference on Monday that the moves were defensive and proportionate -- and that NATO was \"not threatening Russia.\" There was no suggestion in the statement that the troops would be used to assist Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. NATO, Europe and the US have been united in their opposition to any further Russian incursion in Ukraine, promising to lend support to Ukraine and hand down \"massive costs\" for Moscow in the event they make a move. But the shape of that response and what steps they might take are still unclear.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that \"a single additional Russian force\" entering Ukraine \"in an aggressive way\" would result in a severe response by the US and its allies. His comments came after US President Joe Biden muddled the message of severe consequences last week, saying at a news conference that a \"minor incursion\" might not trigger the same response from NATO as an invasion. The President later clarified that any Russian troops crossing Ukraine's border would constitute an invasion.CNN reported last week that the US military goal would be to \"meet the capability\" NATO allies in the region are asking for, a defense official said. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that as many as 8,500 US troops have been put on heightened preparedness to deploy.Local residents Marinka, Ukraine, walk past an apartment building destroyed during fighting in 2015 between the Ukrainian army and Russian-backed separatists. Fighting is still ongoing.The mobilization of Western forces comes amid a significant uptick in Russia's military movements, not only on Ukraine's border -- where the Ukrainian Defense Ministry says there are now 127,000 Russian troops stationed -- but elsewhere in Europe. The Russian Defense Ministry announced last week that 140 ships and 10,000 servicemen would take part in sweeping exercises from the Pacific to the Atlantic, including off Ireland's southwest coast in February. The ministry said the main purpose of the drills is to protect Russia's national interests in the world's oceans, TASS state news agency reported.In Ukraine, one question looms: What will we do if Russia attacks? Ireland's Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told reporters on Monday that he had raised concerns with Moscow about Russia's plans. \"This isn't the time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what's happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,\" Coveney said. Coveney and other European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the security situation in Ukraine and what action to take should Russia cross into Ukrainian territory; Blinken joined by video link following talks with Lavrov in Geneva. EU foreign ministers want to send a clear message to Russia that if it decides to invade Ukraine it will be hit by the \"most comprehensive\" package of sanctions and restrictions ever prepared by the EU, Coveney said.But while NATO countries ramp up readiness and the EU discusses heightened security concerns, Ukraine's own government has not, at least outwardly, signaled the same sense of urgency. In a call with the President of the European Council Charles Michel on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country will not succumb to provocations, but would \"keep calm.\" Zelensky and his government have previously downplayed the danger of a Russian invasion, noting that the threat has existed for years and has not become greater in recent months. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been rumbling since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and fomented a rebellion in Ukraine's east. Despite a cease fire in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace.Tensions are high on Ukraine's border with Russia. Here's what you need to knowUkraine on Monday criticized the US' decision to withdraw diplomats' families and reduce staff levels at the US Embassy in Kyiv, with Oleg Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, saying in a tweet: \"We believe such a step to be a premature one & an instance of excessive caution.\" But other countries are also taking precautions in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital. The UK Foreign Office also announced Monday that some British Embassy staff and dependents were being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to \"growing threats from Russia.\" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that the intelligence around the situation in Ukraine was \"gloomy\" but that war was not inevitable.Speaking to reporters at the EU Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday, the bloc's chief diplomat Josep Borrell said Europe will seek to simmer tensions between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy first but warned Moscow it is prepared to take action if necessary. He also urged for calm, stressing the need to avoid \"alarmist reactions that could that could lead to an escalation. We don't want people to have a breakdown on this.\"  Borrell added that the EU had no current plans to evacuate diplomatic staff and their families from Ukraine.Eliza Mackintosh wrote and reported in London.

But the latest one is the gravest yet.For the past week, the British Prime Minister has been buffeted by multiple claims that social events were held inside 10 Downing Street in the runup to Christmas 2020, when the country was under coronavirus regulations that outlawed such activities.The controversy deepened markedly on Tuesday with the emergence of a video broadcast by CNN affiliate ITV News from the time that appears to show Number 10 officials joking about the parties during a rehearsal for televised press briefings.Downing Street's position, before and since the video was leaked, is this: \"There was no Christmas party and coronavirus rules had been followed at all times.\" Johnson has announced an internal inquiry and on Wednesday, one of the officials in the video -- the prime minister's former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton, resigned as a government adviser.After speaking to multiple officials, CNN has established that social gatherings were indeed held on the two days in question -- November 27 and December 18 -- and has confirmed a Daily Mirror report that Johnson himself gave an impromptu speech at the first one. Sources also confirmed reports that secret Santa gifts were exchanged on December 18.Read MoreThe accusations are damaging for the government as it seeks to enforce tougher coronavirus restrictions. On Wednesday, Johnson announced England would be tightening restrictions -- called \"Plan B\" -- due to rising Omicron cases: From Friday, face coverings will again become mandatory in most public venues, including cinemas. And from next week people will be advised to work from home and present a \"Covid Pass\" proving vaccination or recent recovery to enter nightclubs and other venues with large crowds.\"It's becoming increasingly clear Omicron is growing faster than the previous Delta variant,\" Johnson said, adding that the more than 500 cases identified in the UK are \"almost certainly an underestimate.\" Against this backdrop of rising cases, the charge of government hypocrisy is potent -- last year it forced the resignation of a key aide to Johnson, and the health secretary in June this year, in separate scandals that were also characterized by claims of double standards.  Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson's former press secretary, resigned later on Wednesday.The video itself is the most damaging element of the story. It shows Stratton rehearsing for a televised news conference on Tuesday December 22, being asked by colleagues whether a party took place \"on Friday night\" -- which would have been December 18, the date of the second alleged party. Stratton says, \"I went home.\" She then laughs and smiles. \"Hold on. Hold on. Um. Er. Ah.\"She also said in the clip, shown by ITV, \"This fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.\"Until now, the government had maintained its line that no party had taken place.  But on Wednesday, referring to the video, Johnson apologized in parliament on Wednesday \"unreservedly for the offense that it has caused.\" He added: \"I have been repeatedly assured that there was no party and no rules were broken.\" He announced that his Cabinet Secretary will be investigating the events of December 18 -- the date of the second alleged party and not the event at which CNN has been told he spoke -- and would report back.Johnson said that if rules were broken \"there will be disciplinary action for all those involved.\" He added that he was \"furious\" when he saw the video.Stratton, who was serving as the Prime Minister's COP26 spokeswoman, said her comments had become a \"distraction\" in the fight against coronavirus, and offered her resignation on Wednesday afternoon. \"I understand the anger and frustration that people feel,\" she said in a statement on camera.Allegra Stratton in the leaked video, published by ITV News.\"To all who lost loved ones, endured intolerable loneliness and struggled with your businesses -- I am sorry and this afternoon I offered my resignation to the Prime Minister.\"Johnson paid tribute to Stratton at a press conference later Wednesday. The prime minister told reporters that while he can \"totally understand how infuriating\" the leaked video was, Stratton had been a \"fine colleague\" who \"achieved a great deal in her time in government\" particularly as COP26 spokesperson.Johnson also maintained that to the best of his knowledge, no Covid-19 restrictions had been broken. When grilled by reporters on whether people would heed the latest restrictions after members of his team laughed and joked about the coronavirus, Johnson replied: \"The British public can see the vital importance of the medical information that we're giving.\"Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden said last week, \"My focus has not been on having conversations about what may or may not have happened over a year ago in Downing Street. I have, however, been assured by what the Prime Minister has said, which is that the rules at all times were obeyed in Downing Street.\"CNN approached multiple other government officials for comment but had no reply. The video, which could be dismissed as a jovial knockabout between advisers never intended to be broadcast, undermines Downing Street's key claim that no rules were broken. In addition to the alleged party on December 18, there was another earlier gathering for departing senior adviser Cleo Watson, which took place on November 27. CNN has attempted to contact Watson.Both gatherings took place while London was under strict lockdown measures and social gatherings were banned. The day before the December 18 gathering, the government even sent a tweet warning \"you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity.\" Millions of Britons who'd hoped to enjoy some semblance of normality after a year of missing family gatherings were unable to celebrate Christmas together in 2020, precisely because of the government-imposed limits.A family gather around the television in Liverpool, northwest England to watch Boris Johnson give a televised message to the nation on January 4, 2021.More than 145,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the UK, and the latest revelations about the video sparked outrage from relatives of those who died in the pandemic.\"There are simply no words to describe how upsetting and shameful it is to then hear Boris Johnson's team laughing about breaking the rules they had made, whilst others followed them and could only say goodbye to their loved ones through a screen,\" the Bereaved Families group said in a statement. \"It's the behaviour of people who think they're above us.\"For obvious reasons, this is a deeply damaging moment for a PM who has been accused many times of acting as though there is one rule for himself and his inner circle and the citizens he governs. In order to understand what happened on the days of the 2020 parties, CNN talked with multiple current and former government officials who say that staff gathered in Downing Street, had drinks and behaved in a way that was at the time unimaginable to the rest of the country. What is less clear is how those gatherings came to pass. Boris Johnson receives his first dose of a AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine at St. Thomas' Hospital in London on March 19, 2021. Based on the conversations CNN has had with multiple current and former government officials, several events were held in Downing Street at the various stages of lockdowns and Covid restrictions. At this time, many officials were still working at the Prime Minister's official residence as \"key workers\" -- a designation used by the UK government for categories of employees that were exempt from working-from-home requirements.One senior Number 10 official, who is not a Johnson ally and was present at the gatherings in question explained, \"Obviously this looks bad, but from our perspective, we were working 18-hour days. It was entirely normal that we would have drinks on our desks.\" They claim that these were not organized parties as such, but semi-spontaneous gatherings at the end of stressful workdays between people who, because of their jobs, had to mix anyway. According to three current and former officials, who were present, Prime Minister Johnson gave a short impromptu speech at Watson's leaving party on November 27, 2020. Of the PM's speech, they say that Johnson was on the way to his flat inside Downing Street, saw that staff had gathered and delivered a few words before going upstairs. Downing Street has denied any rules were broken.From the numerous conversations CNN has had with people who were present at these events or have a detailed understanding of what went on, it remains very murky as to how this happened.Current and former officials, appreciating how damaging the revelations of gatherings are, say it was standard practice that staff exchanged secret Santa gifts at Christmas. \"To us, Downing Street was an island where we had to work and lockdown wasn't happening in the same way it was for the rest of the country,\" one current No. 10 official says. In a single quote, this lays bare the problem Johnson now faces. It is an admission that the rules simply didn't apply to a select group of people who worked directly for the PM, who himself was hospitalized for a week and spent time in intensive care with the virus.Boris Johnson with his former chief adviser Dominic Cummings, who become an arch Johnson critic since leaving the government.None of which means this is good for Johnson. The best-case-scenario for the government is that the public accepts staff in No. 10 were working in a small, crowded house at a time a virus was rampant because they had no alternative and, after a hard day's work, they had a drink before returning to duty (on both days, operational communications were sent to journalists beyond the hours that the parties are alleged to have concluded.) However, the video of Stratton joking about the party has turned even Johnson's allies against him. A former official and ally of Johnson, who was not present at the events in question said that they had carried on working through a time of crisis while many others fled London to work from home. The official said the people seen in the video would have to be sacked. Another Johnson supporter, who remains close with the PM, said \"it's hard to see how someone doesn't walk for it.\" Johnson faces some existential questions about his and his government's competence and how they created an almighty trust issue at the heart of government. And, alarmingly, someone who was close enough to be in a room with Johnson's most trusted inner circle, who has some of the highest security clearance possible, leaked a video damaging to a sitting Prime Minister. Conservative lawmakers have long privately complained that Johnson has surrounded himself with advisers who were inexperienced in working in such high office. Johnson came into office promising to deliver on the \"people's priorities\" and actively courted the votes of those exhausted by politics as usual.A less charitable explanation is that he believes it is acceptable for his staff to ignore the laws that his own government legislates. It comes at a time when public trust in his government has dropped because of numerous sleaze scandals. It was only weeks ago that Johnson tried to save a member of his own party who had been involved in a lobbying scandal. There is an ongoing investigation into how the PM paid for a refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, which he has insisted he paid for.The Prime Minister who won a majority in 2019 as the revolutionary candidate willing to upend the cosy Westminster establishment currently looks like a man who is neck-deep in the worst excesses of political sleaze. And if history tells us anything, individual scandals don't sink a leader; but a tidal wave of sleaze can drown them. Johnson might have passed the point at which it's possible to keep his head above water. CNN's Hira Humayun, Sarah Dean, Niamh Kennedy and Amy Cassidy contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)FW de Klerk, the last leader of apartheid-era South Africa who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela after working to end racial segregation in the country, has died at 85, his foundation said on Thursday.De Klerk released Mandela, his subsequent successor, from prison and laboriously negotiated with him a transition to democracy, ending a decades-long segregationist system that kept South Africa's White minority in power over the Black majority for generations.The two men shared the peace prize in 1993 for their work to end the policy, but de Klerk -- who had served in governments that upheld apartheid, and who after his retirement appeared reluctant to condemn it unequivocally -- remained a divisive figure in South Africa long after he left politics.De Klerk died at his home in Fresnaye from mesothelioma cancer, the FW de Klerk Foundation said Thursday. A deeply conservative politician whose party had long supported apartheid, de Klerk surprised his political clan and became an unlikely agent of change in South Africa during his five-year rule of the country.  Read MoreHe effectively announced the beginnings of a new country in one historic speech at the state opening of Parliament in 1990, revealing to a stunned nation that he would free Mandela, legalize anti-apartheid groups, end a national state of emergency and negotiate to end racial inequality in the country.De Klerk's political transformation, sparked by worsening racial tensions and the impending possibility of civil war, led him to be cast as a \"traitor\" by some conservative lawmakers.

He had been more widely cast as an obstructor than a revolutionary, given his lineage and steadfast conservatism.But the brutal realities of apartheid had resulted in violence, displacement and growing opposition, and de Klerk ultimately recognized a change in course was needed.He described himself as a \"convert\" in an interview with CNN in 2012. \"The goal was separate but equal, but separate but equal failed,\" he added. \"We should have gone much earlier with the flow when the winds of change blew across Africa.\"South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (left) with FW de Klerk (center) and Nelson Mandela in 2004.De Klerk nonetheless created a complicated legacy both during his time in power and after his retirement.In the same 2012 interview, de Klerk caused anger by equivocating on whether apartheid was a morally repugnant policy. \"I can only say that in a qualified way ... there were many aspects which are morally indefensible,\" he said.Last year, his foundation issued an apology after de Klerk claimed that apartheid was not a crime against humanity during an interview with South African public broadcaster SABC.He told CNN he and Mandela were \"close friends\" by 2012. \"There is no animosity left between us.

A red alert was issued for a second day on Tuesday due to further expected intense rainfall.A \"depression area on the central Mediterranean persists and is causing disturbed weather conditions in the southern areas of the country,\" the Italian government said Monday.Over two feet of rain fell in Italy in only half a day, something not seen in Europe beforeIntense rainfall and strong winds have impacted southern Italy since Sunday, with half a meter (nearly 20 inches) of rain reported in the region.Read MoreThe highest rainfall totals from Sunday to Tuesday morning are from Linguaglossa, Sicily, with 520.4 millimeters (20 inches) and Fabrizia, Calabria, with 440.2 millimeters (17 inches).

        "content": "Rome (CNN)Down a narrow, winding street in central Rome, golden cobblestones shine out from the footpath in front of homes, etched with the words: \"Deportata Auschwitz\" (\"deported to Auschwitz\").One of the stones is dedicated to Rossana Calo, who was just two years old when she, along with her mother, was transported hundreds of miles to the Nazi death camp; on arrival, she was killed in the gas chambers. These plaques, commemorating more than 1,000 victims snatched from their homes in the Italian capital's Jewish Ghetto in October 1943, are a sobering reminder of the country's dark past. Italy entered World War II as an ally of Adolf Hitler in 1940, but Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime had already embraced anti-Semitism. Months after he was overthrown in 1943, German authorities began to round up Jews in Rome and other major cities in the country's north.  More than 75 years after Mussolini's inglorious death at the hands of partisans, the debate about fascist ideology -- and its continuing appeal to some Italians -- has been reignited in the wake of the government's attempts to control the coronavirus pandemic.  Read MoreOn October 9, the headquarters of Italy's largest trade union and a hospital emergency ward in Rome were targeted during angry protests against the country's Covid-19 \"Green Pass.\"The Green Pass, which came into force last Friday, requires all workers -- from caf\u00e9 staff to care workers, taxi drivers to teachers -- to show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection. Italy -- once Europe's Covid-19 epicenter -- now has the continent's strongest vaccine mandate. Members of the neo-fascist Forza Nuova were arrested in relation to the violent attacks in Rome.Gold cobblestones outside front doors in Rome's Jewish Ghetto commemorate people arrested and deported to Auschwitz. Two-year-old Rossana Calo was one of those. Fascist parties banned  \"Fascism never went away in this country,\" said history professor Simon Martin, the author of several books on Italian fascism. \"Italy has not confronted its past. There is no appetite for this, I think, on either side.\"  Martin said thousands of people still line up each year on anniversaries, such as Mussolini's birth, death and \"March on Rome,\" to visit his tomb in Predappio, 200 miles northeast of Rome, despite the fact he ran a repressive police state, and was responsible for brutal colonial campaigns and massacres during his 20 years in power.  \"[It] has a book of condolence which has to be changed on a regular basis because it fills up,\" he said. Thousands protest as Italy's Covid pass becomes mandatory for workersA 1952 law banned the reconstitution of fascist parties in Italy, but they have reformed under alternative names, Martin told CNN during a visit to the Jewish Ghetto.  The violence of the Green Pass protests on October 9 has led to mounting calls to dissolve neo-fascist groups in the country. Organizers canceled an anti Covid-19 green pass demo in the northeastern city of Trieste planned for Friday and Saturday, and urged protesters not to attend over fears of violence.This week, Italian lawmakers in both the upper house Senate and lower house voted in favor of a motion put forward by the country's center-left parties, which calls on Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government to dissolve Forza Nuova and all movements of neo-fascist inspiration. Draghi and his Council of Ministers will now consult legal experts before announcing a decision.Forza Nuova's lawyer Carlo Taormina told CNN the group is currently being dismantled and has not been active as a political movement for 20 months.  In response to the violent scenes on October 9, tens of thousands of people demonstrated against fascism in Rome's San Giovanni Square at the weekend. \"I came here because it is important to send a message,\" Jacopo Basili, 30, told CNN at the rally organized by Italy's main trades unions. \"What happened was very bad, as if we were returning to 100 years ago in Italy. Today we must say no. It is not possible.\"  People gather in Piazza del Popolo square during a protest against the Covid-19 health pass, in Rome, Saturday, October 9, 2021. Another demonstrator, Leone Rivara, told CNN he doesn't believe the threat of fascism in Italy today compares to the Mussolini era, but that social tensions in the country have been \"aggravated by the pandemic,\" and that \"forces that declare themselves democratic ... cross boundaries and exploit the weakness, the fragility, the anger, the delusion of the people to [upset] the democratic balance of this country.\" One group accused of doing just that is the Fratelli d'Italia, or Brothers of Italy, a right-wing party that made international headlines when one of its members, Rachele Mussolini -- granddaughter of Benito -- was elected to Rome's city council for a second term earlier this month. Rachele Mussolini won more than 8,200 votes -- the highest number tallied for any candidate -- and a huge increase on the 657 votes she received in the 2016 ballot. \"I will strive not to disappoint those who trusted me and to conquer those who don't know me ... My goal is to keep working for my city to give it back [its] lost dignity,\" she wrote in a Facebook post following her re-election. Traveling to Italy during Covid-19: What you need to know before you goCNN contacted Rachele Mussolini, via her press secretary, to ask if she finds it hard to distinguish herself from the fascist associations tied to her last name, but has not received a response.She is not the first descendant of the Italian dictator to go into politics. Her stepsister Alessandra served as a member of parliament in Silvio Berlusconi's center-right People of Freedom alliance, and was a Member of the European Parliament. Opinion polls suggest Fratelli d'Italia, which grew out of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement party (MSI), is currently the most popular party in Italy.  The Fratelli d'Italia party -- along with Matteo Salvini's right-wing Lega and the centre-right Forza Italia -- recently backed radio host and lawyer Enrico Michetti in his fight to become Rome's next mayor.  On Monday, Michetti lost the run-off vote by roughly 20%. During the campaign, his office was defaced with the word \"fascista.\"Asked why Fratelli d'Italia is still affiliated with fascism, the party's leader Giorgia Meloni told CNN her party is not a breeding ground for such a regime.  Andrea Ungari, professor of contemporary history at Rome's LUISS university said he believes a small proportion of Italians could be defined as having fascist beliefs.  Neo-fascist groups Forza Nuova and CasaPound did not participate in Italy's most recent elections.\"It's difficult to define Fratelli d'Italia as a fascist party,\" Ungari said. \"Of course, there are some declarations ... some harsh attitudes ... it is clearly a right-wing party but with the difference between right and extreme right.\"  \"In Italy there is the heritage of fascism of course but sometimes it's a term utilized by the left to monopolise the political debate,\" Ungari warned.  Numerous reminders of fascismMonuments linked to racism, colonialism and shameful moments in history have been removed from countries around the world in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests.In Italy though, architecture from the 20 years of Benito Mussolini's rule is maintained. Unlike Germany, which outlawed and eradicated Nazi symbols in the aftermath of World War II, Italy left numerous reminders of the fascist era standing.  Rome's sports complex -- Foro Mussolini, or Mussolini's forum -- which houses the city's main soccer stadium Stadio Olimpico, has been renamed Foro Italico, but an almost 60-foot marble obelisk bearing Mussolini's name still towers outside it. Ostiense railway station, which was built to commemorate Hitler's visit to Rome in 1938 and boasts a mosaic themed around the Italian fascist ideology that modern Italy was the heir to ancient Rome, is still one of the city's major railway stations.  The Mussolini-commissioned building Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana is the centerpiece of Mussolini's Esposizione Universale Roma neighborhood and remains a symbol of the country's fascist era. The balcony overlooking Palazzo Venezia where Fascist leader Benito Mussolini gave some of his most notable speeches.  And the Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana -- a six-storey marble tower constructed as the centerpiece of Mussolini's new neighborhood, Esposizione Universale Roma, in the city's southwest -- remains engraved with a phrase from his 1935 speech announcing the invasion of Ethiopia. \"I think the real problem with those statues is there's nothing to contextualize them ... [nothing] to tell us what fascism was about,\" said history professor Martin. Martin said that while it may not be practical to tear down all of Italy's fascist-era buildings, because of the sheer numbers involved, \"it should be contextualized. We need to talk about what it means.\"  As for the motion to ban neo-fascist groups and parties, it \"would be a statement of intent by the government,\" said Martin, but it is unlikely to change people's ideas.

        "content": "London (CNN)England is set to remove an \"outdated, unnecessary and actively discriminatory\" question from blood donor forms, which campaigners say has predominantly affected Black communities' ability to give blood. It comes after UK-wide changes in June made it easier for sexually active gay and bisexual men to give blood -- overturning a ban that originated during the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and had been decried as homophobic for years. By the end of this year, potential donors will no longer be asked if they have recently had sex with a partner who may ever have been sexually active \"in parts of the world where HIV/AIDS is very common\", which includes most of sub-Saharan Africa. Read MoreCurrently those who answer \"yes\" are deferred for three months after the last sexual contact with that partner. \"In practical terms, this current rule in England means that someone who is in a long-term, monogamous relationship with someone from or who has ever lived in Africa would most probably be unable to donate blood,\" British lawmakers Taiwo Owatemi, MP for Coventry North West, and Sarah Owen, MP for Luton North, wrote in a letter to Health Secretary Sajid Javid last month.The UK will let some sexually active gay and bisexual men give blood, ending a controversial ban Owatemi and Owen's letter, published on the website for British HIV and sexual health charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the question acted \"as a significant barrier for many people who may wish to donate blood, and this comes at the expense of the NHS [National Health Service] Blood and Transplant's current push to get more Black people to give blood.\" The NHS website says: \"At the moment we need Black donors because of a rise in demand for some rare blood types that are more common in people of Black heritage.\" \"People who are Black African, Black Caribbean and of Black mixed ethnicity are more likely to have the rare blood sub-group, such as Ro, that many Black sickle cell patients need. This change will provide more opportunities for people to donate for the ongoing need for rarer blood types,\" the UK's Department of Health said in a news release. The health department said that the question will be removed from the donor safety check in England following research by the Fair (For the Assessment of Individualised Risk) steering group and supported by the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (Sabto). The question has already been removed in the devolved nations of Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland has not announced a change. National AIDS Trust chief executive Deborah Gold said in a statement: \"We are delighted that the Secretary of State has confirmed this outdated, unnecessary and actively discriminatory question will be removed from blood donor screening forms.\"The science is clear that this is unnecessary and does nothing to improve safety. Instead, it actively prevents much needed donors coming forward to give blood, particularly from Black communities. The change is long overdue, and we warmly welcome today's announcement.\"UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid called it \"another progressive step forward, focusing on individual behaviours, rather than blanket deferrals, and reducing limitations for people to donate blood.\" \"This will make it easier for Black donors in particular to donate blood, ultimately saving lives,\" Javid said.",

        "content": "Rome (CNN)The Italian government has approved a decree making it mandatory for all public and private sector workers to show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection, Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza told a news conference on Thursday.   The rule was decided at a cabinet meeting and aims to persuade more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19. It is due to come into force on October 15. \"This is to make these [work] places safer, and make the vaccination campaign even stronger,\" Speranza said. He called the decree \"a strategy that points on the vaccine as fundamental key to open a new season.\"Read More Around 75% of the Italian population aged 12 years and over have been fully vaccinated, according to government figures. The move makes Italy -- once the epicenter of Covid-19 on the continent -- the first country in Europe to introduce such a blunt rule. Italy had already mandated health workers be vaccinated. Since August 6, a \"certificazione verde,\" or green pass, has been needed to enter cultural sites such as museums or galleries, entertainment and sports venues, theme parks, spas, and to eat indoors. This was extended to include domestic flights, train travel between regions as well as sea travel on September 1. The pass shows that the holder has been vaccinated, has tested negative within the past 48 hours, or has recovered from the virus within the past six months. Speranza said Covid-19 tests will be made easier to acquire, with more pharmacies able to carry out antigen tests. However, he said tests will only be free for people who are medically exempt from being vaccinated -- meaning those who refuse to be vaccinated for other reasons will have to pay to be tested, ultimately paying to obtain their 'Green Pass' to go to work.      The announcement comes amid fears of a potential surge in Covid-19 infections this winter. Italy is currently in a state of emergency because of the pandemic. Although the country has emerged from a third-wave lockdown, case numbers are being studied, and individual regions could bring back restrictions at any point. Italy holds Europe's second highest death toll (after the UK), according to the John Hopkins University data map, passing the milestone of 100,000 deaths on March 8. Italian regions are currently graded by their infection and hospitalization rates, running from white (lowest risk) through yellow and amber to red (highest risk).CNN's Sarah Dean reported from London and Nicolo Ruotolo from Rome.",

Protesters marched in front of the governor's office in the city after 3,500 people living in a government-owned residential area were given three days to leave, two protesters told a local journalist working for CNN over the phone. The protesters, who are also residents of the area, said they were not given reasons for the expulsion order.\"I have nowhere else to go,\" said one protester, who did not want to give her name out of fear of reprisal.

Local television footage shows protesters, including women and children, blocking a road as they marched down it.  Mohammad Ibrahim, a civil activist in Kandahar, said the Ferqa-e Kohna area, on the edge of the provincial capital, was a government-owned area and land was distributed to government employees under the previous government. Ibrahim said there were likely irregularities and corruption involved in the transfer of properties, resulting in the illegal sales of property to residents. Some of the families had been living in Ferqa-e Kohna for more than 20 years, he said. Taliban spokesmen could not be reached for comment on the evictions.There were reports the Taliban had stopped a local journalist from doing his work and beaten another while he was covering the demonstration, according to local news station, Millat Zagh Radio. CNN cannot independently verify the incidents. Local residents march against a reported announcement by the Taliban, asking them to evict their homes built on state-owned land in Kandahar on September 14.Protests against Taliban rule have broken out in several parts of Afghanistan since the militant group took control of the country last month, following the US withdrawal of troops. The Taliban has cracked down on the protests, often violently, with reports of journalists and activists being detained and abused. Last week, journalists from the Afghan online news outlet EtilaatRoz told CNN they were detained while covering a protest by Afghan women against Pakistani involvement in Afghanistan and demanding equal rights in the capital Kabul. The protest was outside a police station and the two men said they were taken inside and severely beaten.During another protest last week, Taliban fighters used whips and sticks against a group of women protesting in Kabul, following the announcement of a hardline, male-only interim government.Taliban fighters use whips against Afghan women protesting the all-male interim governmentTaliban leaders on Twitter dismissed videos being shared online of violence at the women-led protests. The head of the Cultural Commission, Muhammad Jalal, said that these demonstrations were \"a deliberate attempt to cause problems,\" adding that \"these people don't even represent 0.1% of Afghanistan.\"The Taliban have also sought to curtail protests, and a statement issued by the Taliban interior ministry last week set out strict conditions for any future demonstrations, including prior approval from the Ministry of Justice.The United Nations last week called on the Taliban \"to immediately cease the use of force towards, and the arbitrary detention of, those exercising their right to peaceful assembly and the journalists covering the protests.\"Taliban response to peaceful marches in Afghanistan has been \"increasingly violent\" and has included the use of live ammunition, batons and whips, causing the death of at least four people, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ravina Shamdasani said Friday during a press briefing in Geneva.Even before the Taliban's return to power, protracted conflict, poverty, back-to-back droughts, economic decline and the coronavirus pandemic had worsened an already dire situation in which 18 million Afghans -- almost half of the population -- were in need of aid, according to UN agencies. With winter now approaching, many people could run out of food by the end of the month, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said earlier this week, adding that poverty rates had spiraled since the Taliban's return to power.CNN is not naming the Afghan journalist who contributed to this story for security reasons.",

The churches are a holy site for millions of Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. Some residents fled the town, located in Ethiopia's Amhara region, as the Tigrayan fighters arrived, Reuters reported on Thursday. The United States has called on the fighters to \"protect this cultural heritage,\" State Department spokesman Ned Price said Thursday.CNN was not able to independently verify the reports that Lalibela was captured by Tigrayan fighters.Lalibela's churches are a holy site for millions.Read MorePeople stand next to the church of Saint Mercurius in Lalibela in 2019, which is covered by a shelter protecting its rock-hewn structure from erosion.The Ethiopian government on Friday threatened that it would be forced to respond to Tigrayan forces if they continue to expand into neighboring regions, a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.\"The action of the irresponsible group is testing the Federal Government's patience and pushing it to change its defensive mood which has been taken for the sake of the unilateral humanitarian ceasefire,\" the statement read. Ethiopia is at war with itself. Here's what you need to know about the conflictThe statement added that the Ethiopian government is \"being pushed to mobilize and deploy the entire defensive capability of the state if its humanitarian overtures for a peaceful resolution of the conflict remain unreciprocated,\" and accused Tigrayan fighters of launching \"new attacks in the neighboring regions of Amhara and Afar, which left more than 300,000 people displaced and thousands dead.\"A second statement directly addressed the reported spillover of the conflict into Amhara, saying people were concerned about possible destruction of religious and cultural institutions by Tigrayan forces. \"The government will take all the necessary measures to ensure that these sacred places and other institutions are well protected and call on the international community to condemn this heinous act of the TPLF,\" it said.The developments come eight months after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military offensive against Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sending in national troops and militia fighters from the Amhara region who were joined by forces from neighboring Eritrea.  The war took a major turn when Tigrayan fighters recaptured their regional capital of Mekelle from Ethiopian forces in June, then rejected a last-minute ceasefire offer from the central government. Since then, the fighting has spread, with TPLF fighters pushing from Tigray into the neighboring regions of Amhara and Afar. CNN has contacted the Amhara regional government, the TPLF and UNESCO for comment on the reported capture of Lalibela. At least 30 bodies float down river between Ethiopia's Tigray and SudanOn Thursday the US urged all sides in Ethiopia's conflict to avoid further escalations and to seek a ceasefire. \"We also call on all parties to the conflict to end the violence, as I said before, to initiate talks to achieve a negotiated ceasefire, and for the TPLF to withdraw its associated military forces immediately from the Amhara and Afar regions,\" Price added.\"At the same time, we renew our calls for the Amhara regional government to withdraw immediately its associated military forces from western Tigray, and for the Eritrean government to withdraw its military forces permanently from Ethiopia. All parties, as we've said, should accelerate unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance to those affected by the conflict, and the commercial blockade of Tigray must come to an endAsked about the reports regarding Lalibela, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Thursday he had not gotten any information on this particular case but \"we are aware that there's been a spillover\" of the conflict beyond the Tigray region.\"Any conflict often starts out as small and, if it is not tended to, has a tendency to spill over and to get larger. And in the meantime, the people who are paying the price are the civilians,\" Dujarric said.UN says food aid in Ethiopia's war-torn Tigray region will run out Friday as 400,000 people face famineDuring a daily press briefing earlier on Thursday, Dujarric warned that although there has been a recent entry of aid and supplies into the Tigray \"it is still insufficient, with an estimated 100 trucks needed every day to assist 5.2 million people in need.\"\"Trucks are going in, but we see trucks are looted. Trucks are also delayed,\" he added, referring to humanitarian aid food trucks.He said that as of Wednesday, 175 trucks with humanitarian supplies, including food, non-food items and fuel had arrived in Tigray's capital Mekelle. \"These include 50 trucks that crossed into Tigray over the past month with the remaining trucks crossing only in recent days,\" Dujarric said.\"These are among at least 223 trucks with humanitarian supplies for the UN and international NGOs that left Semera, the capital city of Afar Region, toward Mekelle. Most of the remaining trucks are being scanned at a checkpoint and a few trucks are in Abala, the last entry point into Tigray.\"He said two trucks were reportedly blocked by civilians and looted at a checkpoint in Afar, 97 km from Semera, on July 28.CNN's Bethlehem Feleke and Larry Madowo in Nairobi contributed reporting.",

        "images": [],
        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out his plan to lift most of England's remaining coronavirus restrictions by mid-July, despite warnings from some experts that the current surge of Delta variant cases across the country means such a move is premature. Johnson said Monday that the \"continuing effectiveness\" of the vaccine rollout allows England to consider loosening restrictions, rather than tightening them, as cases rise.\"I want to stress from the outset that this pandemic is far from over,\" Johnson told a news conference. \"It certainly won't be over by [July] the 19th,\" he said. \"We're seeing cases rise fairly rapidly,\" Johnson added. \"There could be 50,000 cases detected per day by the 19th, and again as we predicted we're seeing rising hospital admissions, and we must reconcile ourselves sadly to more deaths from Covid.\"Johnson's announcement comes two weeks before the planned date for lifting all restrictions in England. The prime minister added that a final decision on unlocking would be made on July 12, after considering data.Read MoreAs part of the lifting of restrictions -- dubbed \"Freedom Day\" -- there would be a move away from legal restrictions to personal responsibility, said Johnson. Duchess of Cambridge forced to self-isolate after Covid-19 contactThis meant lifting of laws on face coverings, social distancing, and instructions to work from home. \"I don't want people to get de-mob happy,\" said Johnson. \"This is still far from over.\" But he added that this was on balance the time to reopen, given the summer season and school holidays. \"If we can't open in the next few weeks ... then when can we?\" Johnson said. Meanwhile the number of infections is predicted to rise if measures are rescinded, but the government believes its vaccination campaign has weakened the link between cases and hospitalizations and death. Around 86% of the UK's adult population has received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and more than 63% have received a second dose, according to government figures. On Sunday, the UK recorded 24,248 new cases and 15 coronavirus-related deaths. Current restrictions include maintaining a distance of \"one-meter plus,\" the use of face coverings on public transport and inside enclosed public spaces, a cap on the number of attendees at weddings and funerals, the continued closure of nightclubs, and scanning in and out of cafes and restaurants. Pedestrians wear face masks while walking along Oxford Street in central London on June 6.'A personal choice'As a fresh wave of infection continues to swell in the UK, concern is growing among health care experts over the impact of a relaxation of pandemic measures.Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said the government's decision to press forward with England's unlocking was \"unsurprising\" and would put significant pressure on hospitals once more, in addition to exposing many more people to \"long Covid.\" \"The government has consistently ignored the advice and prioritized short-term economic gain,\" Gurdasani told CNN. \"Even at the current rates, we're in for trouble, and opening up further of course increases those risks greatly. Not only would I say we need to really pause opening up further until we vaccinate many more people, but also deal with the current wave.\"Unvaccinated people are 'variant factories,' infectious diseases expert saysGurdasani described the government's plan as \"hugely unethical\" and alarming, given \"we know that long Covid is common in young and healthy people.\"\"This is not the flu, like Sajid Javid seems to suggest,\" Gurdasani said. \"Please tell me when flu has led to 400,000 people having chronic disability in a period of 16 months ... why would we want to expose so much of our population to herd immunity through natural infection when we have safe and effective vaccines that could be given to them in the coming weeks.\"Gurdasani urged the government to adopt smarter policies like continued mask use and investment in ventilation in schools and workplaces, while allowing more time for greater vaccination coverage before lifting measures. Pivoting to protective measures as the country emerges from restrictive lockdowns is an approach echoed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which is urging the government not to \"throw progress away\" and maintain some targeted methods to limit the spread of Covid-19 after July 19.Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said in a statement it \"makes no sense to remove restrictions in their entirety in just over two weeks' time\" and called on ministers not to rush to meet their self-imposed deadline. \"We have made excellent progress with both the vaccination campaign and individual action from people across the country over the last 18 months, and the government must absolutely not throw this away at this critical juncture,\" he said. Nagpaul said that although hospitalization numbers were not spiking as high with previous peaks, spiraling levels of community transmission \"provides a fertile ground for new, potentially vaccine-resistant variants to develop.\"He also added that evidence suggests one in 10 people suffer longer-term impacts of long Covid, even if they only suffered a mild infection, and that an estimated 2 million people in England were living with long-lasting symptoms. \"These factors could have serious consequences for the NHS and public health teams as well as business, education and wider society -- therefore stemming the spread of the virus in the community with a series of manageable, targeted measures must be the priority right now,\" Nagpaul said.'An abdication of responsibility from the government'Stephen Griffin, an associate professor in the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds, said in a statement provided to the UK's Science Media Centre (SMC) that vaccines provide \"a clear route\" out of the pandemic.He added, however, that the \"impatience with which restrictions are due to be relaxed is likely, in my view, to greatly amplify the number of infections we see caused by the Delta variant, and so cause unnecessary harm along this road.\" Griffin added that Johnson's plan, which effectively shifts the responsibility for safety measures from the government to individuals, represented \"an abdication of responsibility from the government.\" Britain thinks it can out-vaccinate the Delta variant. The world isn't so sureBut not all medical professionals are in agreement, with others saying the argument for removing all restrictions was compelling. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in the same SMC statement that \"there is a general consensus that Covid will never go away\" and lifting restrictions over the summer -- when schools are out -- was the right move. \"Even though case numbers are rising quite rapidly at present, possibly as a consequence of celebrations around the Euros [soccer tournament], I still think it would be safer to lift restrictions now than in the autumn. The disease burden associated with a larger peak during the summer would likely be less than one during the winter,\" he said.\"Of course we have seen new issues appear during the course of this epidemic and so no one can be certain of the challenges over coming months, but we will eventually come into an equilibrium with this virus as we have with all the other endemic respiratory infections.\"CNN's Lauren Kent and Sheena McKenzie contributed to this report",

The government's new Health Secretary Sajid Javid has signaled he would like to ease coronavirus restrictions.\"We are on track for July 19 and we have to be honest with people about the fact that we cannot eliminate Covid,\" Javid wrote in an article for the Mail on Sunday newspaper this weekend.Read More\"We also need to be clear that cases are going to rise significantly. I know many people will be cautious about the easing of restrictions -- that's completely understandable. But no date we choose will ever come without risk, so we have to take a broad and balanced view. We are going to have to learn to accept the existence of Covid and find ways to cope with it -- just as we already do with flu.\"Pedestrians wearing a face mask or covering due to the COVID-19 pandemic, walk along Oxford Street in central London on June 6.Javid said the \"rules that we have had to put in place have caused a shocking rise in domestic violence and a terrible impact on so many people's mental health.\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reviewing \"very positive\" data ahead of his decision on the next step in England's coronavirus roadmap, Jenrick told Sky News.Britain thinks it can out-vaccinate the Delta variant. The world isn't so sure\"It does seem as if we can now move forward and move to a much more permissive regime where we move away from many of those restrictions that have been so difficult for us,\" he added.Despite being criticized for being slow to lock down and require mask wearing at the start of the pandemic, the UK has since been heralded for its Covid-19 vaccine rollout.However, doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA) has urged the government to keep some Covid-safe measures in place after July 19 in England amid a rise in case numbers.\"Weekly cases in England are up 74% on the previous seven days, while the number of people admitted to hospitals in England with Covid-19 has risen by 55% over the last week,\" the BMA said in a press release on Saturday.One of the Covid-safe measures the union called for is the ongoing requirement to wear a mask in enclosed public spaces, such as public transport and shops.Rise of Delta variant brings mask question back, even for the vaccinated\"We have made excellent progress with both the vaccination campaign and individual action from people across the country over the last 18 months, and the Government must absolutely not throw this away at this critical juncture,\" Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said.\"While the vaccination programme continues at pace, a significant proportion of people remain either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. This is on top of those who cannot receive the jab or the small number for whom immunisation will be ineffective.\"Neither will all those vaccinated by 19th July be properly protected given it takes about two weeks after the second dose to confer maximum immunity. This means we are still some way from protecting enough of the population from this devastating illness to control the spread,\" Nagpaul added.Asked about the BMA's call to keep a mandate on masks, National Medical Director for NHS England Stephen Powis told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday he didn't want to \"speculate\" ahead of any government announcement.\"I think some people will choose to be more cautious, some people may choose to wear face masks in particular circumstances in crowded environments, and that's not necessarily a bad thing... those habits to reduce infections are a good thing to keep,\" he added.",

The couple initially tried to use the photographer's tripod to reach the ring but it only pushed it further into the mud at the bottom of the lake, Hosking told CNN in a phone call on Saturday.Patel told CNN he panicked when the ring fell in and tried to rescue it himself but the water was \"absolutely freezing\" and he couldn't see a thing.The engagement ring slipped off while Chaukria and Patel were having photos taken. Hosking heard about the couple's plight via a friend and rushed down to the jetty as soon as he finished work. The 21-year-old had been helping to clear trash from the Lakes for three and a half years and set up the group Lake District Diving with his friend Declan Turner to tackle the problem. Read MoreIt's not the first time he has been asked to rescue valuables in the process, and he told CNN he knew only too well that it could take minutes or hours.\"As soon as I put my head under the water the visibility was absolutely terrible so it didn't fill me with confidence. I couldn't see anything,\" Hosking explained.\"It was just all silt -- really fine mud -- even if you drop a penny it goes straight to the bottom,\" he added.Fortunately after 20 minutes searching with an underwater metal detector and a few false positives, Hosking scooped up the ring.Patel described Hosking as a \"brilliant guy\" and said his fiancee was \"speechless\" when he emerged with the ring. \"Now she's never taking it off,\" he joked.Hosking said Patel \"couldn't stop saying 'thank you.' He just kept on saying it, it was brilliant.\"Patel had planned to propose on five different occasions -- but they had all been scuppered by coronavirus restrictions. Patel said if restrictions allow he would love to invite Hosking to their wedding in August.",

But to me, like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end,\" Harry continued.\"He has been a rock for Her Majesty The Queen with unparalleled devotion, by her side for 73 years of marriage, and while I could go on, I know that right now he would say to all of us, beer in hand, 'Oh do get on with it!'\"\"So, on that note, Grandpa, thank you for your service, your dedication to Granny, and for always being yourself. You will be sorely missed, but always remembered -- by the nation and the world. Meghan, Archie, and I (as well as your future great-granddaughter) will always hold a special place for you in our hearts,\" Harry added.Read MoreHe closed with the words \"Per Mare, Per Terram\" meaning \"By Sea, By Land\" in Latin -- the motto for the UK's Royal Marines. Philip maintained close ties with the military community throughout his lifetime after completing his naval service in 1953, including holding the position of Captain General of the Royal Marines.Queen said Prince Philip's death has 'left a huge void in her life'Prince Harry is staying at Frogmore Cottage where he is following coronavirus protocols after traveling from Los Angeles. The trip is the first time that Harry has returned to the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back as senior royals last March. A royal source told CNN that Prince Charles is \"looking forward\" to seeing his son.Prince William said his grandfather was an \"extraordinary man and part of an extraordinary generation\" in a statement earlier Monday. The Duke of Cambridge said he was \"lucky\" to have had Philip's \"enduring presence well into my own adult life\" and was grateful that his wife and children had the chance to get to know him. \"I will never take for granted the special memories my children will always have of their great-grandpa coming to collect them in his carriage and seeing for themselves his infectious sense of adventure as well as his mischievous sense of humour!\" William's statement read. He ended his tribute saying that he and his wife, Catherine, plan to continue to support the Queen in the years ahead as his grandfather \"would have wanted.\" \"I will miss my Grandpa, but I know he would want us to get on with the job,\" he added. Along with William's statement, William shared a photo taken by his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, of his grandfather and Prince George in Norfolk, England in 2015.How Harry can attend the funeralLike any other international traveler returning to the UK, Harry is subject to a quarantine period but he will likely still be able to attend the funeral this weekend. The existing Covid-19 travel regulations stipulate that travelers must complete a passenger locator form and hold a negative coronavirus test before leaving for the UK. Once in England, visitors must either quarantine at home for 10 days or at a managed quarantine hotel. During the mandatory quarantine, two additional Covid-19 tests are required on days two and eight. Harry could use the UK government's \"test to release\" system, which allows a person to take a private Covid-19 test on the fifth day after arrival to end quarantine early if the test result is negative. They must quarantine while they await their test result.There is also guidance for mourners entering the country which allows them to leave self-isolation on compassionate grounds which includes \"attending a funeral of a household member, a close family member or a friend.\" The individual must self-isolate at all other times. 'The Crown' effect: How a TV show introduced Prince Philip to a generation of Americans  Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, will not be joining her husband for the funeral. She is expecting the couple's second baby this summer and \"has been advised by her physician not to travel to the UK\" from California where they live, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said Saturday.The Queen has approved a ceremony adapted from the plan the Duke of Edinburgh consented to years ago to respect pandemic restrictions.  Prince Philip will be laid to rest in a private funeral at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, in what is known as a \"ceremonial royal funeral,\" and will not lie in state, according to the arrangements laid out by the Palace to the press.  Under royal protocol state funerals are usually reserved for monarchs so the duke's funeral will be similar to that of the Queen Mother in 2002, the spokesman explained. The revised arrangements have been made in \"close consultation\" with government and public health officials to meet social distancing guidelines which limit funerals to 30 people.

If they obtain internal approval, the government will submit a proposed order to the court seeking immunity for the juror to testify, according to the letter. The juror issue has the potential to overturn the guilty verdict against Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein who was convicted in December 2021 of sex trafficking a minor and four other charges for her role in facilitating Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell could face up to 65 years in prison and is expected to be sentenced at a later date.Juror in Ghislaine Maxwell trial may have lied on jury questionnaire formJurors were explicitly asked on jury questionnaire forms if they had been sexually abused and, if so, would it impact their abilities to be impartial while deliberating. In interviews with multiple media outlets shortly after the verdict, the juror, who identified himself only as Scotty David, said he was sexually abused as a child and shared his story with fellow jurors.Read More\"When I shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,\" the juror said in a Reuters interview.However, according to a copy of the form the juror filled out and that was posted publicly last week, the juror marked \"no\" when asked if he or a family member had been \"the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault.\"Maxwell's attorneys have argued that because they believe the juror lied on his questionnaire, Maxwell is entitled to a new trial. Last week, US District Judge Alison Nathan denied Maxwell's request for a new trial, saying the current record \"relies extensively\" on statements from the juror involving deliberations that the court is \"prohibited from considering.\" However, Nathan ordered the juror to testify under oath about the questionnaire on March 8.Nathan emphasized in her ruling Thursday that the \"potential impropriety\" is whether the juror lied on his juror questionnaire, not his history of surviving abuse.CNN's Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

Gretchen Whitmer in 2020.Kaleb Franks signed the plea agreement to plead guilty to a kidnapping conspiracy charge about a month before the criminal trial is set to begin against his alleged co-conspirators. The one count of kidnapping conspiracy carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, but the plea agreement says prosecutors will seek a lesser sentence for his cooperation. A hearing date for Franks to formally enter the guilty plea in court has not been set on the docket. The plea agreement requires his cooperation with the government, but does not specify whether he has done so yet. The indictment alleged that between June 6 and October 7, 2020, the six men charged in the case conspired to \"unlawfully seize, kidnap, abduct and carry away, and hold for ransom and reward\" Whitmer.Authorities have said the men were planning to kidnap the Democratic governor from a vacation home and blow up a bridge to delay law enforcement, but they were arrested first. In addition to those charged in federal court, several other people were charged in the case by the state.Read MoreFranks has acknowledged his participation with other alleged co-defendants of the \"Wolverine Watchmen,\" a Michigan-based self-styled \"militia\" group he met through a firearms group on Facebook, the plea agreement says. The plea agreement also explicitly states that Franks confirms that he was not entrapped by two undercover agents who infiltrated the group. Franks' court-appointed defense attorney suggested in previous court filings that he sought to present an entrapment defense theory at trial.\"The defendant became aware after his arrest that several individuals whom he believed to be fellow conspirators were actually undercover informants or agents, including Confidential Human Sources (CHS) 'Dan' and 'Steve.' The defendant was not entrapped or induced to commit any crimes by these individuals.\"A judge sentenced Ty Garbin, a co-defendant who pleaded guilty last January to a kidnapping conspiracy charge, to six years in prison. Prosecutors acknowledged Garbin cooperated significantly with the government against his co-defendants. He's expected to testify against his former co-conspirators at trial. Four defendants remain as the trial nears. A final pretrial hearing is set for February 18. The trial is currently scheduled to begin March 8 and last six to eight weeks.",

        "content": "New York (CNN)Michael Avenatti was convicted Friday of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft for stealing from Stormy Daniels.Prosecutors alleged that Avenatti -- who helped negotiate the $800,000 advance for Daniels' October 2018 book \"Full Disclosure\" -- defrauded his former client by instructing her literary agent to send two of the installments of the advance totaling nearly $300,000 to an account controlled by him, rather than directly to Daniels, without her knowledge. Speaking to cameras outside a federal courthouse in lower Manhattan Friday, Avenatti said he is \"very disappointed\" in the verdict.\"I'm very disappointed in the jury's verdict. I look forward to a full adjudication of all of the issues on appeal,\" Avenatti told CNN.Avenatti is scheduled to be sentenced on May 24.  Read MoreThe verdict came after an eventful day when the jury asked the judge for help, saying one of the 12 was \"acting on a feeling\" and not considering evidence. \"We have one juror who is refusing to look at evidence and is acting on a feeling. We need assistance on moving forward. She does not believe she needs to prove her side using evidence and refuses to show us how she has come to her conclusion,\" the note said, according to Judge Jesse Furman.\"Please help us move forward not going on any evidence, all emotions and does not understand this job of a jury,\" the note added, with the word \"please\" underlined.Daniels to Avenatti in court: 'You lied to me, that's not respectful'Avenatti moved for a mistrial arguing that the jury is clearly deadlocked, and any further instruction or action would be coercive. Furman considered the motion but denied it saying, \"I don't think we're there yet.\"Avenatti opposed some wording in the instruction telling the judge it could \"appear to convince a potential hold-out juror for acquittal.\" The judge noted Avenatti's assumption that the jury was leaning to convict him and said they had no way of knowing the jury split.The jury had been deliberating since Wednesday.Furman also denied prosecutors' request to ask the jury foreperson to identify the holdout juror so the court may consider remedies including dismissal of that juror for refusing to deliberate. Just before noon, the judge brought the jury into the courtroom to instruct jurors of their duties to deliberate based on the evidence and charge them to continue pushing forward. The instruction in part reminded jurors they are not \"to be swayed by sympathy or emotion\" when considering evidence to reach a verdict. The jury of seven women and five men had no visible reactions to the judge's instructions.Daniels' CNN interview After the jury left for lunch, the judge discussed his earlier ruling denying Avenatti's motion for a mistrial based on Daniels' Friday interview on CNN's \"New Day,\" calling it \"beyond frivolous.\" Avenatti said the interview was \"outrageous.\"In the interview, Daniels said she was \"flabbergasted\" that the jury was still deliberating and speculated there could be some bias against her for her work in the adult film industry and belief in paranormal activity.\"Who cares what I believe in, who cares what my spirituality is, where I work, what I've done,\" Daniels told CNN's Brianna Keilar.\"Theft is theft, forgery is forgery -- it really shouldn't matter, it seemed pretty cut and dry\" she said.If Avenatti is found not guilty, she said, that \"sets a precedent that is absolutely terrifying for anybody in the adult film business and anybody that works in the paranormal field or even does paranormal as a hobby.\"\"It basically is free license to commit crimes against us and get away with it, and that's really terrifying,\" she said.The judge said he watched the interview but there was no suggestion any jurors saw it. He advised both parties to rein in comments to the media.Dramatic testimony from Stormy DanielsThe former lawyer, a pugnacious Trump critic who once considered a presidential run of his own, fell from grace after being hit with three federal indictments in a six-week period in 2019. The government rested its case against Avenatti Monday morning after calling 10 witnesses across six days of trial testimony. Avenatti, who dismissed his court-appointed attorneys on the second day of trial to represent himself, ultimately declined to testify in his own defense and did not call any witnesses.  Asked after the verdict if he regretted representing himself or not testifying he said, \"Not at all. I was true to myself.\"Jurors heard from the literary agent, Luke Janklow, who testified that Avenatti funneled contact about the book deal financials around Daniels to him, at times telling Janklow not to answer Daniels' messages. Prosecutors also presented emails and text messages mapping the paper trail of Avenatti's efforts to redirect the payments to the account he controlled.  Daniels testified for about seven hours across two trial days during the government's case. Prosecutor Robert Sobelman methodically went through months of text messages between Daniels and Avenatti in which she repeatedly asked him about the status of her third book advance payment for nearly $150,000. In text messages, Avenatti told Daniels he was \"working on it\" and suggested to her the publishing company was withholding money from her because she hadn't met her publicity requirement for the book. Avenatti said in a statement to CNN ahead of the trial that he is \"completely innocent of these charges. The government is spending millions of dollars to prosecute me for a case that should have never been filed.\" At one point during Avenatti's cross examination of Daniels, when he asked if she had told the government during pretrial interviews that he was typically \"nice and respectful,\" his former client said, \"You lied to me, that's not respectful.\" Daniels eventually conceded that she'd made the statement but added, \"I was wrong.\" Avenatti became a cable television fixture during his representation of Daniels, who was a central figure in the hush-money scandal that resulted in Manhattan federal prosecutors charging Michael Cohen -- former President Donald Trump's onetime personal attorney -- with campaign finance violations for money he paid to silence women, including Daniels, who claimed affairs with Trump. Avenatti rehashed the 2016 hush money payments Cohen made to Daniels on behalf of Trump during his cross examination of Daniels, peppering her with questions about her previous denials of the affair with Trump in public statements. (Trump has denied the alleged affair.)  Cohen, who pleaded guilty to those and other crimes, was recently released after serving a prison and home-confinement sentence. Daniels testified she denied media reports that she'd had a \"romantic affair\" with Trump at the time, \"because it was not romantic.\" \"I did not have a relationship with Donald Trump,\" Daniels said Friday. Unprompted, she added, \"I don't consider getting cornered coming out of the bathroom to be an affair.\" Avenatti faces prison time for other fraud conviction Avenatti was released from the now-defunct Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in April 2020 over Covid-19 concerns amid the rise of the pandemic. He has been in home confinement at a friend's apartment in California ahead of this trial.  In February 2020, Avenatti was convicted in New York of attempting to extort millions of dollars from Nike, by threatening to publicly claim the athletic apparel giant was illicitly paying amateur basketball players. He was sentenced last July to 30 months in prison for which he's expected to report to a federal prison work camp in Oregon. His report date for that sentence has been pushed pending the outstanding litigation.He recently filed a formal claim for $94 million in damages against the Bureau of Prisons for his treatment at MCC, where Avenatti alleges he was treated poorly in dire conditions at the order of then-Attorney General William Barr, according to the complaint. A federal judge granted a mistrial in another case in California in which Avenatti was accused of embezzling nearly $10 million in settlement funds from at least five clients for personal use. The judge granted the motion for mistrial last August on technical grounds, ruling that prosecutors failed to turn financial evidence over to Avenatti's team. Avenatti, who also represented himself in that case, appealed the possibility of a retrial and it is unclear if he will be retried in that case. Avenatti still faces a second trial in California where he has been charged with tax fraud and bank fraud. He has pleaded not guilty.This story has been updated with additional details.",

        "content": "New York (CNN)Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, on trial for federal fraud charges, continued his cross-examination of his former client Stormy Daniels for several hours on Friday, punctuated by contentious exchanges about their relationship and her relationship with former President Donald Trump.Avenatti, on trial for allegedly stealing nearly $300,000 in book advance payments from adult-film actress Daniels, is representing himself, and Judge Jesse Furman several times stepped in during sharp exchanges. Prosecutors allege that Avenatti -- who helped negotiate the $800,000 advance for her October 2018 book, \"Full Disclosure\" -- defrauded her by instructing her literary agent to send two of the four installments of the book advance to an account controlled by him, rather than directly to Daniels.He allegedly sent a fabricated letter to the agent with a manufactured signature from Daniels redirecting book advance payments from Daniels' account to another account he controlled without her knowledge, prosecutors say.At one point, when Avenatti asked if Daniels told the government during pretrial interviews that he was typically \"nice and respectful,\" his former client said, \"You lied to me, that's not respectful.\"Read MoreDaniels eventually conceded that she'd made the statement but said, \"I was wrong.\"Avenatti also rehashed the 2016 hush money payments Michael Cohen made to Daniels on behalf of Trump, and Daniels' previous denial of having an affair. (Trump has denied the affair.)Cohen made an appearance in court Friday but was not in the courtroom during this exchange.Daniels testified she denied media reports that she'd had a \"romantic affair\" with Trump at the time, \"because it was not romantic.\" Avenatti also peppered Daniels with questions about the January 2018 statements and her defense of it in media interviews including a March 2018 appearance on CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" \"I did not have a relationship with Donald Trump,\" Daniels said Friday.Unprompted, Daniels added, \"I don't consider getting cornered coming out of the bathroom to be an affair.\" Prosecutors intend to rest the government's case Monday after calling a law enforcement witness. Avenatti is expected to begin his defense case then and told the court he is \"strongly leaning in favor of testifying.\"",

Daniels testified that Avenatti never told her about the trust account and did not sign any documents approving those transactions.Prosecutor Robert Sobelman methodically went through months of text messages between Daniels and Avenatti in which she repeatedly asked him about the status of her third book advance payment for nearly $150,000.  In text messages, Avenatti told Daniels he was \"working on it\" and suggested to her the publishing company was withholding money from her because she hadn't met her publicity requirement for the book. Avenatti in November 2018 directed Daniels to compile a list of her promotional efforts so he could send a letter demanding payment from the publisher.Daniels testified she didn't know whether he had ever sent the letter. She also didn't know at the time that he'd received the payment in mid-September. Over the holidays in December 2018 Daniels pushed Avenatti for help with the payment, especially angry over her current personal situation with her then-estranged husband.\"I am trapped in this house with my ex until i get paid,\" she wrote in a text.Avenatti is now representing himself, and questioned Daniels on cross examination for about 10 minutes before the trial adjourned for the day.Mistrial declared in Michael Avenatti embezzlement caseIn the brief questioning Avenatti confirmed with Daniels that she believes she can speak to the dead and speaks to a haunted doll name Susan on her show \"Spooky Babes.\" (Judge Jesse Furman had ruled ahead of the trial that Avenatti could inquire about her paranormal beliefs because it may speak to her credibility.)Avenatti also asked his former client if she believes that she has a \"perfect\" memory, always tells the truth and takes contracts very seriously. Daniels agreed.  Avenatti had Daniels read portions of their attorney-client contract at the crux of this case. A section of the contract says the parties could negotiate his compensation should she secure a book deal in the future. She confirmed the document was their only written agreement and was never modified. \"Do you have a single text message, email, voicemail or recording that says I would not take any money from your book deal -- Yes or no?\"She answered, \"No.\" Daniels claims that Avenatti said he would never take any money from the book deal. She cut ties in February 2019 when she figured out he was stealing and was arrested on the charges three months later. Daniels says she never received any compensation for the third book advance payment he allegedly redirected to his account and spent. Daniels is expected to continue testifying on cross examination Friday morning.",

Earlier in the day, Furman cut off Avenatti's former defense attorney Andrew Dalack's cross-examination of Stormy Daniels' literary agent Luke Janklow. The judge cautioned the attorney to move on and wrap up certain lines of questioning several times during the cross examination until eventually Furman told the lawyer to sit down.Outside the presence of the jury, Furman explained his reasoning for stopping the cross-examination, \"I don't think there was a single relevant question,\" during Dalack's 45 minutes of cross-examination Tuesday morning.

Andrew previously pleaded not guilty to the charges against him in connection to the allegations. He now faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for the wire fraud charge and agreed to pay restitution to the charter schools network for the money he stole, according to a Southern District of New York news release. \"Seth Andrew, a former White House advisor, admitted today to devising a scheme to steal from the very same schools he helped create,\" US Attorney Damian Williams said in the news release. \"Andrew now faces time in federal prison for abusing his position and robbing those he promised to help.\"The former Obama White House adviser is scheduled to be sentenced in Manhattan federal court April 14.Read MoreAndrew's attorney, Edward Kim, said in a statement that \"Seth's life has always been motivated by a civic mission and he deeply regrets his past mistakes. He has, with courage, accepted responsibility for them. With the help and support of his family and loved ones, Seth looks forward to deepening his commitment to service and innovation in the next chapter of his life.\"As CNN previously reported, prosecutors said Andrew helped create a network of charter schools based in New York City in 2005, left the network in 2013 for a job at the US Department of Education, and later became a senior adviser in the Office of Educational Technology at the White House, where he continued to be paid by the charter school network. Prosecutors say Andrew left his role in the White House in November 2016 and cut ties with the school network in January 2017.According to a criminal complaint filed on April 20, prosecutors alleged that between March and August of 2019, Andrew used his former association with the network of schools to steal $218,005 of the school's reserve money by using his email address affiliated with the schools to email a bank employee and convince them that he was still associated with the school, which he was not.The complaint stated that after allegedly stealing the school network's money, Andrew \"attempted to conceal the source of the stolen funds ... and make it appear that the stolen funds belonged to a non-profit organization that Andrew founded, and currently appears to control.\"Prosecutors alleged Andrew misrepresented that he \"lawfully controlled\" the money in order to obtain a discounted mortgage interest rate to buy an apartment in Manhattan.CNN's Sonia Moghe contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)A federal judge in New York on Wednesday denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit against Prince Andrew filed by Virginia Giuffre, a woman who alleges she was sexually trafficked to the royal when she was underage.\"Ms. Giuffre's complaint is neither 'unintelligible' nor 'vague' nor 'ambiguous,'\" Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in the ruling. \"It alleges discrete incidents of sexual abuse in particular circumstances at three identifiable locations. It identifies to whom it attributes that sexual abuse.\" Giuffre alleged in the lawsuit that the late financier Jeffrey Epstein trafficked her and forced her to have sex with his friends, including the Prince, and that Andrew was aware she was underage (17) in the US at the time. She alleges the Prince sexually abused her at Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands, at his mansion in Manhattan and at his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell's home in London.Prince Andrew has denied the allegations and had moved to dismiss the suit. CNN has reached out to his attorneys for further comment.The ruling sets up a dramatic series of legal proceedings for Queen Elizabeth II's third child that could have major ramifications for Buckingham Palace. The long-running allegations against Andrew, 61, have already dramatically tarnished his public standing, and he stepped back from royal duties in late 2019.Read MoreWhat to know about Prince Andrew's sexual abuse lawsuit in the USAndrew has until July 14 to potentially answer questions about the case under oath, following a ruling made by Kaplan last year. If the case is not settled, Prince Andrew could face a trial date between September and December 2022.Buckingham Palace declined to comment, saying, \"We would not comment on what is an ongoing legal matter.\"Giuffre's attorney Sigrid McCawley said the judge's ruling is \"another important step in Virginia's heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking.\"The civil suit stems from the sprawling and disturbing allegations against Epstein, the wealthy sex offender who befriended a series of powerful men despite a sketchy history.Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges and in July 2019 was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges. Prosecutors accused him of carrying out a decades long scheme of sexual abuse of underage girls, flying them on private planes to his properties in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands. He died by suicide in prison before he could face trial. Maxwell, his former girlfriend and close associate, was arrested in 2020 and accused of facilitating the abuse scheme. A federal jury convicted her in December on five federal counts, including sex trafficking a minor and conspiracy. Giuffre was not one of the four women who testified in Maxwell's trial that they had been abused. Still, she was mentioned in the trial when Carolyn, one of the victims, testified that Giuffre had recruited her to come to Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida.What the ruling meansBritain's Prince Andrew could face a trial date in late 2022.Kaplan's ruling Wednesday allowed the lawsuit to continue, but he did not determine the facts or validity of the case.The prince's attorneys had argued that Giuffre's lawsuit violated the terms of her 2009 settlement agreement with Epstein in Florida, in which she agreed to a \"general release\" of claims against Epstein and others. That settlement, which was released to the public last week, shows that Epstein paid Giuffre $500,000 to drop the case without any admission of liability or fault. The prince's name does not explicitly appear as a party. However, Giuffre's attorney David Boies argued the settlement is irrelevant to her claim against the prince, noting Andrew did not know about it at the time and that it didn't apply to him.In the ruling, Kaplan wrote that both sides put forth \"reasonable interpretations\" of the settlement's meaning.Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre's 2009 settlement with Jeffrey Epstein released\"The agreement therefore is ambiguous. Accordingly, the determination of the meaning of the release language in the 2009 Agreement must await further proceedings,\" he wrote.Giuffre brought her case under the Child Victims Act, a New York state law enacted in 2019 that temporarily expanded the statute of limitations in child sex abuse cases to give survivors more opportunities to seek justice. Prince Andrew's attorneys argued that the law is unconstitutional, but the judge rejected the argument, citing another judge's analysis that this line of argument was \"creative\" but \"without merit.\"Further, the judge denied the defense's request for a clearer statement of facts from Giuffre, writing in his opinion that Prince Andrew will naturally obtain more details about the claims during the pretrial discovery process. Kaplan also rejected the defense assertion that Giuffre's claims in the complaint are vague or ambiguous.What Giuffre allegesIn claims made prior to filing her lawsuit, Giuffre alleged that in 2001 Epstein brought her to London, where she was introduced to Prince Andrew and went dancing at a nightclub with Epstein, Maxwell and the Prince.In a BBC interview broadcast in 2019, Giuffre said she had been taken to the Tramp nightclub where, Giuffre alleged, Andrew asked her to dance and was \"sweating all over me.\"Andrew has denied the claims, telling the BBC in 2019: \"It didn't happen. I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened. I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\"He claimed in the same interview that he could not sweat, due to a rare medical condition, and that on the night he is alleged to have had sex with Giuffre, he was in fact taking his daughter to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, southwest of London.Giuffre's lawyers asked Andrew in court filings to provide documents proving both of those claims. Andrew's team responded that he was unable to do so, because he has no documents proving a medical condition that prevents sweating, and could not identity anyone he encountered at the pizza restaurant.CNN's Max Foster, Sonia Moghe, Rob Picheta, Kara Scannell and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.",

The guards agreed to provide \"truthful information related to their employment by the Bureau of Prisons, including about the events and circumstances described in the Indictment,\" according to a letter from federal prosecutors that was filed in court papers.

The counts were supposed to take place every 30 minutes.To mask the fact that they had allegedly neglected to complete the checks, the two signed false certifications saying they had performed their duties, according to the indictment.The night Epstein died, no officer completed any count or round in the unit between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., at which time Noel and Thomas discovered Epstein's body, the indictment said.New York City's chief medical examiner ruled Epstein's August 10, 2019, death a suicide by hanging, though a former medical examiner hired by Epstein's legal team disagreed with that conclusion.

Judge Alison Nathan did not set a sentencing date. FOLLOW LIVE UPDATESRead More\"The road to justice has been far too long.

Their courage and willingness to face their abuser made this case, and today's result, possible.\"The jury, which was made up of six women and six men, deliberated for about 40 hours across parts of six days. 4 women testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's trial that they were sexually abused. Here's what they saidProsecutors argued Maxwell and Epstein conspired to set up a scheme to lure young girls into sexual relationships with Epstein from 1994 to 2004 in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands. Four women testified during the trial that Epstein abused them and that Maxwell facilitated the abuse and sometimes participated in it as well.

Obviously, we are very disappointed with the verdict,\" Sternheim said, adding her team believes Maxwell still will be vindicated.The trial, which began November 29, alternated between disturbing testimony from sexual abuse victims and illuminating testimony about some of Epstein's connections to some high-profile celebrities.Annie Farmer, one of four accusers who testified, said Wednesday she hopes the verdicts bring solace to the victims.Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction sends a vital message\"I am so relieved and grateful that the jury recognized the pattern of predatory behavior that Maxwell engaged in for years and found her guilty of these crimes,\" she said. \"She has caused hurt to many more women than the few of us who had the chance to testify in the courtroom.\"Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 but died by suicide in prison a month later. Maxwell, his confidante and former girlfriend, was arrested a year afterward and has been held in jail since. It remains to be seen whether others will be prosecuted. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, a former prosecutor in the district where Maxwell was tried, said this was not a two-person operation.He pointed to civil lawsuits that link others to the abuse.\"I think prosecutors have a real obligation to dig all the way down to the bottom, and bring anyone else who may have been part of this to justice,\" he said.A sketch of Ghislaine Maxwell during the  court session Wednesday where she was found guilty on five of six federal charges.

        "content": "(CNN)The case against Ghislaine Maxwell primarily relied on the testimony of four women who said they were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein when they were under 18 -- and that Maxwell facilitated and sometimes participated in that abuse, too.Maxwell, 60, had pleaded not guilty to six federal charges: sex trafficking of minors, enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and three counts of conspiracy.She was found guilty by a New York jury on five of the six counts and acquitted on the charge of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison.Prosecutors had argued that Maxwell and Epstein created a system of sexual abuse in which they lured underage girls into sexual relationships with Epstein using the ruse of a massage and cash payments. Her defense, though, argued she is being scapegoated for Epstein's actions and has attacked the memories and motivations of the women who say they were abused.Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 but died by suicide in prison a month later. Maxwell was arrested a year afterward.Read MoreWoman testifies Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein started sexually abusing her when she was 14CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Paul Callan said Epstein's death and the passage of so much time posed a huge challenge for prosecutors in this case. The government alleges the abuse occurred between 1994 and 2004.\"Proving sex abuse and rape cases from decades ago is generally an extraordinarily difficult task,\" Callan says. \"Proof in cases where children are involved are even more difficult. Memories of children are often unreliable and malleable.\"Prosecutors called 24 witnesses across 10 days of testimony. \"Despite substantial obstacles, prosecutors finished strongly\" with Annie Farmer, the fourth and final accuser to take the stand, providing \"vivid testimony,\" Callan said.Testimony from the victims began on November 30 with \"Jane,\" who said that Maxwell sometimes joined in on the sexualized massages. \"Kate\" testified December 6 that Maxwell set up those sexual meetings. Carolyn testified the next day that Maxwell once touched her breasts, hips and butt and told her she \"had a great body for Epstein and his friends.\" She was 14 at the time, she said.Finally, Farmer testified that she was 16 years old when Maxwell massaged her naked chest at Epstein's New Mexico ranch in 1996.Here's a closer look at what these women said under oath.What Jane saidIn this sketch, Ghislaine Maxwell, seated left, speaks to her defense attorney on Monday, December 6.A woman identified in court by the pseudonym \"Jane\" testified she met Maxwell and Epstein in 1994 when she was 14 at a camp where he was a benefactor.She and her mother met Epstein for tea in Florida and he said he could mentor her. She then started going to Epstein's home by herself. At first, Maxwell and Epstein made her feel special -- spending time with her, asking about her family and interests and taking her to do fun things, she said. For the first few months, Maxwell felt like an older sister, she said. \"It changed when the abuse started happening,\" she said.  Jeffrey Epstein denied having any suicidal thoughts and prison staffers made litany of errors prior to his death, prison documents reveal Jane described in graphic detail incidents of sexual abuse with Epstein that Maxwell would at times join in on, both in Palm Beach, Florida, and Manhattan when she was 14, 15 and 16 years old.At times, Epstein would masturbate on her and molest her, she said. Maxwell would sometimes be involved, touching her and Epstein, she testified. At least once, Maxwell \"instructed\" her how Epstein liked to be massaged while the three were in Epstein's massage room, she testified.\"It seemed very casual, like it was very normal, like it was not big deal,\" she said. \"It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me.\"She said it took her years before she was able to tell anyone about what happened, saying she felt \"shame and disgust and confusion.\"On cross-examination, defense attorneys combed through her statements to law enforcement since 2019 to try to show inconsistencies with her testimony in court.In the statements, Jane told law enforcement agents that she wasn't sure if Maxwell ever touched her and she didn't remember Maxwell ever being present for any sexual activity between her and Epstein. Jane repeatedly testified she didn't recall if she'd said that to investigators.At other times Jane testified that the law enforcement notes from those interviews were inaccurate, inconsistent with her timeline and not an accurate transcript of her statements, which were not recorded. Maxwell was found not guilty of the charge of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, a charge that was related to Jane. However, she was found guilty on the other charge relating to Jane: transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.What Kate saidProsecutors introduced into evidence this photo of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.\"Kate\" testified she first met Maxwell through an older boyfriend when she was 17.Maxwell invited her for tea at her London townhome and told Kate about Epstein and later invited her again to meet him, she testified.There, Maxwell told her to give Epstein's foot a little \"squeeze\" to show him how strong she was despite her small frame, Kate testified. Epstein approved of the foot massage and also had her massage his shoulders.A couple of weeks later, Maxwell called Kate to ask whether she would do her \"a favor\" and come give Epstein a massage, even though she had no massage therapy experience. Maxwell led Kate upstairs in her townhome to a bedroom where Epstein stood in a robe, gave Kate massage oil, and closed the door behind her. Epstein disrobed and initiated a sex act with her, she said.Maxwell called her back a second for another meeting with Epstein. \"She said, 'I'm so glad you're here. You did such a good job last time (that) he wanted you to come back,'\" Kate said.This time, Epstein was standing naked when Maxwell brought Kate to the same room and closed the door behind her. \"Have a good time,\" Maxwell said as she left the room, according to the testimony.Ghislaine Maxwell said Jeffrey Epstein needed to have sex three times a day, woman testifiesIn her testimony, Kate testified she traveled at Epstein's expense several times to New York; Palm Beach, Florida; and Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein had property. Maxwell invited her to Epstein's private island to give him massages and would inform Kate of the travel arrangements, she said.During a visit to the Palm Beach residence when she was about 18, a \"school girl\" outfit -- a pleated skirt, white panties, white socks and a shirt -- was left on her bed, according to her testimony. When she asked Maxwell what it was for, Maxwell said, \"I thought it would be fun for you to take Jeffrey his tea in this outfit,\" Kate testified.Maxwell spoke of sexual topics often with Kate, asking her if she knew any other girls that could give Epstein oral sex. \"She said that he needed to have sex about three times a day,\" Kate said. \"You know what he likes -- cute, young (and) pretty like you,\" Maxwell said, according to the testimony.Kate said she kept in contact with Epstein until around 2012. She was about 24 when she last traveled with Maxwell and Epstein, but she continued contact with Epstein through her early 30s, she testified.She described staying in contact with him as a mix of denial and fear.\"I did not want to admit what had happened to me and I felt that by ceasing communication I would have to acknowledge the events that had taken place and I would have to say something,\" she said. \"I was also fearful of disengaging because I had witnessed how connected they both were and I was fearful.\"Kate is not considered a minor victim in the charges because she was over the age of consent at the time of the alleged abuse, but jurors were still allowed to consider her testimony, Judge Alison Nathan ruled. The jury could not convict Maxwell on any of the counts based solely on testimony from Kate, as she was over the age of consent at the time of the events, the judge instructed. However, two of the conspiracy charges Maxwell was found guilty of -- conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity -- related to allegations by all four accusers.What Carolyn saidProsecutors say Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with Jeffrey Epstein to create a system of sexual abuse of underage girls.Carolyn, who testified using only her first name, said she was 14 years old when she began to go to Epstein's home in Palm Beach, two or three times per week in the early 2000s.On one visit, Carolyn was setting up a massage room for him when Maxwell came into the room. Maxwell touched Carolyn's breasts, hips and buttocks, and commented that she \"had a great body for Epstein and his friends,\" according to her testimony.Carolyn said she went to Epstein's over a hundred times in all. Each time she visited, $300 in cash was left for her on the bathroom sink, she said.\"Something sexual happened every single time,\" Carolyn said.She said that she remembered bringing three different friends around her age with her over the years. On those occasions she'd receive $600 in cash as an incentive for bringing them, and her friends would receive $300.Accuser testifies Ghislaine Maxwell told her she 'had a great body for Epstein and his friends.' She was 14.Carolyn described a number of sexual encounters with Epstein. She also said Maxwell saw her naked in the massage room \"probably three times\" over the years.Maxwell and Epstein separately invited her to go to an island, but she told them she was too young and her mom wouldn't let her travel out of the country, she testified. She also didn't have a passport.Sometimes, Maxwell or another Epstein associate would call her to set up an \"appointment\" time, Carolyn testified. Other times she would call to ask if she could come over because she wanted the money, she said. She testified that Maxwell and the associate would call her on her mom or her boyfriend's phone numbers if they couldn't reach her.She said she used the money to buy drugs. Defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca cross-examined Carolyn for more than two hours and spent considerable time suggesting Carolyn made inconsistent statements about her timeline, including a 2007 FBI meeting and in a 2009 deposition for lawsuits she pursued against Epstein.Carolyn sobbed when prosecutor Maurene Comey asked if she was trying to get money for her testimony.\"No, money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,\" Carolyn said. \"Because what she did was wrong and she takes vulnerable young girls and traffics them and I'm so petrified that my daughters are going to be trafficked.\" Maxwell was found guilty of the substantive charge of sex trafficking Carolyn between 2001 and 2004, when she was a minor. She was also found guilty of participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy connected to Carolyn's testimony.What Annie Farmer saidJUST WATCHEDFrustration grows over heavily redacted Epstein pilot's flight logsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFrustration grows over heavily redacted Epstein pilot's flight logs 02:40Annie Farmer, who testified under her full name, has spoken out publicly about Epstein and Maxwell for years. She spoke in open court during both Epstein's 2019 bail hearing and Maxwell's bail hearing a year later. She testified for three hours, the fourth and final accuser to do so. Her older sister worked for Epstein, and Farmer met him during the 1995 holiday season. Epstein paid for her commercial flight to New York and at a movie held hands with her and caressed her foot, she said in court.She described going to the billionaire's ranch in New Mexico in 1996 at age 16, where she thought she would be joining other peers but she was the only teen there.Ghislaine Maxwell denied another request to be released on bail ahead of trialThere, Maxwell told her to get undressed and gave her a rubdown, telling her she wanted Farmer to experience a professional massage, Farmer testified.At some point as she lay on her back, Maxwell pulled the sheet down, exposing her naked breasts, and rubbed her chest and upper breast, Farmer testified.\"Once she pulled down the sheet I felt like kind of frozen,\" she testified. \"It didn't make sense to me that that would happen. I just wanted so badly to get off the table and have this massage be done.\"On her last day at the ranch Epstein bounded into her guestroom where she still lay in bed telling her he wanted to \"cuddle.\" \"He climbed into bed with me and kind of laid behind me and reached his arms around me and like pressed his body into me,\" she said.Feeling uncomfortable, she made an excuse to get out of bed and went to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Farmer said that while in New Mexico they went to see the movie \"Primal Fear,\" where Epstein again caressed her in a more \"blatant\" way, seemingly making no effort to hide it from Maxwell, she recalled. Later that day, Maxwell insisted she teach Farmer how to massage Epstein's bare feet, Farmer testified. Under cross-examination, Farmer acknowledged Maxwell was not in the room when Epstein got into her bed. In addition, defense attorney Laura Menninger repeatedly pointed out that Maxwell was not present on Farmer's trip to New York.Menninger suggested that Farmer overstated what she alleges happened to her in her public statements and on her Epstein Victim Compensation Program application for personal gain.CNN's Brian Vitagliano, Christina Maxouris and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

        "content": "New York (CNN)The judge overseeing Ghislaine Maxwell's federal sex trafficking trial expressed her concern that Covid-19 could upend deliberations and requested the panel to stay later each day, but the jury Tuesday asked to go home at its regular time.The 12-member panel has now deliberated for parts of five days -- about 32 hours -- and plans to resume Wednesday morning.Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has pleaded not guilty to six federal counts: sex trafficking of a minor, enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and three related counts of conspiracy. On Monday evening, Judge Alison Nathan asked the jurors to plan to stay until at least 6 p.m. going forward, an hour later than their usual time of departure. She expressed further concern on Tuesday morning, citing the spread of the Omicron variant in New York City.Read More\"We are very simply at a different place regarding the pandemic than we were only one week ago and we now face a high and escalating risk that jurors and/or trial participants may need to quarantine, thus disrupting trial (and) putting at risk our ability to complete this trial,\" she said. But the jurors sent a note saying they were at a good place to stop for the day and they wanted to finish at 5 p.m.\"Our deliberations are moving along and we are making progress,\" the note also said, according to Nathan.The judge told the attorneys outside of the jury's presence that if no verdict is reached Wednesday, she will tell jurors to clear their schedule to deliberate over the New Year's holiday weekend.\"Put simply, I conclude that proceeding this way is the best chance to both give the jury as much time as they need and to avoid a mistrial as a result of the Omicron variant,\" the judge said. 4 women testified at Ghislaine Maxwell's trial that they were sexually abused. Here's what they saidJurors must be available to deliberate every day unless they have a substantial hardship because of an unmovable commitment, the judge told the panel before dismissing them for the day. If convicted on all six counts, Maxwell faces up to 70 years in prison.Last week, jurors deliberated for about an hour Monday and all of Tuesday and Wednesday; they returned this week to deliberate on Monday. In that time, they asked the court to provide the transcripts of testimony from \"Jane,\" \"Kate,\" Carolyn and Annie Farmer -- the four women whose claims form the core of the case against Maxwell.The jury has also requested transcripts of testimony from four other witnesses: Juan Alessi, Maxwell's house manager; \"Matt,\" Jane's former boyfriend; Gregory Parkinson, the former Palm Beach Police crime scene manager who was present at the 2005 search of Epstein's house in Palm Beach, Florida; and David Rogers, a pilot for Epstein and Maxwell.Prosecutors introduced a series of undated photos at trial showing Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein together.On Monday, the jury asked for a definition of \"enticement,\" which is part of two of the charges, and sent the judge a question about a charge involving travel for one of the accusers.The deliberations cap a three-week trial highlighted by testimony from the four women, who said Maxwell recruited and groomed them to be sexually abused by Epstein and sometimes participated in that abuse. The abuse allegedly began when they were younger than 18, and their accusations stretched from 1994 to 2004.Epstein, an elusive financier who pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution charges, was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019; he died by suicide in prison a month later.

Now, as Russian forces ramp up their deadly military campaign in Ukraine, the yachts are emerging as key targets of the US and European allies, who are vowing to seize property owned by Putin's enablers. Disputes are already erupting: French officials seized a yacht Wednesday night that they said was linked to Igor Sechin, a sanctioned Russian oil executive and close Putin associate, as it was preparing to flee a port. But the company that manages the ship denied Sechin was the owner. And the White House said German officials had seized another oligarch's yacht in Hamburg, while local authorities denied any ships had been confiscated.  The French seizure shows that confiscating oligarchs' yachts will require a concerted global effort -- and it's likely to mean protracted legal battles around the world, experts said. Read MoreA CNN review of maritime location data from the website MarineTraffic found that more than a dozen yachts that have been reported to be owned by Russian oligarchs are spread out across the world, from the crystal waters of Antigua to ports in Barcelona and Hamburg to atolls in the Maldives and Seychelles.\u202f\u202f In several cases, the billionaires' yachts have been on the move in the days since the Russian offensive began. \n\nMeanwhile, officials around the world are also enforcing sanctions on a far less flashy but still important group of vessels: oil tankers and container ships the US Treasury Department says are owned by the subsidiary of a bank with close ties to Russia's defense industry.

We're coming for your ill-begotten gains.\" JUST WATCHED'He has no idea what's coming': Biden sends message to PutinReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH'He has no idea what's coming': Biden sends message to Putin 02:36The US Department of Justice launched a new task force -- dubbed KleptoCapture -- to help put Biden's words into action. The effort includes prosecutors, federal agents and experts in money laundering, tax enforcement and national security investigations from the FBI, the IRS, the US Marshals Service, and the US Postal Inspection Service, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday. \"We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute those whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue this unjust war,\" Garland said. Russian-tied yachts docked around the world Yacht ownership is extremely difficult to confirm, with the ships often registered to management companies or shell corporations in an apparent effort to disguise ownership, experts say.\u202f But more than a dozen of the billionaires included in a list of Russian \"oligarchs\" the Treasury Department released in 2018 have been tied to yachts in media reports in recent years, according to a CNN review.\u202f Most of the oligarchs who reportedly own yachts are not yet facing US sanctions. However, some have been sanctioned by the European Union or the United Kingdom, and could be added to US sanctions lists as well.\u202f Amber Vitale, a former official with the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces sanctions, said that US sanctions generally only prevent Americans and American companies from interacting with sanctioned individuals. That means the oligarchs' yachts could be safe from seizure if they stay in international waters or in countries that haven't issued their own sanctions.\u202f \"However, it would get very difficult to operate for long if many allied nations impose similar prohibitions,\" Vitale said in an email. \"Vessels need ports, fuel, operators/captains, repairs and supplies. Without access to these things they could be stuck floating at sea waiting for rescue or resolution.\" The seizures have already begun, with French officials taking the Amore Vero, the yacht they said is owned by Sechin, according to a statement from France's Ministry of Economy and Finance. The yacht arrived at the French port of La Ciotat on January 3 for repairs, but was \"making arrangements to sail urgently, without having completed the planned work\" when it was seized on Wednesday, the ministry said. Sechin, the CEO of the Russian oil company Rosneft, was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Rosneft itself was sanctioned by the US in 2014.The Amore Vero yacht at a shipyard in La Ciotat, in southern France, on March 3, 2022.But a yacht management company associated with the ship denied Sechin owned it. \"I can absolutely say that Igor Sechin is not the owner,\" a spokesperson for Imperial Yachts, which manages the Amore Vero, told CNN. \"The rightful owner is appealing the decision to seize the vessel.\" Legal experts told CNN that oligarchs were likely to transfer assets such as yachts to friends or family who aren't sanctioned to try to prevent them from being seized. Catherine Belton, the author of a book on Putin, said she expected oligarchs were \"feverishly engineering deals where ownership changes could be triggered.\" \"It's going to be a game of cat and mouse,\" she said. The French ministry said that the Amore Vero, which has an onboard gym and beauty salon and won an award for yacht design, is owned by a company whose \"main shareholder\" is Sechin. Sechin served as Russia's deputy prime minister in Putin's cabinet before becoming CEO of Rosneft, one of the country's largest companies, in 2012.  The seizure may also scare other Russian oligarchs into getting their ships out of EU ports. The Dilbar, one of the largest yachts in the world, which is reportedly owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, arrived in Hamburg, Germany in late October, according to MarineTraffic data. There was confusion about the ship's status on Thursday: Usmanov was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Forbes reported that German authorities had seized the 156-meter ship, which can carry up to 96 crew members and 24 guests. The US Treasury Department also sanctioned Usmanov on Thursday, specifically calling out the Dilbar as evidence of his \"luxurious lifestyle.\" But a spokesperson for the Hamburg economic authority told CNN Thursday that \"no yacht has been seized by authorities or customs at the port in Hamburg at this moment in time.\" German customs officials did not respond to CNN's requests for comment, and the shipbuilding company that reportedly had been refitting the yacht declined to comment. A file photo dated September 10, 2018 shows the yacht Dilbar.The Luna, a yacht reportedly owned by Farkhad Akhmedov, an Azerbaijani billionaire who previously led a Russian natural gas company, was also in Hamburg as of the latest MarineTraffic data from earlier this week. Akhmedov, who has not been sanctioned, kept the nine-deck, 115-meter Luna after an acrimonious divorce that was the largest divorce case heard in Britain's legal history.\u202f The yacht features missile detection technology and bulletproof windows.Several yachts reportedly owned by Russian oligarchs have been docked at a port in Barcelona, including the Solaris, which has been tied to Roman Abramovich, the billionaire who announced Wednesday that he would sell the Chelsea Football Club and donate proceeds to a foundation for people impacted by the invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich hasn't been sanctioned. The Galactica Super Nova, reportedly owned by Russian oil company executive Vagit Alekperov, left Barcelona on Saturday and crossed the Mediterranean to Tivat, Montenegro, before sailing south into the Adriatic Sea. While Alekperov hasn't been sanctioned, he is president of Lukoil, which has been hit by US sanctions in the past. Other Russian-linked yachts are in the Caribbean, including Eclipse, another yacht owned by Abramovich, which is among the world's largest and includes a swimming pool that can be transformed into a dance floor, and the Anna, reportedly owned by oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, who once purchased a Florida mansion from former President Donald Trump. Rybolovlev hasn't been sanctioned. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have information to share about this story? We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nCourtney, the former ambassador, said that he expected Russian oligarchs took most of their assets out of the US after two billionaires were sanctioned in 2018, and predicted that they would try to move their yachts out of Western European countries to avoid them being seized. \"We are likely to see more of a redistribution geographically of some of those assets,\" Courtney said, to countries \"that are seen as less likely to sanction,\" possibly in the Middle East.\u202f\u202f Several yachts connected to Russian oligarchs have arrived in recent weeks in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago nation. They include the Clio, reportedly owned by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which left Sri Lanka in early February and has been sailing between various Maldives atolls since then, according to MarineTraffic. Deripaska was sanctioned by the US in 2018. None of the oligarchs mentioned in this story responded to requests for comment from CNN sent to their spokespeople, businesses or lawyers.\u202f Perhaps the clearest example of a yacht with supposed ties to the Russian elite fleeing the West is a Russian-flagged ship named Graceful. Speculative news articles in the German media have reported that the ship belongs to Putin himself, although there's no concrete evidence that that's the case.\u202f Graceful departed Hamburg in early February -- roughly two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine -- and sped to Kaliningrad, Russia, the MarineTraffic data shows. No location data has been recorded since it arrived in the Russian city on February 9.\u202f \n\nHackers last week successfully altered maritime traffic data to make it appear that the yacht's destination was \"hell\" and it had run aground on Snake Island in Ukraine -- where Ukrainian soldiers' profane response to a Russian warship went viral on social media.\u202f Sanctions will likely spark legal battles over the yachts, and require government officials to prove ownership, experts said.\u202f \"A sanctioned person may say to the government that the asset you have frozen is not one of my assets,\" arguing that it is registered in a family member's name or a shell corporation that has not specifically been sanctioned, said Raj Bhala, a professor at the University of Kansas Law School and a sanctions expert.\u202f\"The oligarch could argue before the government that you don't really have the legal authority to seize my asset.\" But there are new dangers for the oligarchs' yachts beyond legal proceedings: A Ukrainian ship engineer was arrested in the Spanish island of Mallorca for trying to sink a yacht owned by a Russian military export company executive, local news outlets reported. \"I don't regret anything I've done and I would do it again,\" the engineer declared in court on Sunday, according to the Majorca Daily Bulletin. \"They were attacking innocents.\" Sanctioned shipping vessels seized, blocked from ports\u202f Even as Biden and other officials have focused their public comments on oligarchs' yachts, the US is also going after other shipping vessels with ties to Russia.\u202f Last week, the Biden administration announced sanctions against five oil, cargo and container ships that the Treasury Department says are owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank that has given billions of dollars to support Russian defense companies. The sanctions block any Americans from doing business with Promsvyazbank. French authorities seized one of the cargo ships, the Baltic Leader, on Saturday as it was headed from France to Saint Petersburg, Russia, \"as part of an operation carried out in cooperation with US authorities,\" according to France's finance ministry. The ship is now anchored at a port in northern France, MarineTraffic data shows. A port operator in Malaysia declined the request of one of the other vessels, an oil tanker named Linda, to dock there on March 5 \"in order not to violate any sanctions,\" Malaysia's Ministry of Transport told CNN. The decision was first reported by Reuters.\u202f Promsvyazbank did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but has publicly denied that its subsidiary owned the Linda, and said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. Two of the other US-sanctioned ships are now in the process of having their leases withdrawn from Promsvyazbank's subsidiary, according to a statement from Russian company FESCO Transportation Group. Some of the ships have been accused in recent years of violating past US sanctions by transporting Iranian oil. A Turkish petroleum company had agreed to service another one of the ships -- an oil tanker named Pegas -- at one of its terminals earlier this year, but after receiving a report that the ship may have been carrying Iranian cargo, the transaction was canceled, according to a spokesperson for the company, Opet.\u202f CNN's Majlie de Puy Kamp and Nadine Schmidt contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)In the years leading up to Russia's attack on Ukraine, US lobbyists have raked in millions of dollars from Russian banks and financial firms paying to push their interests in Washington.Now, in the wake of the Russian invasion and new sanctions announced by President Joe Biden, many of those lobbying firms are rushing to cut ties and drop their lucrative contracts.At least six lobbying firms that previously represented now-sanctioned Russian banks and companies tied to a Russian natural gas pipeline terminated their contracts or representation this week, according to statements and federal lobbying disclosures. The exodus marks the rupture of a Moscow-to-K-Street conduit that has long employed former federal officials and members of Congress of both parties, experts said. \"For anybody that's representing a Russian entity in Washington, DC, it's an uphill climb ... that has just gotten a lot steeper,\" said Benjamin Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a foreign policy think tank, who has written a book on foreign influence. \"It's going to be hard to find a sympathetic ear for any of these Russian clients on the Hill right now.\"Read MoreSanctions announced by US President Joe Biden target VTB Bank PJSC.  Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSome of the banks Biden targeted with sanctions, including VTB, Russia's second-largest, were put under \"full blocking\" sanctions, which freeze organizations' US assets and prohibit them from doing business in the country. That means it would be illegal for lobbyists to work for them unless they receive a license from the Treasury Department, according to legal experts. Dropping contracts with fully blocked banks \"is not a gesture in solidarity with Ukraine, this is a requirement under US law,\" said Erich Ferrari, an attorney who specializes in US economic sanctions. Lobbyists could face prosecution for running afoul of sanctions laws, he said. But even for lobbyists representing firms that aren't fully blocked, it would be a \"real reputational risk for these firms to keep representing these sanctioned entities,\" said Freeman, who called ties to Russia a \"scarlet letter\" in DC. Putin's war was launched on a runway of liesBiden's move to impose sanctions on Russia is intended to make Vladimir Putin's government pay a financial price for the attack on its neighbor -- the most significant military invasion in Europe since World War II. The sanctions will \"impose severe costs on the Russian economy\" and \"exceed anything that's ever been done,\" Biden said in a speech Thursday.Russian stocks fell precipitously in the wake of the invasion and sanctions -- but Putin's government has been preparing for stronger sanctions for years, so it's unclear how much economic damage the measures will do in the long term. The Russian banks did not respond to CNN requests for comment about their lobbyists abandoning them, but several issued statements saying they were prepared for the sanctions or calling Biden's actions politically motivated. \"We have worked through several plans to counter the sanctions in ways which minimize the negative consequences for our clients,\" a spokesperson for VTB wrote in an email. VTB has had one of the longest-running lobbying presences in DC among Russian banks. It has paid lobbying and law firm Sidley Austin more than $2 million since 2015, according to disclosures filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.Battle for Ukrainian capital underway as explosions seen and heard in KyivAmong the company's lobbyists were Rick Boucher, a former Democratic congressman from Virginia, and George Madison, the former general counsel of the US Treasury Department. A spokesperson for Sidley said Friday that VTB is \"no longer a client\" of the firm \"in compliance with US sanctions.\" The spokesperson declined to say when the decision had been made to end representation, but Sidley was still receiving $30,000 a month from VTB as of September 2021, according to its most recent disclosure.VTB hired Sidley and other lobbyists after federal officials placed more limited sanctions on the bank following Putin's takeover of Crimea. In 2016, lobbyists for VTB arranged a meeting between the bank's chairman and State Department official Daniel Fried, who worked on Russian sanctions, and also invited him to a VTB-sponsored gala -- part of a wide-ranging influence campaign, as the Center for Public Integrity first reported in 2018. Fried, who is now a fellow at the Atlantic Council, told CNN that the lobbying had no impact on him or his State Department colleagues. \"I said I'll talk to him but I won't go to his fancy banquets,\" Fried said of the bank's chairman. \"I told him, 'You're part of Putin's system, you benefit from that system, that system is responsible for aggression to Ukraine, and you know perfectly well why we're hitting you.' \"After he left the State Department, Fried said, he had personally been approached by lobbyists offering \"bucket loads of money\" to work for oligarchs trying to avoid sanctions, but he turned down the offers. \"What am I going to do, buy another Prius?\" he asked.Boucher wasn't the only member of Congress to advocate for a Russian bank. David Vitter, a former Republican US senator from Louisiana, and Toby Moffett, a former Democratic congressman from Connecticut, lobbied in recent months for Sovcombank, another bank Biden sanctioned this week. Their firm, Mercury Public Affairs, signed a $90,000-per-month contract with Sovcombank in January, and Vitter lobbied against the bank's inclusion in sanctions legislation being debated on Capitol Hill, federal filings show.Sovcombank \"would be an extremely counterproductive sanctions target\" due to its \"deep ties to US and western institutions,\" Vitter wrote in one message disclosed by Mercury in a Justice Department filing. He said that Sovcombank manages pension funds, employment insurance or savings for more than 40 major US companies, and he argued that the bank being targeted for sanctions \"would have major negative market consequences.\" The firm also reported that it had disseminated a 28-slide PowerPoint presentation that highlighted Sovcombank's environmental sustainability investments and its commitment to diversity.US to impose sanctions on Putin following Ukraine invasionA Mercury spokesperson said the firm had terminated its contract with the bank Thursday when it was included in Biden's sanctions. Among the other companies sanctioned by Biden, a US subsidiary of Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, paid more than $800,000 to Venable LLP for lobbying since 2017, according to Senate records. A former congressional staffer and Treasury Department lawyer registered as lobbyists for the subsidiary, and their work included monitoring legislation and administrative actions related to sanctions, the firm's filings said.A Venable spokesperson said the company had terminated its contract with the Sberbank subsidiary on Friday.And VEB bank, which was sanctioned by the Biden administration earlier this week, paid $62,500 a month to Geopols, a DC communications firm, from 2019 to 2020. Geopols \"provided advice and consultation on public affairs policy and media interactions\" and met with \"U.S. government officials and their staff, and members of the media to discuss potential new sanctions legislation,\" according to filings. Grace Fenstermaker, the firm's principal, told CNN that Geopols had not worked for VEB since May 2020, but the firm was still registered with the federal government as representing the bank until Tuesday, according to a federal filing. The decision to terminate the registration was made before Biden's sanctions announcement, Fenstermaker said. Other Russian firms that lost DC lobbying contracts included the companies behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which had been set to carry 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from Russia to Europe before it was blocked by the German government this week. Lobbying firms Roberti Global and BGR Government Affairs both said this week that they would stop representing Nord Stream 2 AG, the pipeline's Swiss parent company, which is owned by Russian gas giant Gazprom and was sanctioned by Biden on Wednesday. The lobbying firms' exit was first reported by Politico.  Nord Stream 2 AG has paid Roberti Global more than $9 million for lobbying since 2017, according to Senate lobbying disclosures -- making it one of the largest lobbying contracts in recent years, according to Politico. It paid BGR an additional $2 million over the last two years, including $420,000 so far in 2022 before the contract was terminated on Wednesday. A spokesperson for Nord Stream 2 AG did not respond to a request for comment.Roberti Global's lobbying work included \"potential financial sanctions affecting the project,\" the disclosures said. The firm's chairman, Vin Roberti, is a former Connecticut state representative and a major Democratic fundraiser. McLarty Inbound, another lobbying firm, also ended its representation Wednesday of five companies that had invested in Nord Stream. The firm had received $3.5 million from the investors since taking them on as clients in 2017, and the lobbyists working for them included Richard Burt, a former US ambassador to Germany and chief negotiator in US-Soviet arms control talks. Spokespeople for Roberti Global, BGR and McLarty confirmed the contracts had been terminated but declined or did not respond to interview requests. How the Russian invasion of Ukraine is impacting global aviation The Nord Stream lobbying effort appeared to have scored some victories, said Freeman, the foreign influence expert -- at least until this week. Biden decided not to impose sanctions on the pipeline company last year, and in January, Democrats in Congress defeated an effort led by Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to mandate sanctions. The pipeline was set to begin delivering gas later this year. But after Russia ordered troops into Ukraine, Biden reversed course and imposed sanctions on Nord Stream, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government would halt certification of the pipeline.\"What this shows is regardless of how successful a lobbying campaign may be, a foreign power can completely undo any wins with their foreign policy blunders,\" Freeman said. \"Putin's decision to invade Ukraine has completely undone the work of all of these influence campaigns.\"",

Jon Ossoff of Georgia introduced a bill this week with fellow Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona called the Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act, which would require lawmakers, their spouses and dependent children to place their stock portfolios into blind trusts. If passed, the legislation would not allow lawmakers to use inside information to trade stocks and make money. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a very similar bill Wednesday called the Banning Insider Trading in Congress Act, which would also ban lawmakers from trading stocks while in office.  There are some key differences between the two proposals: Ossoff's legislation would apply the ban to any dependent children in addition to the spouses, while Hawley's bill would not. Also, Ossoff's legislation would have the congressional Ethics Committee oversee the issue, while Hawley's bill would have the Government Accountability Office audit. And probably the biggest difference: Ossoff's legislation would fine the lawmakers from their salaries if they broke the law, while Hawley's would require lawmakers in the wrong to return their profits to the American people through the Treasury Department.

Chip Roy of Texas, that would require lawmakers to put their assets into qualified blind trusts when they enter office.The bills from the senators come after an investigation by Business Insider found that 52 members of Congress had violated the federal STOCK Act which is meant to stop insider trading by government officials.The issue of lawmakers trading stocks has gained traction on Capitol Hill in recent weeks and has widespread bipartisan support but is unlikely to get a vote in the House while Nancy Pelosi is the House speaker because of her opposition to the legislation.Pelosi said during a news conference last month she doesn't think members or members' spouses should be banned from trading in individual stocks while serving in Congress.\"No,\" the California Democrat said when asked about a ban. \"We have a responsibility to report on the stock. But I'm not familiar with that five-month review. But if the people aren't reporting, they should be.\"When pressed why members shouldn't be halted from trades while they serve in Congress, Pelosi dismissed the need for a ban, saying, \"This is a free market and people -- we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that.\"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the proposals.",

John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, announced Saturday he is running for re-election in 2022.\"I've always promised that I would do the work, even when it was hard, uncomfortable, or unpopular. That work continues, which is why after careful consideration and prayer, and with the support of my family, I'm asking South Dakotans for the opportunity to continue serving them in the U.S Senate,\" he said in a statement. The 61-year-old is currently serving his third term as a senator from South Dakota and is widely seen as the likely successor to the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history, Mitch McConnell.He's been at odds with former President Donald Trump before, most recently when Trump encouraged current South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run against Thune in the election. Thune had been one of the top Republicans to speak in favor of accepting the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election, drawing Trump's ire.He said for weeks he was waiting to make his decision as he had been struggling with whether to seek another six-year term.Read MoreAhead of the crucial 2022 midterms, there have been a few high-profile, long-serving establishment Republicans who have announced they won't seek reelection in 2022 and retire once their term is up. Those Republicans include Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Richard Shelby of Alabama and Richard Burr of North Carolina.Still, Republicans have not been been hit as hard with retirements in the House as Democrats, putting the GOP in a good position to defend their seats while picking up other congressional seats. Thune, a former House lawmaker and DC lobbyist, was first elected to the Senate in November 2004, defeating then-Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat.  He ran unopposed in November 2010 and won his third term in the Senate in 2016. Thune has held the role of Senate Republican whip since 2019.This story has been updated.",

The Democrat also said he wants the former vice president to voluntarily speak to the committee about conversations he was privy to in the days leading up to the insurrection and what he witnessed on that day.Various Pence aides have started engaging with the panel, including his former chief of staff Marc Short.

The former President is attempting to hide behind executive privilege claims ... but we will not let the former President hide behind these phony claims of privilege and we will get to the bottom of things like that video, the outtakes that video, and everything else that was going on that day, both his action and his refusal to take action.\"She said she agreed with Chairman Thompson's statement that the United States came \"critically close\" to the end of democracy.\"The threat continues. Former President Trump continues to make the same claims that he knows caused violence on January 6, and it's very important, if you look at what's happening today in my party, in the Republican Party, rather than reject what happened on the 6th, reject the lies about the election and make clear that a president who engaged in those activities can never be president again, unfortunately, too many in my own party are embracing that former President or are looking the other way or minimizing the danger,\" she said. \"That's how democracies die.

        "content": "(CNN)The Senate parliamentarian on Thursday rejected Democrats' third attempt to include immigration in President Joe Biden's economic bill, delivering a major blow to Democrats who have repeatedly sought to include immigration provisions in the Build Back Better bill. It's the latest hit to the Biden administration's immigration agenda and likely marks the end of the road for providing protections to millions of undocumented immigrants through the budget process known as reconciliation, which would not require GOP votes.Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough advises the chamber on how its rules, protocols and precedents should be applied as Democrats and the White House figure out what they can include in the massive spending bill.In her ruling, MacDonough wrote the third argument for immigration provisions in the economic bill \"is not much different in its effect than the previous proposals we have considered.\"\"These are substantial policy changes with lasting effects just like those we previously considered and outweigh the budgetary impact,\" she added.Read MoreDemocratic aides had pushed for the third attempt, dubbed \"Plan C,\" before MacDonough and her staff weeks ago after she struck down two other attempts to include more extensive immigration provisions in the bill.A White House spokesperson called the decision \"disappointing\" Thursday evening, saying it \"relegates millions to an uncertain and frightening future.\"\"The President, this Administration, and our partners on the Hill vehemently disagree with this decision and will keep fighting to give relief and protection to the many Dreamers, (Temporary Protected Status) holders, farm workers, and essential workers who are living in fear,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.The group of senators who worked on the arguments to the parliamentarian said in a statement Thursday they \"strongly disagree with the Senate parliamentarian's interpretation of our immigration proposal, and we will pursue every means to achieve a path to citizenship in the Build Back Better Act.\"The senators who issued the joint statement, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Majority Whip Dick Durbin and Sens. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California, added: \"The American people understand that fixing our broken immigration system is a moral and economic imperative, and we stand with the millions of immigrant families across the country who deserve better and for whom we will not stop fighting.\"The provisions Democrats had argued for were the same ones included in the House-passed version of the economic bill, which would provide temporary protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants who entered the US prior to January 2011 and meet a certain set of criteria. About 6.5 million people would qualify, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.The proposed immigration provisions fell short of what Democrats had hoped for -- a pathway to citizenship -- but would still have provided some reprieve to millions of immigrants.Durbin told reporters immediately after news of the decision came out that he was \"disappointed\" the Senate parliamentarian's ruling. \"We're considering what options remain,\" the Illinois Democrat said, but added he doesn't think there's a \"Plan D\" for Democrats right now. Democrats had seized on reconciliation to pass the immigration provisions because it would have allowed them to do so without Republican votes. Despite multiple attempts to pass immigration overhauls in recent years, efforts have fallen short.Democratic lawmakers and immigrant advocates have been bracing for the ruling, waiting to see whether the parliamentarian would reject it as a whole or certain aspects of it, leaving room for additional modifications.Reconciliation, however, has a strict set of rules, and provisions have to undergo a review of whether they have an impact on the budget and not just an \"incidental\" one.Kerri Talbot, deputy executive director at the Immigration Hub, previously told reporters that another \"Byrd bath\" is expected in the event that adjustments have to be made to the Democrats' immigration plan, stressing that it's a process.Three House Democrats -- Reps. Adriano Espaillat of New York, Chuy Garc\u00eda of Illinois and Lou Correa of California, who have previously said they would not support the economic bill unless immigration is in it -- said in a statement Thursday evening, \"We've said it before, and we will say it again: at this point, the Senate can -- and must -- reinstate a pathway to citizenship in the Build Back Better Act, even if that means disregarding the Senate Parliamentarian and bringing that vote to the Senate floor.\"This story has been updated with additional information Thursday.",

        "content": "(CNN)Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is introducing legislation on Wednesday that would require the safe storage of firearms in the wake of the Oxford school shooting in her district that left four students dead last month.Slotkin's legislation, called the \"Safe Guns, Safe Kids Act,\" would require gun owners to secure firearms away from a child if there's potential access to them and would impose a penalty of up to five years of prison time for parents if a child injures themselves or others or uses the firearm in the commission of a crime.It's just the latest effort from Democratic lawmakers to try to enact gun safety legislation that has been repeatedly blocked by Republicans in Congress. CNN has previously reported that prosecutors have alleged the Oxford shooter's father bought the gun, and that the parents gave the weapon to their son as an early Christmas present. The parents, who each face four counts of involuntary manslaughter, are accused of giving their son unfettered access to the gun he's accused of using.\"What really stood out in Oxford was the role that the parents played,\" Slotkin, who is a moderate Democrat from a swing district, told CNN. \"We came up with this bill, building on good work that others have done -- both in the state of Michigan and also federally -- and created a bill that would make it against the law for a person to keep an unsecured firearm if it's reasonable the child could access that firearm.\"Read MoreThe introduction of the legislation comes the day after the nine-year anniversary of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In a video shared Tuesday, President Joe Biden called on the Senate to pass three bills -- one on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention.Earlier this year, Biden unveiled a set of executive actions aimed at taking certain guns out of the hands of criminals and pouring resources into community violence prevention. The actions included expanding background checks for certain types of guns, regulating stabilizing braces built for pistols, restricting weapons known as \"ghost guns,\" which can be built using parts and instructions purchased online, making new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities and creating model \"red flag\" legislation for states to pass.But the limited scope of the President's actions underscores the challenge he faces in getting legislation passed on guns in an evenly split and starkly divided Senate.While Slotkin's bill could pass the Democrat-controlled House if it's put to a vote, it faces an uncertain fate in the Senate where Democrats would need at least 10 Republicans to break a filibuster to advance the legislation.Slotkin, who served three tours in Iraq alongside the US military as a CIA analyst, said she recognizes that she has an uphill battle ahead to get Republicans to sign onto her bill but hopes they will recognize the need for such a measure in the wake of the school shooting.\"I'm still hopeful,\" she said. \"I think it just reflects the fact that gun safety issues, unfortunately, have become these really political conversations. I'm trying to defy that.\"Betsy Klein and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Windy Fire in California is wreaking havoc on sequoia trees in Sequoia National Forest this week. Experts say fire has killed at least 29 of the giant trees, which can live for thousands of years.That toll is only an early assessment. Garrett Dickman, a wildfire botanist with Yosemite National Park, has been tasked with preparing the trees as the wildfire encroaches on sequoia groves, then working to cool the trees after the fire burns through. Part of his job is assessing the trees to see how they fared after the flames move away.A dead sequoia tree in Long Meadow Grove in Sequoia National Forest.While the assessment is just beginning, there's already grave concern. The center of Long Meadow Grove managed well, thanks to work crews did in preparation for the fire, but moving away from that area, Dickman counted 29 sequoias that were \"just incinerated\" by the blaze.\"There were four of those that had burned so hot that they'd fallen over,\" Dickman said, adding one tree burned so badly that it was nearly reduced to just an outline of a tree on the ground. Read More\"The majority of the grove is going to survive,\" Dickman said, \"but there are portions that burned so hot and those trees won't make it.\"Elsewhere in the forest, Dickman has seen even more devastation. In Starvation Creek Grove, which he says has no modern fire history, he said he saw only \"a couple of trees survived.\"\"It was one of the groves where we got a few hours of prep work and those trees that we did the emergency prep work around, from the picture, they are the ones that did survive and all the rest of them -- it doesn't look promising,\" Dickman said, adding that he plans to assess the grove in the next few days.Firefighters battle the Windy Fire as it burns in the Trail of 100 Giants grove of Sequoia National Forest on September 19.Only found in California's the Sierra Nevada, giant sequoia trees are capable of living for more than 3,000 years and soaring to more than 200 feet high. But 10% to 14% of the world's giant sequoias were lost in the 2020 Castle Fire alone.As wildfires continue to burn longer and hotter amid unrelenting drought, there's concern that this year's fires could do far more devastation. The drought has made trees and brush dry and brittle -- easy for wildfires to burn through.\"Those fuels are on the ground and the fuel is dry,\" Dickman explained. \"You can buy a two-by-four from Home Depot and it has more water in it than the trees there on the ground. When they burn, it's 100% consumption.\"Dead sequoia trees in Longmeadow Grove in Sequoia National Forest.As the assessment of the trees continue, so does the fire fight. The US Forest Service is putting together a task force to go into the sequoia groves and scrape around the base of the trees, and to put out fire still burning in some of the trees' root systems. For example, a couple of smokejumpers, specially trained wildland firefighters, are scaling the iconic Bench Tree in the Trail of 100 Giants to attack a fire in the canopy of a nearby tree.\"They're going to climb that tree ... with a hose and squirt over to the other tree and try to put that thing out,\" said Nathan Judy, public affairs officer for the US Forest Service.As for the potential loss of sequoias, Dickman says he's not sure yet whether this fire season will end up being as devastating as last year was for the giant trees.\"After the Castle Fire, I think we have to brace ourselves for something that could be much worse,\" Dickman said, noting that some of the groves will experience new growth. \"There's a difference between a 2,000-year-old tree and one that's 15 years old -- like one's a landscaping plant and one is just like a spiritual experience.\"",

The idea has existed for just about as long as the Academy, which was founded in 1927. But it wouldn't be until 2012 when the museum began to take shape. Nearly a decade later, the opening was delayed by the pandemic. But the Academy Museum is now poised to offer its immersive love letter to the craft of filmmaking.\"We are the only institution that is devoted to talking about exploring the arts and sciences of moviemaking,\" said Bill Kramer, director and president of the Academy Museum. \"We will rotate different stories through our core exhibition stories of cinema.\"A combination of old and new, the museum inhabits an expanded footprint of the former May Company department store at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. Now known as the Saban Building, it is home to the bulk of the collections and the 288-seat Ted Mann Theater. The brand-new facility is capped by a 26-million-pound, concrete and glass sphere that spans 45,000 square feet and includes the 1,000-seat Geffen Theater.

Italian architect Renzo Piano, who designed the museum and is also the mind behind The Shard in London and New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, called the new facility \"the most improbable love story ... between the beautiful, nice, loving old lady -- the May Company building -- and a soap bubble.\"Noting how he played with light in the museum's design as an ode to cinema, Piano also claimed that architects are jealous of filmmakers.\"Everything is in a movie. Everything. It's a story, action, light and shadow and music, photography -- everything is there. Light and shadow,\" he said. \"Light and shadow is actually the essence of this project, of this building. It is common in cinema.\"The exhibitsE.T. from the 1982 film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\"Visitors can travel many avenues of cinema production from screenwriting, casting and costuming to sound mixing, animation and technological advancements.

In fact, there's a whole room devoted to Academy statuettes, including the one Sidney Poitier won for best actor for 1963's \"Lilies of the Field,\" representing the first time a Black actor won in the category.Not all movie history is goldenThe museum has a display of Oscar statues and offers visitors a virtual opportunity to experience what it might feel like to walk across the stage at the Academy Awards.Not all that history fairs well with the passing of time, but the museum's curators say they will not shy away from tough topics.\"This is a place to learn about film history,\" said Kramer, noting how uncomfortable topics must be explored in the museum. \"A lot of our past is not great -- a lot of racism and oppression and sexism. So, while we're celebrating the movies and the artistry and the artists of moviemaking, we also want people to find a safe space to have more complicated conversations and create our new future together.\"Experts in their crafts are heard in their own voices, explaining production decisions from well-known films. A collection of actors' screen tests are shown, followed by the same scene from the final production.\"Filmmaking is the ultimate collaborative art form,\" said Kramer. \"We want students ... film lovers to see themselves reflected back to them in the museum and we want people to be inspired about careers in moviemaking.\"For some of that inspiration and what is sure to be a big attraction at the museum, the Oscars Experience allows visitors to see what it might be like to walk across stage at the Dolby Theater and accept an Academy Award.After all, great Hollywood stories always begin with a dream.",

        "content": "Sierra Nevada Mountains, California (CNN)Almost everything about a sequoia tree is giant: It can grow to more than 200 feet tall and live longer than 3,000 years. Yet the sequoia's footprint is shrinking, as human-induced climate change threatens this ancient tree's survival.Sequoias were once found across the Northern Hemisphere, but today, they only naturally grow across the western slopes of the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California.So when the Castle Fire broke out in August 2020, and merged with another fire to tear through more than 174,000 acres over four months, the loss was something even experts didn't think possible -- somewhere between 7,500 to 10,600 mature giant sequoias were destroyed, according to a report by the National Park Service, published in June.That's 10-14% of the entire world's population of mature sequoias -- a big chunk of history up in flames. \"They stood for a couple of thousand years before ancient Rome, before Christ,\" Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks, told CNN. \"I mean, these trees were mature.\"Read MoreA tourist near giant sequoias at Sequoia National Park in California, in 2019.There are only around 48,000 acres of sequoia groves left in the world, and the trees are now facing threats from human-made climate change in several ways.Scientists say that climate change is making wildfires more frequent and intense. Fires in June this year in the Western states would have been \"virtually impossible\" without human-made climate change,  according to an analysis by more than two dozen scientists at the World Weather Attribution project.The Castle Fire last year was started by lightning, but that doesn't mean climate change wasn't to blame -- a severe and extended drought in California had left vegetation extremely dry, turning it all into kindling, allowing fires here to burning hotter and longer. From left, Rebecca Paterson, Superintendent Clay Jordan and Christy Brigham from Sequoia & King Canyons National Parks near monarch giant sequoias. Sam Hodder -- president and chief executive officer of Save the Redwoods League, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting coastal redwoods and giant sequoias -- explained that the threat is compounded by cedar bark beetles, which thrive in drier conditions. \"A giant sequoia that was weakened by drought was then subject to impacts by the bark beetle, which then further weakened the tree and made it more susceptible to mortality from fire,\" he said. Hodder described the Castle Fire as something not witnessed for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. \"This was the first time that the fire got big and hot enough to get into the crowns of multiple giant sequoia and kill them,\" he said. Sequoias have survived many a drought before, and even those that were spared from the Castle Fire are showing clear signs of stress. Christy Brigham, Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks' chief of resource management and science, said the trees were shedding their needles because it's too dry. The trees have recovered from previous droughts, Brigham said, \"but if climate change continues and droughts become more severe, they may not be able to survive.\" she said.To know what these trees have survived, researchers turn to dendrochronology, the science of studying tree rings, which Clay Jordan refers to as the sequoias' \"journals.\" Biologists can look at those rings and work out when it might have been affected by fire or periods of drought. They sometimes shed light on how humans have threatened them.\"We know that, on average, a healthy forest would experience lightning strike fires about every 10 to 20 years and those fires would be low in intensity and would help burn up those excessive fuels -- keep the forest at a thin enough level so that the forest could thrive,\" Jordan said. A raft of suppression measures that authorities have undertaken to reduce forest fires has in some cases made matters worse. Forests naturally need to burn to some degree, just typically at lower intensity than they do now. Those less powerful fires burn off just enough kindling to make forests less susceptible to more intense fires. \"Now those fires burn hot enough that they can get above the thick barks and into the crowns of these giant sequoias, where they are vulnerable,\" Jordan said, noting that fires are now burning at much higher intensities than they historically did.'Burned up toothpicks'When Brigham and her colleagues visited the site of the Castle Fire after it stopped, they discovered a scene of such lifelessness that she described it as a \"moonscape.\"\"There were no seedlings. There were no needles. There were hardly any cones. Everything had been incinerated -- the entire canopies. It was a field of the world's largest burned up toothpicks,\" she said. Two giant sequoia trees stand shoulder to shoulder in the Alder Creek Grove, more than 500 acres purchased by Save the Redwoods League in 2019.  A couple of hours away by car stands Alder Creek Grove -- roughly 540 acres purchased by Save the Redwoods League at the end of 2019. On the day CNN visited, the sky was smoky and white, as yet another wildfire burned in the region. Among the charred and misshapen trees, some of the once-commanding giant sequoias had been reduced to short and spindly spires.\"Standing here, we've got at least a dozen dead giant sequoias. These trees were 1,500 to 3,000 years old,\" said Tim Borden, Save the Redwoods League's sequoia restoration and stewardship manager. \"Their tree mortality rate for these trees annually was less than .01% and so in one year, in 2020, for us to see 10 to 14% of the total of giant sequoias alive killed in one year, in one fire? There's nothing to compare that to.\"One giant Sequoia was \"decapitated,\" the upper trunk and branches strewn at its base in a tangled heap at the Alder Creek Grove.But patched between the peaks and valleys in the Sierra Nevada mountains, there are little saplings of hope. Down the ridge near where the monarch sequoias -- which are the older trees -- burned out, in an area where the fire wasn't so intense, a carpet of new life has taken root.That's because after lower-intensity fires, sequoias can open up their cones and start to germinate, Hodder explained. And there is hope, too, that people will value these trees -- and all of the planet's biodiversity -- enough to influence their governments to take bolder action on the climate crisis behind the sequoias' struggles. Tiny sequoia saplings that emerged after the Castle Fire offer hope for the tree's future. During CNN's visit to the Sequoia National Park, schoolchildren and families flocked to up the winding road to see the world's largest tree, by volume. The General Sherman tree is stunning, a glorious monarch sequoia standing more than 275 feet tall and 36 feet wide. It's more than 2,300 years old. Without an urgent response to the climate crisis and an improvement in forest maintenance, this tree, which has lived through the rise and fall of entire civilizations, could be lost in a single fire, like thousands of others in this forest were.\"They're among the most rare, the oldest, the biggest living species in the world,\" Hodder said. \"We don't have a moment to lose in getting these forests ready for our new reality.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's resignation on Sunday was triggered after the military went back on a \"non-interference\" agreement struck in November and relaunched the feared national intelligence agency, according to Sudanese political sources speaking to CNN. A video address from Hamdok posted on the verified YouTube account of the Prime Minister's office Sunday confirmed he had resigned. Hamdok previously stated a key demand of the November 21 deal was independence in his choice of political appointees, as he sought to bring the country back from the brink of chaos following the October 25 military coup.Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok sign the political agreement in Khartoum on November 21, 2021. But the military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, made clear its unhappiness with Hamdok's choice of undersecretaries and general secretaries' appointments at various ministries, according to several senior political sources that CNN spoke to, including a source in Hamdok's office, a member in the National Forces Initiative and a source close to Hamdok himself.The sources spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the current political climate.Read MoreAt least four anti-coup protesters shot dead in Sudan as security forces raid broadcasters  In addition to reports of interfering in Hamdok's political appointments, Sudan's military leadership announced a rebranded relaunch of former dictator Omar al-Bashir's notorious national intelligence service (NISS) on December 30. It is now known as the General Intelligence Service (GIS). Previous CNN investigations have implicated the agency in the deaths of protesters. Its continued influence, sources say, was another \"red line\" for Hamdok, rendering the relationship with the military untenable.\"The restoration of arrest and search authority to the intelligence service and the continuation of repression against the demonstrators was the straw that broke the camel's back in the Burhan-Hamdok agreement,\" a senior source in the civilian leadership told CNN.CNN has reached out to contacts within the Sudanese military for comment but has so far received no response.The European Union and the so-called Troika on Sudan -- the United States, Norway and the United Kingdom -- called on \"all Sudanese leaders to recommit to the country's democratic transition\" following Hamdok's resignation, according to a joint statement on Tuesday.The group said that they would not support the unilateral appointment of a new prime minister \"without the involvement of a broad range of civilian stakeholders.\"\"We look forward to working with a government and a transitional parliament, which enjoy credibility with the Sudanese people and can lead the country to free and fair elections as a priority,\" the statement said, adding: \"This will be necessary to facilitate the European Union and the Troika's provision of economic assistance to Sudan.\"'Freedom and justice'Hamdok's resignation speech came after three protesters were killed by Sudanese security forces during anti-coup demonstrations near the capital Sunday, the civilian-allied Sudanese Central Doctors Committee (SCDC) said.Sunday's protests in Omdurman, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) northwest of Khartoum, were the 14th day of mass demonstrations against military rule since the military coup. At least 57 people have been killed by security forces since, the SCDC reported.In the speech, Hamdok said he was stepping down to make way \"for the daughters or sons\" of the country to complete the transitional period.Pro-democracy demonstrators protest in Khartoum on January 2.Hamdok praised the Sudanese people for their determination in demanding \"freedom and justice\" during the protests, adding that \"you will definitely have a better future with your revolutionary enthusiasm.\"On Monday, Volker Perthes, the United Nations Secretary General's Special Representative for Sudan, told CNN that the UN is willing to \"facilitate a comprehensive and inclusive dialogue\" between Sudanese stakeholders in order to prevent further escalation in the region.Perthes said that various parties -- including the UN -- have been calling out for \"credible investigations on who did the killing\" so that culprits can be brought to court, an action which would serve as an indicator of the government's intention in \"rebuilding the trust they have lost in the people of Sudan.\"When asked if the country's military should be held accountable for their acts of violence against the people of Sudan, Perthes said, \"Leaders should be responsible for what they do.\"'It did not survive'Sudan had been ruled by an uneasy alliance between the military and civilian groups since 2019. But in October, the military effectively took control, dissolving the power-sharing Sovereign Council and transitional government, and temporarily detaining Hamdok, the prime minister.The military has taken over in Sudan. Here's what happenedAl-Burhan reinstated Hamdok in November as part of a deal between the military and civilian leadership.Under the deal agreed to by Hamdok and Al-Burhan, Hamdok would again become leader of the transitional government, which was first established after strongman Bashir was ousted in 2019.In his resignation speech, Hamdok said that his \"acceptance of the task to the post of prime minister in August 2019 was on the basis of a constitutional document and political consensus between the civilian and military components, which I preached as a unique Sudanese model.\"\"But it did not survive with the same degree of commitment and harmony with which it started,\" Hamdok said.

        "content": "Khartoum, Sudan (CNN)The Sudanese government will hand Omar al-Bashir over to the International Criminal Court (ICC) along with other officials wanted over the Darfur conflict, according to a Cabinet of Ministers in a statement to CNN.Bashir, who ruled Sudan for three decades before being deposed in 2019, faces charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur.The conflict in Darfur began around 2003 when several rebel groups took up arms against the government in Khartoum. They had grievances over land and historical marginalization.I was 11 when Omar al-Bashir came to power. Terror is all his people have ever knownIn response, the government's counterinsurgency strategy targeted the opposition groups, but reportedly expanded to target tribes associated with the insurgents. The government-backed Janjaweed militia was also accused of raping women in Darfur, and the government was accused of using chemical weapons against the community. In 2009, the ICC's chief prosecutor first issued an arrest warrant for Bashir on charges of genocide and war crimes related to Darfur. The court issued another arrest warrant in 2010, but in 2014 had to suspend the case because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council. Read MoreOn Wednesday, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said that he is mandated -- as an ICC official and in accordance with his mandate from the UN Security Council -- to conduct independent investigations into what happened in Darfur.Khan said that he seeks the cooperation of anyone who has information about these events and that this \"requires the cooperation and assistance of the Sudanese, whether in Darfur or Khartoum, on all the crimes that have been committed, including mass killings, crimes against humanity and other crimes as everyone's responsibility.\"Hashem Abu Bakr al-Jaali, a member of Bashir's defense team, told CNN on Wednesday that the cabinet's decision to hand over the wanted officials to the ICC \"reveals a conspiracy that has been hatched, and if the extradition step is taken, it will be a disaster for Sudan.\"He added that the Council of Ministers is \"not competent to take such decision, as it is a sovereign decision,\" and that it \"seems that the government is trying to cover its inability by taking such decisions.\"Decades of fear and violenceBashir was the first sitting president to be wanted by the ICC, and the first person to be charged by the ICC for the crime of genocide, according to the court's website.Under his iron grip an entire generation grew up in the shadow of war, where the threat of torture in infamous \"ghost houses\" was never far away, and press freedom nonexistent.He was ousted in a military coup in April 2019 following a lengthy popular uprising, and in December 2019 was sentenced to two years in a correctional facility after being found guilty of corruption and illegitimate possession of foreign currency.

        "content": "(CNN)Food and fuel is running out in the capital of Ethiopia's war-torn northern Tigray region, a CNN producer on the ground in Mekelle reports.A communications blackout in the region, in place since Ethiopian forces withdrew and announced a unilateral ceasefire last week, has made it difficult to determine the situation in Tigray and its capital Mekelle. But on Saturday, CNN was able to reach its producer on the ground who reports a blockade on Tigray by Ethiopian forces has been ongoing since June 25.All air travel into Mekelle has been halted by the federal government and eyewitnesses tell CNN that Amhara militia and Ethiopian government forces are obstructing roads out of the city. There has been a full services blackout there -- power, phone, internet -- for nearly a week, CNN's producer reports. Because of the power outage most homes have no running water. Banks cannot operate as their network is down, so people have no access to their own money, CNN's producer added.A destroyed bridge crossing the Tekeze River is seen in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia Thursday, July 1.UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said in a statement on Friday the World Food Programme (WFP) had been able to resume some of its operations in Tigray after fighting halted the emergency response.Read More\"However, serious challenges are threatening the entire humanitarian response in the region,\" he said. \"Electricity and telecommunications remain cut off and banking services are still not available. While road access from and to Tigray for humanitarian supplies remains blocked, staff movement from Mekelle to Afar was possible yesterday [Thursday],\" Dujarric said.   \"Meanwhile, five UNICEF trucks with water, sanitation, hygiene, health and nutrition supplies are waiting to enter Tigray pending approval from federal authorities. There are still no flights in and out of the region though the Government of Ethiopia has today announced the possibility of UNHAS flights resuming this weekend,\" he added. With the destruction of the Tekeze Bridge on Thursday, and the months-long destruction of farms and agricultural implements that prevent farmers from planting, by Ethiopian, Eritrean and Amhara militia forces -- as attested to by the UN and other aid agencies -- there are real worries that food will start to run out. Ethiopian porters unload food aid bound for victims of war after a checkpoint leading to Tigray in Mai Tsebri town, Ethiopia June 26. \"The destruction and vandalization of vital infrastructure are seriously threatening the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need and access of civilians to essential services, goods and livelihoods. All parties to the conflict must protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in compliance with international humanitarian law,\" the UN spokesman urged following the destruction of the Tekeze bridge.Risk of hunger There are extensive fuel lines at the few gas stations across the city that are still open but most stations have already closed, CNN's producer on the ground added.\"It is urgent to get additional staff and supplies into Tigray, restore electricity, telecoms, and ensure the availability of cash and fuel for the continuity of humanitarian operations,\" a UN OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) spokesperson in Tigray told CNN on Saturday.   In a statement ahead of the UN Security Council's first open meeting on Tigray on Friday, Oxfam said: \"There are now more than 350,000 people in a hunger catastrophe in Ethiopia, and this is a crucial time for farmers to plant crops. If they aren't safe to do so, it will continue the cycle of hunger and have deadly consequences for months to come.\"New video of Ethiopia massacre shows soldiers passing phone around to document their executions of unarmed menAt the UN Security Council meeting on Friday, United States ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said: \"Humanitarian workers are reporting that it is more difficult to reach desperate people in Tigray now than it was just a week ago. Such acts, if verified, are not an indication of a humanitarian ceasefire, but of a siege. The Ethiopian government can and should prove this analysis wrong by providing unhindered movement of humanitarian supplies, commodities, and personnel into, and throughout Tigray. If they do not we believe hundreds of thousands of people could starve to death.\"Thomas-Greenfield said \"a meaningful ceasefire deal would affirm the redeployment of forces and the complete withdrawal of Eritrean troops, and Amhara regional forces, it would facilitate unhindered humanitarian access. It would affirm neither the internal nor external borders of Ethiopia will be changed by force, and in contravention of the Constitution, and it should lay the groundwork for discussions toward political solutions to the crisis.\"A UN Humanitarian official, Ramesh Rajasingham, told the Security Council: \"WFP has enough food for only 1 million people for the next month in Mekelle. This is a fraction of what we need for the 5.2 million people who need food aid. However, we have also almost run out of health, water, sanitation and other non-food items kits. Food alone does not avert a famine. Water, sanitation and nutrition supplies are essential in such a response. We also desperately need to prevent a cholera outbreak or people dying from other communicable diseases.\"The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a Friday statement that the international community should urge Tigrayan forces to abide by the unilateral ceasefire, adding that Ethiopia cannot afford to guarantee the protection of humanitarian operators in Tigray \"unless the terrorist element in the region is forced to accept the ceasefire.\" Meanwhile, Ethiopia's Ambassador to the UN, Taye Atske Selassie, told the Security Council \"the decision to cease military operation is hoped to create a conducive environment for humanitarian operations in Tigray and also pave the way for an inclusive national dialogue.\"Additional reporting by CNN's producer on the ground in Mekelle, Ethiopia, whom we are not naming for their safety.

        "content": "(CNN)In a stunning about-turn in the devastating eight-month civil war in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, the Ethiopian government declared an immediate and unilateral ceasefire after Tigrayan troops retook the regional capital Mekelle on Monday evening.Tigrayan forces on Tuesday had not accepted the truce.The Ethiopian military has been in control of much of Tigray since last November, when it launched a major assault on the region with the support of Eritrean soldiers and local ethnic militias in an effort to remove the region's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from power. The armed wing of the TPLF, known as the Tigray Defense Forces, had steadily been gearing up for the offensive and in recent days kicked off a coordinated push to recapture Mekelle.The Tigrayan counterattack was a big blow for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who had declared victory in late November last year when Ethiopia's military overran the city of a half-million people.Since then, the ongoing conflict has killed thousands, forced millions to flee, fueled famine and severely damaged the international reputation of Ethiopia's Nobel Peace Prize-winning leader.Airstrike kills up to 30 people at market in war-torn Ethiopian region of TigrayRead MoreLess than a week into the offensive by Tigrayan forces, the Ethiopian military had withdrawn from the capital, a UN official told CNN on Monday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal from the Ethiopian government. The news was greeted with cheers in Mekelle, and CNN journalists spoke with residents who witnessed as people poured onto the streets in celebration, despite calls for them to stay indoors. Fireworks could also be heard as celebrations carried on into the night.A spokesman for the regional government of Tigray, Getachew Reda, said Monday that its forces had \"broken the backbone of the Ethiopian army\" after fighting nine divisions to take the capital. He said he would celebrate regaining the city with friends this evening, but that the conflict was far from over. \"People are celebrating, the capital has been liberated from our enemies, but as far as I am concerned there is little to celebrate because we still have fighting to do,\" Reda told CNN over the phone.\"Our objectives are degrading the enemy's fighting capabilities. This is a criminal army and we will follow it everywhere to make sure it doesn't have the capacity to come back.\"\"We will not stop until Tigray has been cleared of any and all enemy forces. We will do whatever it takes,\" he concluded. CNN reached out to the Ethiopian Government for comment but has yet to hear back. However, the government said Monday in a statement carried by state broadcaster EBC that it had accepted a ceasefire request by the Tigray Interim Government, which is loyal to the executive in Addis Ababa. According to the statement, the unilateral ceasefire will last across the region until the end of the crucial planting season in Tigray, which ends at the end of September. For seven months, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, with the help of neighbouring Eritrea, has been locked in conflict with the region's elected leadership -- the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).Last week, at least 30 people died when a government airstrike hit a busy marketplace in the small town of Togoga, west of Mekelle, eyewitnesses and medics told CNN. That airstrike marked one of the deadliest attacks in the eight-month war that has fueled famine, forced millions to flee and severely damaged the reputation of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Abiy.Ethiopian army units patrolling the streets of Mekelle back in March.Allegations of damage and lootingReda, the regional government spokesperson, also accused the retreating Ethiopian army of looting banks and damaging critical infrastructure on its way out of the Mekelle. \"We decided to prioritize taking control of the capital rather than pursuing the enemy because they were targeting banks, vandalising property,\" he explained.Earlier on Monday, witnesses told CNN that Ethiopian soldiers were seen entering banks, media bureaus and the offices of humanitarian agencies. A UN official also told CNN that the offices of UNICEF and the World Food Program were raided by Ethiopian forces around 4 pm local time. UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore condemned the action \"in the strongest terms.\"\"Members of the Ethiopian National Defense Forces entered our office in Mekele, Tigray, Ethiopia today and dismantled our VSAT equipment,\" she said. \"This act violates UN privileges and immunities and the rules of International Humanitarian Law regarding respect for humanitarian relief objects.\"UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric joined in on the criticism of Ethiopian forces when asked by journalists at the United Nations in New York. New video of Ethiopia massacre shows soldiers passing phone around to document their executions of unarmed men \"We condemn any and all attacks on humanitarian workers and assets and remind again all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law,\" Dujarric told journalists on Monday. \"The safety of our staff is a priority and we are doing everything we can to ensure it.\"\"All parties must ensure the protection of civilians and that all humanitarian assistance, provided by the United Nations, is provided according to humanitarian principles,\" he also said.This story has been corrected to clarify which international organizations were raided by Ethiopian forces on Monday.CNN's Bethlehem \u200bFeleke reported from Nairobi, and Richard Roth and Kristina Sgueglia from New York City.",

The situation is expected to worsen through September, the report also says.USAID distributes supplies to residents in the town of Hawzen, in central Tigray, who hadn't received much-needed aid for two months. A key cause of the desperate food situation in Tigray is conflict, the report found: \"This severe crisis results from the cascading effects of conflict, including population displacements, movement restrictions, limited humanitarian access, loss of harvest and livelihood assets, and dysfunctional or non-existent markets.\"Read MoreLast month CNN exclusively reported that Eritrean troops were coordinating with Ethiopian forces to cut off critical aid routes. A CNN team traveling through Tigray's central zone witnessed Eritrean soldiers, some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms and blocking aid to starving populations.Tigrayans told, 'We'll see if America will save you now,' as hundreds rounded up by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiersUN agencies say they are particularly concerned by the risk of widespread famine in Tigray, if conflict escalates, and humanitarian assistance is significantly hampered. In a tweet following the report's release, Lowcock called for urgent funding and unobstructed access for aid deliveries.On Thursday, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield called on the UN Security council to meet publicly on the Tigray region and demand answers from the Ethiopian government.\"We cannot let Ethiopia starve. We have to act now,\" she said.Fighting between Ethiopian government troops and the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), broke out in November 2020.

        "content": "(CNN)Lethal violence committed by Nigeria's military on the night of October 20, 2020 could be considered a \"massacre,\" a government-appointed panel concluded Monday -- contradicting previous official accounts of the incident. The Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration had been charged with investigating last year's notorious Lekki toll gate shooting in Lagos, when Nigerian security forces opened fire on young people protesting peacefully against alleged police brutality. Its bombshell report -- which took more than a year to produce -- accuses Nigerian Army officers of having \"shot, injured and killed unarmed helpless and defenseless protesters, without provocation or justification, while they were waving the Nigerian Flag and singing the national anthem and the manner of assault and killing could in context be described as a massacre.\" Police fire tear gas in Lagos as protesters honoring victims of Lekki toll gate shooting spill on to streets The panel also found \"the conduct of the Nigerian Army was exacerbated by its refusal to allow ambulances render medical assistance to victims who required such assistance. The Army was also found not to have adhered to its own Rules of Engagement.\"Read More The panel's report underscores and repeatedly references previous reporting by CNN, which used time stamps, video data, and geolocation last year to analyze hours of video filmed by protesters. 'They pointed their guns at us and started shooting' CNN's investigation found the Nigerian army fired live rounds into crowds at Lekki toll gate, killing and wounding several people. Multiple witnesses also told CNN last year that ambulances were prevented from entering the site to help wounded protesters. Police officers arrive at the scene of protest commemorating the one-year anniversary of #EndSARS, a movement against police brutality, at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos, on October 20, 2021.  Despite an abundance of video evidence, the Nigerian government has long denied that protesters were shot. Last month, on the one-year anniversary of the shooting, Nigeria's Minister of Information Alhaji Lai Mohammed described the incident as a  \"phantom massacre\" and continued to dismiss CNN's investigation as fake news. The government and military did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the judicial panel's Monday report, which cites CNN dozens of times.  However, Lagos Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has said the Lagos state government would implement the panel's recommendations, according to local media.\"This will help in proper restitution and compensation for everyone who must have been wronged. I want to assure you, a white paper will be issued. I am going to constitute a committee to review the document between two weeks and bring out a white paper,\" Sanwo-Olu said, according to the International Centre for Investigative Reporting.Around 70 victims of police brutality have been awarded a total of 410 million naira (around $1 million) as compensation, the chairperson of the panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi, was quoted in a statement released by Lagos State government Monday. What happenedAhead of the bloody events at Lekki toll gate last year, demonstrators had been taking part in daily protests across Nigeria for nearly two weeks over widespread claims of kidnapping, harassment and extortion by a police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).  The shooting on October 20 would ultimately quash Nigeria's fledgling youth protest movement, known as #EndSARS. The investigating panel was initially set up in October 2020 by the Lagos state government to look into cases of alleged police brutality -- and the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad -- and later tasked with investigating the toll gate incident.'He died in my arms.' Twelve months on, a mother's agonizing wait to find out why her son died at Lekki toll gate The panel's report furthermore alleges cover-up attempts by police, which it says cleaned up the aftermath of the shooting at Lekki toll gate and failed to preserve the scene for investigators. \"The police officers also tried to cover up their actions by picking up bullets,\" the report says. It also accuses Nigerian authorities of tampering with CCTV footage and removing the bodies of the dead from the scene.The report recommends that all members of the Nigerian Army except for one major general that were deployed to the Lekki toll gate face \"appropriate disciplinary action and be stripped of their status,\" before being dismissed. \"They are not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation,\" it says.It also recommends that the Nigerian army should be \"discouraged\" from intervening in the country's internal security, adding that \"the dark days of military rule is over and more democratic principles and approaches are required to win both the peace and public trust.\"The government, it says, should do \"all it can to bridge the gap of distrust with the youth,\" and calls for a monument to be erected at the Lekki Toll Gate with the names of the victims inscribed.Reaction to the report led to an emotional outpouring on social media platform Twitter late on Monday night in Nigeria. Many young people have told CNN they feel vindicated by the findings.  \"Tears filled my eyes. The truth needs no defense,\" said DJ Switch, who live-streamed some of the events of that night and was later forced to flee the country. Akin Olaoye, who was at the frontline of the protest that night, told CNN, \"The findings of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in its report defining the atrocities at the toll gate as a massacre, is a big win and leads us on a pathway to obtaining justice for many of the innocent victims, survivors and lost souls still lying in unmarked graves.\"  Serah Ibrahim, who took part in the #EndSARS protests and also gave evidence at the panel inquiry, told CNN justice and accountability now need to follow. \"I hope all the recommendations are carried out. On one part is admitting it happened, on another part is accountability,\" she said. \"Justice is totally incomplete without accountability,\" Ibrahim added.Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report",

They're refugees fleeing conflict or economic migrants in search of better opportunities in Europe.Most have sold everything they own to finance the journey through Libya to the coast and the gateway to the Mediterranean.But a recent clampdown by the Libyan coastguard means fewer boats are making it out to sea, leaving the smugglers with a backlog of would-be passengers on their hands.So the smugglers become masters, the migrants and refugees become slaves.Watch full documentary: Libya's migrant slave tradeMigrants rescued from the Mediterranean arrive at a naval base in Tripoli in October.The evidence filmed by CNN has now been handed over to the Libyan authorities, who have promised to launch an investigation.First Lieutenant Naser Hazam of the government's Anti-Illegal Immigration Agency in Tripoli told CNN that although he had not witnessed a slave auction, he acknowledged that organized gangs are operating smuggling rings in the country.\"They fill a boat with 100 people, those people may or may not make it,\" Hazam says. \"(The smuggler) does not care as long as he gets the money, and the migrant may get to Europe or die at sea.\"       \"The situation is dire,\" Mohammed Abdiker, the director of operation and emergencies for the International Organization for Migration, said in a statement after returning from Tripoli in April. \"Some reports are truly horrifying and the latest reports of 'slave markets' for migrants can be added to a long list of outrages.\" The auctions take place in a seemingly normal town in Libya filled with people leading regular lives. Children play in the street; people go to work, talk to friends and cook dinners for their families.But inside the slave auctions it's like we've stepped back in time. The only thing missing is the shackles around the migrants' wrists and ankles.Deportation 'back to square one'Anes Alazabi is a supervisor at a detention center in Tripoli for migrants that are due to be deported. He says he's heard \"a lot of stories\" about the abuse carried out by smugglers.The Treeq Alsika Migrant Detention Center in Tripoli, where some migrants are held by Libyan authorities before they are repatriated. \"I'm suffering for them. What I have seen here daily, believe me, it makes me feel pain for them,\" he says.  \"Every day I can hear a new story from people. You have to listen to all of them. It's their right to deliver their voices.\"One of the detained migrants, a young man named Victory, says he was sold at a slave auction. Tired of the rampant corruption in Nigeria's Edo state, the 21-year-old fled home and spent a year and four months -- and his life savings -- trying to reach Europe. \n\n\n\n\n\nHe made it as far as Libya, where he says he and other would-be migrants were held in grim living conditions, deprived of food, abused and mistreated by their captors.\"If you look at most of the people here, if you check your bodies, you see the marks. They are beaten, mutilated.\"When his funds ran out, Victory was sold as a day laborer by his smugglers, who told him that the profit made from the transactions would serve to reduce his debt. But after weeks of being forced to work, Victory was told the money he'd been bought for wasn't enough. He was returned to his smugglers, only to be re-sold several more times.The smugglers also demanded ransom payments from Victory's family before eventually releasing him.JUST WATCHEDNigerian migrant: 'I was sold'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNigerian migrant: 'I was sold' 03:15\"I spent a million-plus [Nigerian naira, or $2,780],\" he tells CNN from the detention center, where he is waiting to be sent back to Nigeria. \"My mother even went to a couple villages, borrowing money from different couriers to save my life.\"As the route through north Africa becomes increasingly fraught, many migrants have relinquished their dreams of ever reaching European shores.

        "content": "(CNN)A leading advocacy group for Alzheimer's patients has stopped accepting funding from a Southern California drugmaker following a CNN investigation into the company that sparked a government probe. The CNN report on Avanir Pharmaceuticals showed that its drug Nuedexta has not been extensively studied among the elderly and may be unnecessary or even unsafe for them. Nuedexta, which treats a rare laughing and crying disorder known as pseudobulbar affect, or PBA, is not approved to treat dementia patients unless they also suffer from PBA. Yet Avanir's financial success has been heavily reliant on elderly patients in long-term care facilities, where experts say PBA is uncommon. The article identified cases of inappropriate and potentially fraudulent use of the medication, where regulators found that doctors had improperly diagnosed nursing home residents with PBA to justify using Nuedexta to more easily manage patients who are confused, agitated or unruly.       Full investigation: The little red pill being pushed on the elderlyAfter CNN's report, the Los Angeles city attorney announced that it was launching an investigation into Avanir, examining whether the company broke state or federal laws in the sale, marketing or prescribing of Nuedexta.  Read MoreIn the wake of that announcement, the Alzheimer's Association -- one of the leading advocacy groups for people suffering from the disease -- said it would no longer accept funding from Avanir, pending results of the city attorney's investigation. Avanir gave the group nearly $200,000 this fiscal year, which the nonprofit said was .056% of its annual revenue. \"We are committed to people living with the disease, and we encourage vigorous review and oversight of companies and prescribers to ensure best practices are followed for those impacted by Alzheimer's disease,\" the association said in a statement. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nAvanir has supported other nonprofits as well, along with medical and educational events hosted by these groups that support greater awareness and treatment for those who suffer with dementia. Last month in Chicago, for example, Avanir was listed as a sponsor and presenter at an educational event hosted by the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, an organization providing education and support to families and caregivers. The foundation, which said it has received about $60,000 from Avanir over the past two years, declined to say whether it had any concerns about the findings from CNN's report, but it said it stood by the educational programs it offers at its events, noting that Nuedexta is not mentioned in Avanir presentations and that Avanir is one of many financial backers.   The foundation also provided a statement from one its medical advisory board members, Dr. Jeffrey Cummings, who said that the condition Nuedexta is approved to treat -- PBA -- is \"an involuntary behavior that afflicts a certain percentage of those with dementia ...The AFA's Educational Conferences provide caregivers an opportunity to understand and recognize it.\" Cummings, however, has his own financial ties to Avanir: Between 2013 and 2016, he received nearly $50,000 from Avanir, in the form of consulting and royalty or licensing fees, as well as travel and meals, according to government data. Cummings could not be reached for comment about these payments. He also was the lead researcher on Avanir's study of Nuedexta in Alzheimer's patients with agitation, which included 194 subjects and found that those on Nuedexta experienced falls at more than twice the rate as those on a placebo.  City of Los Angeles opens probe into drugmaker following CNN reportIn a statement to CNN, Avanir said it is currently researching ways to help patients with a variety of neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. \"In conducting this research, we also engage regularly with patient advocacy, research, and other health-related nonprofit organizations because they help us learn and better understand patient and caregiver needs. In the pursuit of these efforts, Avanir takes care to comply with the law and regulations of the FDA and other federal and state bodies.\"  Avanir has said PBA, the condition Nuedexta is FDA-approved to treat, is often misunderstood and can affect people with dementia and other neurological disorders.Ian Larkin, a research professor at the management school of the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the marketing tactics used by pharmaceutical companies, said Avanir's ties to nonprofit dementia advocacy groups are \"deeply troubling\" and represent a conflict of interest. But the relationships are particularly concerning, he said, because Nuedexta has not been approved specifically for Alzheimer's or dementia.   \"I'm not surprised Avanir is pursuing these kinds of sponsorships, because we know the legitimacy and conversations [that nonprofits] can bring are valuable to drug manufacturers,\" Larkin said. \"I am surprised that nonprofits are allowing these sponsorships in light of the significant ethical issues raised.\" He said companies such as Avanir use respected events and gatherings as a platform for their own product, outside of its strictly regulated marketing and sales efforts.  Sign up to receive updates about this and other CNN investigationsA professor of ethics at Harvard Medical School, Eric Campbell, said that many nonprofits have come to rely on funding from drugmakers, and that ethical lines are crossed all the time in the pharmaceutical industry.  \"Yes, this is a conflict of interest,\" he said. \"There is not a single aspect of medical practice and medical education in the United States in which drug companies don't have extensive financial relationships aimed exclusively at promoting their products. The marketing plan is money and payments which buys influence, attention and ultimately results in increased sales.\"   For Avanir, the push in nursing homes has generated significant revenue -- despite how rare experts tell CNN that PBA is in these facilities. Total sales of Nuedexta reached almost $300 million in 2016, with more than half of all Nuedexta pills going to long-term care facilities since 2012.And much of the money being spent on Nuedexta is coming straight from the federal government, in the form of Medicare Part D prescription drug funding, for people 65 and over and the disabled. In 2015, the most recent year for which data is available, this Medicare program spent $138 million on Nuedexta -- up more than 400% from just three years earlier.  Avanir is linked to the US government in other ways, too, recently sponsoring a summit of top medical experts and researchers, hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services and the nonprofit in charge of fundraising for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the US government's primary medical research agency.The Foundation for the NIH said that Avanir contributed \"a modest amount\" for the summit and was one of a number of financial backers -- none of which were involved in the development of the program. It noted that Avanir was contacted because it is a member of the highly-respected LEAD Coalition (Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease). LEAD declined a request from CNN for comment.  Avanir is also entering the world of academia. Currently, it is helping to launch an Alzheimer's training program at a New Jersey community college. The one-year \"Alzheimer's Journey Coordination Certificate Program\" is slated to start next fall at Camden County College and will train students to assist patients and their families with decisions ranging from housing and transportation to medical treatments. A representative from Avanir's parent company sits on the committee that is shaping the curriculum, led by the Rowan University/Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors.  New Jersey Congressman Donald Norcross, who was an earlier supporter of the training program, said he found the CNN's investigation into Nuedexta \"deeply troubling.\" He said the program will be overseen by the joint board and will not include \"any education around PBA or Nuedexta.\"  \"It's never appropriate to put profits over people, especially when you're dealing with care for the most vulnerable among us,\" he said in a statement. \"I support a full investigation into this matter and will certainly review the results.\" Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken at watchdog@cnn.com.This story has been updated to reflect the precise percentage of revenue the Alzheimer's Association received from Avanir this fiscal year. This amount was previously stated as less than 1%.",

But in a recent investigation, CNN found repeated examples where state regulators discovered doctors had prescribed Nuedexta to dementia patients, purportedly for PBA, when it was actually being used to control unruly behaviors.\u202fThis medication has experienced a massive jump in sales in recent years, propelled by prescriptions to nursing home residents for whom the drug may not be necessary or even safe. After CNN's initial report, the Los Angeles city attorney announced that it was launching a probe into Avanir, examining whether the company broke state or federal laws in the sale, marketing or prescribing of Nuedexta. The city attorney said it will likely examine certain doctors paid by the company as part of this.  They are basically being signed up as a sales force.\nMichael Santoro, Santa Clara University professor\nFormer Avanir employees say that the company's speaker program, where Avanir seeks out physicians and pharmacists to present about the drug to everyone from medical colleagues to nursing home employees and administrators, has been essential to its growing success.\u202f  Between 2013 and 2016, Avanir and its parent company, Otsuka, paid doctors nearly $14 million for Nuedexta-related consulting, promotional speaking and other services, according to government data. Paying doctors for promotional speaking is legal\u202fand is defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it's long been a controversial practice.\u202f\u202f  When asked about the doctors CNN identified as having disciplinary records, Avanir\u202fsaid in a statement that it works with experienced and knowledgeable doctors to \"advance effective treatment options for people suffering from central nervous system disorders,\" a category that includes Alzheimer's disease.The company noted that it complies with all legal requirements when doing this and said it has a system in place to screen the physicians it works with.Avanir Pharmaceuticals, based in Aliso Viejo, California, is the maker of Nuedexta.\"Our medical department has in place a robust physician-verification system, which we continually work to refine, to determine if a physician has been disbarred, accurately represented his or her qualifications, and continues to maintain his or her fitness for practice,\" Avanir said in a statement. \"We also rely on the judgments of medical boards, who have responsibility for determining whether a physician is fit to practice and may maintain a medical license. We stand proudly by our work and are dedicated to the patients we serve.\" At least one of Avanir's speakers is currently under federal government investigation, accused of accepting kickbacks in exchange for prescribing Nuedexta.\u202f According to a letter obtained by CNN, the federal government is investigating Cleveland neurologist Deepak Raheja for fraudulently diagnosing patients with PBA in order to secure Medicare coverage for off-label use and increasing dosages of Nuedexta beyond what is recommended. The letter, circulated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) earlier this year, alerted insurance providers that work with Medicare to the fraud allegations so that they could take \"appropriate measures.\" \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nThe Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed there is an active investigation into Raheja, but declined further comment. Raheja denied that he had received kickbacks or been involved in any kind of Medicare fraud in his 25 years of practice. According to government data, Raheja received nearly $300,000 in payments for speaking about Nuedexta, as well as meals and travel, from the drugmaker between 2013 and 2016.  The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents drugmakers across the country, said companies should strive to work with speakers who meet ethical and professional standards. \"In the rare instance where there is an outlier,\" the group said on its website, \"companies take corrective action.\" City of Los Angeles opens probe into drugmaker following CNN reportAcademics interviewed by CNN who have researched pharmaceutical payments and industry ethics said physicians associated with research institutions -- and even some strict private practices -- are typically barred by their employers from these relationships entirely, and there is a concern that those doctors willing to accept large amounts of money from pharmaceutical companies will tend to be more likely to put financial incentives ahead of patient care.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f  JUST WATCHEDIs your doctor being paid by a drug company?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHIs your doctor being paid by a drug company? 02:18Michael Santoro, a Santa Clara University professor and an expert in pharmaceutical industry ethics, said the use of doctors with these kinds of pasts is problematic, calling it a \"scheme\" used by the company to sell more pills.  \"The doctors who are being paid are obviously not scientific leaders,\" he said. \"They are not practitioner leaders either, it would appear. They are basically being signed up as a sales force. Even those who would advocate a strong view of the propriety of paying thought leaders would not approve of these kinds of payments.\"   Avanir said it \"vehemently oppose(s) any mischaracterization\" of its interactions with physicians and other members of the medical community, explaining that these relationships are ethical and are used as a way to share important information and raise awareness of medical conditions and treatments that could help patients. Drugmaker's ties to nonprofits pose 'conflict of interest'And while many of the medical board issues identified by CNN among Avanir speakers involved the prescribing of powerful opioids and psychotropics, one case centers on the use of Nuedexta.   Oregon physician Robert Tilley had already been banned from providing mental health treatment to inmates when he was summoned to face the state medical board yet again -- this time for his prescribing of Nuedexta, among other concerns regarding his care of four nursing home patients. Our medical department has in place a robust physician-verification system...Avanir PharmaceuticalsThis complaint, filed in 2016 by the Oregon Medical Board, accused Tilley of attempting to prescribe the medication to a 66-year-old nursing home resident when there was no support for a PBA diagnosis.\u202f\u202f  Tilley's attempt to initiate treatment of a patient with Nuedexta when it was not medically needed, the board stated, \"constitutes gross or repeated acts of negligence and subjected patient A to the risk of harm.\" \u202f\u202f  The state's complaint also alleged that Tilley had placed these patients in danger by inappropriately prescribing medications, altering dosages and discontinuing drugs, without explaining the rationale. One of his patients, a 68-year-old man who suffered from schizophrenia and was on dialysis, died after Tilley unnecessarily doubled his methadone and prescribed him an additional opioid, according to the medical board complaint. Another patient, a 62-year-old, wheelchair-bound man with dementia, ended up being treated for an overdose in the emergency room after Tilley prescribed him a powerful cocktail of opioids and other drugs. When the patient returned to the nursing home, Tilley then prescribed the same patient \"excessive dosages\" of methadone, in addition to an opioid and a benzodiazepine, the medical board stated. Despite these allegations involving nursing home patients and Nuedexta use, his active ban from treating prisoners, and at least four separate malpractice lawsuit settlements, government data shows Tilley was being paid by Avanir to speak publicly about Nuedexta.\u202f\u202f  Tilley received $22,125 in speaking payments, travel and meals from Avanir\u202fbetween 2015 and 2016. He was also one of Nuedexta's top Medicare prescribers in 2015, writing hundreds of prescriptions for more than 50 patients (adding up to more than $200,000), according to government data.\u202f\u202f  How much is your doctor getting paid by drug companies?Tilley said he has been unfairly targeted by the state medical board after complaints were filed against him because of personal vendettas. He denied any wrongdoing, and said he would never overprescribe a medication or otherwise harm a patient. \"If I were incompetent, why would they be letting me practice?\" he said, noting that the board actions had not resulted in the revocation of his license. He blamed the death of his patient referenced in the board's complaint on the nursing home, which he said took the resident to other physicians who prescribed narcotics on top of the methadone that Tilley had administered.    He also said he became a speaker for Avanir only after he had already been prescribing Nuedexta and had seen some success with it in his patients. He said that he never broke any laws and that he only prescribed Nuedexta if they suffered from PBA or he thought it could benefit them, noting that it had far fewer side effects than dangerous antipsychotic medications often used to treat these patients. He also said that he carefully monitored for side effects and would discontinue Nuedexta if it didn't seem to be working. He said he generally stopped the medication for about half of the patients he put on the drug.  The 2016 complaint about the prescribing of Nuedexta and other drugs in nursing homes is still pending, meaning there has not yet been a final board action or finding of wrongdoing. He also denied the charges against him regarding his improper treatment of prisoners, though he settled the case. Tilley said he has since retired from practicing medicine altogether and that he gave his most recent and final presentation on Nuedexta earlier this year.   Offenses included the harmful treatment of nursing home residents and \"grossly negligent acts\" involving the inappropriate prescribing of dangerous and addictive drugs.Most of the Nuedexta speakers identified by CNN with medical board actions were reprimanded for their treatment of the elderly, excessive or illegal prescribing practices, or insurance fraud. State prosecutors accused Florida psychiatrist Gregg Friedman of billing the Medicaid program more than $1 million, for example, saying that much of the money was for patient visits that never happened. In 2000, he was charged with felony grand theft and \"organized scheme to defraud,\" in addition to 18 counts of Medicaid fraud. CNN wasn't able to determine the resolution of his criminal case because the records were destroyed under state retention laws. But the state medical board took action, suspending Friedman's license and putting him on probation for five years. He settled the case without admitting guilt.   Friedman, who has traveled around the country at Avanir's\u202fexpense long after he was disciplined by the board, received hundreds of payments from Avanir and Otsuka between 2013 and 2016\u202f--\u202ftotaling nearly $200,000. When reached by CNN reporters by phone, Friedman hung up after being asked about his work with Nuedexta. He did not respond to subsequent requests for comment.  CNN identified other doctors who had clean records when they started speaking for Avanir, but landed in trouble while working for the company. Sign up to receive updates about this and other CNN investigationsNew Jersey psychiatrist Dinesh Patel appeared to have an untarnished record until he came under investigation by the state in March last year, and was found to have inappropriately kept a patient on lithium for more than a decade. But even after being placed on probation by the state medical board for \"gross negligence\" in the treatment of this patient, who ultimately suffered kidney failure, Patel continued to receive thousands of dollars in speaking payments from Avanir and Otsuka. Government data shows a payment was made to him as recently as November 2016 (though it's unclear when that speech was made), and Patel received almost $80,000 from Avanir between 2013 and 2016 -- most of which was for speaking.    As part of Patel's probation with the medical board, he was ordered to complete a comprehensive assessment of his skills, and failed three different exams about psychiatry, ethics and the therapeutic uses and effects of drugs. After that, the medical board demanded in November of 2016 that he stop all prescribing -- limiting him to only verbal psychiatry.\u202f\u202f  Even after completing recommended education and retaking the exams, he failed all three again and proceeded to permanently retire from medical practice (without admission of wrongdoing) and voluntarily retire his New Jersey medical license in July of 2017.\u202f  Patel declined to comment for this story, but he did confirm that he is no longer a practicing psychiatrist. Avanir confirmed that the company no longer has \"contractual\" relationships with Patel, Friedman or Tilley. \nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken at watchdog@cnn.com.\nCNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn and Sergio Hernandez contributed to this report.

        "content": "(CNN)A bill introduced this week takes aim at sexual assault and harassment at sea, seeking to better protect and support students at the US Merchant Marine Academy and others working in the maritime industry. Last month, a CNN investigation found that students still face barriers in reporting sexual assault at the academy, despite repeated pledges of reform, and revealed how rarely alleged assailants are held accountable. The proposed legislation is the latest effort to grapple with shipboard sexual misconduct, which has received renewed attention after a student alleged she was raped by her supervisor during the school's mandatory Sea Year training program. CNN's report highlighted the fear of not being able to graduate, since students are typically required to obtain merchant mariner licenses and are only eligible to do that if they receive a certain number of days at sea \u2014 something that could become impossible if a student is removed from a ship after reporting sexual assault or harassment. Culture of fear at Merchant Marine Academy silences students who say they were sexually harassed and assaultedThe proposed legislation, which is bipartisan and was introduced by members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, would grant the Secretary of Transportation the power to waive this licensing requirement. As a result, students who report sexual assault or harassment during Sea Year \u2014 and any other students who don't feel safe on a ship \u2014 would be able to request an exemption and still have the ability to graduate even if they don't obtain a license. The chair of the committee, Rep. Peter DeFazio, was one of the lawmakers who initially put pressure on the school upon learning of the rape allegation from a current student last year. He said this week he \"believes no student should be forced to either relive their trauma should they fear for their safety returning to sea or be forced to leave the academy because they can't graduate.\"Read MoreThe Maritime Administration, which oversees the academy, did not comment directly on the bill's licensing exemption provision, but a spokesperson previously told CNN that \"fear of being unable to obtain the requisite sea time has been a barrier to reporting,\" and that policies the agency put forth in December stress the school will do whatever it can to help students obtain the required time at sea so they can graduate.As part of that same package of reforms rolled out last year, which the agency announced after temporarily suspending Sea Year, ship operators must also meet a number of requirements in order to carry students during the school's sea training program \u2014 such as prohibiting crew members and cadets from entering each other's rooms and immediately reporting any incidents of sexual misconduct to the school if the ship is carrying an academy student, whether or not the student was involved.\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail us: watchdog@cnn.com.\n\n\nSeveral members of the school community previously told CNN that one of the most promising reforms the agency announced was video monitoring on ships, but it was included as a consideration and not mandated. The new bill would require ships to implement video and audio surveillance that can be relied on in criminal and safety investigations. The proposed legislation also applies to the broader maritime industry and is not only targeted at the academy's Sea Year program. The Maritime Administration said Tuesday that the agency has been working closely with students at the school, as well as government and industry \"stakeholders\" to continue to bring about change. \"We appreciate Congress' continuing support for these efforts and any additional resources they can bring to help ensure that all mariners have a safe and welcoming workplace,\" the spokesperson said. Among other provisions, the new bill would extend the statute of limitations that alleged victims are given to pursue civil actions against assailants and employers, and it would allow the Coast Guard to permanently strip mariner credentials from those who have been convicted of sexual assault.\"With this legislation, we can help fight assault and harassment in maritime transportation through penalties for perpetrators, new requirements for owners, expanded legal recourse for victims, and a myriad of policies to prevent sexual assault and harassment in the first place,\" DeFazio said.

        "content": "(CNN)On a 1,000-foot cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, the 19-year-old student felt trapped. Trapped by the crew member she said sexually harassed and groped her, and trapped by the academy that sent her there. She still had at least 40 more days at sea. If she left the ship before completing \"Sea Year,\" a mandatory training program at the US Merchant Marine Academy where students are placed on commercial or government ships to gain \"self-reliance,\" she risked derailing her graduation and worried she would be shut out of a career in the shipping industry.  She also knew it would be impossible to stay anonymous if she decided to come forward because she was the only female student on the ship, and returning to campus early would be a dead giveaway. If her predominately male classmates and teachers found out she reported something that could hurt the elite academy's reputation and put the coveted tradition of Sea Year in jeopardy, she thought to herself, she would be blamed -- or not believed -- and the rest of her time on campus would be torturous. On top of all that, she had been drinking when the crew member touched her, and even though it was a single beer, she worried the school could use that to undermine her report and kick her out for violating the academy's strict alcohol policy. The government covers the cost of tuition at the academy, and she feared she could owe hundreds of thousands of dollars if she were expelled or tried to leave. So she stayed silent. Read MoreThe woman, who graduated in 2016 and went on to work in the military, received permission from her supervisors to share her experience with CNN anonymously. She is hoping to become an attorney to represent sexual assault victims in the maritime industry.Located on the north shore of Long Island in Kings Point, New York, the US Merchant Marine Academy is one of the country's five federal service academies. She and others in the school community told reporters that sexual assault and harassment are disturbingly common at the academy, but a culture of fear has silenced victims for years. They spoke out in the wake of an explosive account from a current student who wrote that she was raped at sea in 2019 by her supervisor. As her allegations spread throughout the maritime industry and federal government last fall, lawmakers slammed the academy for failing to keep students safe. Government officials then temporarily suspended Sea Year and rolled out new safety measures for ship operators and the academy. But this is not the first time the academy has promised to better protect students, and government data reveals how rarely alleged assailants have been held accountable both on campus and at sea, despite previous reforms. A CNN review of school policies, meanwhile, shows that victims still face significant barriers to reporting sexual assault and could jeopardize their education and careers by coming forward.Fierce loyaltyFounded during World War II, the prestigious Merchant Marine Academy sits on the north shore of Long Island in Kings Point, New York, directly across the sound from New York City. While less widely known than some of its counterparts such as West Point and the Naval Academy, it is one of the country's five federal service academies and the training ground for future military officers, ship engineers and captains aboard the country's fleet of government and commercial vessels transporting cargo and passengers around the world. Merchant mariners are not part of the military, but they can be called on during wartime or following natural disasters. They delivered millions of tons of cargo to support troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, and assisted in the aftermath of 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy.The academy admitted a record number of female students to the class of 2023. Women were first admitted to the school in 1974, and the number of female students has been increasing over the years, to a record of 74, or just over 26%, in the class of 2023. But the school's own reports and surveys show how difficult it is for female students to speak up when they routinely face misogyny, discrimination and abuse. Even when they do, academy and government data show how rare repercussions are. Only one merchant mariner has had his credential suspended or revoked for sexual misconduct involving an academy student at sea in the past five years, the Coast Guard said. In that case, the crew member was accused of sexually harassing and groping a female deck cadet and his credential was suspended for three months as part of a settlement agreement. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail us: watchdog@cnn.com.\n\n\nOf the 22 official reports of sexual assault received by the academy between the 2017-18 and 2018-19 academic years, the most recent data available, four resulted in investigations at the school level. When alleged assaults occur on commercial ships during Sea Year, the school doesn't have the authority to investigate unless both people involved were students, meaning it is typically up to the shipping company or the Coast Guard to pursue investigations and take any action. Government officials said they are aware of only one criminal prosecution of a sexual assault case involving a student at the academy and it was more than two decades ago. And the official reports of sexual misconduct are just a fraction of the incidents that occur. When permitted to be anonymous in a 2018 survey, less than half of those who said they experienced unwanted sexual contact during the academic year said they officially reported the incidents. \"There is a toxic culture,\" said an academy employee, who requested anonymity to talk freely about student allegations. The employee told CNN that in the last year alone, seven current students said they were sexually harassed during Sea Year. None of them made formal reports. \"They don't want to betray the academy and hurt their careers ... you're almost trapped. You're getting a great education, but there is an air of indentured servitude.\"'They just don't trust anybody'Amid the historic buildings scattered across the 82-acre campus sits an old gray house, right next to the running track and an outdoor gym where students go in large groups to lift weights and socialize. This is where academy officials took Michelle Underwood and told her she would be living when she was hired to head up the school's sexual assault prevention efforts in 2017. The school publicizes that the sexual assault response coordinator \"lives on campus and is available 24/7 should anyone need assistance with reporting a sexual assault.\" But Underwood knew as soon as she carted her luggage into the house that its high visibility would make it likely no student reporting misconduct would seek her out there.\"Sea Year\" is a mandatory training program at the US Merchant Marine Academy where students are placed on commercial or government ships.\"This is like a bad, bad dream,\" Underwood remembers thinking upon seeing the location of her residence. \"I complained and said I really think this is prohibitive, a barrier from coming to talk to me.\"  She started working at the school not long after the infamous \"Sea Year Stand Down\" of 2016. That was the first time the academy suspended the sea training program amid reports of sexual assault and harassment at higher levels than any other federal service academy -- prompting media coverage about the academy's failures and specific sexual misconduct allegations. Before reinstating the program the following year, officials pledged to implement changes reflecting a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault and harassment. Given the increased scrutiny, Underwood assumed the academy would be truly committed to creating a safer place for students, but she said it soon became clear this was not the case.Instead of seeking advice and opinions from outside experts to help the academy improve its policies, she said the school only worried about protecting its reputation -- denying her the resources and staffing she needed and turning down recommendations she made such as auditing ships during Sea Year to make sure students felt safe. The office where she and other victim advocates worked sits in a highly trafficked location in the middle of campus as well. And while students can also either call a 24-hour phone line to make reports or request a meeting in their barracks, Underwood said the prospect of her walking down the hallway and arriving at a victim's door was just as mortifying. As a result, she resorted to finding a dark alley off campus where she would walk at night with the few students who did come to her to talk. \"They just perpetually created roadblocks for creating safe space,\" said Underwood, who resigned in 2019. She filed two complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, one for a hostile workplace and one for retaliation after making the first complaint. Both were substantiated, she said. The academy declined to comment. The accidental advocate An academy graduate and merchant mariner himself, 39-year-old Ryan Melogy never imagined he would become a one-man watchdog for the maritime industry. But that's what happened. From his studio apartment in Los Angeles and even while working on a ship, he has spent the past two years battling the federal government for information about sexual misconduct at sea. As he posted updates, memes and criticism of the academy and the Coast Guard on social media and his blog, he gained a following and began hearing from mariners all around the world. Some blasted him for scaring women away from the industry, while others rallied behind his mission. Ryan Melogy published the explosive account from Midshipman X, who wrote she was raped by her supervisor during Sea Year.Then, one day in early September last year, he received a message from a current student at the US Merchant Marine Academy. The woman wrote, in painstaking detail, how she was repeatedly sexually harassed and eventually raped at sea by her boss in 2019 when she was 19 years old. She described waking up to find blood on her sheets after being pressured to take repeated shots of alcohol the previous night, and said that since returning to campus, she learned of nine other female students at the academy who said they had also been raped during their Sea Year. At the end of her message to Melogy she wrote, \"You can publish this.\"Under the pseudonym \"Midshipman X,\" Melogy posted the woman's account, which would go on to spark the current reckoning inside the academy and industry. Melogy knew firsthand the consequences of reporting sexual assault.Back in 2015, while working as a second mate aboard a container ship, he reported a senior crew member he said sexually harassed and groped him and two cadets from the Merchant Marine Academy. His alleged assailant continued working on the same ship, however, and the shipping company, Maersk, didn't notify the Coast Guard of the complaint as required by law, according to an agency letter reviewed by CNN. A spokesman for Maersk Line, Limited said that while the company was initially fined for failing to notify the Coast Guard of Melogy's complaint, it appealed and said those charges were dismissed. When Melogy discovered, years later, that the crew member he accused of misconduct had been promoted, he said he finally decided to take his allegations to the agency himself. The Coast Guard launched a criminal investigation in 2019, finding evidence corroborating Melogy's allegations, records show. Nonetheless, Melogy said, nothing happened to him and more students were sent to train on a ship where the man worked. The US Maritime Administration, which oversees the academy, did not dispute this claim but said the academy does not assign cadets to vessels where personnel are known to have \"outstanding allegations of sexual misconduct against them\" and that if this changes while students are already on board, they are removed as soon as possible.In an effort to hold the federal government -- and perpetrators -- accountable, Melogy started his blog, Maritime Legal Aid & Advocacy and posted about his own case. Soon, he said other students came to him with new allegations and information about the man Melogy said groped him and others. As the evidence mounted, the Coast Guard filed a complaint against the alleged abuser in 2020, seeking to suspend or revoke his mariner credentials. More than six years after coming forward, Melogy is awaiting the final determination. The Coast Guard did not comment on the case. Much like publishing his own ordeal, Melogy suspected that posting Midshipman X's account would force the academy and the maritime industry to take notice. And it did. Maersk Line, Limited said it was \"unable to make any findings\" in its investigation of Midshipman X's rape allegation.In the days and weeks following the blog post, Maersk, one of the biggest shipping companies in the world, suspended and then fired five crew members, though it said this month it was \"unable to make any findings with respect to the rape allegation\" because certain employees refused to cooperate with the investigation. The Coast Guard launched an investigation into the rape as well, and the academy suspended its landmark training program for the second time -- just weeks before students were set to board ships and embark on their Sea Year voyages.A need for accountability\"When is it going to stop?\" Stephanie Vincent-Sheldon asked herself as she read the headline about Midshipman X. When she graduated more than two decades ago, she tried to put her time at the academy behind her -- leaving New York, changing careers and starting a family. But all these years later, she felt a flood of anger as she pictured this 19-year-old student going through the same backlash and mental anguish that she did.\"It's basically a firing squad,\" said Stephanie Vincent-Sheldon about what it was like to be on campus after reporting a sexual assault. Vincent-Sheldon is the only student at the academy known to have had a sexual assault case criminally prosecuted, and that was back in 1997, when she reported an older male student barged into her room and molested her in her bed. School officials told her to keep what happened quiet, she said, but she ignored this advice and went to local police, and her assailant was eventually found guilty and sentenced to prison. Her remaining time on campus was excruciating because of how isolated and ostracized she was. \"It's basically a firing squad,\" she said. \"How many bullets are you going to take before you disenroll?\" She said she was subjected to intense psychological exams to determine whether she was fit to participate in Sea Year because she had reported she was a victim and was told that if she left the school, she would have to pay around $225,000 for the cost of the years she had already been there. The academy did not comment on her account or legal case. Vincent-Sheldon said the only way to change the school's culture and for perpetrators to actually be punished is for more students to follow in Midshipman-X's footsteps and speak up, despite all the reasons to stay silent.  \"It's a personal sacrifice to come forward,\" she said. \"But would you really want another woman to go through this because you're too afraid?\" 'Critical we get this right'When Midshipman X's account made its way to officials at the Maritime Administration, they knew they needed to act quickly. Under pressure from lawmakers demanding that students be kept off ships until they were safe, the agency halted Sea Year, a decision it told students was \"one of the most difficult we have faced.\"  The Maritime Administration recently rolled out reforms to better protect students and remove barriers to reporting sexual harassment and assault. Then a top-to-bottom review of academy policies began and the agency solicited input from students, employees, ship operators and others in the maritime industry to figure out how to move forward. \"All of us have agonized over this; it's just simply horrific,\" Lucinda Lessley, the acting administrator of the Maritime Administration, said in an interview with CNN. \"That's why it is so critical that we get this right. It's a long-term process and it has to be a culture change and it has to be owned by every single actor in the space.\"In December, almost three months after Midshipman X spoke up, the agency rolled out a series of reforms it hopes will be the first step in this process. Students will be given satellite phones while at sea, for example, and a new alcohol amnesty policy states that victims, bystanders and witnesses won't get in trouble if alcohol or drug use policies were violated at, or near, the time of an alleged assault. Ship operators, meanwhile, must meet a number of requirements before they are allowed to carry students during Sea Year, such as prohibiting crew members and cadets from entering each other's rooms and immediately reporting any incidents of sexual misconduct to the school if the ship is carrying an academy student, whether or not the student was involved.  Given the academy's troubled history and past pledges to change, some in the school community are skeptical the new reforms will make a difference. \"Until they confront their history they're never going to move forward,\" said Ann Sanborn, a captain and lawyer who worked for the academy for 27 years before retiring at the end of 2020. Sanborn said that as an associate professor and assistant dean for three years, she and others voluntarily mentored victims at the school until 2012 when a sexual assault expert was hired by the academy. After that, she continued to be disappointed to see the school's reports each year showing how many students said they had been victimized. Though she said she believes recent leadership has genuinely wanted to better protect students, progress has been painfully slow. The school needs to learn from past attempts and failures and find new approaches, she said. Merchant mariners are not part of the military, but they can be called on during times of war or following natural disasters.Several of the reforms Sanborn and others said sounded the most promising, such as implementing more video monitoring on ships, are considerations, and not mandated at this point. And the requirements only focus on the Sea Year program even though most alleged sexual assaults have occurred on campus. Students also enter the broader industry as soon as they graduate, and Midshipman X wrote in a November blog post that more needs to be done to address the \"toxic culture of unpunished sexual harassment and sexual assault that plagues the U.S. maritime industry.\"Lawmakers proposed legislation last fall aimed at addressing sexual assault both within the industry and specifically at the academy, though its future is uncertain. Underwood, the school's former sexual assault response coordinator, said she was heartened by this bill but that more avenues are still needed for victims to report sexual assault to someone outside the academy given the distrust of school officials. Denise Krepp, a former chief counsel for the Maritime Administration, said the academy has had plenty of chances to change. She said she tried to ring the alarm back in 2011 when she requested an independent investigation into a \"credible report\" of multiple sexual assaults being covered up by the school. Instead of looking into the allegations, she said officials forced her to resign. Denise Krepp worked as a chief counsel for the Maritime Administration, and she is skeptical that the academy's culture will change. \"There's been no accountability,\" she told Congress in 2019. Krepp also pointed to a $1.4 million settlement agreement the agency entered in 2020 with a student who alleged he was sexually assaulted, leading her to question what is stopping more settlements in the future.  The agency didn't comment on the criticism, but Lessley did agree there is more to be done and that barriers preventing students from speaking up still exist. She emphasized that the new plan includes a requirement that the agency continue to evaluate whether additional changes are necessary. When asked about victims who may be concerned they won't be able to graduate or find a job if they report sexual assault or harassment and have to get off a ship early, fail Sea Projects or receive a negative evaluation from a crew, a spokesperson for the Maritime Administration said the agency understands these are issues and will continue to look into them. \"Fear of being unable to obtain the requisite sea time has been a barrier to reporting,\" the spokesperson said, explaining that new policies also stress the school will do whatever it can to help students obtain the required time at sea and finish their projects so they can graduate.In terms of students being required to repay the government or enter active duty if they leave the school after two years, the agency said the maritime administrator has the discretion to waive this in cases of hardship. Lessley, the acting administrator, said it is unacceptable for any students to feel unsafe at the academy or at sea. \"It's not enough for us now to say that we are making a change,\" Lessley added. \"What's critical is that we make the change.\"Do you have an experience or information to share about the US Merchant Marine Academy or the maritime industry?

        "content": "(CNN)The federal government plans to begin sending students at the US Merchant Marine Academy back to sea later this month, resuming a key training program that had been temporarily suspended in the wake of an allegation that a 19-year-old student was raped on a ship.  The program was halted early last month, just weeks before students were set to embark on their voyages, as lawmakers sharply criticized the school for failing to protect students.   As part of the decision announced Wednesday, the Department of Transportation and the Maritime Administration released a long list of new safety standards that the academy (USMMA) and shipping companies must implement, saying they anticipate lifting the suspension on Dec. 22.Read More \"Sea Year,\" when students are typically sent in pairs to work alongside older, predominantly male crew members on commercial vessels, is one of the academy's major draws. It provides students with real world experience before entering the maritime industry \u2014 with many graduates going on to become engineers and leaders at shipping companies. Among the reforms to the program, the academy says it will ensure that students are allowed to use satellite phones and satellite texting devices to receive support while at sea. It also introduced a new amnesty policy it says will protect students reporting sexual assault \u2014 as well as bystanders and witnesses \u2014 from getting in trouble if alcohol or drug use policies were violated at, or near, the time of the alleged assault. Government suspends training at sea program after college student says she and others were raped  Ship operators, meanwhile, must adhere to more than 30 new measures before they are allowed to carry USMMA students. These include designating someone within the company on shore who is specially trained with victim assistance with whom students can communicate regularly and contact about any issues involving sexual assault, and immediately reporting any incidents to the USMMA \u2014 whether or not it involved a student.  This is the second time Sea Year has been suspended in the past five years amid concerns about sexual assault and harassment. The program was previously halted in 2016 and reinstated the following year when the school pledged that new rules and a zero-tolerance policy for sexual assault and harassment would keep cadets safe both on campus and at sea.  'I was trapped': Shipping giant investigates alleged rape of 19-year-old during federal training program But this September, a student published an anonymous account online, saying she was raped by her supervisor, a senior crew member, in 2019 while aboard a Maersk ship during Sea Year. Since returning to campus, she said she learned nine other female students currently enrolled at the academy said they had also been raped during their Sea Year. As her post circulated among the USMMA community and the maritime industry, lawmakers blasted the school, Maersk suspended five crew members, both the company and the federal government began investigating the reported rape and the Transportation Department suspended Sea Year while it reviewed the program and discussed improvements.  The agency said Wednesday it is hopeful the newest requirements will allow Sea Year to resume in a way that helps keep students safe from sexual assault and harassment and better protects victims.  \"The plan is an initial step,\" Acting Maritime Administrator Lucinda Lessley said in the statement. \"All parties are committed to continuing to review this program frequently, and to make improvements whenever needed to ensure the safety and success of USMMA cadets.\"  Do you have an experience or information to share about the US Merchant Marine Academy or the maritime industry?

        "content": "(CNN)A secretive political group has been pulling in millions of dollars in recent months amid a growing \"Blue Lives Matter\" movement, with a cadre of telemarketers urgently telling Americans that now is the time to support the police and keep them safe.The calls, which often target elderly donors, come from a variety of generic and similar-sounding aliases: The Police Officers Support Association, the National Emergency Responders Coalition and the National Coalition for Police & Troopers. Many donors say they believed they were supporting a charity that helps local officers. But none of the money being raised actually goes to police departments, according to government records. Instead, their contributions end up with a super PAC, Law Enforcement for a Safer America, which has ties to a controversial union and spends the majority of its money on its own operating costs. At least seven local police departments from around the country and a state attorney general have issued \"scam alerts\" and other notices about these fundraising efforts, warning residents in their communities as recently as this summer that they have no affiliation with this group. Around 200 consumer complaints have also been made to state and federal regulators about the super PAC, its aliases and related groups. Law Enforcement for a Safer America officials did not return repeated requests for comment. Read MoreCalifornia resident Kellie Van Westen, 69, said she has family members who are law enforcement officers and that she believed the roughly $1,400 she donated since 2019 would help bolster local police budgets and pay for \"equipment to keep them safe.\"She had noticed the term \"PAC\" on receipts she received in the mail but thought that meant the charities were working together and had a \"pact\" to support the police cause she believed in. Claire Reiss, 79, said she thought the more than $2,000 she donated would go to injured police and their families, but that she stopped giving away her money when the calls just wouldn't stop. The super PAC said on Facebook in September that it had placed this billboard in multiple locations throughout Wisconsin and that more would be coming. FEC filings show that of the group's minimal political spending, most has gone toward pro-Trump advertising such as billboards.\"Our officers deserve our respect and support,\" the Super PAC's website reads. \"These are America's heroes.\" Videos on its site show cities in flames and say that officers have been injured during what the group describes as riots -- presumably referring to recent Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.As the list of high-profile police shootings has grown in recent years and calls to \"defund the police\" have gotten louder, tensions between protesters and those who have rushed to the support of police -- some of whom have become part of a Blue Lives Matter movement -- have been building. And Law Enforcement for a Safer America appears to be cashing in. \"Now those same anarchists that rioted and assaulted law enforcement officers are using the Taliban playbook by destroying public statues and monuments while advocating for defunding law enforcement agencies,\" a narrator states in a video from July, as protests continued across the country.The group's videos have received few views, but money has been pouring in. Law Enforcement for a Safer America has raked in nearly $10 million in donations from January 2019 to June 2020, according to data reported to the Federal Election Commission. This was up from roughly $1 million raised by the group, which was founded in June 2018, in the last six months of the prior election cycle. The vast majority of donations since 2019 were under $200, meaning the funds came from tens of thousands of donors. Of those who gave more than $200, which are required to be disclosed to the federal government, roughly 80% were retirees, according to an analysis of the data. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nSuper PACs are able to raise unlimited amounts of money, which they can use to advocate for political candidates or causes. This group purports on various websites that donations are being used to back candidates who will stand up for police and introduce legislation to help officers and provide benefits to families who have lost loved ones in the line of duty. Campaign finance data, however, shows that about 98% of the money spent is not being used for this mission. Up to June 2020, only 2% of the group's spending went toward political activities -- mainly for advertisements supporting President Donald Trump's reelection, according to data filed with the FEC. The rest of the money has gone primarily to the firms helping it solicit donations -- including nearly $3 million in payments to one telemarketing company sued by the government last month for allegedly using deceptive tactics.Warnings from law enforcementMontana Attorney General Tim Fox posted on Facebook last year about a call he received from \"Roy\" on behalf of the National Coalition for Police and Troopers. \"The call was spoofed to appear to be from [a] Montana phone number,\" he wrote, noting that the caller did not identify the group as a political action committee, or super PAC, and telling his followers that it was not a nonprofit so donations are not tax deductible. \"Money donated to this group might be used for political purposes and will not be used for direct help to police or troopers,\" Fox wrote. \"Please do your homework and avoid scams and misleading appeals for your hard-earned money.\" FEC regulations state that political committees can only deposit a contribution into their account if that money came from a solicitation \"which expressly states that the contribution will be used in connection with a Federal election\" or the solicitation discloses that contributions are subject to federal election law. While several recordings uploaded online show that some callers have briefly mentioned the term \"PAC\" or have said that the group is supporting efforts to elect lawmakers to advocate for certain issues, the Montana attorney general wasn't the only person to say the group hadn't identified itself as required. The Greenfield, Massachusetts, police department warned about the group last year as well. \"We warn against them because they come off as supportive of the Greenfield Police Department, or the \"local\" police, and yet they do not do anything for us,\" said police Chief Robert Haigh Jr. \"These tend to be monies for their own agendas, and not based on the locals. I feel they abuse their use of the name to maybe convey a false sense to the community about who they are and what they really do with the money.\"Also in Massachusetts, a Wilmington police officer received a call soliciting donations. \"The Wilmington Police Department has no association with this organization and we have never even heard of them,\" stated a May release from the department. \"We found a website for them, but it gives very little information about the organization and their mission. We highly encourage our followers to verify who they are making donations to when contacted for fundraisers.\"Among the other warnings: The Miami Township Police in Ohio issued a \"scam alert\" in June referencing \"calls circulating from a Police Officers Support Association asking for credit card donations.\" The Reading Police Department in Massachusetts described the Police Officers Support Association as a \"scam 'charity'\" last year. And the Morton Police Department in Illinois posted on Facebook about calls from a mysterious phone number with a local area code last year. It said callers were soliciting support for police officers but that the group was actually connected to a political action committee. \"We do not support nor do we condone this group,\" the post stated. \"We are just passing along the information if you get a suspicious call asking for money for police officers.\"'Very peculiar'Law Enforcement for a Safer America does not disclose on its website who is running the super PAC, but public filings reveal that leaders of one of the country's largest police unions are pulling the strings. Government documents show that the founding treasurer is currently an executive at the International Union of Police Associations. A union receptionist also confirmed to CNN that the super PAC is run by the union, but union leaders did not respond to repeated calls, voicemails and emails that laid out the concerns from other police departments and donors and asked why so little of the $10 million raised went toward political activities.This Florida-based union touts its federal lobbying efforts on behalf of local members. Entire local police unions, which negotiate collective bargaining agreements for their members, can choose to affiliate with the group. Individual officers can also become members, according to its website. The union is run by a retired police detective, and it is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the country's biggest federation of unions, which did not respond to requests for comment. The union has previously come under fire for hiring allegedly deceptive telemarketers and costly fundraising efforts that benefited its own organization and a police charity it operates.An image from Law Enforcement For A Safer America PAC's Facebook page. The union has recently claimed to have more than 100,000 members, but the IUPA has reported around 20,000 members in tax filings. Tax filings also show that the union operates its own call center and that a company the union controls purchased a nearly 20,000 square foot office building valued at more than $2.5 million, where the union is now based.The filings don't show how much the group's officials are directly benefiting from the political committee it created, and it is unclear why the group deemed it necessary to create so many different aliases to use for soliciting donations. They do disclose, however, that of the nearly $10 million raised, the super PAC gave more money back to the union -- roughly $350,000 for \"office, operational and overhead expenses\" -- than the $173,500 it spent on political activities between January 2019 and June 2020. It also transferred $30,000 to another pro-police super PAC that the union operates, based on the officers listed on its filings. \"This all looks very peculiar,\" said Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in campaign finance. He said that although it is more expensive for super PACs to solicit small donations -- which is what this one is doing -- spending so much on operations and so little on political activities is unusual.While there are no requirements dictating the percentage of money that must go toward political activities, campaign finance expert Rob Pyers has dubbed the group a \"Scam PAC\" because of its high operating expenses and negligible political spending. Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor specializing in campaign finance and political corruption, said the fact that the super PAC had spent such a huge proportion of its contributions on its own expenses was \"jaw dropping\" and that it was equally concerning to hear that fundraisers were going after the elderly who they may consider \"easy marks.\" Targeting the elderlyAn employee who said he previously worked for two companies that raised money for Law Enforcement for a Safer America said that at his more recent job, callers were instructed not to disclose that they were calling on behalf of a super PAC. \"The scripts were designed to give the impression that they were helping out officers versus lobbying efforts,\" he said, adding that the political affiliation was only \"fully disclosed\" when someone proactively asked where the money would be going.He said he ultimately left because he didn't feel like he was supporting the charitable efforts he had hoped to -- seeing a shift toward fundraising for PACs instead of charities and observing how little of the money went to the causes callers were touting. It also concerned him that so many \"prospects\" were elderly. \"At times, I thought they were maybe misguided,\" he said. Videos on Law Enforcement for a Safer America's website show cities in flames and say that officers have been injured during what the group describes as riots.The former employee, who asked to remain anonymous because of a nondisclosure agreement, said he remembered fundraising companies outsourcing some of the telemarketing overseas to locations like the Philippines, where they relied on recordings instead of live agents. \"They would have soundboards with prerecorded bits that would play and give the impression they were talking to a live person but in reality it was just someone playing bits off a soundboard,\" he said. Another telemarketing employee reached by CNN in the Philippines confirmed this, saying he solicited money on behalf of the super PAC and the IUPA using audio recordings of someone who sounded like they were actually calling from America, and that most of the people they reached were elderly -- adding he felt it was a scam because they didn't realize what they were actually donating to. Several donors said they never would have given money to the group if they knew it would pay for Trump advertisements, including 70-year-old Susan Durie, a self-described \"bleeding heart liberal Democrat\" from Los Angeles who donated around $600 and said she felt like a victim of a scam since she thinks she was misled into believing that her donation would go to local police. \"Oh, god,\" she said upon being contacted by CNN and learning how the money was spent, \"I'm supposed to be smart, but boy was I a dope.\"In a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, another woman, whose name was redacted, said she received multiple calls from the National Coalition for Police and Troopers, one of the super PAC's various aliases. She said she was told the group was a charity benefiting police and troopers. \"As a wife of a police officer this is absolutely disgusting!\" she stated. Many of the other complaints to the FTC about the political committee and its related groups said fundraisers used spoofed numbers and violated the law by calling them even though they were on the Do Not Call list, while others said they had been misled or even harassed by fundraisers. Gas station secured small business bailout money, then paid for Trump billboardsAfter learning from CNN that his 92-year-old father had given $1,200 to the super PAC, Curt Busse said that the donations were made as his father's cognitive skills declined, making him a prime target for telemarketers. He said his father served in the Navy for nearly two decades and was always proud of his service. As a result, he had a positive outlook on military and all law enforcement officers, Busse said, but he never expressed \"any particular interest in supporting the police through financial donations.\"\"He was donating to anyone who asked him for money,\" he said.Busse said he and his sister took over their father's finances last year. He said his father has always leaned heavily Democratic, supported President Barack Obama and previously expressed strong anti-Trump views. \"He never would have given money to any group if he knew that some of that money was going to pro-Trump campaign ads,\" said Busse.What should we investigate next?

In a letter from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, US Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. and Jan Schakowsky told Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that CNN's recent reporting on AmazonBasics products had revealed \"alarming product safety issues.\"Dozens of Amazon's own products have been reported as dangerous -- melting, exploding or even bursting into flames. Many are still on the market \"Amazon's oversight of its own products has been grossly inadequate,\" the letter from the two Democrats stated. \"Despite starkly worded reviews and even photographs posted by consumers warning of the grave safety dangers experienced while using AmazonBasics products, it appears that Amazon has turned a blind eye to these problems, prioritizing sales at the expense of safety.\" AmazonBasics is one of the retailer's popular private label lines, and CNN's investigation found that dozens of AmazonBasics electronics remained for sale despite customers reporting the products had melted, exploded or burst into flames. At least 1,500 reviews on the Amazon website, covering more than 70 items, described safety risks. Within those reviews, many consumers explicitly called out items as potentially dangerous -- using terms such as \"hazard\" or \"fire\" or saying the product should be recalled. Read MoreAround 30 items with three or more reviews like this remained for sale on Amazon.com.

We are concerned that this practice may make it more difficult for safety regulators to investigate product hazards.\"Amazon did not comment directly on the letter but reiterated that \"safety is a top priority.\" The company said it takes a number of steps to ensure all AmazonBasics products are safe and high quality, such as selecting experienced manufacturers, monitoring customer feedback and testing items to ensure they pass safety and compliance standards both before and after they are available. The retailer also said it thoroughly investigates safety concerns. \"The outcome of the investigation varies on a case by case basis and may include removing the product from the store, adjusting the design of the product, notifying customers to stop using the product, or other appropriate action,\" Amazon said. \"We want customers to shop with confidence and if ever a customer has a concern, they can contact customer service and we will investigate.\" JUST WATCHEDDozens of AmazonBasics product are flagged as dangerous, but many are still being soldReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDozens of AmazonBasics product are flagged as dangerous, but many are still being sold 04:23Pallone and Schakowsky included a list of detailed questions in their letter, asking for answers and additional information by October 21.The lawmakers joined three US senators who expressed similar concerns in a letter to Bezos last month, writing that \"Amazon must immediately stop the sale of dangerous and defective AmazonBasics products, recall them, and effectively and immediately notify consumers of potential risks.\"The only two recalls of AmazonBasics products were in 2018 and 2019.

He was quickly fired from the department where he had worked since 2001, and amid national protests, was eventually charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers involved with the incident were also fired and face felony charges. But Chauvin still stands to benefit from a pension partially funded by taxpayers. While a number of state laws allow for the forfeiture of pensions for those employees convicted of felony crimes related to their work, this is not the case in Minnesota.Derek Chauvin, 44The Minnesota Public Employees Retirement Association confirmed to CNN that 44-year-old Chauvin would remain eligible to file for his pension as early as age 50, though it would not provide details on the specific amount he would receive. Chauvin's attorney declined to comment. Retirement plan officials said that employees terminated voluntarily or for cause are eligible for future benefits unless they choose to forfeit their future benefit and receive a refund of all their contributions made during their employment. \"Neither our Board nor our staff have the discretion to increase, decrease, deny or revoke benefits,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Any changes to current law would need to be done through the legislative process.\"  Read More\n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nWhile a number of factors are used to calculate pension benefits, Chauvin would likely be eligible for annual payments in the ballpark of $50,000 a year or more if he chose to start receiving them at age 55, according to a CNN analysis based on Chauvin's tenure, 2019 payroll data, contract details, pension plan guidance and Minneapolis Police Department salary schedules. The benefits could stretch to $1.5 million or more over a 30-year period, not including any cost of living increases. Chauvin's annual payments could be even higher if he received significant amounts of overtime in prior years.Two of the other officers charged in the death of Floyd were rookies, but a third also appears eligible to receive pension benefits from his time with the department, according to employment records released by the city. The Minneapolis Mayor's Office, Police Department and the local police union did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Public pensions are paid for through a combination of contributions from taxpayer-funded local governments and workers themselves, as well as investment returns. Public safety pensions are typically some of the most generous and have caused local and state budgets to balloon around the country. Related: DOJ all but abandons broad police investigationsBut they are almost impossible to reduce or take away from workers who have been promised them in public employment contracts, and police unions have fought hard to protect worker pensions. Officers also usually pay some of their own salaries into the funds and typically receive their pensions in lieu of Social Security. Amid growing calls across the country to defund police departments and better distribute the money to social services, such as youth and community development and mental health treatment, pensions will likely prove to be a flashpoint in the ongoing debate. Minneapolis demonstrators have called to defund the Minneapolis Police Department. The laws governing whether pensions can be stripped from police accused of misconduct vary depending on the state. Less than half of states have laws that allow for pensions to be taken away from police who were convicted of any kind of felony, while some other states allow pensions to be taken away for specific crimes like corruption or sexual crimes against minors but not for the conviction of an officer for using excessive force, according to 2017 research published in the Journal of Law, Economics and Policy. But even these laws wouldn't touch the many officers accused of police brutality who are never convicted or even charged with a crime. Many were also passed in the past decade and usually wouldn't apply to officers hired before the laws were enacted, researchers noted. \"Pension forfeiture for misconduct is pretty rare,\" said D. Bruce Johnsen, a law professor at George Mason University and one of the authors of the research. \"With this terrible tragedy it might be a good time to push in this direction,\" he added, saying that the specific situations that would allow for forfeiture would have to be carefully defined.

        "content": "(CNN)Retail sales of the anti-malarial drug President Donald Trump has promoted as a potential coronavirus cure \u2014 and claims to be taking himself \u2014 have been soaring. The drug, hydroxychloroquine, has been around for decades but was thrust into the spotlight this spring when Trump began mentioning its name dozens of times during coronavirus briefings. While it had not been approved for this use, and still hasn't, he urged Americans to \"try it.\"Amid the growing public attention on the medication, its sales doubled from March 2019 to more than $50 million in March of this year, according to market research firm IQVIA, which tracks prescriptions dispensed by retail pharmacies including large chains and mail-order companies. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nWhile the FDA recently cautioned against the use of the drug to treat coronavirus patients outside of hospitals, that warning came after more than 830,000 prescriptions for the drug were filled for the generic and name-brand version of the drug, Plaquenil, in March -- up from roughly 460,000 prescriptions written during the same time last year. The IQVIA data did not yet include April figures and did not capture prescriptions administered to patients in nursing homes through long-term care pharmacies or at hospitals. Data from Premier Inc, a health care purchasing company for more than 4,000 hospitals, shows that hospitals saw a 260% surge in hydroxychloroquine orders in March compared to typical demand. Read MoreDrug touted by Trump as Covid-19 treatment linked to a greater risk of death, study findsAs sales have increased, so has scrutiny over the medication's safety and efficacy in treating Covid-19. Currently, the drug is only FDA-approved to treat or prevent malaria or to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. While so-called off label prescribing of the drug to treat other conditions is legal, it has not been found by the federal government to be safe or effective for any other uses. The FDA's warning said the agency was aware of reports of \"serious heart-related adverse events and death in patients with COVID-19\" who were taking hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a more toxic variation, either on their own or in conjunction with other medications that affect the heart such as azithromycin. The agency said in April that the drug should only be used for Covid-19 patients when they can be monitored in the hospital or are enrolled in clinical trials. In a statement this week, the FDA Commissioner said \"the decision to take any drug is ultimately a decision between a patient and their doctor.\"Sales of hydroxychloroquine doubled from March 2019 to more than $50 million in March of this year.A large observational study published Friday found that seriously ill Covid-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were more likely to die or develop dangerous heart arrhythmias, and a study published earlier this month showed the medication did not help treat coronavirus and could cause cardiac arrest. Another study of hundreds of patients at veterans hospitals found higher death rates in those patients who had been given the drug compared to those who had not taken it. The ousted director of the office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine, meanwhile, has claimed in a whistleblower complaint that he was pressured to make hydroxychloroquine widely available and that he was removed from his position after raising concerns about it.HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.

        "content": "(CNN)Almost everything these days has become the victim of partisan polarization. If Democrats like something, then Republicans don't. If Republicans like something, then Democrats don't. Partisanship, though, has taken a back seat when it comes to Americans' views of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Democrats and Republicans largely agree on how they view the invasion and countries and politicians involved, even on issues on which there used to be partisan disagreement.  You can see this well in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. When it comes down to the fundamental argument by Russia that Ukraine should be \"reclaimed by Russia and no longer be a sovereign territory\", neither Democrats nor Republicans buy it. Just 5% of Democrats say this claim is justified. And only 4% of Republicans dpo.   A new CNN poll found a lot of agreement on what America should do. When it comes to increasing economic sanctions on Russia, 85% of Americans who lean Democratic and 83% who lean Republican agree that they should be increased in response to the invasion.Rarely do more than four-fifths of Democrats and Republicans ag\u200b\u200bree on anything. Read MoreOn the broader question of whether we should be doing more to stop Russian military actions, 65% of Americans who lean Democratic say we should as does a simila\u200b\u200br 62% of Americans who lean Republican, according to the CNN poll. That said, Democrats and Republicans don't want to commit to military action in Ukraine to stop Russia. Per the CNN poll, a majority of both Americans who lean Democratic (55%) and lean Republican (58%) are against such an action. The split is the opposite when it comes to troops if Russia decides to invade a NATO country, according to Quinnipiac. In that case, 76% of Democrats say American troops should get involved. For Republicans, it's 69%. Biden is vowing to seize Russian oligarchs' yachts. Here's where they are right now The fact that a large percentage of both Democrats and Republicans want to protect a fellow NATO member is notable because Republicans have tended to be far more skeptical of the alliance than Democrats. Last year, for example, a Pew Research Center poll found that 85% of American who leaned Democratic said America benefited a great deal or fair amount by being part of NATO compared with only 55% of Americans who leaned Republican.A different Pew poll from 2021 found that Americans who leaned Republican were far less likely (44%) to hold a favorable view of NATO than those who leaned Democratic (77%).While Democrats have generally viewed NATO more favorably than Republicans, the gap had gotten larger during former President Donald Trump's administration. Trump had, at times, spoken of removing the US from NATO. Before he entered the White House, there was just a 6-point gap, in 2016, between Americans who leaned Democratic and viewed NATO favorably (57%) and Americans who leaned Republican and felt the same (51%). With Trump's time in office further in the rearview mirror, it's not surprising that Republicans are now fairly willing to defend a NATO member.Democrats and Republicans coming together on NATO is echoed in their feelings about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin's favorable rating, per the Quinnipiac poll, was a low 6% among Republicans and 1% among Democrats. 'Ban it': Bipartisan lawmakers call on Biden administration to end Russian oil importsDuring the Trump administration, there were a number of polls in which Putin rated much higher among Republicans. Trump, of course, had praised the Russian president. In one of those polls, conducted in 2018 by Gallup, 27% of Republicans held a favorable view of Putin, while just 4% of Democrats did. A poll by CNN around the same time showed a smaller partisan gap in Putin's ratings (14% favorable rating among Republicans to 6% among Democrats), though the gap was significant between those who approved of the job Trump was doing as president and those who did not (20% favorable vs. 4% favorable). With Trump out of the White House and Putin authorizing the attack on Ukraine, things seem to be going back to the pre-Trump norm. Indeed, there was no partisan split at all in how many Americans saw Putin favorably, according to a 2014 CNN/ORC poll. The lack of a partisan split matches what we see in feelings toward Russia broadly. In a late February Washington Post-ABC News poll, taken almost entirely before the invasion, 13% of Americans who leaned Republican and 10% of Americans who leaned Democ\u200b\u200bratic said Russia was a close ally or friendly to the United States. In a 2018 CNN poll, those who leaned Republican were far more likely to say that Russia was an ally or friend of the United States (34%) than those who leaned Democratic (13%). And even on the simple question of whether they view Russia favorably, the partisan divides have all but disappeared. In a Gallup poll taken in the first half of February, 12% of Republicans viewed Russia favorably. This was basically the same as the 10% of Democrats who did. Biden administration will extend immigration relief to Ukrainians in the USThis marks a return to bipartisan normal. Dating back to the latter stages of the Cold War (1975) through 2015, Democratic and Republican views on Russia and the former Soviet Union were almost always identical. It was only during the Trump administration when Republicans were about 10 points more likely to see Russia favorably. Of course, there is one big thing that Democrats and Republicans differ on when it comes to Russia: Biden's performance during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Most Democrats (70%) approve of the job the President is doing, per Quinnipiac polling. Most Republicans (11%) do not. In fact, almost every question that mentions Biden and the invasion results in a partisan split. But this quarrel in domestic politics should not take away from the fact that there is, in large part, a bipartisan consensus when it comes to the larger questions revolving around Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.",

        "title": "Why polls may be underestimating Republicans - CNNPolitics",
        "images": [],
        "content": "(CNN)Most polls you're looking at right now are likely underestimating Republicans' position heading into the midterm election cycle. It's not that the polls are \"wrong.\" Rather, it's that most polls at this point are asking all registered voters who they're going to vote for in November, when it's likely only a distinct subset of voters who will cast a ballot. The voters who will actually turn out for the fall election are likely going to be disproportionately Republican based on current polling data and history. Take a gander at our CNN/SSRS poll from last week. It featured a rather close race when all registered voters were asked who they would vote for if the election for Congress was held now. The generic Republican candidate garnered 44% to the generic Democratic candidate's 43% -- a result well within the margin of error. This poll is basically in line with the average of all polls, which has generally featured a low single digit Republican advantage on the generic ballot. If that held through November, Republicans would be small favorites to take back the House. Democrats winning the House popular vote and holding on to control given how redistricting has gone (relatively well for Democrats) would be quite plausible.The election is still well over half a year away and we obviously don't know who will turn out in November -- hence, why we are not whittling down the electorate just yet.  Read MoreDig into the poll a little more, and you can see where Democrats' problem lies, though. Our CNN poll asked respondents how enthusiastic they were about voting in this year's election \"extremely, very, somewhat, not too or not enthusiastic at all.\"Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic (24%), Republicans held a 59% to 39% lead over Democrats on the generic congressional ballot. If we expand our universe to include those who were very enthusiastic as well (43% of all voters) of all voters, Republicans were ahead 55% to 42%. No matter how you measure enthusiasm, the voters who are most enthusiastic about voting this year lean Republican. A similar signal was seen in an NBC News poll last month in which Republicans registered far more interest in the upcoming midterms than Democrats, so this poll is no outlier. Of course, a vote cast by an enthusiastic voter is worth the same as a vote cast by an unenthusiastic voter. The fact is, though, that enthusiastic voters have been more likely to say they'll cast a ballot than unenthusiastic voters, at least in CNN polling historically. The relationship isn't perfect, but it's clear one exists. In the final poll before the last midterm in 2018, voters were asked the enthusiasm question as well as how likely they were to vote on a scale from definitely not to definitely will/already have. Among those who said they were extremely enthusiastic to vote, 96% said they were definitely going to vote or had already voted. A relatively low 73% of those who were not extremely likely to vote said they were definitely voting or had already voted. This dropped to 64% among those who were not extremely or very enthusiastic. Of course, the exact levels of enthusiasm between the parties could easily differ between now and Election Day. It's also true that the party that has been more enthusiastic about voting at this point in the campaign has been more enthusiastic to vote in the final CNN poll asking about enthusiasm before the midterm. Republicans were more enthusiastic in 2010 and 2014, while Democrats were more enthusiastic in 2018. The party that was more enthusiastic at this point went on to major gains in the November elections.  Indeed, history would need to be upended for there not to be a significant difference between the voting patterns between registered voters and midterm voters who turn out to vote.In a previous story, I examined the difference in party identification between all registered voters and those who actually voted in midterm elections since 1978 in post-election surveys from the ANES and CES. The years in which there was a Republican president (like in 2018), there was a minimal difference in the party identification between midterm voters and voters overall. In years in which there was a Democratic president (like right now), Republicans on average made up 5 points more of the midterm voter pool than registered voter pool. In none of the years with a Democratic president did Republican turnout advantage shrink below 3 points. Averaging across different national pre-election generic ballot polls in both 2010 and 2014, we see how this impacted the result. The Republican lead widened by about 5.6 points and 4.8 points on average in 2010 and 2014 respectively. In other words, it was very close to what we'd expect given what the ANES and CES signaled. Could 2022 be different? Past isn't always prologue, but history does seem more likely than not to repeat itself. Beyond the polling we have nationally right now, the polling ahead of the Virginia gubernatorial election a few months ago painted a similar picture. Fox and the Washington Post, two national pollsters, who presented registered and likely voter results in that race found Republican Glenn Youngkin doing 5 points better on average with likely than registered voters. He would go on to win the election. Anyway you look at it, Democrats are probably in considerably worse shape at this point than polls of registered voters on the generic ballot might lead you to believe.",

        "content": "(CNN)Valentine's Day is a day of love, a special day on which we're supposed to make sure that those around us know how much we care for them. But on this day when Cupid is supposed to strike us with his arrow, there are several reasons to think \"love\" (by its many definitions) isn't what it once was in the United States, for better or for worse. Indeed, here are four potentially troubling statistics and one potentially positive sign about love in the US.  We're at a 30-year low for sex Fewer Amercians are having sex. Twenty-six percent of Americans ages 18 and up didn't have sex once over the past 12 months, according to the 2021 General Social Survey. You might think this is just a pandemic effect, but it's part of a long-term trend. The two years with next-highest percentage of adults saying they didn't have sex once in the past year were 2016 (23%) and 2018 (23%) -- the last two times the survey was conducted. Before 2004, the highest percentage of Americans who said they hadn't had sex in the past year was 19%. Last year's survey was also the first time that the percentage of Americans who had sex once a month or less topped 50%. In 1989, 35% of American adults had sex once a month or less. Read MoreSome of this has to do with fewer people getting married and an aging population, but that doesn't explain all of it. Among married couples under the age of 60, 26% had sex once a month or less in 2021. In 1989, it was 12%. The 1980s really were better for sex. READ MORE: How well do you fight when it comes to love?We're at a 30-year low for living together Fewer people are living together with a partner. It's not just about sex. Some 62% of Americans ages 25 to 54 lived with a partner or were married, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center study of 2019 US Census Bureau data. This included 53% who were married and 9% who were cohabitating. That's well below the 71% of couples who lived together in 1990, with 67% married and 4% cohabitating.You might think the growing share of unmarried people living without a spouse is due to rising educational levels among women who don't need the financial support of a man. The statistics tell a different story, though. Better educated people and higher wage earners are the most likely to live with a partner or be married. A lot of people won't get married if they don't think it's financially feasible, according to Pew polling. There's also been a higher increase in unmarried men living alone (10 points) than women (7 points) compared to the 1990 baseline.      Partnership is at a low, not just marriage Could it just be the case that people are still in relationships, but don't want to be tied down by either living together or being married? Yes, but the statistics suggest something else is cooking. The General Social Survey has, on and off since 1986, asked participants whether they had a steady partner. This past year, 30% of adults ages 25 to 54 (the same age bracket as the Pew study) indicated that they did not have a steady partner. In 1986, it was 20%. In fact, the percentage of 25- to 54-year-olds who said they didn't have a steady partner never topped 23% prior to the 2010s. It's been 25% or above in every survey since. Interestingly, as the population ages and more Baby Boomers have gotten above the age of 55, the percentage of older folks in a relationship has stayed fairly steady -- in the mid-to-high 60s on average. Why exercise is also good for your sexual healthThat means this trend toward singledom is more about young people than older people. It's the same with sex: The percentage of those age 55 and older not having any sex in the last year (40%) is about the same as it was 30 years ago. Many Americans won't get their partner a card for Valentine's DayOf course, the reason love is on my mind is that today is Valentine's Day. Love is supposed to be in the air. A 2022 Monmouth University poll found, however, that a mere 55% of Americans in relationships usually receive a Valentine's Day card from their partner. Combine the other 45% with the over 30% of all American adults without a partner, and most people aren't getting a card from a partner this year. Once again, it's among the younger generation where love seems to be less in the air. The clear majority (64%) of Americans ages 55 and older who are in a relationship say they usually get a card from their partner. This drops to 57% among those ages 35 to 54 and a mere 41% in my age bracket (18-34). It shouldn't be that hard to do Valentine's Day right. Our partners really don't want that much from us. Just 4% want an expensive gift more than anything else for Valentine's Day. The majority across age brackets yearn for a simple gift like chocolates or to spend the night at home with their partner doing a favorite activity. The divorce rate is droppingIf there is one thing good about declining marriage and partner rates, it's that it seems people are less likely to run headlong into a marriage that has a high probability of failing.The rate of divorces and annulments was at its lowest level this century in 2019, according to the CDC/NCHS National Vital Statistics System. There were 2.7 divorces and annulments per 1,000 people in the population. That's down from 4 per 1,000 in the year 2000. It shouldn't be surprising, therefore, that the divorce rate among young adults has seen the sharpest drop. This is the group that is least likely to marry, and those who do seem to be doing a better job of going into a marriage that has a good chance of succeeding. Maybe one day I'll be one of those lucky ones in a successful marriage. A boy can hope. Can't he?",

        "content": "(CNN)The Cincinnati Bengals' incredible ride to a potential Super Bowl title faces one last test against the Los Angeles Rams. The Bengals were not expected to be in the Super Bowl this year and are underdogs in the game, but it's not just the Rams they are facing. They're up against history. The Bengals are part of a group of major professional franchises that have never won the big one. If they win on Sunday, they'll be ending one of the longest streaks of not winning their league's title. Amazingly though, there are a number of teams with even less probable streaks.To put some numbers on it, consider that the Bengals have been a major league football team since 1968. That's 53 years the Bengals have padded up and never won a Super Bowl. The Vince Lombardi Trophy with helmets from the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals.Based purely on random chance -- a calculation we'll be doing a lot of in this article -- there was about only a 15% chance the Bengals would never have won a Super Bowl. To be clear, there is a higher likelihood that at least one team wouldn't have won a Super Bowl since 1968, but for it to be specifically the Bengals, it's about 15%. You can read more about these calculations in this article from FiveThirtyEight's Neil Paine.Read MoreThere are other teams in the NFL with even worse luck.The Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Buffalo Bills (much to my chagrin), Detroit Lions, Los Angeles Chargers, Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans have operated consistently since the first Super Bowl in the 1966-1967 season -- and none of them have ever won a Super Bowl. The chance of that happening for the given franchise is a little less than 15%.My Bills managed to appear in four consecutive Super Bowls and lost all of them. They're the only team to go to four Super Bowls in a row and certainly the only one to lose all of them. Such a fate happening to a team is less than 1%. In terms of length of time for winning the Big One, the Cardinals and Lions manage to top all of these teams. The Cardinals have existed in the NFL since the beginning of the league in 1920. Before the Super Bowl, an NFL Champion was crowned. The Cardinals won just one of those titles: in 1947, thanks in part to a great punt return by Hall of Famer Charley Trippi. The chance the Cardinals haven't won a title since that point is only about 3%. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow celebrates.The Lions have suffered a similar fate. They won an NFL title in 1957 -- a little more recently than the Cardinals. But unlike the Cardinals, they haven't even won the NFC championship since that point. By random chance alone, 99 times out of 100, the Lions should have won an NFL or NFC championship. Worse for arguably the league's unluckiest fan base, the Lions haven't really been competitive. They haven't even appeared in an NFC title game in 30 years. This year, they won three games -- tied for the worst in football. At least, the Cardinals made the playoffs this season.Of course, we're limiting ourselves a little bit by examining only football.Major League Baseball is the oldest sport of the big three -- MLB, NBA and NFL -- in the US. It had three streaks of teams going over 85 years without winning a World Series: the Chicago Cubs, the Chicago White Sox and the Boston Red Sox. All managed to break the slide this century, however. The current streak for ineptitude in baseball belongs to the Cleveland Guardians. They haven't won a World Series since 1948 -- an over 70-year-old streak.They have come close two times in recent years -- in 1997 and 2016 -- though they couldn't get over the top. By random chance, there was a better than 95% chance the Guardians would have won at least one World Series during that timespan. Amed Rosario of the then named Cleveland Indians takes off his hat as he walks off the field in the fifth inning against the Texas Rangers.The Seattle Mariners have a perhaps lesser known streak, though one that is equally nutty. They have been members of the American League since 1977. They haven't won an American League pennant once during that time. For any team, that should happen less than 5% of the time. More -- or less, depending on your point of view -- impressive is that the Mariners haven't even made the playoffs in the last 20 years. This is the longest streak in all three major league sports we're talking about here, not just baseball. There was less than a 1% chance that would happen to the Mariners by random chance alone!But even the Mariners can't top arguably the least talked about streak of horrible luck in the three major sports.The Sacramento Kings haven't won an NBA championship in 70 years. More than that, they haven't even appeared in a championship game since they won it as the Rochester Royals in 1951. This is six years longer than the streak put together by the Lions of the NFL for not appearing in the championship game. A close up shot of the Sacramento Kings logo.What's incredible about what the Kings have managed to do is that they have done so in a league that hasn't historically had a lot of teams. For a good chunk of the Kings' streak, they had to beat out less than 10 teams to make it to the NBA Finals.  More than 99 times out of 100, the Kings should have made it to the NBA Finals at least once by random chance. Arguably the closest they came was in 2002, when they lost Game 6 and Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in somewhat contentious fashion. The Kings lost Game 7 in overtime.And it's not like there has been any sign in recent years that the Kings have gotten better. They haven't been to the NBA Playoffs in 15 seasons, which is by far the longest current streak.Sacramento looks well on its way to year 16 without making it. If that happens, it'll be the longest streak any NBA team has ever gone without making the playoffs. Given over half the NBA teams make the playoffs every season, this is truly on another level. Put another way, even if the Joe Burrow and the Bengals don't win on Sunday, they can at least say they aren't the Kings.A San Francisco 49ers fan watches his team play against the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl LIV.Other Super Bowl musingsOf course, some people will not be watching Sunday's game because they're interested in football. So for all of those out there whose main interest in the game is not the actual sport of football, here are five things you should know -- or might be fascinated to hear:Bring chicken wings to your partyIf you're wondering what the No. 1 treat is for people when watching the Super Bowl, it's chicken wings at 33%. Next is pizza at 19%, according to a 2020 SSRS poll. Burgers (13%) and dips (16%) -- that you might use in chips and salsa -- are the only other foods to hit double digits. What's interesting about this is that pizza typically scores as the top food choice outside of football, but I guess people just prefer something different with their pigskin. A lot of people will watch the gameI don't think most of us realize how many people are going to tune into this game. We've already had north of 50 million watch the AFC and NFC Championship games at their peak. Last year, more than 90 million watched the Super Bowl, so 100 million viewers is very reachable. If we hit 100 million viewers, it will be three times as large as the audience for any non-NFL program in 2021. A lot of people watch the Super Bowl for the commercialsOne of my favorite questions about the Super Bowl was a 2020 SSRS poll asking why people watched it. Nearly three-fifths (58%) said it was for the game. Another 24% said it was mainly for the commercials, and 13% admitted it was for the halftime show. Given that at least 90 million people watch the Super Bowl, we're talking about more than 30 million people who are watching the game for a reason mainly other than play on the field. The postgame show is... more sports and will likely be well watchedOne of the big advantages of a network hosting the Super Bowl is that it gets to showcase a television program after the game. Sometimes, a network will premiere a show -- The Wonder Years and Family Guy come to mind. Last year, the CBS postgame show, The Equalizer, ended up rating in the top-10 primetime programs for the entire year. This year, NBC is putting on the Olympics, which have so far struggled in the ratings. If you don't know who to root for, choose the Bengals to fit inData tells us that most people generally prefer rooting for the underdog. That seems to be the case this year as well. About 15 points more of those with a rooting interest in the game are picking the Bengals over the Rams. That's especially the case outside the state of California, where the Rams are based. So if you don't follow football and want to be part of the in crowd, you better wear black and orange.",

        "content": "(CNN)Former Vice President Mike Pence has caused an uproar by saying he did not have the lawful ability to overturn the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Pence has argued correctly, according to almost every single legal scholar, that his role as president of the Senate was largely ceremonial during the congressional count of electoral votes.\u00a0\"President Trump is wrong,\" Pence declared last week.Normally, taking a position against the former President would be the death knell in Republican politics, but data shows that this looks to be the rare case where Pence is unlikely to face much wrath from the base.Take a look at a recent poll from CBS News/YouGov. The question it asked was simple: After states certify their election results, should Congress have the ability to overturn those results or must they accept them? The vast majority of Americans, 75%, believe that Congress should have to accept those results. Just 25% disagreed.When we examine the results by party, it becomes clear that Pence is probably standing on firm ground with all sectors of the electorate. Democrats (81%), Republicans (70%), voters who supported President Joe Biden (86%) and, yes, voters who went for Trump (73%) all agree that Congress should have to accept the results that were certified by the states.The fact that there is uniform agreement here might be why there looks to be bipartisan support for clarifying the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which tells Congress what it can and can't do with the electoral votes sent by the states. We heard GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has Trump's endorsement in his 2022 Senate reelection bid, voice his support for Pence's decision.\u00a0Read MoreRepublican support makes this bill unlike other election or voting bills that lawmakers\u00a0have tried to pass through Congress, which tend to be very divisive politically. Opposition to the recent voting rights bill in Congress outran support by an 8:1 margin among Republicans nationwide.Pence's lasting popularity, in fact, seems to prove that there may not be a big appetite among Republicans to punish members of Congress who went against Trump in the certification of the election.After January 6 last year, Republicans were asked in an Ipsos poll whether they approved of the recent behavior of members of Congress. This was right after Pence had overseen Congress accepting the electoral votes.Nearly three-quarters (74%) of Republicans said they approved of Pence. This was higher than every other Republican tested: Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas (61%), Missouri's Sen. Josh Hawley (46%), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky (42%), Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah (34%) and even Trump himself (64%).This is part of what makes Pence unique among Republicans who have taken Trump to task. Pence is popular in his own right. His favorable rating stands at 64% in recent polling versus an unfavorable rating of 26%. This is good for a +38 point net favorability rating.Compare Pence's popularity with that of other Republicans who have spoken out against Trump. Romney's net favorability is -30 points. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney's is -40 points.This gets at something key: Not all criticism of Trump is equal in Republicans' minds. There is a major difference among Republicans between saying that Trump should be impeached and removed from office and accepting the 2020 vote returns from states. The former had the support of less than 10% of Republicans. The latter is what most Republicans want to happen going forward.Indeed, Republicans do seem to tolerate some criticism of Trump. Much has been made, including by me, of a Pew Research Center poll question querying Republicans on how accepting the party should be of elected officials who openly critique Trump.Only 37% of Republicans indicated that the party should be very or somewhat accepting of those officials. Then there is the 30% who believe the party should not at all be accepting.The plurality response was not too accepting at 32%. When you add this 32% with the 37% who agree that the party should be at least somewhat accepting, you get 69% of all Republicans who don't believe the party should be totally unaccepting of those who go after Trump.Another way of looking at it is that you can disagree with the former President here and there but you can't be doing so consistently or be too vocal about it. Pence has so far done a pretty good job of that. It doesn't hurt that the former vice president chose an issue on which most Republicans agree with him.Of course, this doesn't mean that Pence would be a major contender for the 2024 presidential nomination. He's currently coming in third, behind Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.But the reason Pence won't win the 2024 nomination is probably because of other issues, not his role on January 6.",

        "content": "(CNN)President Joe Biden has the worst approval rating after one year in office of nearly every elected president, except for former President Donald Trump. But a look across the Atlantic Ocean shows that things can always be worse for Biden. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Conservative Party member, is mired in scandal over parties taking place during Covid lockdowns. His ratings are as low as Richard Nixon's were when he resigned the US presidency in 1974. Johnson right now has a popularity rating of about 24% among Britons, across different polling. (For comparison, Biden's approval rating among US adults is about 41%.)The 24% is low by both US and UK standards. Beyond the Nixon comparison, Johnson's popularity is comparable to two US presidents: Harry Truman and George W. Bush late in their second terms. Truman had a foreign entanglement and a weak economy. Bush had the same problem. Both Truman and Bush saw their parties suffer once-in-a-generation defeats in the following election. Their parties lost the presidency in blowouts and endured losses in the House and the Senate.Read MoreSomething similar has happened in the UK to leaders when their ratings drop this low. Look at data since 1977 from Ipsos. Johnson's popularity ratings right now is lower than 93% of all prime minister ratings since the late 1970s. The last prime minister to be this unpopular was Gordon Brown in the late 2000s. Brown's Labour Party lost the next general election, and he was replaced as prime minister. This has been a theme throughout the last 45 years in UK politics. Every single prime minister whose popularity dipped to Johnson's level failed to recover. They either resigned the prime ministership (like Tony Blair) or lost the next general election (like Brown or John Major).Johnson, at this point, isn't resigning and doesn't face another general election for over two years. There is time for him to recover. The pressure to step down may ultimately get him, however, as a number of members of his own party are already trying to oust him. If enough Conservative parliament members want to, they can force Johnson from power. Biden isn't anywhere close to being in the same straits as Johnson. While Biden isn't as popular as he once was within his own party, he is unlikely to face any serious challenge if he decided to run for another term for president.  Moreover, Biden knows that there is plenty of history of presidents as unpopular as he is improving their position and actually winning another term in office. Ronald Reagan (in 1983) and Truman (in 1946) were less popular later in their terms than Biden currently is and won the next presidential election.More recently, Barack Obama, after the 2010 midterms, was nearly as unpopular and won a second term. Trump almost won a second term, even as he was more unpopular at multiple points as Biden. Biden's numbers could easily improve depending how conditions in the country change. His approval ratings have been tied almost directly to the economy and the state of the coronavirus. Inflation, one of the big drivers of economic discontent, is expected to lessen in 2022. The US is also adding a lot of new jobs. The coronavirus situation, too, may be improving. New cases are falling, and we have no idea where we'll be in 2024. Even if the 2024 election were held today, it's not clear Biden would lose. He's basically running even with Trump, who remains his most likely opponent. Biden is benefitting from the fact that presidential elections are ultimately choices, and the non-Biden choice is as unpopular as he is. Johnson, on the other hand, isn't likely to benefit from facing such an unpopular adversary. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer isn't beloved, but his net popularity ratings are as good if not better than Biden's (depending on the poll). Of course, most voters won't get to vote directly for Johnson or Starmer in a general election. They'll be voting for candidates representing the Conservative, Labour and other parties in their own constituencies (or districts). On this metric, Johnson is in worse shape than Biden. Johnson's Conservative Party is trailing in every single reputable poll to Starmer's Labour Party. The average deficit is running in the high single digits. It's one of the worst positions the Conservative Party has been in the last decade. But perhaps the best way to look at Johnson's vs. Biden's situation is to understand that both may not win the next general election, though it will likely happen in very different ways. Biden may voluntarily decide not to run because he'll be in his 80s by the next presidential election.Johnson may be forced out because of how deeply unpopular he is.",

        "content": "(CNN)One word can describe how Americans are feeling about the way things are going: bad. That's the finding of a new Gallup poll out Wednesday that measures the state of the nation, and it's what a lot of other data tells us as well. Any sense of optimism that was apparent after vaccines were developed for the coronavirus has abated, and a lot of Americans are not pleased with what is going on in their daily lives, the state of our nation and the state of our politics. Gallup has been asking Americans how they are feeling about different aspects of life and policy issues for the last two decades. And this year, across those 29 different measurements, just 38% of Americans say they're satisfied.In 2020, before the pandemic began, an average of 48% of Americans said they were satisfied. There was a big drop in 2021, when 41% indicated they were happy with what was going on these 29 different metrics. What this data indicates is that, nearly two years into the pandemic in the United States, there has not been any real recovery in how Americans believe things are going. Read MoreWhen you break it down by aspects of life and policy issues, the same story emerges. Just 41% are satisfied on the seven aspects of life issues measured consistently over the last two decades. These aspects include quality of life, the system of government and how it works, and the influence of organized religion. That 41% is statistically insignificantly different from the 39% who were satisfied last year, which was the lowest on record. On policy issues, 35% are satisfied on the 16 areas measured consistently over the last two decades. Some of these policy issues include the nation's abortion policies, the policies to reduce crime, the state of the economy and the quality of education in our nation. This 35% is the lowest ever measured. Because there are more policy issues than aspects of life issues measured, this means that, on average, Americans are less satisfied with the way things are going than at any point in the last two decades. Perhaps this shouldn't be too surprising, given everything we've seen in the polling. The General Social Survey has been asking Americans since 1972 whether, all things considered, they're very happy, pretty happy or not too happy. The percentage who said very happy outran the percentage who said not too happy in every poll taken before the pandemic. Today, 24% indicated they were not too happy, compared with 19% who said they were very happy. The former is a record high, while the latter is a record low. The rest, as Christopher Ingraham noted, are in the \"pretty happy\" camp, which hasn't changed much since 2018.   But it's not just where American happiness with daily life currently is, it's also about a lack of optimism for the future. Look at a Marist College poll from December. Only 49% of Americans were more optimistic than pessimistic about how things were going to go in the world in 2022. This was the first time since Marist started asking the question in 2009 that the optimistic percentage fell below 50%.Heading into 2021, 56% of Americans had been more optimistic than pessimistic. This suggests that despite the pandemic, some Americans had hope for 2021. This hope was dashed.Pandemic fatigue likely is a big driver of that negativity. President Joe Biden's net approval (approve minus disapprove) on handling the virus has gone from about +30 points to negative territory. More than a quarter (28%) of Americans now believe that the outbreak will never be under control in Monmouth University polling, and a majority (60%) think it will take at least a year, if ever. At the beginning of 2021, only 30% felt that way. Americans are looking for a way out of the pandemic, which could be why 70% told Monmouth that it was time to accept that the coronavirus is here to stay and we need to move on. Of course, even if Americans become more satisfied with how the coronavirus is going in the country, it won't solve longer-term issues with happiness about where we are politically. More Americans have said the country is going in the wrong direction than have said it is on the right track consistently since the early 2000s. There was a slight jump to a decade-high percentage of Americans (in the mid-40s on average) agreeing in mid-2021 that the country was going in the right direction; however, this has dropped back below 30% in recent data. The unhappiness with our country is seen especially well in how people feel about the two major political parties. Almost every poll Gallup has taken over the last decade shows that less than a majority have favorable opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties. There's a reason why a clear plurality of Americans identify as independents instead of as Democrats or Republicans, when initially asked. When it comes to the midterm elections, nearly a third of voters say it doesn't matter who wins.Indeed, we likely won't solve our collective issues overnight. Hopefully we can get back to a better normal. Because right now, these numbers are just downright depressing.",

        "content": "(CNN)Monday, January 24, 2022 was the least productive day of my professional career. The culprit was the Buffalo Bills losing to the Kansas City Chiefs the day before in arguably the greatest NFL playoff game of all time. The Bills have never won a Super Bowl and will need to wait at least one more year before they do. Every time the Bills fall short, I am filled with a feeling that can only be described as expected despair. As the saying goes: it's the hope that kills you.A question I'm often asked is why do I root for this underdog, as if it is some unexplainable mistake. It turns out, however, that there are many people just like me, and there are good reasons folks keep rooting for teams that break their hearts over and over again. There have been lots of studies about people like me who root for the underdogs, and a couple of theories have been formed about why we do what we do. A good article from the Baylor College of Medicine on the topic provided a summary of those explanations, and I must admit some fit me fairly well. Read MoreFor example, we root for the underdog because we relate to them. I was someone who didn't speak until late and struggled learning well into high school. Relative to my classmates, I saw myself as a bit of an underdog -- a team like the Bills fits me well. Bills fans might suffer a lot of heartbreak, but they remain ever loyal to their team.More broadly, they fit the city of Buffalo very well. Buffalo has the smallest television market in the country for an NFL team. The population of the city had, for a long time, been dwindling for years. Being seen as the outcast reinforces the fact that the Bills are Buffalo's own. To this end, the city protects its team in situations that I doubt few other cities would. When the Bills lost Super Bowl XXV on a missed field goal, the city of Buffalo still hosted a festivity after the game. A crowd of 30,000 gave a standing ovation to the man who missed the winning kick: Scott Norwood.Bills fandom is about loyalty, win or lose. The science of the underdogScience also tells us that people get a lot of happiness out of the underdog pulling it off -- people get more joy out of winning unexpectedly. Ask any Leicester City fan after they won the Premier League in 2016. They were a 5,000:1 shot. The same is definitely true for someone like me. I actually cried when the Bills merely made the playoffs in 2017 after a nearly 20-year drought. I replay the moment the Bills made the playoffs over and over again on YouTube. Keep in mind, the Bills only got in because the Baltimore Ravens lost against the Cincinnati Bengals; the Bills won a tiebreaker and were able to sneak in through a backdoor.The Bills getting into the playoffs didn't get them anywhere close to a Super Bowl though, as they lost in the opening round of the playoffs. Leicester City's title-winning Premier League season in 2015/16 was the stuff of fairy tales.While rooting for the Bills is not something many Americans do, the yearning to root for an underdog is widespread.Americans actually prefer the underdog to the favorite. Academic studies show that about two-thirds of people will root for a hypothetical underdog over a hypothetical favorite. Not only that, but experiments indicate that people will switch allegiances if they find out the underdog is winning.You can see this in the actual polling. Take a look at what happened to the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII compared to XXXIII, for example. Going into that first Super Bowl, the Broncos were massive underdogs to the Green Bay Packers, a beloved NFL franchise which most people like and few people dislike. Fans were two points more likely to root for the Broncos than the Packers. The next year, the Broncos were heavy favorites over the Atlanta Falcons, a team which outside of Georgia doesn't have many fans. Even so, people who had a preference were 11 points more likely to want the Falcons to win. SchadenfreudeBut perhaps the least romantic reason for liking the underdog isn't about the underdog itself -- it's about the favorite.In other words, there is a lot of schadenfreude (pleasure derived from the misfortune of another) going on: we want the losers to win because we enjoy the pain of the winner losing.Think about how much people celebrate on Twitter when Duke basketball, an elite college basketball powerhouse school with a history of winning, loses. How about the chant \"[the New York] Yankees Suck?\" Or better yet, watch any clip of ESPN's Stephen A. Smith laughing at any Dallas Cowboy misfortune. This one of him just getting the biggest joy out of seeing Cowboy fans cry is one of the best.My schadenfreude doesn't apply to the Bills, but it definitely applies to my Yankees hatred. I make sure to call a Yankee friend of mine at the end of every season they lose and make him suffer. One of the biggest mistakes we make is conflating the large fan bases of frontrunners with the fact that most people root for the frontrunners. The Cowboys are both one of the most loved and most disliked teams in the NFL.A FiveThirtyEight study from 2017 found that more Americans listed the Cowboys in their top three favorite teams than every other team, save the Packers. Yet only about 20% of Americans had the Cowboys as one of their favorite teams, while over 30% of fans had the Dallas team as one of their least favorite teams. A 2010 Gallup poll showed the same thing when it came to baseball. A year after they won the World Series, a league high 16% of baseball fans said the Yankees were a team they loved to root for. Nearly twice as many (31%) though said the Yankees were a team they loved to hate. The Yankees are almost the complete opposite of the Bills. They're from the most populated city in the United States and have won more championships than any other American professional franchise. The Yankees do, however, provide a great example of how quickly the tide can turn. The team won 26 World Series in the 20th century, but they have won just one in the 21st century. Though the Bills lost, their future looks bright with Josh Allen at the helm.Maybe the Bills, who haven't pulled it off in the first 56 Super Bowls, will do better over the next 56? All we need is one, and there will be great, great joy.",

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes each led amazing last-second drives before a field goal forced the game into overtime.

(After the first overtime the rules do get somewhat more complicated.)\u00a0Read MoreThe team that wins the toss usually decides to go on defense first because they can know if the other team scored a touchdown or a field goal or failed to score. Based on that, the team that goes second can choose to be more or less aggressive when they get on offense.\u00a0It turns out, though, there hasn't been a statistical advantage to going second since 2013. According to data from\u00a0Oklahoma State's Rick Wilson, a professor at the Spears School of Business, and my digging through box scores from\u00a0Sports Reference, there have been nearly 300 overtime games involving Division I Football Bowl Subdivision teams from 2013-2021.The team that has received the ball second has won 49.7% of the time since 2013, or right about 50% of the time. In other words, there has not been an advantage to going second.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dallas Cowboys suffer heartbreaking overtime loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on ThanksgivingThis year the statistics continue to show no advantage for the team that goes second. In fact, they have lost four more times than they have won in Sports Reference data. That's notable because the rules were adjusted this past season, if no team leads after the first overtime.\u00a0(Read here for more on that rule change.)It's tough to be fairer than 50/50 in overtime. Yet, there have been some people in the past who\u00a0argued\u00a0that the college system isn't as fair as these stats make it out to be. You can see this in a widely\u00a0shared\u00a0tweet from former\u00a0NFL\u00a0player and now analyst Ross Tucker, this Ringer article from 2017, and a fairly cited Reddit thread on the fairness of the college overtime system.\u00a0I actually agreed with these folks before I looked at the most recent data. What seems to have happened is that there may have been a slight advantage to going second in earlier data.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Ringer article cited\u00a0a\u00a0paper co-written by\u00a0Wilson, who has written numerous times on the college overtime system, that showed the team who got the ball second won about 55% of the time from 1995 to 2006. The co-authors of that paper noted, however, that the sample size was small enough for this difference to barely be statistically significant.\u00a0Wilson in an email told me that \"there is no statistical significant difference (i.e. advantage) to choosing to go on defense first in college football OT.\" A better predictor of whether you win or lose in overtime is whether you have the more talented team.\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0NFL\u00a0system is quite different. A team can win the overtime coin toss, receive the opening kickoff and win with a touchdown without the other team getting an offensive possession.\u00a0If the receiving team does not score a touchdown on its first possession (or if the kicking team does not score a touchdown on a turnover), the game continues.The current system (where you can't win with a field goal on the opening possession of overtime) has been in place since 2011 for the playoffs and 2012 for the regular season.\u00a0\u00a0Confetti falls after the Patriots defeat the Falcons 34-28 in ovetime during Super Bowl LI at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas.According to the\u00a0Stathead database, there have been over 160 overtime games under the current rules for winning in overtime (including the postseason). The team that got the ball first has won 52% of the time. The team that kicked off has won 41% of the time. The rest were ties, which happens in regular season games when no one scores during the now 10 minute overtime period.  In other words, there has been about an 11 percentage point advantage in getting the ball first in the current NFL overtime system. Since 2017, when the overtime period was shrunk to 10 minutes in the regular season, the advantage in regular season games has been about 15 percentage points (54% to 39%).  To be clear, the advantage of the team that gets the ball first in\u00a0NFL overtime isn't dominating. I was surprised\u00a0by\u00a0how small it\u00a0is. If you were to run statistical tests, it's right on the edge of statistical significance.\u00a0\u00a0FiveThirtyEight's Neil Paine calls the seeming edge for teams who get the ball first \"small but meaningful.\" When I chatted with him, he noted that it's slightly smaller than the home field advantage (i.e. the home team wins about 14 percentage points more often in the regular season) \"but still matters if it's persistent.\"\u00a0\u00a0Put another way, a great team is still likely to beat a bad team in overtime. But when the teams are fairly evenly matched, getting the ball first probably matters.\u00a0The playoffs is such a time when the teams are usually fairly evenly matched. Although the sample size is just 11 games, the team that has gotten the ball first in overtime since 2011 has won 10 times -- a small sample size but a pretty big statistical departure.Just ask any Atlanta Falcons fan about Super Bowl LI in 2017, when the New England Patriots won in overtime without the Falcons offense ever taking the field. The Patriots did the same thing to the Chiefs two years later in the AFC Championship game.  Now, the Chiefs have done it to the Bills.There's a reason many Falcons fans cried foul after that Super Bowl. Today, many Bills fans know the pain.",

        "content": "(CNN)Almost everything in our world today is divided along political lines. Whether it be something as important as a life saving vaccine or something as simple -- and you would think would be non-partisan -- as what TV programs people watch or jeans people wear, everything seems to be polarized along partisan lines.That's what makes the NFL standout. While the NFL should perhaps worry about the youngest of fans, football is by far the most popular sport in America. It's a sport whose popularity cuts across political and racial divides. Witness the ratings for the Dallas Cowboys vs. San Francisco 49ers playoff game on January 16. More than 41 million people on average tuned in for the game, while 50 million saw the Cowboys lose on one of the most atrocious play calls I can ever recall. This was, of course, merely a first round playoff game.49ers QB Jimmy Garoppolo looking to pass against the Dallas Cowboys.To put that 41 million in perspective, the most highly-rated, non-football television broadcast in 2021 had a little less than 34 million people tune in. Keep in mind that program -- the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris -- was broadcast across more than a dozen channels. And while most of television is struggling to keep viewers in the streaming era, the NFL has actually been gaining viewers this year. Over the course of 2021, 75 of the top 100 programs were NFL games. Read MoreBut this isn't just about television ratings, it's about interest at large. The NFL is king in the USA 2021 Ipsos poll asked American adults whether they were fans of a sport or not. A majority (51%) said they were fans of professional football. No other sport (pro baseball, pro basketball, pro hockey, pro soccer, college basketball or college football) even cracked the 40% mark. In fact, only pro baseball and college football even broke above 30%. Pro football is the only sport that a majority of Americans (51%) said they were fans of.While different pollsters have found differing levels of support for professional football -- depending upon question wording among other factors -- it's the top sport in any poll. Moreover, there's no sign that pro football's popularity has waned when examining Ipsos polling. In 2007, the same 51% of American adults said they were a fan of pro football. When you dig in deeper, you can see why the NFL does so well: it's popular across the political spectrum. Among Democrats, 51% said they were fans of the NFL. Among Republicans, it was 50%. A majority (55%) of independents indicated that they were fans of the NFL.You can see the same thing when you look at Google searches. The NFL is not only the number one most searched league in America, but there is not a statistically significant relationship with the level of search interest by state and how that state voted in the 2020 election.In other words, the states Democrat Joe Biden won search as much about the NFL as the states Republican Donald Trump won. That's not the case for any other major sports league in America: MLB, MLS, NBA or NHL. This may be surprising given what has occurred over the last five years between Trump and the NFL. Trump blasted the NFL in 2017 following players kneeling during the national anthem. In 2020, Trump and his allies again went after the league after more players knelt in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder. Kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against social injustice became a large political issue in the US from the time Colin Kaepernick (seen here with then teammate Eric Reid of the 49ers) began the trend in 2016.NFL leadership backed the protests in 2020, while they did not in 2017. Perhaps, they realized Trump wasn't ultimately making much of an impact. Indeed, just like now, at least 50% of Democrats and Republicans were fans of the NFL in the 2007 Ipsos poll. Racial divide in NFL fandom?It also doesn't appear that there is more of a racial divide among NFL fans than there was prior to 2017.In the Ipsos poll, 51% of White adults said they were NFL fans, which is the same as overall figure. Black adults were somewhat more likely to be NFL fans at 62%, though in the grand scheme that is a far smaller racial divide than we see on many issues in America. For example, Black adults were about 40 points more likely to say they were NBA fans than White adults.When Ipsos asked about professional football fandom in 2007, 54% of White adults said they were fans of the NFL. This is well within the margin of the error of what the 2021 Ipsos polling found. If there is one warning sign for the NFL, it's how young people feel about the league. Fears over concussions may be playing a role in the fact that about 100,000 fewer high school boys played football at the end of the 2010s than at the beginning of the decade.Football is losing some of its advantage among youth in terms of being America's favorite sport, but it isn't in danger any time soon.Football does remain a top sport for high schoolers, according to National Federation of State High School Associations data, but its advantage over other sports is shrinking.  Consider soccer, which is the world's favorite sport. Even with studies showing that people should fear concussions in soccer, the sport has been gaining ground on football. Boys' high school soccer saw a nearly 70,000-person participation increase over the course of the 2010s. Girls' soccer had a 40,000-person increase in participants over that span. This still left football with slightly over one million high school participants compared to about 459,000 boys and 394,000 girls (for a total of about 850,000) playing soccer. This meant the gap between soccer and football players in high school dropped from about 360,000 to about 155,000 over the course of the decade. There are some signs this is leaking into the fandom of professional sports. A majority of adults under the age of 30 (56%) in the Ipsos poll said they were not fans of the NFL. This was 15 points larger than those 70 and older of whom just 41% said they weren't a fan.Professional soccer, on other hand, saw the percentage of fans rise by double-digits over the 2010s in Gallup polling. That said, we shouldn't oversell football's problems. It remains the most popular American sport by a large margin. And while a sport like soccer may be picking up some ground, American adults are about 30 points more likely to be fans of football than soccer across polling. Football -- and the NFL -- does not seem to be in danger of being overtaken by another sport popularity wise any time soon.",

I kept telling him over and over, there are no easy answers in life,\" Ingeborg Oswald said. But she knew she couldn't stop him.  Overshadowed by his \"overachieving\" triplet brother and sister, Oswald said Kyle \"was going through this teenage crisis, not knowing what he wanted to do with his life.\" He had dropped out of junior college and was living with his mother, when he somehow discovered ayahuasca, (pronounced \"eye-uh-WAHS-kuh\") a psychedelic brew that some believe can help users achieve a higher state of consciousness.JUST WATCHEDGo inside an ayahuasca ceremonyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGo inside an ayahuasca ceremony 02:07JUST WATCHEDMeet the 'gringo' shamanReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMeet the 'gringo' shaman 02:25JUST WATCHEDVets seek PTSD treatment in AmazonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVets seek PTSD treatment in Amazon 01:13\"He went online and started reading all these positive things about ayahuasca, which is something I had never heard of before,\" Oswald said.  \"Apparently there's a huge, positive movement toward ayahuasca. And he thought that that would help him maybe discover who he was.\"His research led him to the Shimbre Shamanic Center in a remote corner of the Peruvian Amazon region. Oswald said the center's website made its ayahuasca experience \"sound very individualized.\"   It wasn't cheap: Kyle paid more than $2,000 in cash to take part in the ritual. Despite the promises of the center's website, a very different experience awaited Kyle Nolan in Peru.A death, then a cover-upKyle arrived in Peru in August 2012, a rare overseas excursion for a young man who was more of a homebody than a world traveler.  He journeyed deep into Peru's Amazon with hopes of experiencing a spiritual transformation.On the third night of Kyle's ayahuasca session, he never returned from his hut. Days later, when he didn't arrive home, Oswald called the Shimbre Shamanic Center and spoke to an interpreter for Shaman Mancoluto, who led the center's ayahuasca sessions.\"He told me, 'Oh well (Kyle) just decided he wanted to leave, he took off down the road, and he's left,'\" Oswald said. \"And I said, 'I don't believe you. My son would never ever do that.'\" So she and her daughter flew down to Peru to help local police search for Kyle. For three to four days, they searched hospitals and bars and talked to taxi drivers, asking if anyone had seen Kyle. \"No one ever saw him,\" Oswald said.  So Oswald and her daughter returned home to northern California while the Peruvian police continued their investigation. About a week later, Oswald said she learned from her contact with the Shimbre center that the shaman admitted to police that he had lied about Kyle leaving the center.They had \"found him dead outside, under a bush,\" Oswald said. They \"panicked and covered him up, and told everyone that he wasn't feeling well, that he was in his cabin.\" The shaman told authorities that he and two other men had buried Kyle's body, according to Oswald and Peruvian newspaper El Comercio.\"They said they put him in a wheelbarrow, took him about a mile down the road, dug a pit, buried him, and burned all his belongings,\" Oswald said. She returned to Peru where she had to identify her son's body. An autopsy in Peru was inconclusive.The shaman, whose real name is Jose Pi\u00f1eda, and the two other men were arrested. Pi\u00f1eda was eventually convicted of homicide and lying to authorities, and sentenced to five years in prison, according to local Peruvian media. Kyle's body was eventually brought back to California where Oswald said another autopsy also came up inconclusive, and he was cremated.According to El Comercio, the shaman told police that Kyle Nolan took too much ayahuasca. There's no conclusive evidence of what killed Kyle, Oswald said.  \"The only thing there is possibly out there is maybe the toxicology (results), but I can't get that unless I go back to Peru.\"An unregulated drug It's still unclear how ayahuasca can kill someone. Very little is known about ayahuasca and its effects and many shamanic centers, including the Shimbre Shamanic Center, require participants to cleanse their bodies for several months before taking ayahuasca -- a regiment that Oswald said her son followed very closely. Ethnobotanical organizations are trying to raise money to study ayahuasca and its medicinal qualities, as well as create a health guide for tourists interested in traveling to shamanic centers in the Amazon. There's a growing concern that as more Western tourists head to the Amazon looking for a psychedelic experience, more fly-by-night \"shamans\" will pop up looking to cash in on the boom. There have been other reported deaths, as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults.

It's a hallucinogenic drug. ... They call it a medicine, but it is a hallucinogenic drug,\" she said.  \"Obviously there's side effects to everything.  Anyone can have an adverse reaction to something.  You don't leave someone alone with a hallucinogenic drug (in their system).\" Oswald says she'll probably return to Peru one day when she's ready.  She is not considering any further legal action because, as she said, \"I can't put myself in that position to continue hating someone.\"\"I just have to try to get this behind me.  I can't continue to hate the shaman. ...  I can't let him ruin my life any more than he already has,\" she said. \"I need to get beyond it.\"",

He said he was surprised by \"the scale of development on halt in the towns outside Salt Lake City.\" He named his photography series \"Last Best Hiding Place\" after a phrase he came across during his travels, referring to those living \"slightly under the radar\" in remote parts of the American West.Social mediaFollow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography.\"Some of the parts in ... central Wyoming and central Montana, they are as remote as I've ever been,\" Richmond said. \"And when you're traveling 50 miles between almost just a gas station and that's it, it sort of changes one's viewpoint of scale and distance.\"  Richmond spent the early part of his career as a fashion photographer and taking portraits of actors including Ben Kingsley, Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson -- but his heart wasn't in it.  \"I wasn't really thrilled by the idea of being a fashion photographer,\" Richmond said.\"After the death of my first wife, it just sort of taught me to do what you want to do, and I go 'OK I want to concentrate on this sort of work.'\"His images include people and places in faraway towns like Miles City, Montana; Deadwood, South Dakota; and Eureka, Utah. Often, Richmond would determine where he'd go next by pulling out a map and picking a town that had an interesting name.Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.\"I remember looking in Utah one time and I came across this town -- I just thought, well it sounds really interesting and it's in the hills, and it's called Eureka,\" Richmond explained.  \"The story of the town itself is quite typical of a lot of those towns: it was nothing, no food, it grew huge and then slowly died off.  \"(But) the thing that really fascinated me was the fact that this town was really hanging on ... everything just seemed to click in that town.\"Richmond spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys, captured in one image simply doing their laundry.  He said the biggest culture shock of his entire trip happened during the rodeo events.\"I was surprised by ... the sense that at rodeos, you have the whole idea of prayers. It's such an un-English thing. At any sort of sports event (in England) you wouldn't have a quiet moment and say the Lord's Prayer and 'God bless the troops' ... but out there it seemed absolutely standard.\"Out of the thousands of images that he took, Richmond carefully selected ones he felt embody the real face of the American West. But he insists that his audience needs to \"create their own backstory\" about what they are witnessing in his photos.\"The place has to resonate with me ... there has to have some sort of lyricism or poetry about the image so people can see into it,\" he said. \"There's no story here so the pictures don't have to fit in ... these pictures  can float around a bit more, they don't have to fit with a strict text narrative.\"Tim Richmond is a fine art photographer and master printer.

        "content": "(CNN)Zimbabwe's former president Robert Mugabe, who was once feted as an independence hero but whose 37-year rule left his country deeply divided and nearly broke, has died at the age of 95. To his loyal supporters, he remained until his death the revered leader who ushered in independence after bringing an end to white-minority rule. But to his critics, Mugabe was the caricature of an African dictator who oppressed his opponents and ruined a country to retain power, which he was forced to relinquish, at the age of 93, in 2017.Rumors had swirled around the health of the ex-president, who spent months in a hospital in Singapore earlier this year. Details of what ailed him were a closely guarded secret.Mugabe -- who infamously claimed that \"only God\" could ever remove him from office -- was deposed in a coup in 2017, when members of his own party turned against him after he dismissed his longtime ally, then-vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, to make way for his much younger wife Grace.Fearing an erosion of their influence, senior security forces officials ousted him, replacing him with Mnangagwa.Read More\"It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe,\" tweeted President Mnangagwa on Friday.Tributes -- and also fierce criticism -- pour in after death of Robert Mugabe\"Cde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\"A former teacher, Mugabe was imprisoned for ten years for opposing the white-minority government of Rhodesia (as Zimbabwe was known before independence). After his release, he orchestrated a guerilla war which won freedom for his country in 1980. As Zimbabwe's first prime minister, he was at first lauded internationally for building schools and hospitals.However, the former champion of one man, one vote soon mounted a brutal crackdown against the opposition led by the late nationalist politician Joshua Nkomo. For decades, he maintained his grip on the country with the support of the army and a series of controversial elections.His rule was marked by the violent eviction of thousands of white farmers in 2000, and increasingly dubious elections, including one in 2008 which he lost to Morgan Tsvangirai, sparking political violence that human rights groups say claimed over 200 lives.Widely seen as a disgraced aging despot desperately clinging to power, Mugabe's rule finally came to an end at the hands of the regime he had spent decades building.

His father, Gabriel Mugabe, was a carpenter and his mother, Bona, a catechism teacher. After elementary school he entered a teacher training college, going on to work in several schools in Rhodesia before winning a scholarship to the University of Fort Hare in South Africa, where he studied history and English. In 1952, after graduating, he returned to teach in Rhodesia, later moving to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Ghana, a period during which he accumulated more university degrees, and met his first wife, Sally Hayfron.In 1960, he returned to Rhodesia and worked as publicity secretary for the newly founded anti-colonialist, African nationalist National Democratic Party. Quickly rising in influence, he advocated violence to end white rule, co-founding the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) with Ndabaningi Sithole in Tanzania after fleeing Rhodesia.He and his comrades insisted the white leadership was illegitimate, had occupied his people's land and made them \"a race of no rights beyond those of chattel.\"'I looked at her lustfully, then kissed her,' Mugabe on wooing his wifeIn 1963, he returned and was arrested for making subversive statements. He spent almost eleven years in jail, during which time he continued his political activism and study, earning university degrees in education, economics, administration and law.After his release in 1974, he led the ZANU-PF, the guerilla movement, from Mozambique against Premier Ian Smith's white minority rule. When the war ended in 1979, Mugabe was hailed as a war hero at home and abroad. He went on to lead the newly independent Zimbabwe -- as prime minister from 1980 to 1987, when he became its president.Articulate and smartly dressed, Mugabe came to power commanding the respect of a nation. He had a strong head start, inheriting a country with a stable economy, solid infrastructure and vast natural resources.But the descent into tyranny didn't take long.His hardline policies drove the country's flourishing economy to disintegrate after a program of land seizures from white farmers, and agricultural output plummeted and inflation soared.At first, Mugabe preached reconciliation with former enemies at home and abroad. For the country's black majority, Mugabe built schools and hospitals and promoted agriculture for peasant farmers.He was lauded by the West as a new kind of African liberation leader, particularly by former colonial ruler Britain, which had refused to recognize Smith's government and leveled economic sanctions against the country.'A degree in violence'But early on in his rule, Mugabe showed a penchant for dealing with opponents ruthlessly. The most startling example was the Gukurahundi killings between 1983 and 1987. Mugabe was accused of leading the massacre against political opponents. Tens of thousands of ethnic Ndebeles were killed -- including many found in mass graves that the victims reportedly had to dig themselves.His reputation for ruthlessness stemmed from this period. Later Mugabe would boast of having a \"degree in violence\".Despite the turmoil, Zimbabwe's economy was strong in the early years of Mugabe's rule. The country was known as the \"breadbasket\" of southern Africa and showed startling improvements in literacy rates. But the tone began to change in 1987 when Mugabe consolidated his power, assuming the office of president and head of the armed forces. In the early 1990s, the government began to amend laws allowing it to purchase land for resettlement and redistribution, prompting objections from landowners and the US and UK.As land-grabs escalated, the economy began a downward spiral in 1995 that culminated in catastrophic hyperinflation. Mugabe's government faced charges of elitism, cronyism and corruption. In 1996, he married his former secretary, Grace Marufu (following the death of his first wife in 1992). Elections that year became a one-man contest, after all other opponents dropped out days before the poll.President Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace pictured at their wedding ceremony on August 17 1996. In 2000, Mugabe and his ruling ZANU-PF party suffered their first major defeat since coming to power. Voters rejected a new constitution, handing the longtime president an unexpected blow in what was widely considered a confidence vote on his government.The rejection emboldened the newly formed opposition party, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), but it also prompted Mugabe to take drastic measures to stay in power.As the economy continued to worsen, Mugabe gave his blessing to roving bands of so-called war veterans to embark on often violent seizures of hundreds of white-owned farms they claimed had been stolen by settlers.Mugabe called the land battle \"The Third Chimurenga,\" deliberately linking the farm seizure program to Zimbabwe's struggle against colonial rule.Many of the farms were turned over to Mugabe's cronies, who subsequently did not harvest the land, further contributing to Zimbabwe's economic collapse. International aid and foreign investment dried up in the wake of the land-seizure program, and the US and European Union imposed economic sanctions on the country. In the following years, his government charged the MDC's leader Tsvangirai with treason and passed increasingly tough laws aimed at stifling the independent media and public dissent.In 2007, the University of Edinburgh withdrew the honorary degree it awarded Mugabe in 1984 for his services to education in Africa. In 2008, the UK stripped him of his 1994 knighthood and the University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees revoked the honorary law degree it gave to Mugabe in 1986.But at elections marred by deadly violence and accusations of vote rigging in 2008, Mugabe was forced to concede some of his power. The MDC won a majority of seats in the parliamentary vote, claiming also that Tsvangirai had secured more than 50% of the presidential votes as well. How Zimbabwe became world's most expensive place to fuel a carMugabe claimed victory, but he was forced to hold talks to resolve the ongoing political dispute. Tsvangirai accepted the post of prime minister in a power-sharing deal negotiated by South Africa -- though claims of ZANU-PF harassment and violence against opposition politicians persist to the present.Despite Zimbabwe's deepening economic crisis, Mugabe continually rebuffed calls to step down, insisting he would leave office only when his \"revolution\" was complete. That, he said, meant until the end of his days on earth: \"Only God who appointed me will remove me -- not the MDC, not the British.\"He focused his ire on the economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union, which he said were \"unjustified\" and \"illegal\" and intended to bring about regime change.In 2010, he was nominated by his party to run for the presidency again. However, the 86-year old was reportedly making regular trips to Singapore for medical treatment. Despite this, Mugabe, appearing as politically strong as ever, was re-elected with a solid majority in 2013, ending the power-sharing agreement signed in 2008. Tsvangirai alleged widespread fraud.However, in 2014 signs of dissent emerged among his loyalists. Mugabe fired his deputy Joice Mujuru, a few hours after she dismissed allegations that she'd plotted to assassinate Mugabe as \"ridiculous\". Zimbabwe's Chief Secretary to the Cabinet Misheck Sibanda said that Mugabe also fired eight Cabinet ministers.'He focused on himself'On November 7, 2017, Mugabe finally came unstuck when he fired Mnangagwa in a move to clear the way for his ambitious wife.  A week later, Zimbabwe's military leaders seized control, placing Mugabe under house arrest and deploying armored vehicles to the streets of the capital, Harare. On November 21, 2017,  Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe's president after 37 years of autocratic rule.In his \"retirement,\" Mugabe was rarely seen in public, instead spending his time between Singapore, where he received medical treatment, and his plush 25-room Blue House residence in Harare.Robert Mugabe resigns after 37 years as Zimbabwe's leaderSightings of his wife, nicknamed \"Gucci Grace\" for her love of designer goods, became similarly scarce. The couple were criticized for their luxury lifestyles as the country was plunged into economic ruin. He celebrated his 85th birthday with an opulent party that cost a reported $250,000 and continued to hold such birthday events annually, last year spending a reported $800,000 and celebrating in a region suffering drought and food shortages.He repeatedly rebuffed repeated calls to step down, insisting he would only leave office when his \"revolution\" was complete.\"This is a man who had so much to offer to Zimbabweans, but he didn't, he focused on himself,\" said Trevor Ncube, one of the country's most powerful publishers.Journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault contributed to this report",

But now, at the age of 93, President Robert Mugabe is witnessing his rule's historic end.Mugabe had been teetering on the brink of political ruin since the country's military seized power in the capital Harare, on Wednesday. It was the most serious attempt to overthrow the leader since he came to power 37 years ago.Tiring of his political overreach, members of his own party turned against him after he dismissed Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa to make way for his ambitious wife Grace.The veteran leader will be remembered for waging a campaign of fear, oppression and violence in a bid to maintain power, and for leading a country once called the breadbasket of southern Africa into poverty. The descent into tyranny didn't take long.Read MoreMugabe began his political career as the hope of his country, a leader in Zimbabwe's fight for independence and a figure regularly compared to South Africa's venerated freedom fighter Nelson Mandela. As a revolutionary guerrilla leader, Mugabe fought white-minority rule and spent years in jail as a political prisoner. After 10 years in prison in his country -- then known as Rhodesia -- he earned university degrees in education, economics and law from the University of London. In the mid-70s, he took on the leadership of the political wing of the militant liberation movement, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), based in Mozambique.Robert Mugabe  Fast FactsFrom there, he helped orchestrate an armed resistance, emerging as a war hero both at home and abroad when the conflict ended in 1979. He became the first prime minister of the newly independent Zimbabwe after elections in February 1980.Articulate and smartly dressed, Mugabe came to power commanding the respect of a nation. He had a strong head start, inheriting a country with a stable economy, solid infrastructure and vast natural resources. As former US diplomat Samantha Power wrote in 2003: \"Mugabe knew that whites drove the economy, and he was pragmatic.\" Under his leadership Zimbabwe modernized, she noted. \"It had a network of paved roads, four airports, and ... a rigorous and inclusive education system.\" But by 1983, it became clear that his administration would be merciless to any opposing his rule. He presided over forces that carried out a string of massacres in opposition strongholds. The country's Fifth Brigade is believed to have killed up to 20,000 people, mostly supporters of Mugabe's main political rival.In 1987, Mugabe's grip on power tightened when a new constitution replaced the office of prime minister with an executive president. He's the only person to have ever held that office.JUST WATCHEDMugabe's rival speaks about electionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMugabe's rival speaks about election 05:32Land acquisition and more power grabsHeading into the 1990s, Zimbabwe had the continent's fastest growing economy and was a leader in education and literacy rates. Mugabe was reelected by a popular majority in 1990, and found more ways to cement his rule, including revising the constitution to extend the president's term to six years. Zimbabweans then began experiencing a gradual erosion of their rights -- and their riches. A 1992 law allowed the government to purchase land by force from white landowners who were expelled if they objected. The land was resettled and redistributed to black Zimbabweans.The law prompted an exodus in the tens of thousands and a downward spiral in the economy led to hyperinflation. At the peak of the crisis, prices were doubling every 24 hours and monthly inflation peaked at 7.9 billion percent in 2008, Cato Institute economists estimate.JUST WATCHEDAnti-government protests on the rise in ZimbabweReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAnti-government protests on the rise in Zimbabwe 03:10Mugabe was widely accused of rigging elections to keep winning office. In March 1996, he was reelected in what essentially became a one-man race, with opponents dropping out before the vote. Voters turn on MugabeIn 2000, Mugabe and his ruling Zanu-PF party suffered their first ever major defeat. Voters rejected a new constitution that would have allowed the government to seize property owned by white descendants of predominately British settlers without paying them compensation. In the period that followed, some 4,000 farmers and landowners were forcibly displaced, and the great majority of the land was given not to poor black farmers, but officials and party members loyal to Mugabe and his family, who had no experience in running farms. The breadbasket of Africa suddenly stopped producing. Large-scale commercial agriculture, which at one point accounted for upwards of 40% of the country's export economy, was replaced in the most part by sustenance farming. Exports dropped off and malnourishment swept the country. The World Food Program and foreign aid agencies stepped in to feed millions of Zimbabweans, while international aid and foreign investment dried up. The United States and European Union imposed economic sanctions on the country.JUST WATCHEDChristiane Amanpour & Robert Mugabe 2009 ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChristiane Amanpour & Robert Mugabe 2009  23:41In a 2009 interview with CNN, Mugabe insisted that land reform was \"the best thing (that) could have ever happened to an African country.\"\"Zimbabwe belongs to the Zimbabweans, pure and simple,\" Mugabe said. He argued that white Zimbabweans, even those born in the country with legal ownership of the land, had a debt to pay. In 2002, the US and EU imposed targeted sanctions on Mugabe and some senior Zanu-PF party members after widespread reports of human rights violations.A new contenderMugabe faced the first formidable challenge to his rule in 2002 with the rise of opposition MDC party leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Mugabe managed to secure 57% of the vote compared to Tsvangirai's 42%, but the election was widely condemned as rigged.In the years that followed, Mugabe sought to stamp out the opposition. His government charged Tsvangirai with treason, and passed increasingly tough laws aimed at stifling independent media and public dissent. Despite the country's worst famine in 60 years, he issued orders to white farmers to stop working their land and vacate, enforcing the redistribution of land from whites to blacks.

In 2003, Mugabe withdrew Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, the 52-nation organization of Great Britain and her former colonies. Human rights groups accused Mugabe's regime of using starvation as a tool for domestic support. In response, he initiated a \"look east\" policy, forging closer ties with the country's old ally China, securing lucrative investment and trade contracts. By 2008 the West had well and truly turned against Mugabe, with major institutions stripping him of his honorary degrees and a knighthood. Election fraud, violence and arrests forced Tsvangirai to drop out of the race that year. Mugabe, the sole candidate, won his sixth term in office. He later signed a power-sharing deal with Tsvangirai, who became prime minister and brought about an end to months of unrest.A year later, Mugabe celebrated his 85th birthday with a lavish party that cost a reported $250,000, even as the country remained in an economic and health crisis. He continued to hold such birthday events annually, last year spending a reported $800,000 and celebrating in a region suffering drought and food shortages. He rebuffed repeated calls to step down, insisting he would only leave office when his \"revolution\" was complete. \"Only God who appointed me will remove me,\" he infamously said, \"not the MDC, not the British.\"Zimbabwe political crisis: What's happening?Mugabe attempted to blame international sanctions for his countries economic woes, telling CNN that they were unjustified and illegal.\"The continued imperialist interference in our affairs is affecting our country adversely,\" he said at the time.In 2010, he threatened to seize all Western-owned investments in Zimbabwe unless the sanctions on him and his loyalists were removed. He won yet another election in 2013, his opponents eventually dropping a challenge to the result in court. A year later, he fired eight members of his Cabinet as well as his deputy at the time. US President Barack Obama extended sanctions on Mugabe and his inner circle for another year before leaving office in January.  In recent years Mugabe had given his second wife, Grace, a greater role in the country's political affairs. She was considered a leading candidate to fill the role of vice president after Mugabe fired Mnangagwa earlier this month. Now, Zimbabweans are nervously awaiting the post-Mugabe era. Importantly, the likely successor -- Mnangagwa -- represents the old guard from which Mugabe emerged, and some fear a victory for him will have the country pass from one tyrant's hands into the hands of another.Are you in Zimbabwe?

She was also six months pregnant. Syed gave her a $20 tip, expressed her outrage at the man's behavior and offered to contact the police. Hours later -- and still fuming -- Syed posted about the incident earlier this month on her Facebook page and got a huge response.That gave her an idea. She asked her thousands of Facebook friends and followers if they'd be interested in sending \"$5 or (whatever)\" to her Venmo or Cash App and she'd figure out a way to get the money to Bryanna. Read MoreDonations poured in. \"I used to work retail and this story has me shaking mad,\" one woman replied on the post, after donating.  A few days after the incident, Bryanna said her manager told her the woman who witnessed the incident was trying to get in touch with her. They eventually connected. \"(Feroza) was like ...'I have a surprise for you and I really want to give it to you in person' so I sent her my address,\" Bryanna told CNN, asking that her last name not be included. \"She gave me the envelope and I couldn't do nothing but cry because I wasn't expecting that.\" Bryanna receives a card from those moved by her story shared on FacebookInside the envelope was $1,700 in donations from people who saw Bryanna's story on Facebook and, as Syed said, wanted to \"put a smile on her face and show her not all humans are horrible.\"\"A large portion of the donations were $5, $10, $20 and that totaled up to a large sum of money,\" Syed said. In a follow-up post, Syed shared Bryanna's Cash App handle so others could donate directly to the soon-to-be mother and even helped set up an online baby registry at Target.\"She has been a blessing,\" Bryanna said of Syed. \"There's still some good people out there.\" Syed said she didn't do anything special: \"I just saw somebody being mistreated and I didn't like what I saw.\"\"Doing the right thing inspires others to do the right thing and what I keep learning again and again and again is when you see something like this or any situation where someone is being mistreated or harmed ... all it takes is one person to change the narrative,\" she said. And that lesson is particularly important during the Covid-19 pandemic.\"When we talk about how to give back to our essential workers who put their lives on the line feeding, housing, shopping and providing health care for us -- remember that anyone can do what I did,\" she wrote.",

Yet his rise from obscurity to president wasn't all on the up and up. Getting the Republican Party's nomination in 1860 and then defeating Democrat Stephen Douglas involved some sly political moves by Lincoln's team.Here's a look at some lesser known facts about this larger-than-life leader:He wasn't above 'dirty politics'Lincoln's 1858 Senate race against Douglas was dirty: Douglas even encouraged votes by providing liquor to those who supported him.

Ahead of the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's campaign team, led by Judge David Davis, met with delegation leaders, sometimes promising Cabinet-level positions in exchange for support for Lincoln.  \"They worked their way into every nook, cranny and snook-filled hall they could,\" said Allen Guelzo, author of several books on Lincoln and a professor at Gettysburg College.Lincoln's campaign aides even printed out 5,000 counterfeit tickets to the Republican convention to pack the halls with his supporters.\"Make no mistake, Abraham Lincoln was chief political strategist: He relied on his aides maybe sometimes to do the dirty work, to be ruthless, to cut deals, but he was the lead dog,\" said David Plouffe, President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2008.He contemplated sending freed slaves back to AfricaLincoln was firmly against slavery -- yet his position on what should happen to freed slaves wasn't so clear. \"The problem arises with the next question: What do you do with slavery, given that it's unjust?\" historian and author Eric Foner told NPR. \"Lincoln took a very long time to try to figure out exactly what steps ought to be taken.\"JUST WATCHEDWhy Lincoln ended slavery ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhy Lincoln ended slavery  01:22He wavered on his views of what should be done with freed slaves. Even his historic Emancipation Proclamation, which he delivered as President in 1863, stopped short of granting citizenship or any other rights to African-Americans -- stating only that freed slaves should be paid \"reasonable wages\" for their work and should be allowed to serve in the U.S. military.   \"Lincoln does not really see black people as an intrinsic part of American society,\" said Foner, who outlined Lincoln's evolving views on slavery in his book \"The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.\"\"They are kind of an alien group who have been uprooted from their own society and unjustly brought across the ocean. 'Send them back to Africa,' he says (in an 1854 speech). And this was not an unusual position at this time.\"As a candidate for Senate in 1858, Lincoln stated during his fourth debate with Douglas, \"I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races.\"But his views evolved over time. And Foner said that the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in 10 rebellious Southern states, \"completely repudiates all of those previous ideas for Lincoln.\" He ran for the U.S. Senate twice -- and lost both timesIf you thought Lincoln was a U.S. senator before he got to the White House -- well, you're not the only one.  Lincoln served in the Illinois House of Representatives for four terms before seeking higher office. After a single term in the U.S. House, he first ran for a Senate seat in 1845 -- a race he lost by five votes.JUST WATCHEDDouglas accuses Lincoln of 'race hate'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDouglas accuses Lincoln of 'race hate' 01:19Despite his clear victory over political rival Douglas in the famed debates of 1858, he also lost that Senate race to Douglas.  Word got around about the passionate politician and his powerful anti-slavery speeches at those debates. \"Newspapers across the country that had begun reporting the debates in August in order to cover Douglas ended in November by featuring Lincoln,\" Guelzo wrote. \"Lincoln gained a national reputation that it would have been impossible to acquire in any other way.\"Lincoln was invited to speak at a Republican event in New York's Cooper Union in February 1860 -- and delivered an impressive speech that Holzer noted \"dramatically catapulted (him) toward the White House.\"  With his star on the rise, Lincoln still smarted from his Senate losses. In 1859 he told a fellow Illinois congressman, \"I would rather have a full term in the Senate than in the presidency.\" He most likely suffered from clinical depressionJoshua Wolf Shenk, author of \"Lincoln's Melancholy,\" analyzed the work of historians who reviewed the original accounts of the men and women who knew Lincoln the best.  These scholars surmised that Lincoln's widely reported \"melancholy\" had all the signs of the three major stages of depression: fear, engagement and transcendence.\"He often wept in public and recited maudlin poetry,\" Shenk wrote in The Atlantic. \"He told jokes and stories at odd times -- he needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. \"As a young man he talked more than once of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God.\"He was aware of an assassination plot against himFour years before John Wilkes Booth famously shot and killed Lincoln on April 14, 1865, the newly elected U.S. leader was fully aware his political enemies had been plotting his death. Those entrusted with his security had tried to persuade Lincoln to reschedule a multicity train tour leading up to his March 1861 inauguration in Washington.JUST WATCHEDAn actor, a president and the crime of the 19th centuryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAn actor, a president and the crime of the 19th century 02:39A detective hired by the railway \"told Lincoln in blunt terms that if he kept to the published schedule, 'an assault of some kind would be made upon his person with a view to taking his life,' \" Daniel Stashower wrote in Smithsonian Magazine.Lincoln even hinted at his awareness of this danger during a speech at Philadelphia's Independence Hall in February 1861 as he tried in vain to prevent a civil war:\"If this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle (of liberty, outlined by the Declaration of Independence), I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it.\"Lincoln agreed to continue his journey in an unmarked train car.

Defense of its ideals was an obligation,\" Glenn wrote in his memoir. \"The opportunity to join in its quests and explorations was a challenge not only to fulfill a sacred duty but to join a joyous adventure.\"Glenn developed a fascination with flying at an early age. When he was 8 years old, he and his father went for a ride in an open-cockpit biplane, two years after Charles Lindbergh made his transatlantic flight. That adventure sealed his destiny as a pilot.He also developed an early love for childhood playmate Anna Margaret Castor. By the time they got to high school, they were sweethearts. Both were in Muskingum College in New Concord, his mother's alma mater, when Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. A short time later, Glenn enrolled in the Naval Aviation Cadet Program and graduated the following March. He joined the Marine Corps in early 1943 and wed his childhood sweetheart on April 6 of that year.John Glenn's true heroGlenn flew 149 combat missions in World War II and the Korean War. In the final nine days of the Korean War, Glenn shot down three MiG fighter jets along the Yalu River. His military service earned him numerous awards, including six Distinguished Flying Crosses. After Korea, Glenn became a test pilot for naval and Marine aircraft and, in 1957, set the transcontinental air speed record.  He flew a Vought F-8 Crusader from Los Angeles to New York in three hours and 23 minutes -- the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed. With that feat, Glenn became known as one of the top test pilots in the United States and a natural candidate for the country's emerging space program.People we've lost in 2016 'The Right Stuff'He eagerly volunteered when NASA requested pilots for its suborbital and orbital programs, and in 1959 he and six others -- Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, Scott Carpenter, Wally Schirra, Gordon Cooper and Deke Slayton -- were selected as the first astronauts, known as the \"Mercury 7.\" Glenn was the last living member of the group. The men instantly became national heroes and media sensations.   On February 20, 1962, Glenn rode an Atlas rocket into history as the first American to orbit the Earth. He was the third American in space, behind Shepard and Grissom -- whose missions aboard smaller Redstone rockets were short suborbital flights. The Soviet Union by that time had sent two cosmonauts, Yuri Gagarin and Gherman Titov, on orbital flights.After making three orbits in four hours and 55 minutes, Glenn landed in the waters off Grand Turk Island in the Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles southeast of Bermuda, where he and his Friendship 7 were retrieved by the destroyer USS Noa.Saddened by the loss of my former astronaut colleague John Glenn. Was very honored to have known him. #Godspeed, John Glenn. pic.twitter.com/IRKGJNqYJQ\u2014 Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) December 8, 2016\nGlenn recalled in a Life magazine article a strange phenomenon that occurred during the mission: \"There, spread out as far as I could see were literally thousands of tiny luminous objects that glowed in the black sky like fireflies. I was riding slowly through them, and the sensation was like walking backwards through a pasture where someone had waved a wand and made all the fireflies stop right where they were and glow steadily.\"The flight also featured a glitch that contributed to Glenn's reputation for being cool under fire.Because of an indicator light showing that the Mercury capsule's heat shield was partly detached, mission controllers decided to bring Glenn home early and told him not to jettison his aft retro rockets, which allowed him to maneuver the craft in space. Because the retropack was strapped to the heat shield, it was thought it would provide an extra measure of security.It would later be learned that the heat shield wasn't damaged, but the fiery re-entry was made more spectacular by the scorching retropack in Earth's upper atmosphere. Glenn's first words when he stepped aboard the deck of the USS Noa were, \"Boy, that was a real fireball of a ride!\"Later in life, Glenn poked fun at the risk. \"We used to joke about it in the past when people would say, 'What do you think on the launch pad?' \" he said in a 1998 CNN interview.  \"And the standard answer was, 'How do you think you'd feel if you knew you were on top of 2 million parts built by the lowest bidder on a government contract?' \"Glenn's mission was more than just a round-the-world space journey. It was a psychological boost to a nation worried about the Soviet Union's early lead in the space race.Shortly after landing, Glenn was honored with an enormous ticker tape parade in New York City on March 1, 1962. An estimated 4 million people turned out.His success bolstered America's spirit and gave credence to President John Kennedy's 1961 pledge to put men on the moon. But Glenn would not be one of them.Kennedy reportedly ordered NASA not to fly Glenn again because he was too valuable as a national figure. Glenn resigned from the space agency in January 1964.Political careerGlenn's fame made him a natural candidate for political office, and shortly after his resignation from NASA, he announced he would run for the Democratic ticket for a US Senate seat in 1964.  But his political career was sidelined for a few years when an injury forced him to withdraw from the campaign. Glenn then joined Royal Crown Cola as a vice president and later as president. Yet he remained interested in politics. He was also a close friend of the Kennedy family. On June 5, 1968, Glenn was with Sen. Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, hours before Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan. Kennedy died the next day.\"Who knows what might have happened if Bobby had been president,\" Glenn reflected shortly after his 90th birthday, in a 2011 interview with the Dayton Daily News. \"I know he had just about more compassion for the underdog, for the poor, the downtrodden than, I think, just about anybody that I ever knew.\" After a failed bid for a US Senate seat in 1970, Glenn won in 1974, beginning a 24-year career representing Ohio on Capitol Hill. He was widely regarded as an effective legislator and moderate Democrat. He played a key role in weapons control, authoring the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, which prohibited the sale of nuclear equipment to nations that currently have none.Glenn -- along with fellow Mercury 7 astronauts Grissom and Shepard -- was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978 by then-President Jimmy Carter.More than 20 years after their historic missions, the team was immortalized in the 1983 movie \"The Right Stuff.\" Glenn -- portrayed by Ed Harris -- didn't care much for the film, saying, \"I thought it was dramatic enough without Hollywood doing its number on it.\"Despite his rock-solid reputation as an American icon, not everything went perfectly for Glenn. In 1984, he decided to run for president, confidently declaring, \"With the nomination of my party I firmly believe I can beat Ronald Reagan.\"He was knocked out of the primaries early on.A return to spaceJohn Glenn's true heroAs he grew older, Glenn never gave up his dream of flying in space again or, as he called it in the Mercury days, being \"a willing guinea pig.\"  At age 77, a year after retiring from the Senate, Glenn accepted an invitation from NASA to rejoin the space program as a member of space shuttle Discovery on a nine-day mission to study the aging process, which mirrors what astronauts experience during long durations in space.On October 29, 1998, Glenn became the oldest human ever to venture into space, and his flight proved once again that he was a man who embraced a challenge. For most men and women, fame is fleeting and greatness is short-lived. For John Herschel Glenn Jr., it lasted a lifetime.Glenn is survived by his wife of 73 years, Annie; his two children, John David and Carolyn Ann (Lyn); and two grandchildren.",

        "content": "Story highlightsThree peace activists face trial this week for breaching a nuclear weapons siteThe incident last year took place at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, TennesseeIf convicted, they could face 20 years in prisonWhen an elderly nun and two fellow peace activists walked undetected onto one of the nation's most secure nuclear facilities last year, they wanted to call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons.  Yet their actions in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, triggered a very different concern:  If three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto the Y-12 National Security Complex -- once considered the \"Fort Knox\" for highly enriched uranium -- just how safe are the nation's nuclear weapons facilities from terrorists?Nuclear weapons interactive: Who has what?Sister Megan Rice, 83; Greg Boertje-Obed, 57; and Michael Walli, 63, will stand trial this week on federal charges of destroying U.S. government property, depredation against federal property exceeding $1,000, trespassing and injuring national-defense premises. The three activists are accused of defacing property at the Oak Ridge nuclear facility.The last charge alone carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The trial began Tuesday at federal court in Knoxville, Tennessee, according to WATE, CNN's affiliate in Knoxville.In the predawn hours of July 28, 2012, Rice, Boertje-Obed and Walli walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside, approaching a chain-link fence surrounding the Oak Ridge nuclear facility.Armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter, they cut their way through the fence, fully expecting to be arrested on the spot.Instead, they walked nearly a mile, cutting through four fences in all, breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country.\"When we got to the very high security fence where there's a lethal force authorized ... I thought, maybe we should turn around,\" Boertje-Obed told CNN's David Mattingly.But they didn't.  Hours later, the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners, spray-painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium. Since the incident, Congress has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs Y-12 and seven other nuclear weapons sites.  Map: Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, TNMost recently, Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March that the Department of Energy has taken \"several major actions ... to improve security\" since the Y-12 breach, including management changes and independent security reviews.Today, changes at Y-12 are noticeable.  A new security contractor is in charge. New signs and security fences are going up.While last year's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at Y-12, a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the Sandia National Laboratories said he doesn't think the nation's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk.\"What these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons-grade material,\" said Michael Allen, who is now a vice provost and dean at Middle Tennessee State University.\"Once they got in, they could spray paint things, but it's just like if you got into Fort Knox, you wouldn't know the combination to the locks.\"Allen said the country's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites around the country that are \"usually out in the middle of nowhere\" to protect against threats.

        "content": "Story highlightsNorth Korea has declared the United States a \"sworn enemy\"But recently, American dignitaries have been welcomed in PyongyangNorth Korea recently carried out a nuclear test that it called a new phase of confrontationIt seems North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un is carrying on his father's strange tradition:  mixing a fascination with American culture with a hatred of the United States.  Kim has made it quite clear that his country's February nuclear test marks a new phase of confrontation with the United States, which Pyongyang has described as \"the sworn enemy of the Korean people.\"Opinion: How to deal with North KoreaYet that hasn't stopped Pyongyang from welcoming a few dignitaries from this \"sworn enemy\" nation, including a top Google executive and a few basketball stars. No one knows if it's all part of an organized effort to woo North Korea into diplomacy by appealing to its leader's interest in American culture.  Yet one thing is for sure: This love-hate relationship has sparked some odd stories out of the Hermit Kingdom.  Here's a look at some of the most recent ones we've come across:JUST WATCHEDDennis Rodman's basketball diplomacyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDennis Rodman's basketball diplomacy 03:47JUST WATCHEDNorth Korean art on an epic scaleReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korean art on an epic scale 02:32JUST WATCHEDFlash Brief: North Korea nuclearReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFlash Brief: North Korea nuclear 02:34JUST WATCHEDKim Jong Un developing his legacyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKim Jong Un developing his legacy 02:491. Kim Jong Un: Dennis Rodman's new BFFIf you read the reports about former NBA star Dennis Rodman's visit to Pyongyang, you might have double-checked whether the story was just another Onion parody.   Not only did the American basketball star -- known for his over-the-top publicity stunts --  visit North Korea, but he also was joined by three members of the famed Harlem Globetrotters, who played against North Korea's \"Dream Team\" (no surprise, the game ended in a tie).  Rodman proclaimed Kim \"a friend for life,\" and appeared courtside with the North Korean leader. Not everyone was cheering this so-called \"basketball diplomacy.\" A commentary in Canada's National Post outlined North Korea's \"monstrous gulag system that Dennis Rodman will never see.\" And CNN contributor John Avlon wrote that Rodman isn't the only \"celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator.\"North Korea issues threat to U.S. military2. Google executive urges country with barely any electricity to embrace the InternetYou've probably seen that NASA satellite photo of the Korean peninsula at night, the one that shows the northern half completely dark while the southern half and the Chinese coast are fully alight.  Electricity is still a luxury in North Korea, where cold winds from nearby Siberia can plunge temperatures below freezing. But that didn't stop Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt from visiting North Korea in January as part of a delegation urging North Korea to \"make it possible for people to use the Internet.\"  While many North Koreans might be more interested in having a heated home, Schmidt and his Google colleague Jared Cohen have advocated about the Internet's ability to empower citizens living under oppressive regimes.  3. Famous Americans apparently aren't the only ones heading to PyongyangIn the wake of the Schmidt and Rodman visits, Bloomberg Businessweek looked at just how many Westerners are heading to North Korea for its closely monitored, government-run tours.  Surprisingly, it found a nearly 20% increase in visits since 2011.4. Get your North Korean education ... in TokyoThe United States isn't the only outside country that has a love-hate relationship with North Korea.  Until the end of World War II, Korea was a Japanese colony, and many Koreans were brought to Japan -- many against their will -- before Korea was divided between north and south.  More recently, North Korea admitted to kidnapping Japanese citizens from Japanese soil in the 1970s and 1980s, something Tokyo has demanded more answers about.  Despite this tense history, Japan hosts a number of North Korean-funded schools -- complete with portraits of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung and previous leader Kim Jong Il on its walls.  Students, who are mostly Japanese, say they are learning Korean culture and language, and laugh off suggestions that they're training to be spies.   5.  Dreaming of annihilating the United States, to the tune of 'We Are The World' It's no secret that North Korea's propaganda images are bizarre, at least to the non-North Korean eye. If this doesn't make sense, just search Google Images for \"North Korea propaganda.\"  Yet one video released in the run-up to North Korea's nuclear test on Pyongyang's official website still managed to raise some eyebrows.  The video -- set to the tune of \"We Are The World,\" the 1985 song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie heralding world peace -- shows a North Korean man dreaming about an apparent missile attack on the United States. \"Black smoke was billowing somewhere in America,\" the caption in Korean reads.

Pyongyang claimed it had put a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and South Korea insisted it was all a cover for testing ballistic missile technology.When the United Nations expanded sanctions as punishment, the North Korean leadership bared its teeth and vowed to conduct another nuclear test and continue experimenting with long-range rockets -- with the U.S. in mind.  READ: Seismic activity reported in area of previous North Korea nuclear testsKim Jong Un seems determined to make his own mark as leader.Far from floundering in his own inexperience, Kim has worked swiftly to consolidate his power base domestically by replacing senior figures in the military -- many loyal to his father -- with his own people.JUST WATCHEDNorth Korea conducts new nuclear testReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korea conducts new nuclear test 01:20JUST WATCHEDPyongyang threatens South KoreaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPyongyang threatens South Korea 02:51JUST WATCHEDNorth Korea leader comes of age ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNorth Korea leader comes of age  02:10JUST WATCHEDS.

Korea eyes future threats from North 04:00Whereas the elder Kim's leadership was centered around \"military first\" politics and tied to the powerful National Defense Commission, a government body, the younger Kim is returning the center of gravity for the regime back to the Party apparatus, according to Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a not-for-profit research and analysis organization.READ: Kim Jong Un tightens his gripBut some North Korea watchers believe the Swiss-educated fan of Western movies and basketball lacks the absolute power enjoyed by his father and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea.\"I believe he is in overall control of the Korea Workers Party, the military, and the state -- but with the help of his uncle, Jang Sung-taek, and his family confident, Choe Ryong Hae, chief of the general political bureau of the Korea People's Army,\" said Chung-in Moon, Professor of Political Science at Yonsei University in South Korea.READ: South Koreans cast wary eyes North\"Whereas his father Kim Jong Il had the absolute consolidation of power base and direct full control of the Party, the military, and the state, his son Kim Jong Un seems to reign than rule.\" Moon added that his aunt, Kim Kyung-hee, is the other main influence on the younger Kim.However, the 20-something leader has a very different style to his father, demonstrating a softer, seemingly personable side. In the last 12 months, the world was introduced to his wife during a number of high-profile public appearances, something that never happened during his father's reign.  In one memorable scene last year, a visibly relaxed and smiling Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, were filmed taking in the attractions at an amusement park outside the capital.He has also shown a willingness to speak publicly, even acknowledging the suffering of his own people during one speech in April last year. \"Our Party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism,\" Kim told a crowd of thousands at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang.READ: North Korea 'targets' United StatesHis father is believed to have made only one brief broadcast while in charge.\"Kim Jong Un basically grew up on Google and his father grew up on letters and stamps,\" said Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group.\"It's a new era and Kim Jong Un realizes the more he can kind of shape the narrative to the international community, the more it is to his benefit in terms of getting security and money and everything else that he wants for his country.\"But despite signs Kim could be someone the world can do business with, the recent aggressive posturing and rhetoric emanating from Pyongyang suggest otherwise -- with the country's leadership seemingly united.READ: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke\"As far as regime and national security is concerned, there is a unity between hardliners and moderates,\" said Moon.  \"The North Korean leadership does not think that their behavior is aggressive. For example, launching a rocket for peaceful use in space is, they believe, their sovereign right.  And any aggressive behavior such as the third nuclear test is a rightful reaction to unfair and unjust punishment by the U.S. and the U.N.  \"There seems to be a huge perception gap.\"Meanwhile, little is changing for the people of North Korea. Aid groups say malnutrition is still rampant in the countryside where citizens lack access to safe water and sanitation.According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of thousands of people remain enslaved in prison camps which are \"notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse.\" The rights group also claims that on taking power Kim's new government gave shoot-on-sight orders to border guards to stop citizens fleeing to China.",

        "content": "Story highlightsSamuel Mullet Sr. is accused of orchestrating beard-cutting attacksMullet and 15 others faces hate crimes trial in federal courtTo the Amish, a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhoodFederal prosecutors are expected to argue that an Amish sect leader, accused of orchestrating beard-cutting attacks against fellow Amish men, was operating a cult out of his family compound in rural Ohio.The sect leader, Samuel Mullet Sr., is one of 16  Amish men and women charged with federal hate crimes in the beard-cutting attacks last year.  The trial began Monday with jury selection in federal court in Cleveland. Mullet and several of his sons, who were arrested in December, are among those on trial.To the Amish, a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhood.  Prosecutors have said the accused men and women, all members of Mullet's breakaway Amish sect, planned and carried out the attacks \"on their perceived religious enemies\" under Mullet's orders. CNN has sought a response from Mullet's attorney, Edward Bryan. Bryan has disputed the prosecution's characterization of his client, according to The Cleveland Plain Dealer.Previously on CNN.com: 3 Amish men accused of cutting hair, beards of others \"They're trying to create this perception he's something he's not,\" Bryan told the newspaper. \"He's not a wacky cult leader. He's a decent, hardworking, caring man.\" According to witnesses cited in a federal affidavit, Mullet \"forced extreme punishments\" on anyone in his community who defied him, \"including forcing members to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop on his property.\" In addition, the affidavit alleges that, as the bishop of an Amish clan in Bergholz, Ohio, Mullet had \"acts of sexual intimacy\" with married women as part of \"counseling\" to \"cleanse them of the devil.\"If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison, according to CNN affiliate WOIO-TV in Cleveland.Usually, the Amish resolve disputes without involving law enforcement, but concerns that Mullet is operating a cult on his compound prompted some Amish members to report the beard-cutting incidents to police last fall.Amish man Myron Miller was held down by men armed with scissors and battery-powered clippers who cut off a chunk of his beard, according to a police report.  Arlene Miller said she and her husband decided to report the cutting to police in hopes of preventing other people from being hurt, including Mullet's followers, who \"need help,\" she told CNN.From left, Daniel Mullet, Johnny Mullet, Lester Mullet, Eli Miller and Levi Miller are among those on trial.\"There's a lot of lives being messed up down there. There's a lot of people being abused and brainwashed,\" Arlene Miller said.The Millers said fear of reprisal attacks prompted them and other Amish residents in rural eastern Ohio to lock their doors at night -- something unheard of in Amish communities.Mullet's sect is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around an 800-acre compound in a remote valley outside Bergholz, according to Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla.Prosecutors have said Mullet \"exerted control over the Bergholz community by taking the wives of other men into his home, and by overseeing various means of disciplining community members, including corporal punishment.\"  Those accusations could play a key part in the trial against Mullet and his co-defendants. Last week, a federal judge ruled that witnesses can testify about Mullet's alleged sexual activities at his compound in Bergholz, according to The Plain Dealer.When reports of the beard-cutting attacks first surfaced last fall, they uncovered an ongoing split between Mullet's sect and the larger Amish community in and around Bergholz, many of whom believe that Mullet is creating rules and punishments that do not fit with the broader Amish belief system.

He married Mullet's daughter, Wilma, and the couple had two daughters. Concerned about the way Mullet was \"ruling\" his followers, Troyer said he started making arrangements to move his wife and children out of the group.Not long after, Troyer said, Mullet began interfering with their marriage. Troyer said Mullet would ask women, including his wife, \"about their sexual relationships with their husbands.\"\"That's very atypical behavior for Amish to do that,\" Troyer said. \"It's unheard of.\"He said, \"In the Amish community, no one has jurisdiction over what goes on between a husband and wife.

        "content": "Tokyo (CNN)Japan has backed its condemnation of war in Ukraine with sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs, but experts say they're not the only audience for Tokyo's outrage -- China is meant to get the message, too. Since Moscow attacked Ukraine, commentators have drawn comparisons between Russia's actions and China's stated ambition to seek the \"reunification\" of Taiwan with the mainland. The \"what if\" scenario has not been lost on Japanese leaders. In the first days of the invasion, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was quick to frame the Ukraine crisis as a global issue. \"This is a very serious situation which doesn't just affect Europe, but also Asia and the whole world order,\" he told reporters.And the Japanese public seem to be in lockstep with his views. In a country typically more focused on domestic issues, the war is dominating news coverage. Thousands of anti-war protesters have taken to the streets of cities nationwide, and a recent poll shows that over 80% of the 1,063 people surveyed support Japan's economic sanctions against Russia. For Japan, support for Ukraine serves a dual purpose, according to Yoko Iwama, an international relations and security expert at the National Graduate Institute of Policy Studies. Read More\"The purpose of Japan's response is to send a message that we will be ready and we will resist if there's an invasion (of Japanese territory), that we will not allow the borders to be changed by force,\" said Iwama.\"We don't want a real war, the objective is political -- that China is persuaded from an aggressive act like the one that Putin has taken in the last several days and weeks.\"It's against that backdrop that Japan's former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, raised a previously unthinkable suggestion during an interview three days after the Russian invasion.Abe, still an influential figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, floated the idea of Japan entering a NATO-like nuclear weapons sharing program -- hosting US nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. It was a shocking proposal for country that suffered the devastating impact of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II -- but one Abe says should no longer be taboo. Different times, changing tacticsJapan's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine differs markedly to its actions after Moscow's attack on Crimea in 2014. Then, under Abe, Japan was called out for being too slow to act. Now its strategy is different -- and the urgency arguably greater. Back in 2014, Abe adopted the tactic of pulling Russia closer to prevent it tightening ties with China, said James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. Russia had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by sending in armed forces to take over key facilities and foment a separatist rebellion that rumbled on for eight years. Tokyo initially treated Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region as a Western issue, according to Sheila Smith, a senior fellow for Asia-Pacific studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.\"(The Japanese government) treated it a little bit like an issue for the Europeans and Americans to deal with; that it wasn't really about Japan, but that they'd go along with it,\" Smith said.She said Abe harbored hopes that Russian leader Vladimir Putin would sign on to the normalization of Russia-Japan ties or a full peace treaty formally ending hostilities dating back to World War II.But Japan's softer stance against Russia drew international criticism, and Tokyo eventually joined its Western allies in imposing sanctions on Russia, including diplomatic measures consisting of suspending talks related to easing visa requirements, a travel ban and the freezing of certain individuals' assets.However, this year the scale and horror of the crisis unfolding in Ukraine has prompted Japan to push a consistent message of unity with its G7 partners to show it's a \"trustworthy partner,\" according to Brown, from Temple University.\"You hear time and time again, the government say -- 'and alongside our G7 and other international partners, we will coordinate in taking a tough response on this issue' -- they don't want to be seen as out of step,\" Brown said.Japan needs G7 support -- particularly from the US -- to contain any move from Beijing on Taiwan, the island which China claims as its territory despite having never governed it.  So last week, Japan added even more sanctions against Russia and Belarus -- freezing the assets of an additional 32 Russian and Belarusian officials and oligarchs. And in a rare move, it also reviewed its guidelines on the transfer of defense equipment overseas, paving the way for the transport of bulletproof vests and helmets to Ukraine. Tokyo has also joined the push to cut Russia from the SWIFT banking system and has frozen Russian leader Vladimir Putin's assets. Experts says Japan wants to keep in step with its international allies in the face of the unfolding human tragedy and China's growing military might.'Sense of urgency' For decades after World War II, Japan's pacifist constitution prevented it from building up its military strength. Article 9 of the document said that \"land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential will never be maintained.\"But in recent years, the country has signaled a move towards greater military spending, and last December Prime Minister Kishida announced the government was exploring options to give it the capability to strike enemy bases.China is considered a major threat, but the combined strength of Russia and China has put Japan under considerable pressure.Last year, the two countries conducted what was billed as the first joint China-Russia naval patrol in the western Pacific. Vessels sailed through the Tsugaru Strait that separates Japan's main island and its northern island of Hokkaido, before heading down the nation's eastern coast and then back toward China through the Osumi Strait off the southern Japanese island of Kyushu.Russia's attack on Ukraine reveals political fault lines in AsiaForeign vessels are permitted to sail through the Osumi and Tsugaru straits -- both international waters -- but Japan closely monitored the maneuvers, which the country's Defense Department called \"unusual.\"Japan's Ministry of Defense said on Friday that 10 Russian Navy vessels, including a frigate, had sailed through the Tsugaru Strait the previous day, toward the Sea of \u200b\u200bJapan.Japan has territorial disputes with both China and Russia. Last year, Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi told CNN the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China, are unquestionably Japanese territory and would be defended as such. Japan also contests Russia's claim to the Kuril Islands, an island chain off Hokkaido.And then there's Taiwan, which sits to the south in waters used to ferry 90% of Japan oil supplies. Last year, Japan approved a record defense budget for 2022 of 5.4 trillion yen ($47.2 billion), which exceeded 1 percent of its GDP. Some say the Ukraine crisis on top of local security considerations shows it needs to commit even more. Breaking down taboosBut extra defense funding is just one aspect of Japan's armor against an escalation of regional tensions. Last month, Abe has used his position as former leader to raise another even more controversial prospect -- the idea of hosting US nuclear weapons in Japan. \"Japan is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has its three non-nuclear principles, but it's essential to understand how the world's security is maintained, and we shouldn't treat those discussions as a taboo,\" Abe told Fuji Television.Kishida immediately dismissed the suggestion, calling it \"unacceptable,\" while anti-nuclear activists were predictably outraged. Japan falls within the US nuclear umbrella but has long ruled out hosting nuclear weapons due to devastation wrought by atomic bombs dropped during World War II.When asked about Abe's comments in a regular press briefing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Japanese politicians had made \"wild comments\" that \"openly violate its own Three Non-Nuclear Principles and the obligations of a party to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).\"\"By raising nuclear sharing with the US, Japan has fully exposed the dangerous tendency of\u2002lingering militarism in the country,\" he added.In the interview, Abe also called for the US to take a more explicit position on the defense of Taiwan over whether or not it would defend the self-ruled island if Beijing were to attack.Last year, US President Joe Biden said the US would defend Taiwan if it were to come under attack from China, a comment that seemed incongruous with America's stated policy of \"strategic ambiguity.\" However, later a government official said the US was not announcing any change to its policy on Taiwan -- under the \"One China\" Policy, the US acknowledges China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.One thing is clear: Russia's attack on Ukraine has rattled the Japanese and has forced them to face questions some might otherwise avoid.\"People are asking, 'Will the United States really come in if the Chinese attack? Will the United States go to war with China?'\" said Smith, from the Council on Foreign Relations.\"These are all recent questions that have been bubbling up under the surface, based on the capabilities first of North Korea, but also China. And I think that's also being laid bare as Putin uses nuclear threats,\" she added. Journalist Yuki Kurihara contributed to this report from Tokyo.",

        "content": "Hijudai Manuvering Area, Oita, Japan (CNN)For the first time in almost 30 years, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) is conducting a massive nationwide military exercise to prepare troops for potential conflict.Since mid-September, about 100,000 personnel, 20,000 vehicles and 120 aircraft have been participating in various exercises across the country focused on operational readiness. In recent years, the Indo-Pacific regional has become a focal point of tension, with GSDF officials saying the security environment surrounding Japan is the worst it's been since the end of World War II.\"This Ground Self-Defense Force exercise is truly focused on improving operational effectiveness, deterrence and response capabilities,\" said Col. Noriko Yokota, GSDF spokesperson. \"Each unit is conducting the exercise with an eye to what is necessary to achieve this goal. They are preparing themselves so that they can respond with confidence when they are forced to take further action.\"Since mid-September, about 100,000 personnel have been participating in various drills across the country.Read MoreEarlier this week, North Korea said it had successfully test-fired a new ballistic missile from a submarine that landed in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. Meanwhile, further south, China has been ramping up pressure on Taiwan by sending military jets into its Air Defense Identification Zone.Without identifying any country by name, GSDF officials say regional powers are willing to change the status quo by force -- and one country in particular continues to develop nuclear weapons, missiles and challenge the non-proliferation system. \"The current security environment surrounding Japan is extremely severe,\" said Lt. Gen. Yuichi Togashi, Commanding General of the 2nd Division GSDF. \"We, the Self-Defense Forces, are required to enhance the effectiveness of operations.\" Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force is conducting a massive nationwide self-defense exercise.Building a defensive forceTroops from the GSDF 2nd Division in Asahikawa, Hokkaido traveled about 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) to the Hijudai Manuvering Area in Japan's Oita prefecture to perform defensive combat drills.       Since arriving in September, they've spent weeks building out logistic areas, command posts, battlefield positions and underground triage units. Some are built underground and all are covered in camouflage, making them difficult to identify.GSDF officials say the drill isn't taking place to prepare for potential conflict against in any specific region or against any particular country.But the training environment at Hijudai Manuvering Area has similar terrain to what troops would experience if war broke out in Japan's southern islands. That includes the Senkaku islands -- an uninhabited rocky island chain in the East China Sea -- administered by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing, where the islands are known as Diayou.Tensions over the uninhabited rocky chain -- 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of Tokyo but only a third of that distance from Shanghai -- have simmered for years, and claims over them date back centuries.The GSDF 2nd Division in Asahikawa, Hokkaido travelled to Hijudai Manuvering Area for the drills.Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi recently told CNN the islands are unquestionably Japanese territory and would be defended as such.\"(The) Senkaku islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory, both according to international law and looking historically,\" Kishi said. \"There is no territorial dispute relating to the Senkaku islands between Japan and other countries. Against Chinese action to Senkaku islands and other parts of the East China Sea, we have to keep sending strong message. \"As Japan's Defense Ministry and self-defense forces, we have to build up our own military capabilities as well as to respond to this situation.\"Troops training on southern islandsIn a marked departure from Japan's post-World War II pacifism, the combat training portion of the drill at the Hijudai Manuvering Area includes unscripted simulated war games.The GSDF 2nd Division was broken up into two teams to simulate invaders and defenders with the aim of taking out rival combatants and practicing first aid.Instead of live ammunition, troops on the ground are armed with simulation weapons that fire lasers. The troops' uniforms, tanks and other vehicles are all lined with sensors that notify them if they've been killed or injured by the enemy. The combat focused training portion of the drill at Hijudai Manuvering Area includes unscripted simulated wargames.In the simulated combat drill, if someone is hit, troops on the battlefield apply first aid in the field before taking the individual to a triage unit. Depending on the severity of the simulated injury, injured troops are treated and return to the battlefield or are medevacked to hospital to receive more specialized care.Other troops are being deployed for drills on Japan's southern islands -- Miyako Island, Amami Oshima, and Yonaguni Island, with the latter just 234 kilometers (145 miles) from Taiwan. \"The deployment of troops in the southwest region is a major concept of the Ground Self-Defense Force,\" Yokota said.  \"We believe that it is important for the SDF to deploy troops wherever they are needed.\"For Japan, these war games have never been more important. \"We are now aware that the security environment surrounding Japan is unprecedentedly severe,\" Yakota said.\"In this context, we, the Self-Defense Forces, are preparing for all kinds of contingencies, considering that we have to respond to all kinds of situations.\"Since Japan's GSDF was established in 1954, the force has never been involved in actual conflict -- meaning drills like this are the closest members have ever come to fighting a war. The drills end in mid-November.",

In an exclusive interview with CNN, Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu Islands in China, are unquestionably Japanese territory and would be defended as such, with Tokyo matching any Chinese threat to the islands ship for ship, and beyond if necessary.Japan has been expanding its Self-Defense Forces, adding state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets and converting warships to aircraft carriers for them. It is also building new destroyers, submarines and missiles, all the while noting its military expenditure still pales in comparison with China's increased military spending.\"Against Chinese action to Senkaku Islands and other parts of the East China Sea ... we have to demonstrate that the government of Japan is resolutely defending our territory with the greater number of Japanese coast guard vessels than that of China,\" Kishi said. \"There is no territorial dispute relating to the Senkaku Islands between Japan and other countries,\" he added. Tensions over the uninhabited rocky chain -- 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only a third of that distance from Shanghai -- have simmered for years, and claims over them date back centuries.Read MoreWhen tensions spiked over the islands in 2012, it sparked a groundswell of nationalist sentiment in China. Public protests broke out in dozens of Chinese cities, with Japanese-branded cars smashed, Japanese stores and restaurants vandalized, and debris hurled at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing.At the governmental level, China has been just as strident as Kishi is in claiming the island chain.Minamikojima, Kitakojima and Uotsuri islands, part of the five main islands in the Senkaku group in the East China Sea, on September 11, 2013.\"The Diaoyu Island and its affiliated islands are an inherent part of China's territory, and it is our inherent right to carry out patrols and law enforcement activities in these waters,\" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement last year.China has been backing its claims in the region with its ships, and by establishing new laws that give its coast guard expanded powers.According to Japanese authorities, Chinese Coast Guard vessels have ventured into Japanese territorial waters, or within 12 nautical miles of Japanese land, a total of 88 times between January 1 and the end of August. While in the contiguous zone, waters between islands but not within 12 miles of shore, there have been 851 Chinese incursions.Experts say China's strategy is to put its forces in places in and around contested areas and exert Beijing's law and authority over them. Such action makes the Chinese claims seem like due course.\"Exercising coastal state rights is an important step in corroborating sovereignty through practice,\" said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King's College in London. Kishi has taken notice.China Marine Surveillance vessels (front and middle) cruise with a Japan Coast Guard ship near Kitakojima and Minamikojima of the disputed Senkaku Islands on April 23, 2013.\"There are actions that continue to challenge an integral part of Japan's sovereign territory. These actions are making it a fait accompli,\" he said.That \"integral\" Japanese territory extends even closer to another possible flashpoint in the Japan-China relationship.Taiwan's importance to JapanJapan's westernmost island is at the very end of a string of Japanese possessions paralleling the Chinese coast and extending south some 700 miles (1,125 kilometers) from the main island of Kyushu, through the military hub of Okinawa and the resort island of Ishigaki, to the tiny island of Yonaguni.With its 11 square miles of rock and population of fewer than 2,000 people, Yonaguni sits only 68 miles (110 kilometers) from Taiwan, the democratically governed island over which Beijing claims sovereignty.Taiwan and mainland China have been governed separately since the end of a civil war more than seven decades ago.Taiwanese soldiers are seen holding grenade launchers and machine guns and driving tanks, during a military exercise, in Tainan, Taiwan, on September 14, 2021. However, Beijing continues to view Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory even though the Chinese Communist Party has never governed it.China has been stepping up its military pressure on Taiwan. In June, it sent over two dozen warplanes near the island, prompting Taiwan to alert its air defenses.Chinese leader Xi Jinping says Taiwan must be brought under Beijing's control and has not ruled out the use of force in making that happen.JUST WATCHEDDramatic videos show Chinese naval exercises amid rising tensions over Taiwan (April 2021)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDramatic videos show Chinese naval exercises amid rising tensions over Taiwan (April 2021) 04:04That, said Kishi, has Tokyo in a constant state of vigilance.When Tokyo released its annual defense white paper in July, it contained its strongest language ever on Taiwan, saying \"stabilizing the situation surrounding Taiwan is important for Japan's security.\"At the time, Kishi said it should be monitored with \"a sense of crisis.\"In his interview with CNN, he gave specifics.\"What's happening in Taiwan is directly linked to Japan,\" he said, noting the island sits astride his country's \"energy lifeline.\"\"Ninety percent of energy that Japan uses is imported through the areas around Taiwan,\" Kishi said.It's a vulnerability that Tokyo has to mitigate.\"What could happen in Taiwan could likely be an issue for Japan, and in that case, Japan will have to take the necessary response to that situation,\" Kishi said, while stressing that tension should be diffused through dialogue, not violence.But Tokyo isn't just using words to back up its claims. It's also beefing up its military defenses, putting missiles and troops on Yonaguni and planning to do the same to nearby Ishigaki in the near future.\"This is to demonstrate our strong will to defend our southwestern area of Japanese territory,\" Kishi said.In that regard, Tokyo has a key ally in its corner, the United States.Tokyo and Washington share a mutual defense treaty, meaning the US is obligated to defend Japanese territory.US President Joe Biden reaffirmed that security commitment shortly after his inauguration in January, with a White House statement specifically mentioning the Senkakus.Kishi said this week that alliance is being strengthened, and in commenting on the Senkakus situation, said Washington has Tokyo's back.Carrier @HMSQNLZ, Type 45 destroyer @HMSDefender and tanker @RFATidespring were joined by Japanese ships for training in the #PacificOcean.

        "content": "Tokyo (CNN)Japanese rescue workers continued to search for survivors Tuesday, three days after a devastating \"tsunami\" of mud swept through a coastal city, killing at least four people and leaving two dozen others missing.Torrential rains triggered the powerful mudslide in Atami, Shizuoka prefecture, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Footage posted on social media showed the deluge of black water crash down a mountain and into the city, destroying homes in its path as neighbors watched on in horror. Rescue efforts were stepped up over the past three days, with police, firefighters and members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces joining the difficult and occasionally treacherous operations. An additional victim was confirmed dead Monday night bringing the death toll to four, an Atami official said, while 26 people have been rescued. The official added that 24 people remain unaccounted for. Officials previously said more than 110 people were missing. Rescue workers search for missing people at the site of a landslide on July 4, 2021 in Atami, Shizuoka, Japan.Yuji Shima, who lost his home and all of his belongings, was evacuated to his friend's home along with his wife and mother. Read More\"The mudslide looked like a tsunami -- it was like a big wave that made a thunderous noise and came crashing down onto the ground,\" Shima said. \"The ground rumbled and the electricity pylons were shaking.\"Shima added there was a \"muddy, chemical stench in the air\" as the mudslide crashed down. \"It all happened in a split-second,\" he said, adding that he prioritized his family's safety before anything else, and didn't bring any belongings with him as he fled his home. More than 130 houses were swept away in the mudslide, Atami City's Fire Disaster and Management Agency said. Officials started evacuating people Saturday. Atami has three evacuation centers. Two private hotels in Atami are also sheltering 562 people, the city official said. At a news conference on Sunday, Heita Kawakatsu, the governor of Shizuoka, said the prefecture will investigate whether the mudslide was caused due to deforesting the area, which might have reduced the ability of mountain soil to retain water. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga expressed his condolences to the victims of the landslide on Saturday and stressed that emergency workers were doing their utmost to save lives, rescue people and help with evacuations.Suga added that the heavy rain would continue to affect various parts of the country, and urged citizens to check hazard maps in their local area and pay close attention to weather updates and evacuation information.Japan is prone to landslides, averaging up to 1,500 landslides annually in the past decade -- an almost 50% increase compared to the previous 10 years, according to a 2020 Japanese government report.Flooding related disasters, like landslides, are a traditional yet serious risk to the country. This is because half of the Japanese population and 75% of the country assets are concentrated in flood-prone areas, according to experts.",

Sporting a bandana, fans, whistle and traditional Japanese costume, the IT company president is a superfan who has attended every Summer Games since Barcelona 1992. She even performs a Japanese cheer routine at each one and hopes to carry on the tradition this year.\"The purpose of my cheer activities is to share the message of love, friendship, and peace,\" said Ishikawa, who is a self-acclaimed \"international (Olympics) cheerleader.\" \"The Games are the one opportunity where we can share that with people from around the world.\"Read MoreVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, videos and featuresIshikawa might be upbeat; however, with just one month until the opening ceremony of the Summer Games on July 23, many in Japan are still not convinced by assurances from the government and organizers that it's possible to stage the Games safely.Earlier in June, a British medical journal called for a \"global conversation\" on staging the Olympics. And a recent poll from Kyodo News found 86% of 2,000 people surveyed feared a rebound of Covid-19 cases if the mega event went ahead.Kyoko Ishikawa (center) went to her first Summer Games in Barcelona in 1992 and crossed paths with Japan's \"Uncle Olympics.\"While overseas spectators were barred from coming to the Games earlier in March, just this week, Tokyo 2020 organizers agreed to allow up to 10,000 fans at events, providing the number does not exceed 50% of venue capacity.That has left ticket holders like Ishikawa hopeful they'll still be able to experience -- in person -- an Olympics like no other.Olympic attractionUsually at the Olympics, hordes of international fans pack stadiums and host cities.The number of attendees can be staggering -- for instance, a total of 8.3 million tickets were sold for the 1996 Games in Atlanta, Georgia, according to Guinness World Records. In comparison, 4.45 million tickets were initially sold for Tokyo 2020 but 840,000 were refunded after the postponement.Ishikawa nabbed tickets for the 1992 Games and never looked back.Ishikawa says she got hooked on that buzz from the crowds when she went to her first Olympics in Barcelona in 1992 as a student. It's also where she met Naotoshi Yamada -- or \"Uncle Olympics\" -- who was known to have attended every Summer Games since Tokyo 1964 in his colorful Japanese costumes.The pair hit it off and kept meeting up at every Summer Games. They were even planning to celebrate Tokyo 2020 together until Yamada died, age 91, in 2019. Ishikawa (right) sits with Naotoshi Yamada, aka \"Uncle Olympics,\" at the Beijing Games in 2008.Ishikawa, determined to continue Yamada's legacy, is a fan who counts on showing her support vocally. Others, however, communicate their fervor for the Games through mementos. Namely Shlomi Tsafrir, an Olympics memorabilia collector who has an archive of over 100,000 artifacts and knick-knacks. He's been hooked on the Olympics since 1998 when he opened a souvenir shop and loves using his collection as a talking point.\"I want more people to be interested in the history of the Olympic Games. Many of my Olympic memorabilia items come with a fascinating story behind them,\" said Tsafrir.Armchair fandom?Since the Games' postponement in March last year, organizers have coordinated preparations for holding the major international event amid the coronavirus pandemic.Japan's vaccination rollout has ramped up significantly in mid-June, with large-scale vaccination centers accepting bookings for people between ages 18 and 65, and an increasing number of companies and universities offering inoculations on site.Despite this, Japan's top coronavirus adviser said on June 18 that staging the Tokyo Olympics without spectators is \"desirable\" as it would be the lowest risk option amid the pandemic.Responding to his concerns, Tokyo 2020 organizers and Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said this week they would not rule out an Olympics without spectators if a state of emergency is reinstated in Tokyo.The capital shifted to a quasi-state of emergency on June 21, a day after the third state of emergency ended.Shlomi Tsafrir (far left) has traded pins far and wide. Here he is at the 2000 Games in Sydney.While Tsafrir still hopes he can go to the Games, he -- like Ishikawa -- must wait to find out if he's among the lucky ones who can enter Olympic venues. Tokyo 2020 organizers will hold a fresh lottery to decide who will be able to watch in person for events with over 50% of the venue capacity already filled.New kind of spectatorshipFor Tsafrir, who likes to visit different Olympic cities and towns to acquire memorabilia, a successful Games sends a message to the world that life can resume, and that other big cultural and sporting events might come back in the future.Tsafrir has table tennis and swimming tickets but said he wouldn't be too disappointed if he can't watch the events at the venues. \"Most people in the world will be watching the Olympics at home -- and sometimes watching it on TV, you can get a better angle than sitting in the stadium,\" Tsafrir added. Tsafrir at an exhibition on Olympic-related treasures, which he opened in Nagano.TV viewership is crucially important for the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which draws 73% of its funding from broadcasting rights. With medical experts warning of a resurgence of coronavirus as people move around the country, both Japan's leader and top Covid-19 expert have urged people to try and watch the Games from home to prevent the spread of the virus.\"There are technologies that can create the feeling of being (at the Olympics) -- we can stream (the Games) to the world and create a new way of cheering. I think Japan can create a new model for that,\" Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease expert, said in a news conference last Friday.And it's not just medical experts and officials who are trying to find ways of adapting to a streamlined Games.Ishikawa performs a traditional Japanese cheer dance called the \"sansan'nanaby\u014dshi\" -- a routine usually performed at high school sports events to cheer on athletes.Surrounded by Olympics paraphernalia at her home in Tokyo, Ishikawa is pondering how she'll make her brand of fandom work in a socially distanced world.\"We cannot meet face-to-face, but currently, we have technologies that still link and connect with the people from around the world. I'm thinking of how we can utilize that.\"CNN's George Ramsay contributed to this report from London.",

His action comes in response to a CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits nationwide and on the heels of a Missouri police chief's apology to victims.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the destruction of kits by a police department in his state \"disturbing\" and directed state police to contact the agency and ensure it is \"complying with state law regarding the handling of rape kits.\"Meanwhile, the group credited with convincing state legislators to enact laws requiring the testing of rape kits said it will push for the addition of language that prohibits destruction of the evidence. CNN's investigation \"shined a bright light on a largely unknown\" problem, said Ilse Knecht, director of policy and advocacy for the Joyful Heart foundation, a non-profit whose program End the Backlog focuses on untested rape kits.\"You can't say all kits should be tested if kits are destroyed,\" Knecht said.Read MoreEnd the Backlog altered its model legislation Monday to add a provision prohibiting destruction. It says: \"Kits associated with a reported crime that is uncharged or unsolved should be preserved for 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations, whichever is greater.\"Destroyed: How the trashing of rape kits failed victims and jeopardizes public safetyThe CNN investigation was published last week and revealed that 25 law enforcement agencies in 14 states destroyed rape kits in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher than 400. There are an estimated 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the country; CNN surveyed 207. CNN's analysis was based on records provided by the departments that reported destroying kits.The destruction occurred since 2010 and often followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed.Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes.Since 2016, End the Backlog has successfully pushed for the passage of 34 laws and four resolutions in 26 states concerning the testing of rape kits, Knecht said. Its model legislation influenced the wording of laws requiring analysis of rape kits in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and elsewhere.Georgia state Rep. Scott Holcomb told CNN he plans to use End the Backlog's new legislative language to introduce a bill prohibiting the destruction of rape kits in unsolved and uncharged cases when the legislature reconvenes next year. He drafted legislation passed in 2016 requiring the testing of backlogged kits in Georgia.CNN's investigation was \"powerful,\" he said, and he wants to make sure it's illegal to destroy a rape kit in his state.CNN surveyed three law enforcement departments in Georgia, asking whether the agencies destroyed any rape kits since 2010. All of them reported that they had not. But there are more than 600  agencies in the state, and Holcomb wants to be sure it isn't happening, or hasn't happened, anywhere. If it has, he wants it stopped.\"There's no excuse for this to happen,\" said Holcomb, a former prosecutor. \"The system has failed and continues to fail. I hate to say it but the basic reason [this happened] is because women aren't believed when they report these crimes.\"Read more: How CNN reported on rape kit destructionCNN found that the Seattle Police Department destroyed at least 18 kits while the cases could still be prosecuted. Police officials told CNN the department stopped destroying kits after it identified the practice earlier this year.While decrying destruction, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson praised the Seattle Police Department for \"taking responsibility and revisiting its protocols.\"\"Every kit,\" he said in a written statement, \"is a story that deserves to be told.\"Read more: Law enforcement agencies respond to CNN's rape kit investigationDestroying rape kits \"is not who we want to be as a community,\" said Emily Petersen, a senior prosecutor who handles sex crimes in King County, where Seattle is located.\"We never want to be in a position where we have to tell a victim that we can't prosecute their case because we don't have their rape kit,\" she told CNN.Petersen stressed the importance of testing and retaining kits and adopting a victim-centered approach to investigating and prosecuting sex crimes.In New York, CNN found the Jamestown Police Department destroyed at least two kits tied to cases police described as first-degree rapes, which carried no statutes of limitations. Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, related Cuomo's reaction to CNN. And US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand issued a statement calling the destruction \"deeply offensive to the survivors of these horrific crimes.\"\"I am extremely disturbed that some police departments around the country have been brazenly destroying this crucial evidence, even before the statute of limitations has ended -- something they almost certainly would not do for any other violent crime,\" she said.In Michigan -- where CNN found the Lapeer Police Department had destroyed at least 10 kits, including five belonging to minors -- officials from the Michigan Women's Commission called the findings \"disheartening.\"\"Without this valuable evidence, our justice system cannot hold those who commit these crimes accountable, nor can survivors receive the justice so necessary to the healing process,\" said Mary Engleman, executive director of the commission, which is part of the civil rights department.\"We are supportive of the Lapeer Police Department's efforts to address insufficiencies identified by the CNN investigation and call on every law enforcement agency in the state to review all relevant policies and procedures to assure survivors maintain the opportunity to pursue justice in our courts.\"Kym Worthy, the Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime, said CNN's investigation should be required reading for anyone in the criminal justice system.\"It has been almost a decade since the Detroit kits were found and this treatise made my blood boil. I am more outraged, infuriated, and incensed than I was then,\" Worthy said. \"The next person that knowingly destroys a sexual assault kit needs to go to jail. I do not know how anyone that claims to be human can continue to ignore this issue in this country after reading this truth.\"Police chief apologizes to rape victims and vows reforms in response to CNN investigation Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley's office did not respond to CNN's requests for comment on destruction in Springfield, Missouri, which CNN featured in its investigation.On Friday, Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams issued an apology video to sexual assault victims. He told local reporters the department would end its practice of giving victims a 10-day deadline to engage with investigators and offering them prosecution waiver forms before completing thorough investigations.A spokesman for US Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said the lawmaker was \"concerned\" by CNN's findings. \"Nothing is more important in these cases than physical evidence that corroborates the victim.\"Read more: Where police failed rape victimsIn California, two lawmakers reacted to CNN's investigation on Twitter.US Sen.

        "content": "(CNN)Inspired by a CNN investigation that revealed law enforcement agencies nationwide improperly destroyed rape kits, a Georgia lawmaker introduced legislation Wednesday aimed at preventing that from happening in his state. \"We have an obligation, if and when we find the perpetrator of a sex crime, that we bring cases. And we do that with all the evidence possible to win,\" said Rep. Scott Holcomb, a former prosecutor. CNN's investigation, \"Destroyed,\" surveyed more than 200 police departments and sheriff's offices around the country and found that 25 agencies in 14 states trashed rape kits in unsolved reported sex crimes while the statutes of limitations were still running. The destruction followed flawed and incomplete investigations and most kits were never tested for DNA. The practice of destroying kits was routine and occurred with little to no oversight, CNN found. While Georgia and other states have grappled with backlogs of untested kits, the destruction of that evidence is a more fundamental crisis. The kits are gone and can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted. Holcomb's bill requires that any investigating agency maintain evidence containing biological material for 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations, whichever is greater. Read MoreThat mirrors the federal government's guidance. The National Institute of Justice recommends maintaining rape kits in \"uncharged or unsolved reported cases\" for at least 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations. In Georgia, there is no statute of limitations for rape, aggravated sodomy and aggravated sexual battery as long as the suspect remains unknown. If the suspect is known, the statute of limitations is 15 years. DeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston applauded Holcomb's legislation. The challenge of investigating sexual assault cases, she said, is that law enforcement may have an offender's DNA and know that the same profile has turned up at other crime scenes \"but it may take decades for that person to actually be identified.\" Many rapists are serial offenders, so when kits are destroyed, the chance to use the evidence to identify suspects and link them to multiple attacks is lost. Prosecutions are also put at risk when defendants cannot exercise their right to test original evidence used against them in court. Trashing rape kits, dozens of experts told CNN, endangers public safety. An example illustrating the power of preserving rape kits -- even beyond the statute of limitations -- is the case of the Golden State Killer who terrorized California in the 1970s and '80s. Police used DNA from rape kits to help identify Joseph James DeAngelo, who was arrested last April. He has been charged with multiple counts of murder, some involving other offenses related to rape, robbery and burglary.In Georgia, rape kit destruction is unknownIn CNN's investigation, reporters concluded that since 2010, at least 400 rape kits have been destroyed in unsolved cases while prosecutions were still viable. The number is likely higher. That's because there are an estimated 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States; CNN surveyed 207. In Georgia, CNN surveyed three police departments: Atlanta Police Department, Hapeville and Lake City Police. Each said they had not destroyed rape kits. (See how CNN chose each department it surveyed) There are 450 law enforcement agencies in Georgia with full-time employees, according to the FBI. The heads of Georgia's sheriffs and police organizations told CNN this week that they don't know whether agencies have destroyed or currently destroy rape kits. Frank Rotondo, executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, and Terry Norris, who heads the Georgia Sheriffs' Association, said they support keeping rape kits for the length of the statutes of limitations. They warned, however, that some agencies may complain they don't have enough space in their evidence rooms to store rape kits for 50 years. The kits are smaller than shoeboxes, they acknowledged, and smaller agencies would likely have few kits.Despite the perceived challenges, both were optimistic about working with Holcomb to do what is best for the safety of all Georgians.\"My initial response is to support [the bill] if it will help prosecute a case. It's a good idea and we ought to do it,\" said Norris. Police chief: 'No question' kits should be keptGeorgia would not be the first state to enact legislation requiring the maintenance of rape kits in unsolved cases. Missouri passed a law last year requiring that they be kept for 30 years in cases that have not been adjudicated. Idaho requires that rape kits tied to felony cases be preserved for 55 years. Idaho state Rep. Melissa Wintrow fought hard a couple years ago to pass that bill. \"I'm happy to talk to anyone in Georgia about this issue because, in my experience, this is about educating folks,\" she said. \"Rape kits don't take up a lot of space. The pushback I saw is when the counties feel like the state is making these laws without consulting them or giving them funding to help them carry out the law.\"Norris and Rotondo said that any bill that is passed must come with mandated funding. Holcomb said he supports state funding.\"I understand that many agencies are under-resourced and that has to be addressed, they have to be helped,\" Holcomb said. \"We all have to come together on this.\"LaGrange, Georgia, Police Chief Louis Dekmar told CNN that the solution may lie in removing the responsibility of maintaining kits from some of the smaller agencies. Dekmar is the recent past president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which for two decades has issued best practices in sex crimes investigations.He'd like to see regional storage centers established across the state that meet the standards necessary to preserve, track and secure DNA evidence. And no matter what happens with the legislation, he said, it's got to have teeth. The law should detail some mechanism for oversight, entice agencies with incentives to follow through and spell out punitive measures if they don't.\"There should be no question about storing these kits, and I'm not sure we shouldn't be keeping them past the statute of limitations,\" Dekmar said. \"What is the resistance? Tell me what that really is?\"Dekmar noted that there is no time limit to prosecute murder in Georgia and there's been no opposition to maintaining evidence in those cases.",

        "content": "Springfield, Missouri (CNN)The police chief in Springfield, Missouri, on Thursday told a rape victim advocacy group that the department will review sex crimes cases in which the agency destroyed rape kits.Chief Paul Williams' pledge to Me Too Springfield came two weeks after he apologized to sexual assault victims and invited them to contact him if they felt their cases were mishandled.His gesture was in response to a national CNN investigation into rape kit destruction. The chief said the department's review will focus on the 108 rape kits that CNN identified as being destroyed since 2010 before a statute of limitation expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. Seventy-five percent of those kits, tied to cases reported as recently as 2014, were never submitted to a lab to be tested for DNA, CNN found. Springfield Police stood out from other agencies for the variety and volume of investigative shortcomings that led to kit destruction and how quickly rape kits were destroyed. Dozens of untested kits were destroyed in a year or less after victims reported being assaulted, according to department records.Experts who reviewed Springfield case files at CNN's request called practices they saw in its investigations \"disturbing.\" The police imposed 10-day deadlines on victims shortly after they reported being assaulted. If victims did not respond in time, their cases were closed and their kits destroyed while prosecutions were still viable. The police also gave victims waivers declining their option to prosecute before thorough investigations had been conducted, a tactic that effectively ended cases.Read MoreOutraged by revelations in CNN's investigation, the grassroots organization asked for the meeting with Williams so he could respond to their questions and requests. Police declined to open the discussion to journalists.In their meeting, Me Too members said they asked the chief to notify every victim whose kit was trashed and reopen those cases if possible.Williams rejected that idea, according to Sarah Bargo, Me Too's secretary, because the chief said he feared that contacting victims risked re-traumatizing them. Williams told Me Too that he is working with The Victim Center, Springfield's primary rape advocacy group, to use the center's hotline -- 417-864-SAFE -- as a way for victims to ask questions about their cases or rape kits.Victim Center director Brandi Bartel told CNN that the plan is in its early stages. Victims who call the line could give the center permission to pass their questions to police. Bartel expects that the police department would then contact the victim directly.\"I want to be helpful,\" she said. \"But I want to be clear -- we are not law enforcement. We are not attorneys.\"Since CNN's story published, one victim whose case is currently being investigated has contacted the department to learn the status of the rape kit, according to written answers police gave to Me Too and provided to CNN. Two other victims have told police they feel their cases were mishandled.The department declined to discuss those cases, citing the victims' privacy.Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams told an advocacy organization his department would review rape kit destruction.Me Too members asked Williams if he would consider bringing in outside experts to review the department's current sex crimes investigations.  Such reviews are considered best practice in policing. Williams told the group that he's reaching out to an organization that may be able to \"spot check\" Springfield's sex crimes cases, Me Too vice president Kelsey Nichol told CNN.Williams said the agency has stopped imposing 10-day deadlines on sex crime victims or giving them prosecution declination waivers.Read more about how CNN reported its investigationMe Too also asked Williams about the department's backlog of untested kits. Williams had previously told the group that he ordered a review of all kits in 2014 and found that the agency had more than 300 on hand. Williams told Me Too that police had reduced the number of untested kits to 237 and expected to finish testing the rest within two years.Me Too members told CNN they wanted more information about the state's intention to establish a system to track rape kits as they make their way from police to a lab for testing. Williams told them that discussions about that will begin after the first of the year.In a statement to CNN, the Missouri Attorney General's Office said that Attorney General Josh Hawley \"hopes grant funding will allow Missouri to test existing kits and establish statewide protocols that will prevent any kit from going untested in the future.\"Members left the meeting feeling good, they said.\"I went into the meeting feeling apprehensive,\" Nichol said. \"But it went very well. We felt heard by the department.\"Read \"The rape files\" flawed investigationsElsewhere, a police chief in Lapeer, Michigan, who apologized for his department's destruction of rape kits, told CNN on Thursday that he's taken several steps since the story appeared to improve his agency's handling of cases. David Frisch said he's created a policy specific to sexual assault investigation, updated the department's evidence policy and gotten members of the department training on sexual assault.Meanwhile, the attorney general in Washington state said he would notify every law enforcement agency in his state and direct them to ensure that rape kits are not being inappropriately destroyed.In New York, a spokeswoman for Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the destruction of kits by a police department in his state \"disturbing.\" The governor has directed state police to contact the agency and ensure it is \"complying with state law regarding the handling of rape kits,\" spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement.In Georgia, state Rep. Scott Holcomb told CNN that its investigation prompted him to begin writing legislation to introduce next session that would outlaw destruction of rape kits before the statute of limitations expires.And, national nonprofit organization the Joyful Heart foundation took action. Its program End the Backlog is credited with persuading state lawmakers across the nation to enact laws requiring the testing of rape kits. Days after CNN's investigation, it updated its model legislation to include a provision stating, \"Kits associated with a reported crime that is uncharged or unsolved should be preserved for 50 years or the length of the statute of limitations, whichever is greater.\"CNN's investigation \"shined a bright light on a largely unknown\" problem, said Ilse Knecht, the Joyful Heart foundation's director of policy and advocacy.\"You can't say all kits should be tested if kits are destroyed.\"Actress Mariska Hargitay: Rape kit destruction shows \"shameful level of disregard\"CNN's Sergio Hernandez and Sonam Vashi contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Asheville, North Carolina (CNN)A congressman paid tribute to him, the county school system dedicated a library in his name and a state university awarded him an honorary degree, calling him a source of inspiration and emulation. Bill Murdock has led Eblen Charities, one of western North Carolina's largest nonprofits, for nearly three decades, cultivating a reputation as a humble servant to the poor and a disciple of Mother Teresa.  But a CNN investigation into his background paints a different picture. Murdock was charged with a felony sex crime with a child in 1988 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a deal that one prosecutor initially involved in the case now considers an injustice. And he earned prestige with a resume built on exaggerated and dubious achievements. One award that has burnished his image, the Mother Teresa Prize for Global Peace and Leadership, sounds impressive but came from a company he incorporated out of his home. He claims an educational background from some of the country's most prestigious universities -- Harvard and Stanford, where his attendance consisted of one-week courses in nonprofit management. A familiar face in Asheville, frequently appearing in the local media, Murdock, 63, has risen to prominence in this tourist mecca nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains while his criminal record has remained largely unknown. Read MoreWhen his conviction has surfaced, as it did last year after the University of North Carolina at Asheville chose him for an honorary degree and to be its commencement speaker, Murdock offered this explanation: A woman came on to him, he rebuffed her and she retaliated by falsely accusing him of sexual misconduct with her teenage daughter. That account satisfied the UNCA Board of Trustees at the time. It also has satisfied the Eblen Charities board and an influential group of Asheville powerbrokers. But CNN tracked down the victim from that case, who has silently watched Murdock's stature grow. The Murdock she knew was her eighth-grade teacher, the 30-year-old married man who she says rubbed his body against hers, promised a future together and sexually abused her throughout her freshman year in high school. \"He would go into very elaborate stories about our dating, our wedding, and he always played himself as the hero,\" said Shelley Love Baldwin, now 47. \"My family was struggling financially. I was struggling. I just felt like he targeted us.... He saw vulnerability, and he swept in.\" Shelley Love Baldwin was a middle school student when her teacher Bill Murdock inappropriately touched her, she says. The abuse left Baldwin suicidal and in therapy much of her adult life, she said, and traumatized her entire family.\"It's been painful for years, and it just comes in waves of emotion for all of us,\" said her brother, Scott Love, a pediatrician in Asheville. \"And my family, I think we've all learned how to deal with it in some ways and never learned how to deal with it in others.\" Murdock maintains his innocence and denies ever abusing Baldwin. He said he became close to the Loves while separated from his first wife and that the family was unhappy when the couple reunited. Murdock gave a 90-minute interview to CNN and refuted the allegations of the victim and her family. \"There's a whole lot more to this,\" he said. \"I don't mind telling you the whole story....I just want to make sure I'm doing it the correct way.\" Murdock said he needed to consult his lawyer first but never explained further, despite reporters' follow-up phone calls and another visit to his office. The lawyer who Murdock mentioned told CNN he did not represent him. He referred questions to Murdock's defense attorney from the 1988 case, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. CNN interviewed Baldwin's parents, a former classmate and two medical professionals who said Baldwin told them years ago that she was sexually abused by Murdock. In addition, her siblings and a couple who worshipped with the family said they witnessed interactions between Shelley and her teacher that concerned them. Murdock himself admitted to an inappropriate emotional relationship with the girl in an audiotaped confrontation surreptitiously recorded by her father in 1988. After learning the details of CNN's investigation, the UNCA Board of Trustees rescinded Murdock's honorary degree on March 8, citing questions about his background, awards and academic credentials. Other organizations affiliated with Murdock refused to answer questions, including the Buncombe County schools. The same school district that accepted Murdock's resignation the day before his arrest nominated him to a community college board in 2016 and named a school media center in his honor in 2018. Shelley Love was a student at Clyde A. Erwin High School in 1987.Many in Asheville see Murdock as the head of a charity that helps the destitute, a man whose awards and accolades are testimony to his character. How could he be capable of abusing a child?\"This is a cautionary tale about how we deny our suspicions and how we don't listen to victims and how we're willing to look at the good someone has done when they have done very bad things in their past,\" said Wiley Cash, a New York Times best-selling author and writer-in-residence at UNCA.But attitudes are changing. Decades-old accounts of sexual abuse are being re-examined in many cases.More than 30 years after a young girl said she fell prey to her teacher, Baldwin, like many victims, is speaking out publicly for the first time.Her abuse -- and his denialIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Baldwin, her parents and siblings recounted what the family described as calculated grooming and sexual abuse by a teacher they trusted. Reporters shared those details with Murdock, who acknowledged a closeness with the family but provided a different recollection of events.This is the Loves' account:Shelley was a shy, bookish eighth grader in 1985. Placed in the gifted program at Clyde A. Erwin Middle School, she felt excited to learn Bill Murdock would be her math and science teacher. A gregarious guy and chummy with students, Murdock was popular. He kept her after class, working on math problems.\"The uncomfortable stuff started pretty early on with him bringing me to his desk,\" she recalled. \"His whole leg would be against my leg. His whole upper body would be against my body. [I'd] feel his breath on [my] face. I mean, he would just be all over me right there.\" \n\n\n\n\n'I was suicidal for years'\nShelley Love Baldwin says Bill Murdock sexually abused her. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge but says he is innocent.  Three decades later, she says, \"The truth is important...my story is important.\"\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nDuring P.E., as Murdock played sports with the boys, Shelley said, he gave her his jacket, watch, college ring and tie to wear. It was kind of flattering, she recalled. It was also mortifying.\"I already felt awkward. I spent most of my middle school years trying to be invisible and not get attention. I just remember just wanting to melt away into the bleachers.\"One evening, the eighth-grader told her mom, \"I think Mr. Murdock likes me.\" Carolyn Love remembers that moment and wishes now that she'd responded differently.It's probably okay, she said. The touching continued throughout the school year, Shelley said, including holding her hand just moments before her mother was to pick her up. She felt trapped, pressured and confused. She was relieved when middle school ended. Erwin High School would be her escape, she thought -- until she learned Murdock had taken a teaching job there.In high school, Shelley Love Baldwin recalls, her teacher told her they would one day get married. He denies that.Just before freshman year began, Carolyn said, Murdock showed up at the Loves' home while she was working in the yard. He told her he liked teaching Shelley and could help their introverted daughter. He was going to coach soccer at Erwin High and suggested to Carolyn that Shelley become the team statistician.Carolyn appreciated his gesture and encouraged her daughter.\"I thought, 'Won't that be good?' with the kids, 'cause she was shy,\" she remembered. \"You could see that she was unhappy...Bill was saying, 'I will look after her.'\"Murdock and Shelley spent a lot of time together. \"All the kids seemed to know or think we had this relationship, which was humiliating.\"At a home football game one evening, girls began to taunt Shelley about him. Crying, she took off, walking fast toward home.Murdock drove up alongside her, offered her a ride. She got in. They drove, then stopped at an intersection. \"He reached over, and he grabbed my hand, interlaced his fingers,\" she recounted. \"He's like, 'I want to pray with you....' He tells me how special I am.\" Then, she said, Murdock kissed her forehead. \"He kissed my cheek, kissed my ear, started kissing, like, all over my face.\" Shelley shook her head, trying to back away but their lips made contact. \"He said, 'Well, you kissed me.' That was his thing forever after that....'You kissed me.'\"When he stopped, Shelley slid back into her seat. Carolyn remembers Murdock explaining that he drove her daughter home because she was getting picked on at the game. Carolyn and Doug Love sometimes worked past the time that Shelley and her younger siblings Heather and Scott arrived home from school. Carolyn had a job at a department store. Doug, a pastor, was working full-time at the Red Cross and trying to start a church. The Love family in the 1980s. Shelley is standing to the right, next to her father.They were raising their kids in a time before the sex offender registry, when Asheville was a small town and seemed like a safe place for children. Their faith was at the center of their lives. They saw the good in people. When their daughter's teacher told them he was having marital problems, they responded with compassion, inviting him for meals and visits. Murdock spoke with them about God, attended Bible study in their home and played Christian songs on his guitar. And he spent more and more time around Shelley, who said she had become convinced they were in love. Gaile and Ed Peavler came by the Loves' home to worship and noticed a closeness between Shelley and her teacher that they found worrisome.\"I remember them sitting on the floor together, the looks passing between them, I just knew there wasn't something right there,\" Gaile Peavler recalls. \"She just had a big crush on him, and he was encouraging that.... Their behavior, to me, was just like a couple that were flirting with each other and sharing secrets.\" By this time, Shelley said, Murdock was stoking a fantasy in her imagination late at night in phone calls after her parents went to sleep. \"I didn't speak very much. I mean, he mostly wanted me to be quiet, 'cause he didn't want me to be caught.\" She said Murdock told her they would get married when she turned 16 in a state where it was legal. He described dates they would go on, she said, and the children they would bring into the world and name Clayton Joseph and Rebecca Lee.\"This was night after night after night....I had gone from hating him...to now I'm totally, utterly dependent.\"Shelley felt that her teacher, who was now 31, had isolated her from her peers. She and Murdock, she said, were engaging in masturbation and oral sex.Shelley shared a bedroom with her 11-year-old sister Heather, who remembers Shelley tucked under her desk late at night, ear pressed to the phone. She and her brother, Scott, who was 12, also remember Murdock being at their home when their parents were away and insisting that they leave him and Shelley alone, sometimes in a bedroom.\"The door would always be shut,\" recalled Scott. \"It was always some private project. It was like, 'Oh, no, no, you guys need to stay out here. This is top secret.'\"Heather Barbieri says she was 11 when Bill Murdock told her to go into the family's basement. The experience haunts her.They said Murdock would tell them the two were working on special presents for them -- for Christmas, or their birthdays.In tears, Heather recounted Murdock sending her to their dark, dirt-floor basement. \"He would shut the door behind me,\" she said. \"I remember being able to hear my sister and Bill. They sounded playful, they sounded in love.\"It certainly didn't feel like it was about a Christmas present or a birthday present,\" she continued. \"I began to feel like I had to protect my sister, that I had to figure out what was going on...I had to expose him for who he really was to my parents.\"Heather thought she had the proof she needed when she witnessed Murdock kissing her sister on the lips. She immediately told her mother. \n\n\n\n\n'I had to protect my sister'\nHeather Barbieri was Shelley's little sister, but she took on a big job. She feels the impact to this day.\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nCarolyn confronted Murdock.He told her that Heather got it wrong; Shelley was upset, and he was consoling her with a simple kiss on the cheek. Carolyn believed him. \"There was just a really good story behind it, and Shelley backed him up,\" Carolyn recalled. But she couldn't help but worry. \"Sometimes, I'd come home from work, and he would be there. But he would always tell me he just got there....And I was always careful to tell him, 'Don't be here when I'm not here.'\"Scott remembers playing in the woods near their house and seeing Murdock pick Shelley up or drop her off on a road around the bend from their home.\"I definitely remember him coming up and not actually driving all the way to our house, which I always thought was weird as a kid,\" he said.Shelley told CNN that in the midst of the sexual abuse, she told her parents that men in a van took her into the woods but she escaped unharmed. The couple said they reported the incident to authorities and soon after, Shelley admitted she'd made it up. Carolyn recalls the detective warning them that someone might be abusing Shelley and the story was her cry for help. It's a scenario generally supported by child psychologists. Children who are being sexually abused, they say, sometimes invent stories as a way to alert adults without disclosing the real source of their pain. \"This was happening, and it was hurting,\" Shelley says now. \"It just wasn't happening with the guys in the van.\"Bill Murdock wrote to Shelley in her 1986 yearbook. She says he was grooming her then and would later abuse her. The false report and Shelley's increasingly withdrawn demeanor deepened her mother's suspicion of Murdock. One day, Carolyn sat on a hilly area overlooking the road to their home, watching for Murdock's car. She saw him drop Shelley off away from the house. Murdock arrived at the home first, Carolyn said, and Shelley walked slowly behind him to appear as though they'd traveled separately.  \"I walked in there, got their alibi, got their story, which was completely false and I knew it,\" Carolyn said. \"And I tore into him and told him never ever be in our house again.\"The Loves believed they were done with Murdock. A short time later, they received a note from his wife Dana, thanking them for the kindness they'd shown her husband. The couple had reunited.Carolyn and Doug thought nothing of it.Shelley was devastated. That night, she said, she walked to a nearby bridge and contemplated jumping.\"We wouldn't have known why, if she had done it,\" her father said, weeping at the memory.Shelley's grades plummeted, and she refused to return to Erwin High. Her parents enrolled her in a private school. One of her new friends, Michael Hayes, sensed right away that something deeply bothered her. He gently asked what was wrong.\"She told me that she had been having sex with her teacher,\" he told CNN. \"I told her, 'You have to tell your parents. You have to tell them.'\" Emboldened, she did.Doug Love was livid. He wanted answers. He confronted Murdock in a school parking lot in February 1988 and recorded the conversation. Murdock declined to hear the entire recording but listened to parts of it and confirmed it was authentic. \n\n\n\n\n'Her emotions and probably mine are getting a little bit out of hand'\nIn 1988, Doug Love confronted Bill Murdock and secretly taped the encounter.  Murdock told CNN he did not want to hear the entire recording, presented here, but listened to parts of it and confirmed it was authentic. It shows Murdock denied sexually abusing Shelley but asked for forgiveness and offered to resign his teaching job.\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nThe father asked Murdock if he had \"a physical relationship\" with Shelley.\"Oh no. No, no,\" Murdock said. \"You're denying that?\" Doug asked.\"I mean, outside of a hug,  you know, she'd hug me and stuff like that,\" Murdock replied. \"She's told us more than that, Bill. She's told us more than that, Bill. She's told me about, about your having her masturbate her (sic). And, and she's told Carolyn that.\"\"No,\" he said.\"And not only once but numerous times, Bill.\"\"No sir, no sir.\"Doug Love confronted Murdock in a secretly taped conversation. Murdock denied allegations he had sexual contact with Shelley but asked for forgiveness and offered to resign from his job.The father pressed on. \"This girl has been an emotional wreck. She's had counseling. She's had a hard time. She, she's never had any type of a sexual relationship, hasn't even dated before. And then she comes up with this, and she's having a heck of a hard time with it all, Bill.\" Murdock continued his denial but said, \"I'm not calling her a liar...  Her emotions and probably mine are getting a little bit out of hand.\" He brought up Shelley's false report about the men in the van, said he talked to her about \"trouble\" with a boy. \"And I tried to help. And I'm not a threat to anybody.\" He apologized and said he might have made mistakes. \"If I did, like I said, I'm very sorry and I never meant for it to happen and all I can do is ask your forgiveness.\" He said he \"broke it off\" because \"the whole thing was wrong. Emotions that were building up and stuff like that was wrong.\" He offered twice to resign his teaching job and nervously asked, \"What are you planning to do?\" \"I'm not sure, Bill.\"\n\n\n\n\n'How could we have been fooled?'\nDoug Love describes the way he feels Bill Murdock ingratiated himself with the family -- and the resulting devastation.\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nIn his interview with CNN, Murdock denied some allegations and said he could not recall other scenarios the Loves described. He did remember the conversation with Doug Love. He said he did not know it had been recorded but confirmed it was his voice on the tape.  \"I think I probably asked his forgiveness,\" he told reporters, \"just because if, if he thought there was anything inappropriate and if emotions were getting out of hand, it was about the whole family. And thinking that, you know, if, if he, if this is going to be a big thing and, you know, all of this, you know, I mean, it'd be just as easy to, to resign.\"In the conversation with Doug, Murdock never mentioned accusations he has repeated over the years: that Carolyn Love made up the abuse because he rejected her advances. He acknowledged being at the Loves' home during Shelley's freshman year. \"We were close, at their invitation, I mean, we were, we were certainly friends during that time.\" He said the family became incensed when he reunited with his wife. \"They weren't happy about the fact that we were getting back together....They just said they didn't feel it was the right thing to do and they were, they felt that, you know, that God didn't want us to, to get back together... They, I guess, thought I was more part of their family. And again, they wanted, you know, me to, you know, to stay.\" Bill Murdock says he was close to the Loves. The family says he betrayed them.Murdock acknowledged to CNN that he drove Shelley home from the football game but said he didn't kiss her. He denied putting Heather in the basement, late-night phone calls with Shelley and conversations about marriage and children. He denied touching her in class in middle school, giving her his clothes to wear or coming by the house suggesting that she be his soccer team statistician. He couldn't remember being in the house with Shelley when her parents weren't home or the confrontation with Carolyn after Heather said she saw them kissing. He said he only dropped Shelley off away from her house once.\"One time she was walking down the road, you know, and fairly far away,\" he said. \"And so I picked her up, and she said, 'Well, why don't you just drop me off here?'\" And he said it wasn't Carolyn's accusations that made him stop visiting.\"I felt it was time to stop coming around the house, being uncomfortable Dana and I were getting back together,\" he said. \"And, you know, those-- it just wasn't-- you know,  you know, it was, was not good for, for the marriage, not good for, for Dana and I.\" Murdock said Doug and Carolyn Love suggested being the couple's marriage counselors but declined to explain why they would make such an offer if they were unhappy that the Murdocks had reunited. The Loves and Murdock agree there was a confrontation at his apartment. It occurred after the recorded encounter. Both Dana and Shelley were there. Murdock again denied abusing the girl and told CNN his wife believed him. The Loves say Dana later called and asked to meet with Carolyn. Dana wanted to know, Was the couple planning to go to authorities? Carolyn said they were. Would they be willing to meet with Dana's friend in the Buncombe County District Attorney's Office? Yes, the Loves said. They felt sorry for Dana, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, and didn't think prison was the answer for Murdock but wanted him to pay some price and get counseling.Carolyn and Doug Love say welcoming Bill Murdock into their home is their \"biggest regret.\"Dana's friend, Assistant District Attorney Bert Neal, recalled meeting with the Loves and their teenage daughter. He found Shelley \"totally credible,\" he told CNN. \"She was a normal little girl, and it was a good family,\" Neal said. \"And I just didn't see that things would be made up.\" As Neal recalls, he worked on the case initially but his boss, District Attorney Bob Fisher, took it over. Fisher is dead, as is the judge. Because the case is so old, the District Attorney and Buncombe County Sheriff's Office said they no longer have records.Neal said that Dana, who he would represent in her divorce in 1992, told him \"she could easily believe the accusations.\" Her second husband, journalist Keith Jarrett, told CNN that Dana had been disturbed by the attention Murdock showed Shelley and \"came to believe he was guilty.\" Dana died in 2000. The Loves wanted Murdock prosecuted but were unwilling to allow their emotionally fragile daughter to testify in court. Carolyn and Shelley said they were interviewed by a sheriff's investigator.  \n\n\n\n\n'Don't ever have anything to do with my children ever again'\nCarolyn Love relives the moment she says her suspicions about Bill Murdock were confirmed.\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nOn August 9, 1988, a warrant was issued for Murdock's arrest for felony indecent liberties with children -- taking \"immoral, improper and indecent liberties with Shelly (sic) Love\" and committing a \"lewd and lascivious act\" on her. He immediately resigned from Erwin High. Sixteen days later, Murdock pleaded guilty to what is listed on the official court record as \"misdemeanor liberties with children.\"  A law professor and three former Buncombe County assistant district attorneys called the quick disposition highly unusual for such a case, which normally would take months or years to resolve. Even more unusual was the charge, misdemeanor liberties with children.There was no such charge, Neal and other legal experts told CNN.\"It appears that they just decided to call a felony offense a misdemeanor. How you get there from here, I have no idea,\" said Rebecca Knight, a former Buncombe County sex crimes prosecutor and retired district court judge.A court document shows Bill Murdock pleaded guilty to misdemeanor liberties with children.Fisher arranged the plea agreement, said Neal, who was censured by the State Bar in 2006 for missing court appearances and had his license inactivated in 2012 because of a disability. Murdock spent no time in jail and received unsupervised probation. He was ordered to \"remain in counseling until such time that [the] counseling agency feels he has rec'd maximum benefit.\" Murdock had been seeing a marriage therapist for four months by then, according to the therapist's notes, because of \"accusations by a high school student of sexual impropriety and ensuing marital problems.\" He continued seeing her for his court-ordered treatment. She observed him to be \"a 33 year old attractive male who was neatly dressed and well-mannered.\" He'd been a \"model citizen,\" she wrote, and she commended his \"problem-solving techniques.\" The therapist determined that Murdock \"does not fit the personality profile of a sexual abuser.\" A little more than two months after his conviction, she concluded the treatment was no longer necessary. Neal now says he thinks Murdock got off light. \"I don't agree with the disposition,\" he said. \"I thought he should have paid more of a price than he did.\" So do the Loves. They said they were unaware of the plea deal and learned of it in court. Asked what misdemeanor charge he pleaded to, Murdock told CNN, \"I'm not even sure what, what, what it was.\"He said he wasn't questioned by law enforcement. Shelley's siblings said they were never interviewed either. Murdock said his attorney, Brent O'Conner, advised him to plead guilty. \"He said that, first of all, it would cost about $20,000 to defend,\" he said. \"And even though he knew it wasn't true, he said, 'How do you prove a negative? How do you prove that you didn't do something?'\" O'Conner did not respond to numerous requests for comment. But he has written a letter in defense of Murdock, which one former Eblen board member read to Wiley Cash during a telephone call last year. In the letter, according to Cash's notes, O'Conner said Murdock vehemently denied the allegations and shared none of the traits of the sex offenders he'd represented. The Loves, disappointed in the outcome of his criminal charge, left Asheville. \"We moved away...specifically to get [Shelley] out of here and to get our family back on track,\" Carolyn said.A few years later, while watching Scott compete in a state wrestling match, the Loves were stunned to see the coach of an opposing team: Bill Murdock, a new employee at Asheville High School. \"It's been painful for years,\" says Scott Love, Shelley's brother and an Asheville pediatrician. \"It just comes in waves of emotion....\"Carolyn said she and Shelley then drove two hours to the school and shared their story with administrators. Murdock resigned on March 30, 1992. He told CNN he had been hired as a temporary teacher. \"This had come up again,\" he said. \"I just decided that...this isn't worth going through all of this again.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n'He took advantage of my parents'\nScott Love says his parents lived their faith -- and opened their door to Bill Murdock in his time of need.\nAudio has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\nOutraged that Murdock had been allowed to continue teaching, the Loves contacted the District Attorney and the school superintendent at the time, according to documents CNN obtained. An attorney for the school district concluded that Murdock's conviction was grounds for his educational license to be revoked but that since he was no longer teaching and because of \"the passage of time,\" no action would be taken.  At a minimum, the Loves had wanted Murdock to receive sex offender treatment and be barred from working with children. They got neither. The birth of a charity -- and an imageDuring the time the Loves say Murdock abused their daughter, he taught gifted middle school students at Super Saturday, a program on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Asheville, according to job applications he submitted to UNCA. He taught there through 2001. A statement by the university said background checks were not required until after Murdock left. Murdock's job at Eblen Charities puts him in regular contact with low-income children and families. The board has known about his conviction for years and stood by him.\"This thing has been gone over so many times,\" said Dewey Andrew, a board member who has been involved with the charity since the beginning. He said he did not know the details of the case. \"I know what I've heard and what his attorney has said and all those kind of things. So I think that the, the, whatever it is that someone's bringing up is a bunch of bull.\" \"I will take up for Mr. Murdock to the very end,\" Andrew said before abruptly ending the interview. Lou Bissette, a former Asheville mayor and ex-Eblen board member, said that after he left the charity several years ago \"the board or the chairperson looked at it, looked at all that they could find, and, and determined that there was not enough evidence there to do anything about it.\" Bissette said he's known Murdock more than 20 years and never heard of any other allegations, noting that \"he's had access to hundreds of children and families, thousands over the years....I think what Eblen has done has been really incredible for our community.\" A statement by the Eblen board, released last week to Asheville media outlets, said it had long been aware of \"an allegation\" in Murdock's past, investigated it and \"determined that no further action was necessary.\"\"We believe in helping people and giving people a second chance,\" the statement said. \"Bill has proven himself worthy of continued employment as our executive director. He has done good work here and has improved the lives of the people of western North Carolina. We continue to stand in support of Bill Murdock.\" It's unclear who wrote the statement or whether it represented a consensus of the board. Two board members declined to answer questions, and others did not return messages seeking comment.The genesis of Eblen Charities was a 1990 golf tournament Murdock helped conceive to benefit a foundation for cystic fibrosis, according to Eblen's web site and Murdock's writings. Murdock and his co-organizers needed a sponsor and approached Joe Eblen, who ran the family-owned Biltmore Oil Co., a wholesale gasoline supplier and operator of retail convenience stores. A wrestling aficionado since elementary school, Murdock recruited professional wrestlers and the tournament became an annual event. In 1991, the family of a young girl with cystic fibrosis needed help paying for transportation to take their daughter for treatment at Duke University. The parents worked and did not qualify for financial assistance. \"I called Joe and he, out of his own pocket, paid for the family to go, and then we decided, you know, there's needs in our community,\" Murdock told CNN. \"I had a yard sale. We raised $400 and we started Eblen.\" Murdock, who had been working at a real estate company, became its first employee, initially working out of Biltmore Oil. The charity stood apart from other aid organizations, offering assistance without rigid guidelines.  \"Everything went through him,\" said Leslie Anderson, an Asheville-based consultant to nonprofits. \"I remember him standing up at any number of meetings and saying, 'Here's my phone number. All you need to do is call me and I will make it all happen.'\" Eblen Charities went on to contract with the county government, disbursing money for heating and utility assistance and overdue bills for rent, power, gas and water. Local businesses helped provide turkey dinners at Thanksgiving, back-to-school supplies, and shoes and clothing for needy students. The annual budget grew to $5 million, according to its 2016 financial statement, the most recent available. To Joe Eblen, Murdock was \"like a son,\" Anderson said. Raised by grandparents, Murdock said his own father had little presence in his life and his mother died when he was a toddler. Joe Eblen died in 2013. The Eblen family declined to comment for this story.As the charity grew, so too did Murdock's renown. He became its public face, garnering positive news coverage and penning books and op-ed pieces that read like Sunday sermons. \"We all would do well to follow Mother Teresa's example and not only see the need but to act without delay,\" he wrote in his book \"Find Your Own Calcutta: Living a Life of Service and Meaning in a Selfish",

        "content": "Asheville, North Carolina (CNN)The executive director of a prominent North Carolina charity is leaving his post after a CNN investigation this week detailed the account of a 47-year-old woman who says he sexually abused her when she was his teenage student. Bill Murdock, 63, made the decision to retire from Eblen Charities Thursday, according to a statement issued by the Eblen board. He led the organization, one of western North Carolina's largest non-profits,  since its beginning nearly three decades ago.Murdock also resigned from the board of Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College Friday.He was charged with a felony sex crime in 1988 and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. He maintains he is innocent and says he took the plea deal on the advice of his lawyer, who cited the high cost of a defense and said he couldn't guarantee an acquittal.After CNN's investigation was published Tuesday, some community leaders in Asheville called for him to resign from Eblen. The story also revealed the dubious and exaggerated achievements Murdock touted that elevated him to a position of power and prestige in this tourist mecca nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Read More\"This feels like a relief,\" said Shelley Love Baldwin, upon learning of Murdock's departure. Baldwin gave her account of abuse for the first time to CNN. \"I feel that justice has been served for the community.\"At the charity office before his announcement to leave, Murdock told a CNN reporter, \"My plans are seeing what, what's going to happen with the board and all.\" The board met Thursday but members refused to speak afterward to CNN. The statement says Murdock would assist in the transition to interim leadership. \"The Board expresses its appreciation for Bill's many years of dedicated service to Eblen Charities and the people of Western North Carolina.\"Just last week, the Eblen board issued a statement standing by Murdock. It came after CNN informed the University of North Carolina at Asheville of its findings and the board of trustees rescinded an honorary degree given to Murdock in 2018. Murdock had \"proven himself worthy of continued employment,\" the statement said. \"We continue to stand in support of Bill Murdock.\"Eblen board members did not return messages seeking comment on Murdock's retirement or whether he would receive a compensation package. The assistant director of Eblen Charities, Susan Riddle, said Friday, \"We are all very sad. But we're committed to our clients and the work of Eblen Charities and that's what we are going to do is get back about business.\"Baldwin said Murdock methodically groomed her in the eighth grade and sexually abused her throughout the ninth grade. Two former classmates who read her story on CNN came forward Thursday to support her. They said they observed the close contact with Murdock that Baldwin described and said that they believe her account. Baldwin's story also was supported by her family members, a third former classmate and two medical professionals in whom she confided. She and her family gave a vastly different account than the one Murdock has told for years -- that he is innocent despite his plea of guilty to a reduced charge. Murdock denies the abuse and some of the family's allegations. He said he could not recall other scenarios the family describes.Baldwin's account has resonated throughout much of Asheville, dominating local news coverage and coffee shop conversations.  Buncombe County Commissioner Amanda Edwards called Murdock's departure \"the right thing for the community....He did plead guilty,\" she said. \"And no matter how much time passes ... it doesn't decrease the breach of trust that our community is feeling right now.\"   A court document shows Bill Murdock pleaded guilty to misdemeanor liberties with children.\n\nMurdock's resignation from the A-B Tech board came amid calls for his removal from some of his colleagues. Board member Ron Edgerton said he \"sent out a rather tense email to a number of board members telling them that either they do something, or I would through Gov. (Roy) Cooper.\"\"The details of the [CNN] report are damning,\" Edgerton said. In his resignation letter to the chairwoman, Murdock called his time on the board \"a great honor.\" \"I have been thinking for some time about what direction to go regarding the board seat that I currently hold,\" Murdock wrote, \"and have decided to relinquish my seat as I don't want the distractions of the past few weeks to interfere with the tremendous work of the board of trustees and that of the college.\"CNN's investigation showed Murdock earned respect with a resum\u00e9 built in part on exaggerated and dubious achievements.One award that has burnished his image, the Mother Teresa Prize for Global Peace and Leadership, came from a company he incorporated out of his home. He claims an educational background from several of the country's most prestigious universities -- including Harvard and Stanford, where his attendance consisted of one-week courses in nonprofit management.Eblen's website and Murdock's book covers and bio claim the Eblen Children's Pharmacy won the Peter F. Drucker Award in 2001 for being \"the most innovative nonprofit program in the country.\" Laura Roach, who administers the prize, told CNN she could find no record of Eblen winning.Murdock was arrested on August 10, 1988, and charged with felony indecent liberties with children -- taking \"immoral, improper and indecent liberties with Shelly (sic) Love\" and committing a \"lewd and lascivious act\" on her.  Sixteen days later, he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge listed on the official court record as \"misdemeanor liberties with children.\"The quick disposition and the language of the reduced charge struck a North Carolina law professor and three former county district attorneys as odd. They said that misdemeanor charge did not exist. \"It appears that they just decided to call a felony offense a misdemeanor. How you get there from here, I have no idea,\" said Rebecca Knight, a former Buncombe County sex crimes prosecutor and retired district court judge.Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams told CNN Thursday that Baldwin has contacted his office, and he will meet with her and members of her family if they want. \"I would encourage any other people who've read CNN's article who have information to come forward,\" Williams said, adding they can contact his office, the Buncombe County Sheriff's Office or Asheville's Family Justice Center.Some people in the community said it is important how Asheville responds to the revelations about Murdock's past and exaggerated accomplishments.\"A community's first reaction is wanting to not believe that the person that they trusted is capable of causing such an act of violence,\" said Angelica Wind, executive director of Our Voice, Buncombe County's rape crisis and prevention center. \"We cannot give power to sexual violence by silencing survivors,\" she said. \"How a community responds to a disclosure unequivocally sets the tone as to whether other survivors come out of the shadows.\" Shelley Love Baldwin was a middle school student when her teacher Bill Murdock inappropriately touched her, she says.\nTami Ruckman, the director of development for Eliada Homes, an Asheville non-profit that works with foster children, says she used to be a social worker. She said Baldwin's story was \"eerily familiar\" to what she has heard sexual abuse victims recount.\"The victim is always in the place of accusing someone of something nobody else could fathom that they would ever do,\" Ruckman said. \"Her story just sounds dead on, to me.\" Murdock has told people over the years that the victim's mother came on to him, he rejected her and she then falsely accused him. He denied to CNN that he sexually abused Baldwin. Speaking Wednesday before the decision, Ruckman stressed the good work of Eblen Charities but said Murdock should resign. The organization is \"incredibly important to this community,\" she said.Two former classmates of Baldwin's who read CNN's investigation said their teacher showered Baldwin with attention.\"Honestly, I don't remember a moment that they weren't together. ... He would sit on her desk and he'd lean across,\" recalled Casey Clark, an eighth-grade classmate. \"She was his assistant in everything. And it was awkward. As an eighth-grader, you're like, 'OK, that's weird. I don't want any of that.'\" Baldwin told CNN that Murdock would give her his clothes to wear. It is a detail that Murdock denied happened. Clark said she remembered it.\"She did wear his coat,\" Clark recalled. \"And he would, like, drape his coat over her.\" A young Bill Murdock, right, wrote to Shelley in her 1986 yearbook. She says he was grooming her then and would later abuse her.\nClark said she had no trouble believing Murdock sexually abused Baldwin.She \"was so sweet and so quiet,\" said Clark, \"that she was the perfect kind of target ... she wasn't going to say anything.\"\"She...was just his shadow.\"  Her husband, Andrew Clark, was a student of Murdock's in 10th grade and remembers how odd it was that Baldwin, a ninth grader, would sit in class even though she was not actually taking the course. \"We were all sort of confused by that,\" he said. \"She would have on his sports coat during the class,\" he recalled, adding that Murdock and the teenager acted \"very close.\"Students taunted her, he said.\"'Oh, she's teacher's pet,' just sort of teenage jargon -- 'I think they're doing it,'\" Andrew Clark recalled. He, too, believes Baldwin.\"In hindsight, we all kind of knew ... because my impression was this had happened. I'm just disgusted by the whole situation. ... I think he's guilty.\"Ashley Fantz is a senior investigative reporter at CNN who focuses on crime, military issues and gender violence.

        "content": "(CNN)When Troy Powell first showed an interest in Ryan Houston's dancing, the 21-year-old student thought the attention could be his big break.   Houston was studying at the New York City school of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, one of the most prominent dance companies in the US and an iconic institution in the world of Black performing arts. Powell, a high-profile dancer, choreographer and teacher nearly two decades his senior, had helped make and break dance careers as a leader in the group's junior touring company. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a tip or sensitive material to share with CNN?\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\nBut Houston said their professional relationship quickly turned uncomfortable as Powell texted him increasingly flirty and sexual messages. One night in 2010, Powell invited Houston to a nightclub, where he pushed him against a wall, grabbed his groin and butt and tried to kiss him, Houston said. Once he reported Powell's advances to the school's co-directors, Houston said, they told him making a \"big deal\" about it would hurt his chances to get a position in the company. Anthony DeCarlis, another former student, said he considered Powell \"a father figure\" when Powell invited him to stay the night at his home in 2003 -- until he felt his teacher's penis rubbing against his backside as he lay on a bed. Powell has hurt people \"who have entrusted The Ailey School with their dreams and their future,\" DeCarlis said in an interview with CNN this month. \"I just don't want it to be a secret anymore.\" Read MoreThe Ailey organization on Monday announced that Powell \"was no longer employed\" there, saying an investigation sparked by social media chatter concluded Powell had \"engaged in inappropriate communications with adults enrolled in the School.\" But CNN found that Powell's behavior went beyond just communications -- and that the school's leadership was presented with multiple allegations of misconduct years ago.  Allegations span almost a decadeHouston and DeCarlis are two of four former Ailey School students who alleged in on-the-record interviews with CNN that Powell abused his position of power, touching them inappropriately or making sexual overtures that include inviting one student to a sex party and sending another an unsolicited photo of his genitals. Three of the students said that after they rebuffed Powell's advances, they were cut from performances or rejected during auditions, which they believed may have been a form of retaliation by Powell. Friends or mentors of three of the former dancers told CNN that the students had shared their accounts about Powell's behavior at the time. The allegations span almost a decade from 2003 to 2011 -- before the #MeToo movement shone a spotlight on similar behavior by a host of prominent men.  Leaders at the Ailey organization were aware of at least some of Powell's alleged conduct many years before they started the investigation, according to several former students who said they personally reported the incidents to the school's co-directors, Tracy Inman and Melanie Person.  Artistic director Troy Powell speaks during Ailey II's New York Season dress rehearsal at The Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater on March 29, 2016 in New York City.Powell, 51, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Ailey organization declined to make Inman and Person available for an interview, and the co-directors did not respond to interview requests. The Ailey spokesperson said that \"at no time were the allegations of physical misconduct reported\" to Inman and Person.\"Ailey is instituting a thorough review of its policies and procedures, which provide multiple avenues for reporting, and will be undertaking additional training of all employees and students,\" the spokesperson, Christopher Zunner, said in an email. \"We affirm our commitment to providing a safe and supportive environment for all.\"Some former Ailey students and dancers told CNN they saw the allegations against Powell as a symptom of a larger problem in a profession where artistic directors can get away with inappropriate behavior because they wield tremendous power over dancers' careers.Tarnished legacy at a legendary dance companyThe Ailey company was launched in 1958, when it was difficult for many Black dancers to perform with mainstream dance groups. Its founder, choreographer and modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey, used his experiences growing up in deeply segregated rural Texas to create breathtaking dances that incorporate Black spirituality.In his most famous work, Revelations -- which was performed at the inaugurations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and is still performed around the world by dancers from the company -- Ailey orchestrated the history of Black America in a 36-minute dance set to gospel songs. While the group was originally all-Black, Ailey decided to make it multiracial; most of its current students and members are people of color. Before his death in 1989, Ailey grew the organization from a small ensemble to a dance empire. The group pulled in $48 million in revenue between July 2017 and June 2018, the most recent year for which its financial information is available.Alvin Ailey dance theater official fired after sexual misconduct allegationsPowell, a native New Yorker, had started his training as a scholarship student at the Ailey School at age nine, according to his online biography on the company's website, which was taken down this week. He performed around the world and taught at the school before taking over in 2012 as the artistic director of the group's junior touring company, Ailey II, which is seen as a stepping-stone to the most prestigious dancing roles. A larger-than-life figure in the halls of the school's glassy building near New York City's Columbus Circle, Powell would often poke his head into classes to check on potential recruits, and dance students would give their best performances when he did, they said. But behind the scenes, rumors about Powell's behavior spread among the close-knit group of Ailey alumni who've interacted with him.Last month, those rumors erupted on social media: A TikTok video of two dancers with the caption \"When you wanna be in Ailey 2 ... But guys gotta sleep with Troy Powell\" circulated widely among the school's alumni in recent weeks. It's unclear who created the video. But several former students, including Houston and DeCarlis, posted their own sometimes tearful social media videos of themselves detailing the harassment they faced from Powell. Following that, an attorney working with Ailey's general counsel reached out to several of the dancers who had commented on the social media posts. Three of the dancers told CNN they had been interviewed by that attorney. Ailey put Powell on leave in June as it conducted that investigation, according to the organization.Powell's downfall represents the latest sexual harassment scandal to hit a leading US dance institution in recent years. Peter Martins, the artistic director at New York City Ballet, retired in 2018 amid allegations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse, which he denied, and Marcelo Gomes, a star dancer at the American Ballet Theater, resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct. Gomes, who has danced with other groups since, has declined to comment about the allegation against him.There's some evidence that Powell was aware that his behavior with students was inappropriate, even years before the school launched its investigation.  A fifth former Ailey student, who asked not to be named to avoid damaging his contacts in the dance industry, shared with CNN screenshots of Facebook messages that he said Powell sent him in early 2013, before he arrived at a summer intensive program at Ailey. He said less than an hour after a mentor posted a photo of him on Facebook announcing his graduation from another dance school, Powell messaged him out of the blue: \"How are you babyboi?\" In a series of messages, Powell told the then-20-year-old dancer he could supplement his scholarship to help him pay for The Ailey School, and that the two could party together once the dancer arrived in New York. But Powell conditioned their friendship on a vow of secrecy.\"I want to help but you have to promise me you will not tell a soul... not even your mother,\" Powell wrote. \"Feels like I've been through this before and got into drama, not trying to go through it again.\"  From flirty messages to an alleged nightclub assaultRyan HoustonThe accounts the students shared with CNN followed a similar pattern: Powell started by complimenting their dancing, and then sent them sexual messages that were increasingly inappropriate -- and in a couple cases escalated to physical behavior. His actions came as a betrayal for students who had dreamed of joining Ailey for most of their lives. Ryan Houston said he fell in love with dance as a middle schooler in Los Angeles after attending an Ailey performance, and said dancing with the company was \"what I saw for myself since I was 11 years old.\" Houston was thrilled when he arrived at The Ailey School at age 21, he said, first through the summer intensive program and then full-time in the fall. He said he quickly met Powell, who cast him in a dance. \"He would give me a lot of, like, attention and looks and compliments,\" Houston said. But Powell soon started texting him increasingly flirty messages, he said.Houston said he felt uncomfortable with the texts, and had heard rumors about Powell, but he would laugh or brush off Powell's comments \"mostly because I didn't want to upset him -- because he was the one who picked who should be in the second company.\" As the decisions about admission into Ailey II approached, Houston said Powell invited him to get dinner. He decided to go, he said, to \"show him I'm fun, personable... like this would be a great person to take on tour.\" But the restaurant they went to was \"romantic\" and dark, Houston said. Over dinner, Powell asked him \"who I've been with, what do I like sexually,\" and \"kept curbing the conversation to anything sexual,\" Houston said.  Then Powell asked him to come to a nightclub, and Houston reluctantly agreed, he said. Powell bought him a drink, brought him to a corner, and then began groping his groin and butt, Houston said. Powell was \"trying to feel on me, trying to kiss me,\" he said. Houston, shocked, broke away and left. In the cab home, he said he got a text message from Powell telling him he was \"childish.\" The next day, Houston said, Powell stopped speaking to him, ignoring him completely. \"It was almost like a switch\" went off, he said. Later that year, when the new members of Ailey II were announced, Houston wasn't on the list. He said he was \"devastated,\" and that his colleagues and other teachers were surprised he didn't make the cut.  The following summer, Houston said, another leader at the company brought him back as an apprentice on Ailey II. But after he was rejected again for membership in the company, he said he went to the school's co-directors, Inman and Person, and told them about what happened with Powell. He said he didn't remember if he specifically told them about Powell groping him, but that he told them Powell was making inappropriate advances toward him.Their response, he said, was that they couldn't do anything without proof. They told him that \"if I were to make a big deal about this and nothing happens, then I would be looked at as a problem and I would kind of mess my chances up to ever getting in the first company,\" he said. \"I was told that since I don't really have any text message proof of that, I should just let it go and just work hard and come back next year and audition.\"Zunner, the Ailey spokesperson, said Inman and Person had never received reports about physical behavior by Powell. He didn't respond to further questions about Houston's allegations.Houston said he decided to let it go. He left the school, stopped dancing, and struggled with depression as \"my love for dance dwindled,\" he said. Houston said he no longer had the text messages he received from Powell because he got a new phone. But a former Ailey School teacher told CNN that Houston had showed him the text messages from Powell at the time. \"I don't remember the words, but it struck me as being intimidating and inappropriate,\" said the instructor, who asked that his name be withheld because he still has a relationship with the Ailey organization. \"It felt like someone asking you out on a date... I do remember it made [Houston] feel really uncomfortable. He didn't know how to deal with it.\" The instructor said he encouraged Houston to report the episode to Ailey leadership but he didn't do so himself because he felt Houston was strong enough to handle it on his own.Houston, who now lives in Los Angeles and manages an event planning company, said he decided to speak out about Powell's actions after seeing the TikTok video online, and because his eight-year-old son has started to show an interest in dance. \"It's bittersweet,\" he said -- he'd love to see his son following in his footsteps, but also worries about him having to face the same kind of harassment. \"Seeing him want to dance, you know, it makes me nervous,\" he said. A teen dancer's night at Powell's home Anthony DeCarlisWhen Anthony DeCarlis missed his train home to New Jersey late one night in 2003, the 19-year-old dance student barely thought twice about accepting Powell's offer to sleep over at his home, he said. DeCarlis, who grew up in Rochester, New York, still remembers the first video he saw of the Ailey company performing a piece called Hymn. \"I was like, 'Oh, my God. They are so fierce,\" DeCarlis said. \"It was just beautiful what you can do with your body and the way that you can express yourself through music. I've never seen anything like that.\" Making it even more powerful, he said, was that \"it was a Black dance company -- it was people that looked just like me.\" DeCarlis made it to Ailey as part of a summer intensive program in 2003 and found it flattering when Powell started paying attention to his dancing, he said. \"He's telling me that I'm such a good dancer,\" DeCarlis said. \"And it's kinda like, 'Oh, well, maybe I'm good.'\" Powell would often go out to bars with DeCarlis and other students, and Powell always seemed to know someone who could get DeCarlis inside even though he didn't have a fake ID, DeCarlis said. \"I'm like this little five-foot-three kid bouncing off the walls,\" he said. \"And then he's giving me alcohol.\" After one night on the town with Powell, DeCarlis, who was living in New Jersey at the time, missed the last train, he said. Powell invited him to stay the night at his place in Brooklyn. DeCarlis said he didn't worry about it because \"this is someone that I trust.\" But when they arrived at Powell's home, DeCarlis quickly realized there was only a single bed. When he laid down, he said Powell tried to \"cuddle up on me,\" and he felt Powell's erect penis \"trying to knock, knock, knock, knock on my back door.\" Peter Martins retires from NYC Ballet amid sexual harassment allegations\"I was so surprised,\" DeCarlis said. He said he immediately told Powell to get off him, and his teacher stopped. The next morning, as a shell-shocked DeCarlis left for his class, he said Powell gave him a gift: A Louis Vuitton duffel bag Powell told him he bought during an Ailey trip in Europe, to replace a knockoff DeCarlis had bought and frequently carried. After the incident, DeCarlis said Powell mostly stopped talking to him, other than occasional greetings in the hall. He said he was cut from a piece Powell had directed that he had been cast in. \"My name was written on the cast list,\" he said, \"and it was scratched off.\" Another instructor told him he was cut because his ballet level wasn't advanced enough, DeCarlis said. He said he didn't know whether the rejection had to do with him saying no to Powell. \"I was devastated,\" he said. He said he told a friend he danced with as a teenager about the episode with Powell. The friend, who asked not to be named to avoid hurting her dance career, told CNN she remembered DeCarlis telling her about Powell rubbing his penis against him, and about the Louis Vuitton bag, around the time it happened.  DeCarlis, now 36, continued to dance with other companies and the Metropolitan Opera House, and currently teaches ballroom dance. He said he was glad that Powell no longer works at Ailey. But he wants the school to make broader reforms and issue a public apology to former students harassed by the director.\"I literally have buried this somewhere in my subconscious,\" DeCarlis said. \"And this is how it's coming back out.\" After a lewd photo, opportunities disappearAddison EctorWhenever Powell popped his head into classes at the school, dance students always gave their best performances to impress him, students said. But some were warier than others. Addison Ector, who spent three years at the school starting in 2010, said that before he even arrived in New York he had been warned about Powell by one of his dance mentors. Louis Jones, his instructor at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in Los Angeles, had told Ector to \"watch out\" for Powell, who he said might try to make a pass at Ector, both Ector and Jones told CNN.  Jones himself had been a student at the Ailey School in the early 2000s, and during that time, Powell made sexual overtures to more than one student who confided in Jones, he said. At the time, Jones said he complained to Denise Jefferson, then a longtime director of The Ailey School, who died in 2010. Jones said that Jefferson took notes during their meetings and told Jones that he should \"allow her to handle the situation -- and to remain quiet about it.\" Jefferson told Jones not to \"broadcast this\" or \"get out to the public,\" he recalled. \"I believe that she didn't want the name of Alvin Ailey to be tarnished,\" he said. It's unclear what Jefferson did with that information. But when Ector arrived at Ailey years later, Powell was still in a leadership position. In 2011, during Ector's second year at the school, his goal was to get into Ailey II, so he said he danced as hard as he could whenever Powell watched him. They began to have small talk in the halls, and Ector said he then started receiving messages on social media from Powell.Powell invited him to events like balls -- late-night parties that celebrate vogue dancing -- but Ector declined every time, he said, using the excuse that he had ballet class early in the morning. Eventually, Powell sent Ector, then 19, a photograph of his penis, Ector said. The photo showed a man's chin and body, but not his face, so Ector said he assumed it depicted Powell.Ector said he showed the photo to his best friend, another Ailey School student who has since moved on to another dance company. The friend, who asked not to be named to avoid damaging her career, confirmed Ector's account to CNN. She said the man's jaw and torso looked like Powell to her. Ector deleted the photo and blocked Powell from messaging him, he said. \"In that moment, I just wanted it to be gone. I wanted it to be over with,\" Ector recalled. But another dancer and friend of Ector's, Claire Guthrie, who also overheard the story, said she was disturbed by the incident. She told CNN that she brought it up to a counselor during a wellness class, and then told the full story to Person, one of the co-directors, when she was asked who she was talking about.  After that, Inman called Ector into his office, where he and Person asked about the incident, Ector recalled. When Ector told them he had received a photo of his instructor's penis, they asked if the photo had Powell's face, Ector said.The directors said \"there's nothing that they can do because they can't prove that it was him in the photo,\" Ector said. He said he told them it came from Powell's number, but that didn't change anything. \"They were protecting him,\" Ector said. Zunner, the Ailey spokesperson, did not directly address Ector's allegations.At that point, Ector told his old teacher Jones, who said he reacted by calling Powell. \"I told Troy that Addison is my student that I sent there with the confidence and faith that he was going to get great training and wouldn't have to be subjected to sexual harassment,\" recalled Jones, who said he considered Ector like his child. He said he told Powell, \"You have to stop this. You've been doing this for years.\" Powell denied any wrongdoing, saying that \"Addison took it the wrong way,\" Jones said. Jones said he didn't report the incident to the school because he didn't want to hurt Ector's chances of succeeding at Ailey. But Ector quickly saw opportunities dry up anyway. He said that Powell had verbally offered him an apprenticeship at Ailey II -- but that he later learned he didn't get the position. Ector tried again during his third and final year at the school to audition for a spot in Ailey II, and was cut halfway through auditions, he said. He believes he wasn't given a fair shake because of what happened with Powell. After he left the school, Ector continued dancing with companies around the world. Earlier this summer, when the TikTok video showed up on his social media feeds, Ector posted his own Instagram video, telling his story to the camera. Powell's departure is \"a step in the right direction,\" Ector said, adding that he hoped Ailey can \"keep their legacy strong and just not let this one bad apple ruin the whole batch.\"Invitation to a sex partyMichael Bishop, who came to The Ailey School in 2011 after graduating from a university dance program in Mississippi, said his experience with Powell began when the teacher approached him one evening after class.\"Tell me more about you,\" Bishop recalled Powell saying. \"He was like, 'You should really audition for the second company,'\" and asked Bishop for his phone number.Bishop, then 24, was thrilled. \"I saw him as somebody who was trying to become a mentor,\" Bishop said. \"I didn't think twice about it.\"About a week later, Bishop said, Powell invited him to lunch. Over a meal at a restaurant near the school's building, Powell told him that students and teachers at Ailey sometimes have romantic relationships, Bishop said. \"My exact response was, 'I do not do student-teacher relationships outside of the professional realm, period,'\" Bishop said. He said Powell seemed shocked by the response and laughed it off.But Powell continued texting him and asking him to hang out, Bishop said. One night, he said Powell called him and urged him to go to a party.Powell told him, \"'I think you will like this party,'\" Bishop said. \"And I was like, \"What do you mean?\" He's like, 'Well, it's a sex party.'\"  Bishop said he told Powell he was disgusted by the idea, and Powell told him he was joking. After he hung up, he said he kept his distance from Powell. He said he didn't tell the school's administrators, or anyone else, because he doubted he would have been taken seriously.\"This is a major company,\" Bishop said. \"These people have tons of money. They're not going to just listen to this one person who says that this man has, like, tried something.\"A few months after his run-in with Powell, Bishop said, he left the school for a job performing with West Side Story in Europe. He said he no longer has the texts from Powell after getting a new phone.Bishop believed for years that he was the only person Powell had made inappropriate advances toward -- until he saw the social media videos in recent weeks. After Powell's exit, Bishop said he felt \"a mixture of crying and exhilaration and happiness.\"  \"He should have to pay for the things that he's done,\" Bishop said. Now, he added, Powell \"can't hurt anybody else.\"",

        "content": "Las Vegas (CNN)Steve Wynn slipped a pair of vampire teeth into his mouth and walked into an employee meeting at his glittering Las Vegas casino.  It was the day before Halloween 2006, and he would later say he wanted to lighten the mood.It didn't work.The 15 dealers he faced inside the Wynn Las Vegas -- all fuming over his new policy that greatly reduced take-home pay -- would later file a complaint against him with the National Labor Relations Board, saying he threatened to fire them if they unionized. They told a board judge that the mogul made his point by throwing a tantrum, shouting, belittling them and slamming his fist on a table. At least twice, they said, he boasted of being \"the most powerful man in Nevada.\"Read MoreThis week, Wynn stepped down as chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts after employee allegations of sexual misconduct roiled the value of the empire he created.  The 76-year-old businessman has denied the charges, detailed in an investigation by the Wall Street Journal. They include harassing female employees for decades and pressuring some to perform sex acts with him. Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver declined to comment on the allegations of Wynn employees in this story. Other public documents obtained by CNN, including the NLRB judge's decision, offer a glimpse into what it has been like to work for Wynn. A CNN reporter spoke with some of the people involved in incidents outlined in the documents. They confirmed the accounts in those records, but most did not want to be quoted. Each feared that talking about Wynn publicly would hurt them professionally in Vegas. His power and influence, they believe, still looms large.The documents suggest that whether you dealt cards, served cocktails or cleaned at Wynn's properties, it helped to understand who your boss was. He was Las Vegas personified -- a showman who played to win.Betting against him was risky.As the lawyer of one employee who challenged the billionaire put it: Wynn was not afraid to \"get rid of a fly by firing a shotgun.\"The mogul vs 'muggers and thieves' The October 30, 2006, meeting with the casino dealers came after months of contentious back-and-forth over a new policy that forced dealers to share their tips with supervisors. Dealers said the change cost them as much as 20% of their pay. The casino, Wynn Las Vegas, maintained that it wanted to correct a pay disparity; supervisors earned less than dealers who -- before the tip-sharing policy -- could make as much as $100,000 a year. Dealers argued that if Wynn wanted to give supervisors a raise, he should reach into his own pocket. Tensions further escalated when dealers claimed in the media that Wynn had insulted them. In the National Labor Relations Board document obtained by CNN, the dealers said Wynn had called them \"muggers and thieves.\" Fifteen dealers and several Wynn Resorts executives were in the room when Wynn strode in and grabbed a seat. An account of that meeting is contained in the decision issued in this case by the Labor Relations Board judge; it quotes testimony given by the dealers, by executives who spoke on Wynn's behalf and by Wynn himself. Ultimately, the judge would find that Wynn's actions violated the National Labor Relations Act. The act protects workers' right to organize and shields them from reprisals for seeking union representation.Numerous dealers said that Wynn began by acknowledging their opposition to the tip policy, according to the judge's decision, but told them there was nothing they could do to change it. Wynn mentioned two other Vegas businesses where employees voted to unionize or had gone on strike and lost their jobs. \"If you join [a] union, I can by law replace all 600 of you,\" dealer Tynisia Boone recalled Wynn threatening, \"and if you picket you will automatically be terminated because those are my sidewalks.\"Wynn denied that he threatened to fire anyone. He told the judge that he said, \"Nobody is getting fired.\" He only fired people for cause, he said, not for unionizing. He told the judge that he was only conveying to the dealers that union representatives can \"call people at home\" and \"intimidate\" employees while an employer like himself speaks \"on the record...publicly.\"Wynn opened the floor to questions, telling the dealers they should feel free to speak up. \"We all need to become a family again,\" the dealers recalled him saying.Steve Wynn, known as the king of Las Vegas, also operated major casinos in Macau, China. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu) Cynthia Fields, a single-mom with a toddler son, was seated next to Wynn. She spoke up, saying she had left a job at MGM Hotel to work at Wynn's casino. Dealing for Wynn, several workers told CNN, were coveted spots on the Las Vegas Strip because his casinos paid better than others. \"If I had known I was going to come here and I was going to have money taken away for nothing I had done,\" Fields told her boss, \"I possibly would not have made that change.\" She went on to tell Wynn that she was a single parent with a young son and the tips policy would mean she would lose $15,000 to $20,000 a year, a \"huge financial burden.\" According to her, Wynn replied, \"If $15,000 to $20,000 a year makes that big of a difference in your life, then you're doing something wrong.\" Another dealer testified to recalling this. Wynn then became loud and irate, she and others recalled. Fields said Wynn stood up from his chair and \"was leaning over me\" so intently that \"I could feel the spit on my face from his mouth.\" Dealer Tynisia Boone recalled \"Wynn got up and started screaming\" and then \"started getting up and down and slamming his hand and fist on the table.\" According to Boone and others, Wynn asserted that he was \"the most powerful man in Nevada.\"Dealer Tom Golly declared Wynn's attempts to take tips \"illegal,\" according to Boone. Wynn retorted that his \"name was on the building and he can do anything he wants to do,\" Boone said.In his testimony before the Labor Relations Board judge, Wynn admitted to banging his fist on the table. \"Yes ... that's the way I speak. I tend to be an emphatic person,\" he said. He said he couldn't remember telling Fields -- who he referred to in testimony as \"this gal\" -- that she was doing something wrong if losing $15,000 to $20,000 a year was a big deal.Asked by the dealers' attorney why two female dealers appeared to be teary-eyed during the meeting, Wynn answered that they came into the meeting that way. \"I'm certain it wasn't anything I said,\" he testified. Two Wynn Las Vegas executives spoke to the judge on the company's behalf. One said Wynn's behavior was \"animated\" in the meeting with dealers but denied that Wynn ever used the word \"terminated,\" or said he was the state's most powerful man.  Another executive denied that Wynn slammed his fist on a table before Wynn admitted he had done so in his own testimony. The judge's summary also referred to testimony from two dealers who supported Wynn. One said Wynn had offered to \"look into a bonus program\" after Fields spoke. Another recalled that Wynn knocked a water bottle over but couldn't recall him repeatedly standing up and sitting down, or uttering the words \"replaced\" or \"terminated.\" Neither denied that he threatened them with termination.Judge Burton Litvack ruled against Wynn, finding that his remarks about the futility of unionizing and \"derisive comments about the effects of union representation\" violated workers' rights to support a union under the National Labor Relations Act.  Wynn's \"statements and actions during the meeting must be viewed in the context of his desire to frighten and intimidate\" the dealers, Litvack wrote.The punishment was standard under the Act: The casino had to agree to refrain from repeating its violations of the labor laws and post a public notice saying they would not happen again. One dealer, feeling victorious, took a photo of that notice after it was hung on a wall at work. The dealer showed the photo to a CNN reporter.In his decision, which was not appealed, Litvack wrote that Wynn gave \"sardonic and disingenuous\" testimony and \"exhibited a haughty and insolent attitude while testifying.\" A decade later, Litvack told CNN this week that Wynn struck him as a \"chauvinist.\"Because of the age of the case, a transcript of the hearing was not available but Litvack told CNN that he \"came out of his chair\" listening to Wynn make \"very disparaging comments about the women who were at the meeting, particularly some of them that, I think it said, were crying. He was very demeaning about them crying.\"I think he called them gals -- not women, not employees. It's a very demeaning comment,\" Litvack said. \"It upset me. I believed the women.\"Waitress says she was called a 'blue whale'Eleven cocktail waitresses who worked for Wynn at The Mirage brought federal suit against him in 1997, claiming he discriminated against them because of their weight and age. The lawsuit was reported on this week by the Las Vegas Review-Journal which said that the newspaper in 1998 stopped publication of a reporter's story about the suit and its allegations that Wynn told servers they did not look good in their uniforms. JUST WATCHEDFormer cocktail waitress celebrates Wynn resignationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormer cocktail waitress celebrates Wynn resignation 01:13The Mirage settled the waitresses' claims by 2003, the terms of which were undisclosed, the Review-Journal reported.The paper last week interviewed a waitress, now 75, who it did not name, who alleged that Wynn sexually harassed her for a year and that she had sex with him. \"I did it willingly, because I felt I had to,\" she told the paper. \"I didn't really want to. I was afraid for my job.\"Wynn did not respond to the Review-Journal's story this week.He gave this statement after the Wall Street Journal's investigation into alleged sexual misconduct with employees: \"The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous. We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering the insulting publicity or engaging in multiyear lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.\" Read: Troubles for Wynn's Massachusetts' casino projectCharlotte Arrowsmith, the lead complainant in the cocktail waitresses' suit, spoke with CNN on the day Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts. She worked for Wynn for 17 years, she said, first at his Golden Nugget casino and then at The Mirage. She felt belittled the last five years of her employment, she said.She said she was called a \"blue whale,\" and dealers and supervisors \"would make the whale sounds like the whales make in the ocean\" when she and other servers put in drink orders. She wept at the news that Wynn resigned. \"Oh, hallelujah, thank you Lord! Something positive can come from this,\" she said. \"After all that he put us through, he needs to be humiliated.\"Read: Wynn is gone but board is under scrutiny Cleaning up On October 2, 2005, a woman who worked as a cleaning crew manager for Wynn walked into a Las Vegas police station, according to a narrative report the department provided to CNN. She said the casino owner had assaulted her. The incident began, Raquel Houston told police, when Wynn called her, yelling that he wanted her to come to the Lure Nightclub, a lounge at Wynn Resorts, \"at the speed of light.\" Houston described to CNN this week what she remembers happening.After Wynn ordered her to meet him, she said, he shouted, \"Now!\"Crews were working with big machines to clean marble at the club, and she worried that Wynn or someone else had been injured. She ran upstairs with her two assistant supervisors to find a casino executive and Wynn. \"He turns around to me and then he starts yelling at me and grabbing me tight and pulling on me,\" Houston told CNN. \"I was shocked. I couldn't believe that he was doing this.\"\"He was going, 'What is this crap? What is going on here? Who gave you authorization?' \"I was trying to answer his question,\" Houston recalled. \"I told him, 'This is the marble crew that does your floors every night.' I told him, 'Please stop grabbing me. Stop, let me go.'\"In 2006, Houston sued Wynn in civil court, describing her effort  \"to pull away\" from Wynn. He \"tightened his grip\" on her arm and \"continued to drag her,\" the suit said. \"After a significant struggle [Houston] was able to free herself.\"Her arm was injured in the incident, she alleged, and she had to get medical treatment, including therapy. She also needed \"ongoing treatment\" for \"emotional trauma and distress,\" the suit said.Houston told CNN that Wynn badly bruised her arm. She asked for damages in excess of $10,000 each for medical costs, lost wages, emotional distress and other compensation. Under Nevada law, suits for less than $50,000 must go to arbitration, and this case did.Wynn denied her allegations. He hired lawyers in New York for $39,027.40, according to a court filing, and lawyers in Las Vegas whose bill came to $100,830.95. Court papers show the legal battle stretched on for almost four years. During part of that time, Houston had no attorney. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Wynn, saying Houston failed to provide evidence and meet the burden of proof. Las Vegas police spokesman Lawrence Hadfield said investigative reports are not public in Nevada, but he told CNN that Houston's case went to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges.The billionaire wanted Houston to reimburse him  $49,124.53, according to a document filed by an attorney who took up her case. \"There is no other way to describe this approach\" wrote attorney M. Lani Esteban-Trinidad, \"other than to analogize it to attempting to get rid of a fly by firing a shotgun ...\"Houston told CNN she struggled to get a job in Las Vegas for years after she was fired from Wynn Resorts in 2009, the year the case ended. She is 57 now and still unemployed. Officials at other casinos, she said, have told her that they can't hire her because she challenged Wynn.\"It's been rough and horrible,\" she said, crying. She feels black-balled. The court ordered Houston to pay a portion of Wynn attorneys' fees and other costs totaling nearly $16,000. Houston said she had to file bankruptcy because of the case.\"It wasn't about money,\" her lawyer told CNN. \"To my feeling, it was just vindictive. \"I think he wanted to send a message to anybody that might want to challenge Wynn Resorts or Steve Wynn: It won't end well for you.\"  CNN's Miguel Marquez, Traci Tamura and Jaide Timm-Garcia contributed reporting to this story.",

        "content": "(CNN)During the Obama administration, high-profile police shootings of black men like Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Laquan McDonald in Chicago helped spark sweeping federal investigations and reforms of biased policing practices.  Now, a trio of wrenching deaths has again refocused the nation's attention on the racial prejudices ingrained in the country's justice system. Protesters have filled the streets in recent days demanding justice for George Floyd, who died as a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck; Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by Louisville officers entering her home allegedly without announcing themselves; and Ahmaud Arbery, who was gunned down by two white men who went free for more than two months until a video of the small-town Georgia slaying went viral.  L-R: Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.But under President Donald Trump, the Department of Justice has all but abandoned broad investigations into unconstitutional policing practices, a half-dozen former DOJ lawyers who worked on similar cases told CNN -- essentially giving up on one of the federal government's most effective tools to fight police misconduct. While the Justice Department launched 12 investigations of law enforcement agencies for practices that violate the Constitution during George W. Bush's first term, and 15 during Barack Obama's first term, the department has opened only a single public investigation of that kind in the three and a half years since Trump became president, according to legal experts and DOJ records.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the outrage in Minneapolis and around the country, \"the DOJ is needed more than ever,\" said William Yeomans, who spent 26 years at the department prosecuting cases involving police misconduct and hate crimes. The DOJ should \"examine the Minneapolis Police Department from top to bottom, every detail, every practice, every policy, every record of abuse of its power to use force, every complaint that has ever been launched against it,\" he said. \"But it isn't going to do that.\" Read MoreThe Justice Department has announced more limited investigations into several of the recent deaths. The US Attorney for Minnesota said last week that an investigation into the officers involved in Floyd's death was a \"top priority,\" and a lawyer for Arbery's family told CNN that federal officials had informed the family they intend to investigate the men who chased and shot him for possible hate crime charges. \"I am confident that justice will be served\" in the Floyd case, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement Friday, calling the video of Floyd's death \"harrowing to watch and deeply disturbing.\" A memorial of flowers and candles grows around the words \"I can't breathe\" in Minneapolis on May 30, 2020 in response to the death of George Floyd.Activists and elected officials have been calling for broader investigations. On Thursday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee wrote to the DOJ to demand investigations into the Minneapolis and Louisville police departments' practices, and a probe of why Georgia officials took so long to make an arrest and file charges in the Arbery shooting. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and 27 of her Democratic Senate colleagues have also called for a DOJ investigation into the Minneapolis department's practices.   But former DOJ attorneys said they doubt Barr would be interested in such wide-ranging cases. And even if investigations were opened, a department policy put in place by Barr's predecessor, Jeff Sessions, severely restricts prosecutors' ability to seek consent decrees, court-enforced agreements with police agencies that mandate reforms.A DOJ spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about the department's use of police investigations, or its plans to address the Floyd, Taylor and Arbery killings.  Michelle Obama: It's up to everyone to root out racismThe Trump administration, police unions, and other groups representing officers have argued that the Obama administration went overboard in prosecuting police, harming officer morale and making departments less effective.  And in recent weeks, the department has cited the same legal authority that allows it to crack down on police misconduct for another target: stay-at-home orders. In at least two cases so far, the DOJ has supported churches that sued their state or city objecting to stay-home orders during the Covid-19 pandemic, arguing that the orders were being unfairly enforced against churchgoers.  \"It's an abdication of their responsibility,\" said Emily Gunston, a lawyer who helped lead several DOJ investigations of police departments during the Obama administration. Without the department training its sights on law enforcement agencies, she said, \"it means that there's just no check on these police departments.\" A powerful tool to fight police misconduct Congress gave the Justice Department the power to investigate biased policing practices in 1994, in the wake of the police beating of black Los Angeles motorist Rodney King and five days of rioting in the city when four of the officers were acquitted about a year later. A new law let the DOJ open investigations and file civil lawsuits against any law enforcement agency with a \"pattern or practice\" of violating constitutional rights.  Peaceful protesters and violent instigators defy curfews after George Floyd's deathThose investigations typically last months or years and involve holding public meetings, interviewing officers and community members, analyzing data about the local justice system and digging into case files. Ultimately, the DOJ can file a lawsuit to put in place a court-enforced consent decree, which would require a law enforcement agency to make specific reforms and allow a federal judge to monitor their progress. Over the last two and a half decades, the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations collectively opened nearly 70 investigations of police departments and other law enforcement agencies around the country, leading to 20 consent decrees, according to DOJ documents and data compiled by The Marshall Project.The power was used most aggressively under the Obama administration, which stepped up the use of consent decrees. Court-enforced agreements in cities like Ferguson, Cleveland and Baltimore included laundry lists of reforms departments agreed to comply with, from deescalation training and body cameras to changes in law and more equitable hiring practices.  Michael Brown Sr. yells out as the casket of his son Michael is lowered into the ground during his funeral at St. Peters Cemetery in August 2014 in St. Louis. One high-profile shooting isn't enough to justify a pattern or practice investigation, former DOJ lawyers said -- but sometimes cases that capture the national attention help cast a spotlight on more systemic defects, such as police departments' excessive use of force or racially biased policies.  \"You can't look at one case in isolation,\" said Sharon Brett, an attorney at Harvard Law School's Criminal Justice Policy Program who worked on police investigations as a DOJ lawyer. \"You'd have to show the constitutional violation occurring across more than one case.\" George Floyd killing latest in string of police actions to stoke public anger in MinnesotaThe Minneapolis, Louisville and Glynn County, Georgia, police departments have never been the subject of pattern or practice investigations. And activists in all three jurisdictions have argued that the recent high-profile killings aren't isolated incidents but are examples of deeper-rooted problems.  In Minneapolis, a 2015 federal review conducted at the request of a former police chief found the agency faced \"community perception of disparate treatment of communities of color,\" \"inconsistent\" supervision of officers and flaws in how the agency flagged and tracked officers' bad behavior. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in 2013 that none of 439 police misconduct cases handled by a then-newly opened office resulted in a single instance of discipline. And the officer who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck had 18 prior complaints filed against him with the agency's internal affairs division, according to the Minneapolis Police Department.A demonstrator displays a \"Black Lives Matter\" sign Thursday, May 28, 2020, in St. Paul, Minnesota.Former Chief Janee\u00b4 Harteau told CNN that every recommendation the DOJ made in 2015 resulted in change at MPD, including renewed training for supervisors and the development of a system that flagged any complaints against officers early, no matter how minor, and kept track of those complaints and resulting discipline or coaching. She also commissioned a 2017 DOJ review of how the police can better handle protests. Demonstrations erupted in that city in the wake of a 2015 shooting of a black man by two white officers. One of the observations she said DOJ made was that police can do something simple to deescalate or at least prevent escalation during angry protests by simply not appearing confrontational. \"If officers didn't have to be in riot gear, we put them in polos and khakis,\" she said. \"And the city -- everyone on down, council members, everyone in leadership has to train for an event like what you are seeing today in Minneapolis.\" The city had begun to address that when the city's mayor demanded her resignation in 2017 after a high-profile police-involved shooting. Harteau said she doesn't know what training has happened since she left. The right and wrong answers to Trump's American carnageThe Louisville Metro Police Department has faced multiple lawsuits alleging officers used race as a pretext to pull over black motorists and conduct \"racially biased\" seizures, as well as a scandal over two officers using a police department mentorship program to sexually exploit teenagers. A department spokeswoman said it does not comment about pending litigation.And in Glynn County, a local grand jury declared in a report last year that the police department suffered from \"an ongoing culture of cover-up, failure to supervise, abuse of power and lack of accountability.\" The department has been engulfed in controversy involving alleged misconduct by a narcotics task force, which led to the police chief being indicted just days after Arbery was shot. (The chief, John Powell, has challenged the indictment and plans to plead not guilty, his lawyer told CNN.) Demonstrators protest the shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery at the Glynn County Courthouse on May 8, 2020 in Brunswick, Georgia. The Glynn County Police Department did not respond to CNN's request for comment.Christy Lopez, a Georgetown Law professor and former DOJ lawyer who worked on police practice cases, said that she found it important to pay attention to local officials' reactions after a high-profile shooting occurred.\"If the reaction is one of shock and surprise and an immediate attempt to figure out what happened,\" it's an indication that the incident might be an aberration, she said. But undue delays for law enforcement action after the Arbery and Taylor shootings could suggest \"there might be tolerance for similar conduct more broadly,\" she said.  Trump administration hits brakes on investigations  So far, the wide-ranging investigations and consent decrees that defined the Obama administration's approach to police misconduct have all but disappeared under Trump.  Since the President took office, the department has made public only a single pattern or practice investigation, former lawyers and civil rights law experts say: an April 2018 probe of the Springfield, Massachusetts, police department's narcotics unit. While two current and former officers were indicted on federal charges for unreasonable use of force against Latino juveniles later that year, the status of the broader investigation is unclear; a DOJ spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about its status. Pattern or practice investigations into police departments are typically made public, according to DOJ documents, and former lawyers said it would be all but impossible to conduct a full investigation in secret. Then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaking at a news conference on October 16, 2018.Sessions spoke out against consent decrees and police investigations as attorney general, ordering a review of existing decrees and arguing that the cases \"undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness.\" Before Sessions left the department in November 2018, he put in place a memo that required consent agreements to be \"narrowly tailored\" to the injury caused by misconduct and limited the use of court monitors, among other stipulations.The document \"required attorneys to jump through ridiculous hoops in order to pursue a consent decree,\" Yeomans said. It is essentially telling attorneys \"you cannot pursue the most effective tool you have for reigning in police misconduct.\"While Barr hasn't been as outspoken as Sessions about the issue, he said at his 2019 confirmation hearing that he generally supports the policies in Sessions' memo. Police blocked off a street as demonstrators marched in Chicago in December 2015. A video showing the shooting of Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer sparked almost daily protests in the city at the time. The administration has also abandoned some of the cases that were started under Obama, including a high-profile investigation into the Chicago Police Department. Two weeks after dash-cam video of an officer shooting and killing black teenager Laquan McDonald was released in November 2015, the DOJ opened a pattern or practice investigation in the Chicago department's use of force. That resulted in an extensive report on the department's practices and an \"agreement in principle\" the feds and the city signed in the last days of the Obama administration agreeing that the two parties would move forward with a consent decree.\u202f But after Sessions took over, the department decided not to move forward with pursuing a consent decree. In August 2017, then-Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan essentially stepped into the role left open by the department, filing suit against the city of Chicago, and later won a consent decree despite Sessions' objections. A serious divide exists among Trump advisers over how to address nights of protests and riots in US after Floyd's deathUnder Trump, the department's Civil Rights Division has continued to investigate conditions in prisons and juvenile justice systems, and has prosecuted individual malfeasance by law enforcement officers -- which could continue with potential prosecutions of the officers in the Minneapolis or Louisville shootings. In addition to the Springfield case, the department sued the Baltimore County Police Department in August 2019 alleging that its hiring practices discriminated by race -- but that case didn't involve the county's actual policing activity.\u202fAnd DOJ lawyers are continuing to help enforce consent decrees that are already on the books, legal observers say.\u202f Meanwhile, the team that handled police practice cases saw numerous staff departures after Sessions made clear those investigations weren't a priority, several former lawyers who worked in the group told CNN.  \"The Trump administration has intentionally stripped its own capacity to address problems in local policing,\" said Margo Schlanger, a University of Michigan law professor who tracks civil rights litigation. \"They had all these tools... On some of them, they've cut off their own hands, on some they've tied their hands behind their back.\" George Floyd's brother says Trump 'didn't give me an opportunity to even speak' during phone callThe president himself has also seemed to encourage police misconduct. In a 2017 speech in New York, he told uniformed officers \"please don't be\u202ftoo nice\" with suspects. \"When you guys put somebody in the car and you're protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over?\" Trump said, making a motion with his hand to imitate an officer preventing a suspect's head from hitting a squad car. \"I said, you can take the hand away, okay?\" His press secretary later said he was joking. Early Friday morning, the president tweeted about the Minneapolis protests, threatening to send in the military and declaring \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" That's a phrase that appears to have been coined in 1967 by a controversial Miami police chief who bragged that his department didn't mind \"being accused of police brutality\" -- although Trump said later Friday he didn't know the phrase's origins and hadn't meant it as a threat. Some police unions and officer advocacy groups have argued that the Obama administration went too far in its investigations of some police departments. Consent decrees hurt officer morale and made police departments less effective, and Sessions and Barr are right to reduce their use, they say. Louis Dekmar, a former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and a police chief in Georgia, worked as a DOJ police monitor between 2004 and 2007 making sure that a police department in his state made federally requested improvements.  Given the number of problems at the Glynn County Police Department, he thinks the DOJ should conduct a sweeping investigation of its practices. The protest pictures alone tell the story of America's racial hierarchyBut he also said that the DOJ went overboard in attempting to institute changes in departments it investigated during the Obama administration. The DOJ \"started mandating principles and philosophy like what kind of policing an agency should be doing, what constitutes community policing,\" he said. \"That's why you saw the frustrations you did from police unions. It was too much.\"  In contrast, he said, the Trump administration has given large grants to the police chiefs association to train officers, which Dekmar argued was an effective way to improve policing.  Arresting reporters at a protest is an affront to the First AmendmentStill, activists say stronger federal oversight could help defuse some of the anger that has caused protests to devolve into violence in recent days. When people lose confidence that police misconduct will be punished, \"you have what's going on right now: citizens operating out of order because the justice system hasn't been operating in order,\" said Rev. John Perry, the president of the local NAACP branch in Glynn County, where Arbery was shot and killed. \"Part of securing the peace is showing our citizens we're serious about accountability.\" From investigating police to challenging stay-at-home orders Even as federal police investigations have all but disappeared, the DOJ has used the same statute that allows it to crack down on rogue law enforcement agencies for another target in recent weeks: Covid-19 stay-at-home orders. In at least two cases so far, DOJ lawyers have backed lawsuits by churches against governments that are banning them from operating under restrictions on gatherings. Bans that are unfairly applied to churchgoers and not to people conducting other essential activities violate the Constitution, the department argued, citing the same law that bans police departments from systematically singling out people of a certain race.  JUST WATCHEDBottoms: 'Extremely concerned' about coronavirus at protestsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBottoms: 'Extremely concerned' about coronavirus at protests 05:10So far, the department has weighed in on cases filed by local churches against Greenville, Mississippi, and the Democratic governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam. Federal lawyers also filed a brief Friday supporting seven Michigan businesses suing that state's Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, over her order, although they didn't specifically cite the same statute.   Virginia \"cannot treat religious gatherings less favorably than other similar, secular gatherings,\" the DOJ wrote in its brief supporting an evangelical church that faced criminal charges after holding a service with 16 people. The department argued that the Northam's stay-home order unfairly bans \"church services or other religious gatherings that exceed ten people, despite permitting various other gatherings that may result from secular activities.\" JUST WATCHEDBooker calls for national police misconduct registryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBooker calls for national police misconduct registry 03:25The Virginia case is still being litigated, although a federal judge denied the church's request for a temporary restraining order. The Mississippi lawsuit led the city to change its policy and allow drive-in services as long as churchgoers kept their windows rolled up.  Federal officials could get more involved in similar cases in the coming days and weeks, after Trump on May 22 said he was ordering governors to \"allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now\" -- a directive that legal experts said may not be enforceable.  Former DOJ lawyers say it's ironic that the department is suddenly using the same statute it has all but given up on for police cases.  \"They are using the police misconduct statute -- for the second time in three years -- in a case where plaintiffs are not even suing the police,\u202fbut rather the Democratic governor,\" Lopez said. \"It certainly raises the question in my mind whether this is more about politics than police accountability.\" CNN's Eliott McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

He then turns toward a kneeling woman, her hands raised in protest. The officer suddenly lunges and shoves her. Then, a female officer appears. She swats her male colleague back toward a line of patrol cars, waving her arm and appearing to upbraid him for what he did.   \"Thank you!\" a protester shouts at Officer Krystle Smith, who won praise for her actions on social media and from police leaders around the country.Fort Lauderdale police have identified Steven Poherence as the officer seen on video appearing to shove a female protester who was kneeling on the ground as tensions rose Sunday night downtown. pic.twitter.com/2HD8q1Xe1M\u2014 Parker Branton (@ParkerWPLG) June 1, 2020\n\nNeither Smith nor Officer Steven Pohorence, who is suspended pending an outside investigation, were allowed to comment on the incident.Read More\"I was proud of her,\" said Ivonne Roman, the former police chief in Newark, New Jersey, who has been fighting for years to push her profession to hire more women. \"That is why we need more women in policing. Statistically, they do not escalate; they de-escalate.\" As protests over the police killing of George Floyd have refocused national attention on police abuses and use of force, law enforcement experts and leaders say one powerful reform would be simple: Hire more women. Women make up only about one out of every eight sworn police officers nationwide, according to federal statistics. A female officer is seen while protests continued over the death of George Floyd in Brooklyn on June 6, 2020. Law enforcement agencies do not recruit, retain or promote women at the same rate they do men -- even though research suggests that if they did, the nation would see far fewer tragedies like the killings of Floyd, Laquan McDonald or Eric Garner.   Research has shown that women cops are less likely to face sustained allegations of excessive force than their male colleagues, and that women officers cost cities less in civil lawsuit settlements for such incidents and are the subject of fewer citizen complaints. Another study found that women police injure suspects less.When it comes to routine use of force, studies have come to varying conclusions about whether gender is a factor. CNN analyzed data from four of the few metropolitan police departments that publish data about the gender of the officers involved in use of force incidents. In all four cities -- Cincinnati, Indianapolis, New Orleans and Orlando -- female officers were involved in a smaller percentage of incidents than their share of the department. But more than a dozen experienced cops, law enforcement professionals and researchers told CNN that women in police departments face obstacles, from fitness tests that emphasize brawn over people skills, to pervasive harassment from some male colleagues.   A female police officer uses police tape to cordon off an area outside a restaurant in Hollywood, California, in January 2017.\"Policing -- everyday policing -- is about social services: domestic violence cases, dealing with people's mental health problems, getting victims to open up, negotiating,\" said Maureen McGough, the Chief of Staff for the Policing Project at New York University Law School. \"But recruitment ads you see for police are still using that macho guy with a gun. And the physical fitness tests to get into the police academy still favor upper body strength, something that has nothing to do with how good a cop you're going to be.\" If the United States is serious about police reform, experts said, then law enforcement has to finally make equal room and opportunity for women.  \"Policing as an institution was constructed and run by men, so the system in which we are still operating, what we value, the people we recruit, it still reflects that male culture,\" McGough said. \"I don't think most Americans understand that.\" How women handle policingFor at least two decades, the percentage of women serving as officers in local police departments has slightly increased to around 12%. There are even fewer women in police leadership: In 2016, the most recent year for which national data is available, less than 3% of chiefs and 10% of first-line supervisors were women, according to the federal government-run Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics survey.  Among 20 of the largest 25 police departments in the country that provided data to CNN, the percentage of sworn women officers ranges from 10.6% in San Antonio to 25.2% in Detroit. Large metro law enforcement agencies tend to have higher rates of women officers than small local departments, many of which employ no women, according to federal data. \n\nIn several other western democracies, officers are far more likely to be women than in the United States. Recent figures show women represent more than a third of police in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In England, Wales and Australia, women make up over 30% of police; in Canada 22%.  Thirty years of research suggests that the dearth of American women with a badge could be exacerbating excessive use of police force.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nWomen officers are the subject of fewer citizen complaints and sustained allegations of excessive force than their male colleagues, according to a study in 2002. That research, considered by experts to be a landmark look at the differences between genders in policing, also shows that women cost municipalities and agencies less money in civil liability payouts compared to men. The latter finding has been supported by additional research that shows  women use less force and local investigations examining lawsuits. In Minneapolis, for example, only three of more than 50 officer conduct lawsuits settled between 2010 and 2014 involved women accused of excessive force, a Minnesota Public Radio investigation found.  Research also indicates that when male officers are paired with female officers, they use less force, and women paired with each other are the least likely to use extreme force. While 30% of male officers have fired their weapon while on duty, only 11% of female officers have, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey found. While every person is different, women generally tend to be socialized to talk rather than shout, negotiate rather than bully and empathize rather than order, police leaders and researchers said.  A female police officer and others process the scene of a shooting in Grand Forks, North Dakota, on May 27, 2020.\"I was on the street for many years, involved in all kinds of critical incidents, and force was never my first response,\" said Jane\u00e9 Harteau, who served as the Minneapolis police chief between 2012 and 2017. \"I would much rather not fight my way out of a situation. I'll do it if I have to, but if I can get the cuffs on and we're done, great.\"  \"Women invented de-escalation,\" Harteau said. \"It's called communication.\" On the long list of high-profile police killings that have sparked protests around the country, the vast majority of officers accused are male -- from Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis to Darren Wilson in Ferguson to Daniel Pantaleo in New York.  One of the few fatal incidents involving a woman officer that received national attention in recent years was the 2018 killing of Botham Jean, a Black man who was shot in his apartment in Dallas by Officer Amber Guyger, who said she thought she was entering her own apartment. Guyger is serving a 10-year prison sentence after being convicted of Jean's murder last year.What the data revealsCNN's analysis of data from four cities supports the idea that women officers use less force. Women officers in Orlando carried out 8% of the uses of force between 2009 and May 2019, while they make up 17% of the department. In Cincinnati, women officers carried out 13% of episodes of use of force from 2000 through September 2018, while they currently comprise 23% of the total officers.  In Indianapolis, women officers carried out 9% of uses of force from 2014 through last month, while they currently make up 13% of the officers.\u202fAnd in New Orleans, women officers carried out 10% of uses of force from 2016 through November 2019. They made up 22.5% of the department in 2016, the latest year for which federal data is available.\u202f Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard, middle, looks up as Honolulu Fire Department and HPD helicopters drop flowers onto a procession for police Officer Tiffany-Victoria Enriquez on January 30, 2020.There's also some evidence that women officers used more serious force at lower levels than their male colleagues. For example, in New Orleans, which ranks use of force in four levels by seriousness, women carried out just 7.5% of police uses of force at the highest level, which include discharging their firearm, putting someone in a neck hold or striking a handcuffed suspect.  Women in policing tend to have different skillsets, said Liana Perez, the director of operations for NACOLE, a national group of civilian police oversight agencies.\"Sometimes they benefit from de-escalation skills or the ability to talk people down,\" Perez, who previously worked as the independent police auditor for the city of Tucson, said. \"And on the flip side, for the most part, suspects or individuals they are encountering are less likely to get into a physical confrontation with a woman than with a man.\" Where are the women?Police departments face two problems in increasing the number of women with a badge: Recruiting them and keeping them on the force. That starts, experts said, with the way some departments advertise for new recruits -- with commercials that predominantly feature men and deliver a more \"Die Hard\" than \"Officer Friendly\" image of policing -- guns blazing, men repelling down buildings, and high-octane car chases. Ads that highlight big guns and militaristic standoffs have been used to recruit new officers in cities from Alexandria, Louisiana to Brunswick, Georgia to Melbourne, Florida, and even places like Palo Alto, California -- a wealthy Silicon Valley suburb that had 90 incidents of violent crime in 2017, the year the ad was released.In Gainesville, Florida, the police chief stopped using a 2014 recruitment ad that depicted scene after scene of men shooting guns over heavy metal music, a spokesman said, because he decided it didn't represent day-to-day police work. Though the department stopped linking to it on its website and airing it locally in the fall of 2015, it remained on the agency's YouTube channel until a CNN reporter asked the department about it last week. JUST WATCHEDNYPD officer suspended after apparent chokehold incidentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNYPD officer suspended after apparent chokehold incident 01:26Female recruits also face barriers in passing fitness tests that are still required for many police departments around the country. In New Jersey, about a third of female recruits (31%) failed the state police academy's fitness test in 2017, while only 2% of male recruits did, according to an investigation by the Asbury Park Press and USA Today Network. In Colorado Springs, a federal judge ruled in 2017 that the local police department's fitness test discriminated against women, leading the department to stop using the test and awarding the 12 plaintiffs a more than $2.4 million settlement. Half of female recruits failed that test, while only 6% of male recruits did, according to the judge's ruling.  But experts say most police work is based more on interpersonal skills than upper body strength, and that those tests can arbitrarily make it more difficult for women to succeed.  Some departments have already started to reform fitness tests. In Texas, the state Department of Public Safety released a model policy that replaces tests involving push-ups, running, or pull-ups with a single rowing test that has differing requirements based on age, gender and weight. Several cities like Austin have adopted it.  However, even cities that have reformed their testing can still have biased recruiting processes. When Lt. Eve Stephens started a new role at the Austin department handling personnel, she realized how few women were graduating from the department's police academy. Only 11% of the officers in Austin are female, one of the lowest percentages among the largest metro departments.  Stephens discovered several male academy instructors second-guessing them when they tried to use de-escalation tactics in their role playing exercises, she said. A recruit reported that an instructor told her that he was going to make it \"his job\" that she not graduate, Stephens told CNN. Another recruit, a stay-at-home mother, told Stephens that a male instructor told her, \"are you even ready for this?\"  JUST WATCHEDWhat would the US look like without police? ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat would the US look like without police?  02:17Stephens said she successfully pushed for both instructors to be transferred from the academy.  \"I just thought, 'Where the hell are all the women?'\" said Stephens, who started a mentoring program for female recruits in 2018. \"We were recruiting a lot of women and a lot of women started at the academy, but attrition was twice that of the men.\" The Austin Police Department did not respond to the instances described by Stephens about academy instructors, but in a statement said it holds recruiting sessions focused on women where applicants can talk with women officers. Any incidents of inappropriate comments or behavior are prohibited, the department said, and if they are substantiated, the offending person will be reprimanded and could be fired.  'Here, kitty, kitty': What moving up the ranks can feel likeOnce women become police officers, another huge barrier to keeping them in the profession is the treatment some face from their own male colleagues.  When Harteau started her policing career in Minneapolis in the late 1980s, she said, officers would regularly make sexually suggestive comments to her. \"I could handle that,\" she said.  Former Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau speaks at a news conference in December 2015.But the harassment Harteau and her female partner faced escalated. Their patrol car was vandalized, she said, and property that should have gone to the evidence room mysteriously wound up in their car. Officers \"consistently\" wouldn't respond to their calls for backup, she said.  \"One time we had a chase with a stolen car and the guy bails, and I'm trying to air a description, and one of the guys gets on the radio and starts saying, 'Here, kitty, kitty,'\" Harteau recalled. \"It was degrading.\" The Internal Affairs department didn't take their complaints seriously, Harteau said, so she and her partner filed a discrimination and hostile work environment complaint with the state Department of Human Rights, which they won. The police department referred a request for comment about the case to the City Attorney's Office, which declined to comment, and the state department did not respond to a request for comment.Demonstrators say public safety re-imagined is a future without policeHarteau had a choice: Quit or keep her badge and press on. She rose to chief \"because I never went away,\" she said. And even as chief, she faced second-guessing from the male-dominated department when she tried to promote more women, she said.  Harteau resigned at the mayor's request in 2017 after an officer shot and killed a woman who had called 911 to report a rape. The officer was convicted of murder and manslaughter. There had been another controversial police shooting during her tenure.But Harteau also tried to improve the department. Twice she brought in the US Department of Justice to review police practices. Those efforts, she said, resulted in the police creating a better system to track officer complaints and staff getting training on how to interact with protesters. \"Throughout my career I have always done considerable self-reflection, evaluating what I do,\" she said. \"Every day did I do my best? Probably not. Some days you are stronger and can get more accomplished, but did I make things better than when I [started]? I think so.\" There's no playbook for the battle between mayors and police right nowAbout 14% of Minneapolis officers are female, according to the department.   More than 30 women officers from across the country shared similar stories with Natalie Todak, a University of Alabama criminology assistant professor. She interviewed women who've been promoted to elite police units such as bomb squads or SWAT teams. Their male colleagues told them things like the unit had been \"pussified\" since they joined, Todak said. The women in the study are promised anonymity, Todak said, because to speak publicly about their harassment \"would turn a woman into a pariah\" and threaten her career.  Instead, she said, they find ways to cope. They use humor. They keep their head down.  That is what Wendy Stiver tried to do. At Dayton Police Department, where she worked for more than two decades, someone once left a feminine hygiene product affixed to an evidence slip on the windshield of the cruiser she shared with another female officer, she said.  Even after she rose to major, the sexist antics continued: A male sergeant's name plate was placed on the woman's bathroom door, she said, and a feminine hygiene product was stuck on another male sergeant's door.  \"They're making these locker room jokes,\" said Stiver, who now works as an executive with the Charleston, South Carolina, police department. \"That was the locker room culture.\"  Stiver said she never reported these incidents because she did not believe it would result in change. A Dayton police spokeswoman said the agency can't verify those alleged incidents happened since they were not reported, adding that the department is trying to create a culture \"inclusive of all people.\" How police departments can do betterPolice leaders say departments are making more of an effort to increase the number of women in their ranks now than ever before -- and the protests over Floyd's death show how important that work is.   Roman, the former Newark chief, said she and other law enforcement professionals are fighting for what she's calling \"30 by 30 Initiative,\" the ambitious goal of raising the percentage of female representation in law enforcement to 30% by 2030.  And it's not just female police chiefs who are taking gender disparities seriously. Luther Reynolds, the police chief in Charleston, South Carolina, said recruiting women is one of his top priorities, and he recently removed or reassigned officers who had questioned his decision to promote a young female lieutenant.  \"Some of the women I policed with I felt safer with, because they had patience, empathy... they knew how to talk to people,\" Reynolds said. \"Maybe they didn't bench press 300 pounds, but they had other skills to navigate really gnarly situations.\"  In Houston, Police Chief Art Acevedo said he has made a point of promoting more women. Now, just over half of the department's assistant chiefs and division commanders are female.   Those leaders are \"not placed there just because they're a woman -- it's because they're damn good,\" Acevedo said. \"It doesn't require testosterone to do the job.\" How we reported this storyTo study use of force by female officers, CNN analyzed public use of force data from four departments that include officers' gender in their databases: Cincinnati, Indianapolis, New Orleans and Orlando.  None of the databases appear to include fatal uses of force. The data for Cincinnati, Indianapolis and New Orleans included each individual use of force by an officer against each individual suspect -- so if one officer pointed their gun at three suspects in one incident, that could be counted as three uses of force. For the Orlando data, incidents were counted separately, so each officer counted may have used force against multiple people.Correction: This story was corrected to reflect that Janee Harteau's policing career began in the 1980s, not 1990s.",

If he leaves the embassy, British police say, he'll be arrested. Apparently fed up with the waiting game, late this week police sent a note to Assange asking him to turn himself in. He's apparently ignoring it.This is just the latest Assange nail-biter since he became globally famous two years ago for publishing a trove of classified U.S. documents and sensitive State Department cables, acts that angered a lot of people who'd like him to go away.Assange is dangling from a cliff, for sure.Hanging by a pinky finger next to him -- WikiLeaks. \"Could the site itself go? Yes. As an idea, though, WikiLeaks isn't dead. The idea, the spirit, of leaking online is much bigger than WikiLeaks, and there are groups trying to do it,\" said former Guardian journalist and Columbia University journalism professor Emily Bell, who taught a class about ethics and WikiLeaks. JUST WATCHEDAssange resisting extradition ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAssange resisting extradition  01:00The operative word is \"trying.\"\"WikiLeaks has shown that, in real life, facilitating leaks takes a lot of money and it leaves a lot of people vulnerable,\" she said.The future of leaking online is bright, she said, but any WikiLeaks aspirants will have to figure out one thing.How do you become a symbol of transparency yet hide much of how you operate? \"The trick and brilliance about WikiLeaks is that it was set up to evade law,\" Bell said, noting WikiLeaks had servers in different countries so no single territory could legally shut the site down. \"Most mainstream publishers are just not in that business. They are still not comfortable with that. You saw even the most sophisticated and financially strong groups unable to do this.\" The New York Times has shelved an idea to set up a system for leakers. Former executive editor Bill Keller talked about the idea in 2011. The Times worked with WikiLeaks to release leaks in 2010.\"The technology was too complicated,\" Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades-Ha told CNN this week. The newspaper is still open to the idea, she added, but won't be working on it \"anytime soon.\" A list for would-be leakersBeyond technology, there are huge challenges to creating a leaking site, lessons that perhaps only the past two years of travails at WikiLeaks could have taught.JUST WATCHED101: WikiLeaks revealedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH101: WikiLeaks revealed 00:59Here's the list of must-do's to pull it off: 1. A site must publish relevant and important leaked information and have the staff to vet it, even if it's a huge amount of data. The dominant aesthetic of sites that publish leaks is text, text and more text, which can dizzy the eye and feel overwhelming. Consider presentation, design. Keep in mind that readers are smart, but they are busy and cannot, probably, read a quarter-million U.S. State Department cables.2. It has to build and maintain a communication-sharing infrastructure that protects the identity of leakers. That helps establish credibility and makes people less afraid to send information. 3. It has to be ready to pay -- in money and reputation -- for the consequences of leaking. WikiLeaks began having money problems, Assange said, not long after the 2010 published leaks. Assange claimed that various institutions and corporations had hit the site with a financial blockage. The WikiLeaks founder even joked in an online ad about how much it costs to be in the business of leaking, riffing on the classic MasterCard ads:20 secure phones to assist in staying anonymous -- $5,000Fighting legal cases across five countries -- $1 millionUpkeep of servers in over 40 countries -- $200,000Donations lost due to banking blockades -- $15 millionAdded cost due to house arrest -- $500,000Watching the world change as a result of your work -- pricelessShadow and LightMuch of Assange's work at WikiLeaks was done with the help of German computer scientist Daniel Domscheit-Berg. For more than a year he has been at the helm of a project anticipated by some as WikiLeaks' heir apparent. Domscheit-Berg registered the domain for OpenLeaks.org in 2010, two days after he resigned from WikiLeaks. Domscheit-Berg wrote in his memoir that he could no longer work with Assange or accomplish what he felt was WikiLeaks' goal since the massive 2010 leaks began. He wrote that Assange was a \"megalomaniac\" and that he could run a more transparent and focused site.OpenLeaks is now live, but it doesn't publish any leaks. It doesn't edit or release documents, but enables third parties to publish them. For example, if someone had information that revealed something untoward was happening in higher education, he or she could send that to an education organization without OpenLeaks even having access to it. Have a story and documents for a news organization? Use OpenLeaks to send it securely, the group says. Watch a video that describes how OpenLeaks works.Other sites touted last year as WikiLeaks 2.0 don't appear to have taken off. Websites don't work, and it's unclear who is running what organization anymore, if they still exist. There's a general opaqueness in online leaking, which isn't surprising, given all the stresses involved in the practice. One site mentioned sometimes by hackers and others is wikispooks.com. The site \"invites 'whistleblower' type material through an anonymous upload facility which can be utilized in as secure a fashion as is possible on the vast spying machine that is today's World Wide Web.\" CNN e-mailed an address on the Wikispooks site -- the only way it provides to communicate. CNN received a reply declining to talk about WikiSpooks. But the writer, whose identity CNN cannot verify, provided three links: The first describes what WikiSpooks is; the others address its \"rationale\" and \"Anonymous Uploads.\"There are other organizations happy to discuss their efforts to facilitate leaks online.One of them is 100Reporters, which launched in October. The brainchild of former New York Times reporters relies on a network of experienced journalists who report stories focused on global corruption. The site's \"Whistleblower Alley\" allows users to anonymously upload information and tips, said founder Diana Schemo. When a message is sent, it is automatically encrypted. Schemo receives a notice alerting her to the message. Only she possesses a code that can unscramble the encryption, Schemo explained.The site isn't designed to receive large caches of documents, so someone sending a message would have to write that they have documents they'd like to send, and then 100Reporters decides whether to provide that person access to transmit those documents. The site explains in detail the various measures the group takes to help ensure security.The idea for 100Reporters was conceived in 2010, the same year WikiLeaks became internationally famous for leaking the Afghan War Log and the Iraq War Diary, and the Arab Spring began to take root. \"We saw that people in different countries had trouble getting out information about corruption without tipping off a regime that would crack down on them,\" Schemo said. 100Reporters is funded by the Ford Foundation, and several experienced lawyers advise the organization for free.Whistleblower Alley has not received any document leaks from whistle-blowers that have been vetted and become stories, said Schemo, but the site continues to get tips that turn into larger stories that its reporters work on. 100Reporters was well into its development when Al Jazeera launched its \"Transparency Unit\" in January 2011, which also says it offers a secure way for leakers to upload information.According to Al Jazeera, only certain journalists within the organization who work with the unit can access the information. This past year the unit has been embroiled in controversy for publishing a document dubbed \"The Palestine Papers,\" a play on the Pentagon Papers, which were leaked to The New York Times by a whistle-blower in the 1970s.  The Palestine Papers contained minutes of a meeting among negotiators with the Palestinian Authority, the United States and Israel, according to Al Jazeera's reporting.The news outlet said it was the largest leak of confidential files in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, contained more than 1,600 documents and offered \"an unprecedented window\" into Israeli, Palestinian Authority, U.S., European and Arab relations and \"closed-door\" negotiations. The international press covered the release of the papers and reaction to them. \"Palestine papers\" became a trending topic on Twitter.Al Jazeera obtained the documents and then shared them with the Guardian, according to journalists with the British newspaper.The leak prompted Saeb Erakat, the former Palestinian chief negotiator, to file a complaint citing privacy violations with the United Kingdom's broadcasting regulator. The regulator ruled in favor of the media in October, the Guardian reported.Al Jazeera spokesman Osama Saeed declined a request by CNN to talk about the transparency unit.A veteran at leaking, since 1996There's at least one site that has stood the test of time (relative to the Internet) when it comes to leaking online. Cryptome.org has been live since 1996. It is billed as a secret-spilling site that \"welcomes documents\" that are \"prohibited\" from release by \"governments worldwide,\" including classified material. It doesn't vet information and makes no effort to explain documents that are uploaded. It has been criticized for making e-mail addresses and other identifying information available with only a few keystrokes.Recently, Cryptome republished a set of racy e-mails originally uploaded to Flickr that suggested an affair between the Obama administration's nominee to be the next U.S. ambassador to Iraq and a Wall Street Journal reporter.In 2010, the site reportedly leaked internal documents about Microsoft guidelines for how the company can provide user data to law enforcement. Wired magazine reported that Microsoft managed to get the site shut down.Cryptome upset the Department of Homeland Security by publishing a document about security at the Democratic National Convention, CNET reported in 2004.New York architect John Young runs the site. Now in his 70s, Young is considered the grandfather of leaking online, a swami in the art of cryptography, data sharing and deciphering code. He told CNN that the site has never vetted information it posts.\"We don't promise what we are doing is true. We want the public to decide,\" Young said. \"We don't trust authenticators of any kind. It's another form of control to authenticate.\"He worked with Assange in the early days of WikiLeaks.\"People in government and others may be upset, but we can't stop the leaks,\" said Young. \"They can blame journalists or us but we aren't the problem. The problem is people inside organizations who are leakers and want this information out, and they're going to keep doing it.\" Young said he isn't afraid to continue posting leaks in light of the prosecution of U.S. Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning. Manning has been behind bars for more than two years and faces life in prison if found guilty in a court-martial proceeding on charges of stealing classified material. Information Manning is suspected of taking was published on WikiLeaks.\"There is a lot of smoke and lightning about Manning; there's not much that's going to be done to him,\" Young said.The Manning case, and controversy surrounding Assange and global media coverage of the antics of Anonymous, the hacker collective, have driven more eyeballs to Cryptome, Young said.  \"We're glad that Julian got famous because it brought us attention, but we're happy to take a back seat to much of that attention,\" said Young. Cryptome is going to continue to publish documents. \"What is the alternative?\" Young asked. \"That information not get out there?\"\"You can call us radical, you can call it whatever you like,\" he said. \"But we've been here much longer than WikiLeaks and we'll be here long after.\" Do you think there should be more sites like WikiLeaks?

        "content": "Story highlightsFor years, Syria's first lady had Princess Di imageShe was raised in London and worked in financeTalking about the Gaza War to CNN in 2009: \"Where in the world could this happen?\"In her Vogue photograph she is beautiful, wrapped in a luxurious fuchsia pashmina. She's very rich, as the story repeatedly conveys, a stern mother of three, a woman who tries to make it happen everyday while, of course, teetering in her beloved Christian Louboutin heels.Vogue's spring 2011 profile of Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was highly controversial. The piece called the British-born 36-year-old a \"rose in the desert\" but didn't  mention Syria's abysmal human rights record. In March, protests began spreading around the country -- and met brute force from the regime led by Asma's husband. After intense criticism in the media, Vogue reportedly first defended the piece then removed the story from its website. Since then, little has been reported about Asma Al-Assad. It's not even clear where she is. Could she have returned to her native England, where she attended fancy prep schools and got her college degree? Or is she still in Syria with her husband, as he fends off pressure from the growing protest movement and the many governments that have called on him to step down? Syria's first family: Who are they?Bashar al-Assad has denied responsibility for the violence, which the United Nations says has claimed more than 5,000 lives. Syrian soldiers who have defected said they were ordered to shoot unarmed protesters. The U.N. reports that at least 256 children have been killed since early November, including a 2-year-old girl allegedly shot by an officer who said he did not want her to grow up to be a demonstrator.

Before the violence broke out, she was involved in volunteer work to educate Syria's youth. What must Syria's first lady be thinking now? Could she do anything to stop the bloodshed?\"No one can say what's happening behind closed palace doors, but I doubt she feels she has any control or would ultimately have much influence over what her husband is doing,\" said Syrian expert Andrew Tabler, an American scholar and journalist who lived in Syria between 2001 and 2008. He knew and worked with Asma al-Assad. \"If you consider what appears to be true,\" he said, \"you would conclude that she's standing by her man.\"Tabler's new memoir, \"In the Lion's Den,\" details his experiences with the first family and explains Washington's long tense relationship with Damascus. More: Tweets mock Asma al-Assad profile writerWhen Tabler, a Pennsylvania native, moved to Syria, interested in Middle Eastern politics, he was full of hope. Bashar al-Assad had taken power the previous year. He and his new wife seemed a modern couple, and there was the promise of reform. Eight years later, Tabler left Syria feeling  the government was so paralyzed by systemic, decades-old corruption that even the most well-intentioned leaders were unlikely to spur positive change. Now a Next Generation fellow at The Washington Institute's Program on Arab Politics, Tabler believes Bashar al-Assad must go. Tabler earned a living in Syria as a freelance journalist, some of his early work in the country coming when Asma al-Assad gave him approval and funding to write and publish an English-language magazine called Syria Today in the early 2000s. Tabler says her assistance at the time was extraordinary. There were no press freedoms in Syria, and yet the president's wife, modern in dress and direct in tone, was sanctioning an American to write about the country.But then came problems. Tabler worked for Asma al-Assad for a year and agreed to run editions past her before publication. Just before the first edition was due to come out, it was mysteriously quashed. Her assistant delivered the bad news without explanation. At one point, he and another writer felt they were being spied on by the Mukhabarat, the country's secret police.Syria Today went on to get other funding. Tabler continued working on the project for a short time. It is now published online and has no links with the regime. \"There are two sides to Asma al-Assad,\" says Tabler. \"She is a modern woman, definitely apart from other wives of Arab leaders.\" She ran nongovernment organizations specifically geared toward the country's worst problems: high unemployment and disparity between the rich and poor. But Asma al-Assad coveted the good life too, Tabler says. \"She also wanted to be a princess.\"More: Leaked e-mails: Shopping amid a massacreFrom work-a-day to the palaceAsma al-Assad was born in 1975 in London to a well-regarded Syrian cardiologist, Fawaz Akhras, and his wife, Sahar Otri, a diplomat at the Syrian Embassy in London. Asma means \"supreme\" in Arabic.Raised in the middle-class neighborhood of Acton in West London, Asma al-Akhras reportedly got good grades at the tony private girls school Queens College. She went on to obtain degrees in computer science and French literature at Kings College in London. After graduating, she worked for three years in finance with a specialization in mergers and acquisitions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, according to Tabler's book. Her colleagues had no idea she had met one of the sons of Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad -- or that they were dating after reportedly meeting while she vacationed with her family in Syria.It wasn't expected that Bashar would carry on the family's political dynasty. He didn't seem to have the personality for the job; he wasn't deeply involved in military or government matters, according to \"Inheriting Syria: Bashar's Trial by Fire,\" a biography by Flynt Leverett, who worked as an expert on Syria for the CIA in the 1990s and was the senior director for Middle East affairs at the National Security Council in the early 2000s. Because Bashar's older brother Basil was expected to succeed his father, Bashar al-Assad went to London in the 1990s and studied ophthalmology. He and Asma are believed to have seen each other during this time. Bashar was called back to Syria in 1994 when Basil died in a car wreck. This turn of events made him first in line to rule Syria, and he was appointed president by Syria's rubber-stamp Parliament in 2000 after his father died. More: Bashar al-Assad: A man defined by violenceBefore 2000 ended, he and Asma were married.According to Tabler's book, no photos of the wedding appeared in Syrian papers; some Syrians told him the Assad family was unhappy about the union. Assad was a member of the elite Alawite tribe, and Asma's father was Sunni. The groups have a long history of rivalry and conflict -- especially in the city of Homs, Asma's father's hometown. Homs has seen sectarian tensions and killings as the protest movement has evolved. Shortly after her wedding, Asma al-Assad traveled around Syria incognito to try to get to know the people, Tabler wrote. She found there was massive poverty and a growing population of unemployed young people. \"Villagers are very pure, very willing,\" she told Tabler in an interview in 2001. \"Villagers don't want to leave their villages, but economic opportunities don't exist there.\" The politics of glamourThroughout most of the 2000s, Asma al-Assad's profile in the region increased. The first lady gained a reputation as a clothes horse, preferring Chanel on her tiny frame. She kept her chin-length honey hair in loose waves and always wore exquisite heels. Her photograph was often published, usually next to that of lithe beauty Queen Rania of Jordan, another Western-styled fashion icon with a busy public calendar.Syrian and international writers gushed about how Asma al-Assad was not only glamorous but also a champion of women's rights.The New York Times profiled the Assads in 2005 when they opened an opera house in Damascus: \"Together they made a kind of visual rhyme with the building: Tall, slender and young, they seemed the essence of secular Western-Arab fusion, the elegant doctor-turned-president out on the town with his dazzling British-born Syrian wife, the former J. P. Morgan banker whom Syrians call their Princess Diana.But the story also delved into the tense relationship between America and Syria, as U.S. troops were operating in western Iraq near the Syrian border. When the Times reporter asked President Al-Assad if he was concerned, he said he was not. Then Asma al-Assad \"flashed a warm smile and deftly flicked\" the reporter away. ''We're off duty,'' she told the Times reporter.Asma's profile borrowed heavily from Princess Diana. This 2009 YouTube photo compilation shows Syria's first lady helping old people and sick children, sitting in classrooms, planting trees, waving and smiling alongside her husband. It's unclear who posted the video. The poster didn't use his or her real name, and the e-mail connected to the channel featuring other similar videos celebrating the Assads is no longer active. In 2010, Asma al-Assad talked to diplomats and intellectuals at the Paris Diplomatic Academy.  A YouTube video shows her speaking, without notes, about Syria's history and how that heritage informs daily life. \"Some often ask me how then can Syria remain stable, moderate and influential in a region that is increasingly being surrounded by extremism, ideologism (sic), sectarianism and all other forms of negative perceptions in our society,\" she told the gathering. \"The typical answer I get is because of military, political, security reasons. Again, I believe I have a different view. \"It's the very essence of our culture. It's what our history teaches us of openness and engagement,\" she said. \"It's the sense of identity and pride that we have knowing who we are in the world and knowing what we've contributed to the world over thousands of years that gives us that sense of stability and that sense of moderation.\"Some of you might think I am talking politics. ... Trust me, I have no interest in politics,\" she continued. \"My interests are elsewhere. But living in the region for as long as I have, I realize that politics affects every facet of our lives.\"\"In the Lion's Den\" portrays Asma al-Assad as confident, charming, gutsy and focused, but also na\u00efve, someone who seemed to sincerely believe she could better the country through various charities and NGOs. Tabler describes one meeting he attended with European diplomats where the first lady charmed everyone and left the impression that the Syrian first family was approachable, at least compared to other members of her husband's regime.Asma al-Assad was \"a comprehensible and reasonable individual in an opaque regime,\" Tabler wrote.In December 2010, around the time a Tunisian street vendor lit himself on fire and inspired a wave of protests across North Africa, Asma al-Assad and her husband were photographed in Paris. They were smiling, as they left a Monet exhibition.More: al-Assad's inner circle, mostly family, like 'mafia''These atrocities'Three months later, the first major protests broke out in Syria. About 3,000 people gathered in Damascus on March 16 to demand the Assad regime release hundreds of political prisoners, many jailed during Hafez al-Assad's regime. Reuters and other news agencies reported that security officers detained and beat demonstrators. The next day, Asma al-Assad gave the keynote speech at an event hosted by the Harvard Arab Alumni Association at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus. In a description online, the alumni group wrote: \"In her role as Syria's first lady, Her Excellency Asma al-Assad applies her experience, energy and influence to her country's social and cultural development. Her role reflects the significant economic, political and social change that is happening in Syria today. Asma al-Assad's work supports that of President Bashar al-Assad by fostering the emergence of a robust, independent and self-sustaining civil society.\" The group's program director, Sena Halabi, said he didn't have a transcript of the talk and that it wasn't videotaped. Harvard spokesman Joe Raposo said he could not provide details of her remarks because the conference was a private, non-Harvard-sponsored event. In October as bodies piled up in the streets of Homs and Hama, aid workers told Britain's Independent newspaper  they had met with Asma al-Assad in Damascus, at her request. The first lady asked the group about the risks of their jobs, one worker told The Independent. But she was expressionless, the workers said, when they told her about abuses they had witnessed by security forces and soldiers. \"There was no reaction. She didn't react at all. It was just like I was telling a normal story, something that happens every day,\" one worker said.Tabler said he suspects  the first lady \"is in denial\" about just how severe the violence in Syria has become -- and about her husband's culpability. \"They talked so much about reform that I think she has fooled herself,\" he said.But Asma al-Assad's head seemed quite clear two years ago when she spoke with CNN about how she would not tolerate an oppressive and violent regime, except in this instance she was talking about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.She said that 60% of Middle Easterners are under 25 and feel increasingly frustrated with a lack of economic opportunity. Governments must make those young people \"believe in a future,\" she said. \"The reality on the ground is increasingly ... going further and further and further away from that,\" she said, foreshadowing the causes of the Arab Spring, a movement led primarily by young people. The first lady went on to speak about 2009's Gaza War, a three-week bombing and invasion of Gaza by Israel that began in late December when Israel launched a surprise airstrike.Asma al-Assad called Israel's actions \"barbaric\" and said innocent Palestinians were dying in droves. She was appalled by reports from human rights workers who witnessed the carnage. \"This is the 21st century. Where in the world could this happen? Unfortunately it is happening,\" she said. \"As a mother and as a human being we need to make sure that these atrocities stop.\"",

        "content": "Story highlights\"Big Al\" began blogging about his life in Homs, Syria, in September Stuck inside while war happens outside, he watches \"The Simpsons,\" listens to Nine Inch NailsAl argues with his parents about whether to stay or leave SyriaMost protesters are young, like him. \"I know my rights as a human being,\" he blogs In a concrete block apartment building in a working-class Syrian suburb, a young man who calls himself \"Big Al\" spends his days listening to Nine Inch Nails on his smartphone. He watches back-to-back episodes of \"The Simpsons\" on his laptop while he shovels a pan of brownies into his mouth.He loves to cook. It's the only thing keeping him going.\"I'm a big guy, and I like to cook and bake,\" he says. \"Since I've been jobless for more than a year, and there are no activities to do, I get busy baking. In fact, I made more pizzas and cookies this year than I did in the past three years.\"When the electricity is on, there he'll be, in a tiny kitchen in his parents' apartment, stirring and sifting and tasting. He'll hear gunfire popping in the distance; sometimes the boom of a shell landing shakes the apartment. He is scared. Of course he is scared. Fear settles on everything. His eyelids are heavy. But what else can he do but keep on living?Officials: Syria's prime minister defectsIt's scorching hot in Syria, but Al always keeps the windows open a little. Pressure from explosions around his Homs neighborhood can cause glass to break. This is one of the lessons he's learned from war.Big Al lives in Homs, now full of burned out structures and rubble, such as this building.He's also learned to keep his laptop plugged in so it can soak up whatever electricity might come on, if it does. Al loves the Internet. To him, it's freedom. He can say what he wants and be who he would like to be, something like the goofy, happy guy he used to be before so many people started dying in his country.Al spends hours hunched over his keyboard, typing, working on his blog, Thoughts and Feelings of a Syrian Freedom Fighter. Its entries, thousands of words, white letters against a black background, are nothing like the usual bomb and body-count stories about Syria.Al's blog is a detailed diary of a young man's life interrupted, days and nights existing in two states: mundane, almost zombie-like boredom and then sudden, run-for-your life terror.He writes about sleeping through outages and waiting in lines for hours for a bit of bread. He describes venturing out to buy vegetables -- he and his parents have to get food somewhere -- and being caught in crossfire in the street. He says he drains whole days watching his collection of DVDs and peering through his window to watch young men around his age outside on his street, laughing and firing their guns into the air for no apparent reason than because they can. It's very difficult for journalists to verify information from inside Syria because the government has restricted access by international press. Media rely many times on video and other materials posted online to have an insight into what is happening there. Some have been proved to be fake, but CNN has carefully examined Al and his blog. He has given information that only someone inside Homs, a Syrian city in the center of much of the violence, would know.CNN believes these are his experiences.A friend dies; a blog is born\"The big bad wolf is coming/ No one knows what he looks like.\"That is a line from Al's first post in September, nearly six months into a violent rebellion in Syria. Young people about his age had begun protesting in March 2011, chanting that they'd had enough of President Bashar al-Assad, whose family has held power for 42 years.He joined them. He thought it would work. Why wouldn't the result of their demonstrations in Syria be like the uprisings that sank dictators in Tunisia or Egypt? But weeks became months; summer came and went. More and more Syrians protesting al-Assad's rule died, typically in increasingly vicious clashes with the regime's military forces.By fall, Al realized his country was becoming a place he didn't recognize. He was worried. Things were really bad.Then they got worse, and very personal.In September, one of Al's good friends was killed in street violence.He wrote a poem about it in the voice of what he imagined his friend's killers thought. He wanted other activists to read it.We don't care if you're young or oldWe don't care if you're big or smallWe don't care if you're black or white, rich or poorYou're all the same in our eyesYou're all.. Nothing After he published it, he was shocked when people not only saw it but wrote to him. He decided to keep writing, \"to tell the story from the beginning,\" he explained. He began using a Microsoft Word document to keep track of everything he experienced, which he would post whenever he could get access to the Internet.In a single post, \"Life in Homs,\" published June 14, Al details a single day: He goes out to a bakery, stands in a line that balloons from 11 people to 100, buys a dollar's worth of bread and returns home.Around the time of the publication of this post, there are streams of reports in the media that are overwhelmingly horrifying.To suppress rebels fighting to oust al-Assad, human rights observers say, the president's forces are systematically torturing and killing children, shooting babies and other innocents, slaying whole families in their homes.Syrian security forces, soldiers and pro-regime militias are using sexual violence to torture people in detention and sexually abuse women and girls as young as 12 during raids, Human Rights Watch documented.Photojournalists captured images of blood-stained walls, suggesting executions were being carried out.On the other side of the fight, a leader of a rebel group said they had turned to making homemade explosives.The international community watched and waited, trying to gauge what was happening in Syria. It got some kind of answer the second week in June, when the United Nations peacekeeping chief said he thought Syria was locked in a civil war. Such a designation, experts have said, generally make it less appealing for foreign nations to become involved in the conflict.Big Al also watches the news when he can.He blogged June 14:\"8:30 AM, I watched the news, got depressed and went back to bed (Since I don't have a business to go to, because it's been closed for over a year now, like most other businesses in Homs, but that's a story for another time). In bed I tried to check my email and twitter but I found out that 3G and GPRS aren't working. I don't have ADSL at home so I have no internet connection now. No big deal, I'm used to it. But unlike the previous six days we have fresh water since morning.\" On this day, after his morning breakfast trip to buy bread, he goes out again to buy vegetables. The trip quickly turns into a life and death situation. He is caught in a gunbattle between a tank and what seem to be random people shooting in the street. He turns his smartphone on the scene and records it.\"(There was) shooting and it was only 5 meters away from me. I was inside the store so I lied down on the floor next to the salesman. The glass shattered and the goods started falling from the shelves on us because the entire place was shaking badly.\"By the time the drama of the shooting ends, Al describes seeing families near the shop packing up and trying to leave. \"As I was walking home, many families were packing their stuff in their cars and fleeing the neighborhood. Many left the area in the past week, and only a few are still living here. Some of them asked me if they can use the street I came from and I said no and told them to be careful.\"I arrived home at 1:30 PM, and found both of my parents standing on the balcony waiting for me, and that drove me insane more than what I just came from. Our balcony has been shot so many times before, and I have a collection of bullets from it. It's filled with holes and even my AC was shot a while back. \"I went up and we had a really bad fight, and I did most of the yelling if not all.\"My mother told me that when she heard the shooting and I told her to leave me alone, she was so scared she couldn't think straight anymore. She found herself going out the balcony hoping to see me without thinking about her personal safety. My dad followed her and they both stayed out there until I came back.\"A few months ago, his neighborhood seemed like a safe place for people who lived around Homs, a city of half a million people. CNN isn't disclosing Big Al's neighborhood to protect his identity and safety.\"All empty houses got filled, even schools and abandoned buildings. The destruction of major markets in Homs left most people without jobs, so they saved what good they can save and started selling their products on the streets,\" he explained in an e-mail. He and his parents argue over whether they should leave their home. They always end up fighting over it, he said.CNN Inside SyriaBig Al said he and his parents have rounded up all their important possessions and put them in two suitcases. The bags are ready to go at a moment's notice.One suitcase has clothes; the other contains nonperishable food. A briefcase contains personal documents, money, medicine and jewelry. The family wrote a list of what they packed.In an April post, he wrote, \"I've always said that I prefer getting killed than leaving my house and becoming a refugee, and I might prove this very soon. I won't leave my house to anyone. I live or die here. I know I'm not being smart with this decision, but that's who I am. I know my rights as a human being, and I will take them or die fighting for them.\"Complete coverage of the unrest in SyriaA good Ba'ath scoutAl says his friends have all left Homs; most have left Syria. His relatives, except for his parents, are also gone.His parents, he says, don't always understand why young people chose to demonstrate against al-Assad. He has told them his generation wants to be freer. He tells them they should have stood up when they were younger.\"I have to spoken to my parents about this a lot when they try to tell me what to do regarding the movement,\" he explained. \"I tell them that they did nothing, so they don't have the right to tell us what to do.\" Early in his blog, Big Al posted several entries he called \"chapters,\" lengthy entries that touch on major moments in his life.He recalls one incident from when he was a teenager. He was watching television at home when the station abruptly switched to classical music.\"Someone died. Someone important. ... My heart skipped a beat. It happened. I knew it happened before they say anything. Hafez Assad is dead. They announced it. I froze.\"I told my family and they didn't believe me.\" 'Hafez Assad can't die' my mom said in shock.\"We gathered in front of the TV. It's over. The dictator is dead... Is this over? Are we finally free of this family? Could this be real?\"Hafez al-Assad had held power since 1970 after serving in the Syrian air force and rising in the ranks of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. He and the entire al-Assad family, with their political connections and power, were known for taking on contracts in key industries like telecommunications, banking and oil.The cornerstone of Hafez al-Assad's rule, many say, is not growing the Syrian economy or expanding its reach in the oil sector. Rather, the al-Assad patriarch is known for a 1982 massacre in the western city of Hama, a beautiful and ancient metropolis with cobblestone streets and ornate buildings. An uprising took root there in the early 1980s, a movement that portended trouble for Hafez's grip on power.To quell it, government forces, led by Hafez's brother Rifaat al-Assad, shelled entire neighborhoods. There was no official death toll, but historians and human rights groups have said that between 10,000 and 30,000 Syrians were killed.Big Al had not been born.\"We were taught many things at a very young age, and those things were stuck in my head even though I didn't completely understand them,\" he wrote December 21 in a post titled \"The Beginning.\" Big Al was raised in Homs. \"Like many other boys, he joined the Baath Scouts when he was in elementary school. Just like everybody else in my generation, and I had absolutely no idea what does 'Talae3 Al Baath' mean ...\"He posted some of the songs and mottos he learned as a child: \" \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u064a\u0646         \u062d\u0628\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064a\u064a\u0646\u0628\u0637\u0644 \u062a\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0627\u0645\u062f      \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f\"\" 'Translation: Long live, the one who's loved by the millions, the hero of October, Abu Suliman the leader' Abu Suliman is what we used to call Hafez Assad, it changed to Abu Basel a while after.\"In Arabic, Abu means father; Basel, the name of Hafez al-Assad's eldest son, can mean lion or strong. Hafez al-Assad was born to a poor family but rose to lead the Arab Socialist Baath Party. Al remembers the first commandment of Al Baath Scouts. \"We love our big Arab world, our country Syria, and Al Baath Party.\"Al's parents always told him how great Syria's leader was.When Hafez al-Assad died in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad was rubber-stamped into power by Syria's parliament. Bashar Al-Assad had studied ophthalmology in London. Just before he took control of Syria, he married a stylish British-born woman. Asma al-Assad had worked as a banker in London.In the early 2000s, the first couple was photographed smiling and looking sharp. They went to art openings. Asma al-Assad aligned herself with charities for the poor and disabled. The al-Assads talked about making Syria more open and free. The international press deemed them modern and progressive.\"We had hope that Bashar is a better man, a more enlighten(ed) man, and of course, a more merciful man than his father was,\" Al blogged.During that time, national politics wasn't on Al's mind anyway. He was off to college and thrilled to distance himself from the country's military training, which he says he'd been forced to participate in -- if only to show up and go through the motions.Away at college, he thought he could get away with skipping all that.\"And most importantly, no stupid uniform and no mottos to repeat like a parrot without meaning any of them. I was about to have a space of freedom I never had before. And I'm gonna enjoy it,\" Al wrote.At first, Bashar al-Assad allowed more freedoms. Syrians were allowed to install satellite dishes. Private -- not state-controlled -- universities opened. Dial-up Internet connections were available. But by 2010, Syria was beset with incompetent and bribe-hungry government workers and police, Big Al blogged. So when the Arab Spring uprisings started and the people suddenly seemed capable of forcing change, \"the tiny light of hope in every Syrian's heart tripled. Tunisia did it. Egypt did it. It is possible!\" Al blogged.\"I live or die here\" -- blog post April 18 Al rarely sleeps through the night. \"I simply have no life anymore,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"A good night of sleep is a dream to people in Homs. Waking up in the middle of the (night) to the middle of unbelievable loud explosions is a common thing now.\"Sometimes, to drown out the sounds coming from outside, he'll put on his headphones and listen to music: Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, Foo Fighters. His favorite, the one he plays when he can't sleep, is \"The End\" by the Doors.\"Jim Morrison,\" Big Al said, \"is my idol.\" Not long ago, Al started thinking about what it would have been like to not be born in Syria. In a blog post, he writes about Steve Jobs, the late Apple CEO whose biological father is Syrian. Jobs was born in America and adopted by a couple in California.Al wondered, what if Jobs had grown up in Syria?  \"(He would) live a cheap house in a cheap area like Baba Amr or Khaldieh, and eventually get killed while the city is being bombed by the military or get arrested for tweeting something about freedom. \"How many Steve Jobs could my city and my country bring to the world?\" Al blogged. \"How many Steve Jobs have been killed by Assad's army in the past 41 years?\"Two men just talkingIn June, Big Al wrote in an e-mail, \"We are in a stage where we just don't really care anymore. We're all depressed all the time, and we fight each other about everything.\" In a post titled \"Is anybody out there?\" he wrote, \"No connection, no electricity, no food, no services, and an unbelievably vicious attack on the city.\"Al is often annoyed and bored with the redundant nature of his posts.\"Shelling, shooting, arresting, and chasing... The sounds of shelling and shooting were like any other day...\"In March, he goes outside. It's snowing. Then, something that might seem extraordinary to people outside Syria: Al describes talking with a security forces officer in the street. \"The streets were empty and the sounds of shelling could be heard every few seconds coming from afar, and shooting from nearby as well. I heard someone calling me from the darkness and couldn't see who it was, they told me not to be scares, but I wasn't anyway.\"I walked towards the voice and found a member of the security forces, he was wearing his uniform and holding his rifle and standing behind a wall. He asked me what I wanted and why I was there, and then he told me not to walk in that area at night and to be careful. He was nice to me and he even offered me some water if I didn't have any at home. I asked him what he thinks will happen next, he hesitated to answer, but it was obvious what he was trying to say.\"He mumbled something about Libya and Egypt, and that was enough. He's a good guy, but he was too scared to leave his barrier and join the free army. I asked him if he needed a place to stay in and I was hinting that I can help him leave Assad forces, but he didn't answer. I walked away from him without saying another word. I wish I could protect him, but I can't even protect myself.\"Later, Al would continue watching the same online videos as the rest of world, images that were so repulsive and violent, words seemed pointless. \"By the end of March I didn't want to write anymore as I felt like I've been writing the same things over and over again. The situation in Homs didn't change for two months and every day is the same. A vicious circle of shelling, shooting, arresting, and chasing has been controlling us all for a long time and especially since early February.\"Today was the first day of the eight days Annan gave Syria to stop all types of violence, but seems like the regime misunderstood what Annan is trying to do as their attacks spread to new areas, and that's why I have decided to write again, as for the first time ever, I was able to see buildings being hit directly without leaving my house.\"A cheesy thought came to my mind since we're in April. The Syrian regime decided to fool Kofi Annan and the rest of the world by accepting to ceasefire on April 1st. This is the greatest April fool's of all time. Assad will call the Security Council on the 12th and be like \"I GOT YOU! OH I GOT YOU GOOD!\" and they'll laugh and forget about us forever.\"Survivor's guiltIn late May, at least 50 people, including 13 children, were killed when Syrian forces attacked the town of Houla in Homs province, anti-government activists said. Syria's government denied that its troops were behind the bloodbath, and a Foreign Ministry spokesman denounced a \"tsunami of lies\" against al-Assad's government. Videos posted on YouTube show demonstrations in cities across the country, including Damascus, Daraa, Idlib and the suburbs of Hama. \"Oh Houla, we are with you until death,\" they chanted.Al published a blog entry May 29 recalling the Houla massacre. \"Today started like any other day in my sad city Homs. Gunfire and shelling sounds could be heard every now and then, but that didn't stop the people from going out to buy food and other basic things.\"The streets in the safe neighborhoods turned into markets where sellers use the sidewalks to show their products, like vegetables, Hummus, bread, and sometimes shoes. But then again there are no real safe neighborhoods in Homs anymore. Mortar shells and gunshots can come out of nowhere to take lives. \"Shelling in Houla started slowing down but not in other area, and that helped some people get inside to check what happened, and that's when the reports started coming.\"I will never forget that night. I can never forgive those monsters. And I ask you to not forget what happened there in Houla. That big scar in the face of all humanity will never fade away.\"Al feels a kind of guilt about what happened. \"We are truly sorry we failed you Houla,\" he writes. \"We are ashamed of ourselves.\"Last wordsAl's latest blog came July 29. It's long, a compendium of notes he's been keeping over the past few months. Much of it just a couple lines for each day. They read like the top lines of news stories. There are accounts of shells dropping and clashes in the street. An explosion has hit near his house and rattled the windows. It's been difficult to get online, he writes, and cell phone networks are down all the time. \"June 20th, the numbers of casualties are increasing every day. The attacks have become more vicious than ever all over Syria. Still no cellphones, 3G, or Dial up.\"CNN continued to communicate with Al. He had been thinking a lot about the chance Syria seemed to have months and the initial optimism he felt in the days after a cease-fire negotiated by U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan earlier in the spring.\"The Syrian regime promised the UN/AL envoy Kofi Annan to execute his plan and ceasefire starting April 12th at 6 AM. \"I woke up to see if the regime will do what they promised, and I must say that I didn't hear a single gunshot all morning. I know this regime too well, and I know they might break their promise at any point, but I took an oath to write what I witness and not lie about it, and in this case, the regime did what they promised. The soldiers, security forces members, and vehicles are still everywhere, but there's no shelling or shooting anywhere.\"Annan quit this week as the special peace envoy, casting serious doubt that a diplomacy could quell Syria's bloodshed. Annan cast wide blame for why his effort failed, including a \"clear lack of unity\" within the U.N. Security Council, the failure of the al-Assad regime to cooperate and Syrian rebels' continued fighting. But he did offer parting advice that there still could be reason to hope.Al recalls on his blog how his own optimism faded quickly after the first try at a cease-fire, an initiative that seemed to end as soon as it began.\"April 14th, the quiet mornings are over, and the horrible shelling sounds and smoke clouds are back at the same rate like Annan and his ceasefire plan didn't even exist.\" \"The same view I saw back in April 3rd and 4th. Buildings being hit by missiles and getting destroyed in two different areas.\"I knew this was coming, yet I couldn't help but to feel overwhelmed.\"May was more of the same.\"May 28th, another unbelievable night of excessive shelling. I didn't count the explosions as they were too many. 3-4 explosions could be heard in a row at times, and that kept going all night and into the morning.\"On June 16, Al sees a helicopter flying over Homs. \"A little after that the UN observers announced the suspension of their mission due to the increase of violence in Syria.\"More tanks have shown up in his neighborhood in the past few weeks. \"My area has become a playfield for tanks and security forces are always around with their vehicles,\" he blogged. \"And pickup trucks, and of course their guns.\"\"I'm having such a bad day and have the worst feeling in my gut,\" Al recently wrote in an e-mail.His messages all seem like that now, resigned to whatever is coming.",

        "content": "Story highlightsSince December 2006, nearly 48,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence in MexicoMexican cartels make billions of dollars a year, much of their profits in the U.S.The bloodbath could threaten the survival of the Mexican state, and American national securityThere are kingpins with names like the Engineer, head-chopping hit men, dirty cops and double-dealing politicians. And, of course, there are users -- millions of them. But the Mexican drug war, at its core, is about two numbers: 48,000 and 39 billion. Over the past five years, nearly 48,000 people have been killed in suspected drug-related violence in Mexico, the country's federal attorney general announced this month. In the first three quarters of 2011, almost 13,000 people died.                       Cold and incomprehensible zeros, the death toll doesn't include the more than 5,000 people who have disappeared, according to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission. It doesn't account for the tens of thousands of children orphaned by the violence.The guilty live on both sides of the border. Street gangs with cartel ties are not only in Los Angeles and Dallas, but also in many smaller cities across the United States and much farther north of the Mexican border. Mexican cartels had a presence in 230 cities in the United States in 2008, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Its 2011 report shows that presence has grown to more than 1,000 U.S. cities. While the violence has remained mostly in Mexico, authorities in Arizona, Georgia, Texas, Alabama and other states have reportedly investigated abductions and killings suspected to be tied to cartels. Mexican black tar heroin (so called because it's dark and sticky), is cheaper than Colombian heroin, and used to be a rarity in the United States. Now it is available in dozens of cities and small towns, experts say. Customers phone in their orders, the Los Angeles Times reports, and small-time dealers deliver the drug, almost like pizza deliverymen. Traffickers are recruiting in the United States, and prefer to hire young. Texas high schools say cartel members have been on their campuses. Most notoriously, a 14-year-old from San Diego became a head-chopping cartel assassin. \"I slit their throats,\" he testified at his trial, held near Cuernavaca. The teenager, called \"El Ponchis\" - the Cloak - was found guilty of torturing and beheading and sentenced to three years in a Mexican prison.For more than a decade, the United States' focus has been terrorism, an exhausting battle reliant on covert operatives in societies where the rule of law has collapsed or widespread violence is the norm. The situation in Mexico is beginning to show similarities. In many border areas, the authority of the Mexican state seems either entirely absent or extremely weak.  In September 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said  cartel violence might be \"morphing into or making common cause with what we would call an insurgency.\"  If cartel violence is not contained in Mexico, which shares a nearly 2,000 mile border with the United States, the drug war could threaten U.S. national security and even survival of the Mexican state. How much is enough?For most of us, Mexico is reduced several times a week to a sickening barrage of horror flick headlines. Thirty-five bodies left on the freeway during rush-hour in a major tourist city. A person's face sewn onto a soccer ball. Bodies found stuffed in barrels of acid. Heads sent rolling onto busy nightclub dance floors.                          What could explain such savagery? Traffickers don't have a political or religious ideology like al Qaeda.The answer, some experts say, is a number. Something like $39 billion.That's the top estimated amount Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations make in wholesale profits annually, according to a 2009 Justice Department report, the latest year for which that calculation was available. The department's 2011 report said that Mexican traffickers control the flow of most of the cocaine, heroin, foreign-produced marijuana and methamphetamine in the United States. There are seven cartels in Mexico vying for control of smuggling routes into the United States, a bountiful sellers' paradise. South of the border it costs $2,000 to produce a kilo of cocaine from leaf to lab, the DEA said. In the U.S., a kilo's street value ranges from $34,000 to $120,000, depending on the ZIP code where it's pushed. \"How much is enough to the cartels? How many billions justify how many deaths to them?\" said DEA special agent and spokesman Jeffrey Scott. \"Mexico is their home, too. Their families live there. At what point does the violence cripple their ability to conduct business?\"Scott has been with the DEA for 16 years. Between 2006 and 2011, he led a Tucson, Arizona, strike force that fought smugglers bringing tons of methamphetamine, marijuana, heroin and cocaine across the border. By the time the drugs reach the low-level street dealer, they have been through many middle managers in the cartels' purposely confusing web of workers.\"The people who are arrested will sometimes say, 'Sinaloa who?'\" he said, referring to the cartel that originated in the Mexican Pacific Coast state and has the strongest presence in the United States. Dealers usually don't know or care where their product comes from, Scott said. He said he doubts the tens of millions of Americans who use illegal drugs do, either. Get ShortyFrom foot to head he is short/But he is the biggest of the bigIf you respect him, he'll respect youIf you offend him, it will get worse-- Lyrics to narcocorrido \"El Chapo\" by Los Canelos de Durango \"El Chapo\" (Shorty) is the boss of the Sinaloa cartel. In his last-known photo, the 5 foot 6 inch son of a poor rural family wears a schoolboy haircut and a plain-colored puff-coat. Despite having virtually no formal education, Forbes estimates Joaquin Guzman Loera is worth $1 billion. This month the U.S. Treasury declared him the most influential trafficker in the world. He has eluded capture for more than a decade, is known for coming up with original ways to smuggle, like putting cocaine in fire extinguishers, and is suspected of helping Mexicans and Colombians launder as much as $20 billion in drug profits. The legend of \"El Chapo\" began to grow when he escaped, reportedly on a laundry cart, from a Mexican prison in 2001. He seemed even more untouchable last summer when his 20-something beauty queen wife (who has dual nationality) crossed into California to give birth to twins. The birth certificates leave blank the space for the father's name, and she apparently hustled back across the border.It's anyone's guess where El Chapo is. Mexican President Felipe Calderon wondered last year if he was hiding out in the United States.                                          Guzman is the drug war. Perpetuating the image of the bulletproof bad guy keeps it alive. YouTube is full of narco snuff. Those with weak stomachs should avoid the wildly popular El Blog del Narco, which posts gory photos of killings and confessions by drug lords. Cartels make their own movies, glorifying the business. The films are sold in street markets in Mexico and the United States.Some say it's no coincidence that the first beheadings of Mexican police officers occurred in 2006, when videotapes of al Qaeda beheadings were shown on Mexican television. Since then, headless corpses have become a cartel calling card. In a single week in September, a sack of heads was left near an Acapulco elementary school and a blogging reporter's headless corpse was dumped in front of a major thoroughfare in the Texas border town of Nuevo Laredo. Her head, along with headphones and computer equipment, was found in a street planter.A note left at the scene, one of dozens of journalist killings in the past five years, read: \"OK Nuevo Laredo live on the social networks, I am La Nena de Laredo and I am here because of my reports and yours ...\"                                                                                               The message was signed with several Z's, indicating the slaying was the work of another major cartel, the Zetas. One of the first cartels to use the internet, the Zetas are perhaps the savviest propagandists in the drug war. They're known for effective recruitment tactics.A few years ago, they appealed to the destitute in a nation where the minimum wage is $5 a day, but millions have no work.Banners were dropped from bridges in major cities. \"Why be poor?\" the signs said. \"Come work for us.\" The good old bad daysDesde que yo era chiquillo tenia fintas de cabron (Ever since I was a kid, I had the fame of a bad-ass)ya le pegaba al perico, y a la mota (already hitting the parrot [cocaine] and doing dope [marijuana])-- El Cabron, a legendary narcocorrido, or narco ballad, released in 2005.Feeding addiction has long been a part of Mexico's relationship with the United States, first becoming a well-oiled operation during Prohibition when Americans crossed over to drink and get high and Mexicans sent marijuana and alcohol to speakeasies in the States.During this era, narcocorridos, or drug pop ballads glorifying kingpins, became popular. The accordion-based anthems were danceable, fun. Today the songs are no longer so amusing. Between 2006 and 2008, more than a dozen performers have been murdered. Cartels have held some balladeers hostage for days, forcing them to entertain partying crews. Some state and local Mexican governments have tried to ban the music, but the effort has only made the songs sexier. They shake butts from Cancun to Culiacan, and across the United States from Los Angeles to New York. Slain narco singers have been nominated for posthumous Grammys. (Watch narco singer Valent\u00edn Elizalde's music video \"A Mis Enemigos\" which some speculate was an attack on the Gulf cartel and led to his murder.)Narcocorridos have become death impersonating art, a symbol of just how unexpectedly dark the Mexican drug business has become.The definition of a cartel is an agreement among competing firms. That was the old way for the Mexicans. Pay the cops and the politicians. Don't kill anyone unless absolutely necessary and don't make a mess of it. Two scenarios made their thieves' agreement possible. For decades, Mexicans mainly transported cocaine for the Colombians or the Colombians sent the cocaine directly into the United States on planes or speedboats. That changed in the 1990s when the United States tightened its choke on Colombia's main smuggling point in the Caribbean and Florida and worked with the Colombian government to combat cartels and eliminate kingpins like Pablo Escobar. The neutered Colombian cartels were then forced to rely on the Mexicans, who smuggled across much more vast and impossible to monitor areas like the border and the eastern Pacific Ocean. Suddenly indispensable in their industry, the cartels in Mexico reacted like any ambitious corporation. They bought out every last possible competitor, ramping up bribes across the ranks of law enforcement and politicians. They advertised themselves to struggling working class people and the poor as a panacea amid all the government's failures: Cartels were the private-sector alternative. Within a few years, they gained unrivaled dominance in the global illicit drug trade. The second scenario helping the cartels, some experts say, was rampant corruption within the PRI, or the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ran Mexico for 72 years. There were far fewer deaths and the cartels' bottom line wasn't threatened. The PRI lost power in 2000 with the election of Vicente Fox, who led the opposition National Action Party.Known for his cowboy hats, Fox made little of the cartels during his election campaign. But after meeting with American officials in the early days of his administration, he announced he wanted the traffickers gone. The arrests of kingpins and key players followed, which prompted chaos within cartel ranks as commands were shaken. Cartel members fought amongst themselves and each other. The good old bad days ended. A real war starts La traicion y el contrabando (The treason and the contraband)Son cosas incompartidas\" (They are the same thing)- Lyrics to \"Contrabando y traicion\" by Tigres del Norte To understand the drug war, accept that it's impossible to keep track of all its players. Accept that there are no white hats or black hats. There's only grey. Fog. There is, however, agreement among experts about when war was declared: In late 2004 in the border town of Nuevo Laredo, 10 minutes from Laredo, Texas. The Sinaloa wanted this golden smuggling route.Every year, more than 5 million cars, 1.5 million commercial trucks and 3.8 million pedestrians cross northbound from Mexico into the United States here, bringing with them a ton of hidden narcotics.In 2004, Nuevo Laredo was controlled by the Gulf cartel, which was just as old and Corleone-esque as Sinaloa. For help defending their turf, the Gulf hired a group of former Mexican special forces soldiers who called themselves Zetas after the federal police code for high-ranking officers, \"Z1.\"  The Sinaloa clan hired their own protection, a gang named Los Negros led by a blond-haired, blue-eyed American from Laredo. The man's cohorts called him La Barbie.                                        The Zetas battled Los Negros with tactics befitting an elite military. They fired automatic weapons, launched RPGs and grenades. They shot at each other for more than a year. Local gangs jumped in. Civilians dropped. Emboldened by their Nuevo Laredo victory, the Zetas formed their own cartel. As they went after other cartels throughout Mexico, the Zetas honed a reputation for sickening brutality, seeming to kill just because they can. They have been blamed for setting fire to a casino killing 52 people, shooting dead 72 migrants on a Tamaulipas farm in 2010, murdering and tossing into mass graves women and children and killing bloggers. In April 2011, the bodies of 190 people, some of them migrant workers, were found in a mass grave in the desert of Tamaulipas. Officials say the Zetas have lobbed grenades into celebrating crowds and blown up a pipeline that sent \"rivers of fire\" into residential streets. They have terrorized cities that once seemed untouchable by the violence, including the port city of Veracruz and Mexico's richest city, Monterrey, home to many international companies. As the Zetas enacted their terror, that blond-haired, blue-eyed American leading Los Negros got angrier. La Barbie was Edgar Valdez, a Texas high school football star who worked his way into the Mexican underworld as a pot dealer. In 2005, the Dallas Morning News reported on a video showing four bound and bloody men, suspected to be Zetas, being interrogated off camera by a man believed to be Valdez. A pistol comes into the frame, goes off and one of the men slumps. The video went viral. People around the globe started asking what was really going on in Mexico.Journalist Ioan Grillo has been to more murder scenes than he can recall. His new book, \"El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency,\" includes interviews with hit men, gang members, government and law enforcement officials and people caught in the crossfire.Grillo repeatedly returns to a single idea. Wars occur because people cannot feed their families. They happen because groups of people feel unimportant, disenfranchised, angry and broke. They want a piece of life. It only takes a few people with particularly hollow morals, capable of shutting off or suppressing guilt, to convince many that killing and dying in spectacular ways is tantamount to glory.Jihadist groups, kamikaze squadrons, American street gangs, cartels. Their members were all kids at one point. Grillo writes that he has seen teenagers show up at murder scenes showing no grief. It has become routine. They pick up shell casings scattered on the ground and debate whether they've been fired from AK47s or M4s.There are very few counselors in Mexico to help, and there is very little quality education outside the circles of the comparatively privileged few, he wrote. Why wouldn't a kid take 50 pesos to be a lookout, or 1,000 pesos to kill someone? \"I would love to see more money spent on these concerns,\" Grillo said, \"than on more military helicopters and soldiers gunning it out with the cartels.\" Fighting back After he was elected president in 2006, the PAN's Felipe Calderon took a page out of his predecessor's playbook and declared war on the cartels. He had the Mexican military fan out across the country and fired hundreds of corrupt police officers. He even disarmed an entire town, saying that most of its police force was working for the cartels.Plenty of narcos were arrested, and some extradited to the United States, but many thousands of people died. They included cartel members, police and  civilians who were caught in the middle of a gruesome war.Calderon and President George W. Bush reached an unprecedented agreement to fight the cartels. The Merida Initiative (named after the Mexican city where the two met) included a U.S. pledge of $1.5 billion between 2008 and 2010. President Obama requested millions more for 2011 for the program. The program provides aircraft, inspection tools and other sophisticated drug-detecting technology to the Mexicans. It also funds drug counseling and prison rehabilitation programs. To fight corruption, the United States has also pledged to give money to help train police in Mexico. For its part, the Mexican government has passed legislation aimed at bolstering its judicial system, and in October 2010, Calderon formally requested a total reshaping of the police force in Mexico. The reform he proposed would create unified state police forces and eliminate municipal police, who federal officials have said are very susceptible to corruption because of  their low salaries. Observers say Calderon underestimated how many police and other law enforcement officers were on the cartels' payroll when he came to power. As of March 2008, 150,000 soldiers had deserted. Traffickers, experts say, spent the Fox administration hunkering down, ingratiating themselves to communities, buying food and paying for medical bills, offering restless young people a sense of identity and hard cash.And as Grillo has written, many people didn't trust the police and the soldiers as they once did. Authorities were accused of widespread human rights abuses while on anti-cartel missions. Jose Luis Soberanes, president of the Mexican Human Rights Commission, testified in 2008 that his office had received complaints that police and soldiers had entered towns to rape and torture and kill, including shooting dead two women and three children in Sinaloa state. The cartels had become Robin Hood to many, similar to Colombia kingpin Escobar. In his impoverished Medellin, Escobar built a soccer field and a school. He died in a gunbattle with agents in 1993. At the church Escobar built, some Colombians still come to worship him like a saint. A Barbie, a fox and some piggies\"La Barbie\" was arrested in August 2010 in Mexico, and smiled as he was paraded in front of the press. The green Ralph Lauren polo shirt he wore inspired an international fashion trend.     Calderon's administration trumpets his arrest and others, and vows to keep fighting the cartels. But the president is a lame duck. Term limits prohibit him from running again in 2012.Many expect the PRI, Mexico's founding party that ruled for seven decades, to return to power in July's elections. Whoever wins the election will have to answer a critical question: whether to appease the cartels and try to negotiate with them or continue the all-out assault that Calderon launched.Negotiating with traffickers played a role in Colombia, where religious figures and former guerillas led the talks, experts said. But they also stress that Mexico is not Colombia, and this is not the late 1980s. Crime syndicates operate differently. Key players on both sides of the border have considerations unlike those during the Colombian crisis. Mexico, they contend, is far less likely to welcome close foreign involvement than Colombia did. A solution also cannot come from only one side of the border. Former President Fox and other experienced leaders in Latin America have advocated legalizing the consumption of marijuana, saying it would cut the value of the cartels' product.   In 2011, the U.N.'s Global Commission on Drug Policy, which included Fox, recommended that governments experiment with drug legalization, especially marijuana.Last fall, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a candidate for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, said he thought the drug war violence had become so dire that U.S. troops could be sent into Mexico. Drug trafficking in Mexico, he and others have said, fuels criminal organizations around the globe and feeds human and arms trafficking. Perry had barely finished his thought before being pounced on by critics, many within his own party and especially his opponents: How would a limping U.S. economy pay for that? The United States was already involved in two wars. Mexico has historically been highly averse to allowing a foreign force to fight on its soil, experts said. The idea of Team America swooping into its sovereign neighbor is offensive to many Mexicans. Consider the country's national anthem, written after the 1840s Mexican-American War in which Mexico lost half its territory.If some enemy outlander should dare to profane your ground with his sole,think, oh beloved Fatherland, that heaven has given you a soldier in every sonIn 2009, the group Los Tigres del Norte were banned from performing a popular song titled \"La Granja\" at an awards ceremony in Mexico City.The lyrics blast the Mexican government's strategy against the cartels, a \"Fox\" who came to break plates on a farm. The animals got out \"to create a big mess.\" The lyrics also suggest that America, Mexico's No. 1 drug customer, is just as dirty.The piggies helped outThey feed themselves from the farmDaily they want more cornAnd they lose the profitsAnd the farmer that worksDoes not trust them anymore",

They held their guns and kept watch from the sandbag berm they'd built. They could not afford to lose focus. The enemy, they knew, would likely use the bad weather to their advantage. Part of the United States-led coalition, the Kurds have fought ISIS on the ground for months. Ayn al Issa is vital. The terrorists depend on its main road to transport supplies. The Kurds have won and lost and won the area in the past. They know that to take it fully, they must be relentless.A Kurdish sniper takes position, his gun camouflaged.\"We are waiting all the time, we are ready for them,\" the unit's commander said. He wanted to be called Rubar, but would not, for his own security's sake, give his last name or age to CNN. In a brief interview conducted over the phone with U.S.-based reporters, the commander recounted what happened. Read MoreWhen the first pop of gunfire from ISIS fighters came, it was clear the militants had used the cover of the fog to rush the Kurds, to shoot at them within a few yards. The fighting was so close, ISIS fighters dove behind trenches the Kurds had constructed. At one point, a coalition airplane roared overhead, but had to hold fire because of the risk of killing Kurds, Rubar said. How long could a close fight like this last? 20 minutes? 45 minutes? Time is hard to measure when you're fighting for your life. Rubar said it felt like three hours. None of his fighters died, he said. And he was weary, but proud to say they killed at least a dozen ISIS fighters. Some managed to escape, disappearing into the fog.After battle, Kurdish fighters -- women among them -- secure the area after checking dead ISIS fighters for suicide vests.The Kurds did the work of every battle's end with ISIS. They stretched the enemy's corpses' on the ground and, carefully, removed their shirts to make sure none were wearing suicide belts. Then they quickly buried them. For the Kurds, even an enemy who bastardizes a beloved religion, who kills your family and friends and threatens your country, gets to be buried. A suicide vest is found on one of the ISIS fighters.Hours after the fight, Rubar doesn't say he is exhausted. His ragged voice does that for him. Rubar told CNN that his soldiers don't have adequate supplies and weapons. He worries about that. But he's going to keep fighting. His unit plans to head into Raqqa.He said he's unafraid. He knows he could die.\"I know that it's a big possibility,\" he said. \"It's a choice I make. I am ready for death and I accept it.\" Avenging Paris: Kurds dig in to fight outside Raqqa",

        "content": "Story highlightsThe Taliban has tried to kill Fawzia Koofi, an outspoken women's rights advocateShe grew up in a remote area of Afghanistan, but has twice been elected to Parliament Koofi is campaigning to be Afghanistan's next president in an election slated for 2014 Her stress relief from a dangerous job? Her young daughtersThe mother with an important but dangerous job sat down to write a goodbye letter to her two young daughters. Just in case, she thought. The Taliban could get lucky this time and finally kill her.Fawzia Koofi, who is campaigning for the presidency of Afghanistan, began by writing this to her 10- and 12-year-old. \"Today I am going on political business to Faizabad and Darwaz. I hope I will come back soon and see you again, but I have to say that perhaps I will not.\" If she didn't come home, she wrote little Shuhra and Shaharzad, they should take their mother's advice on how to get on without her.\"First,\" she wrote, \"don't forget me.\"Finish school, live independently, stay with your aunt, study abroad. All the money their mother has in the bank, it's all theirs. Spend it wisely, on school.\"A girl needs an education if she is to excel in this man's world.\"Explore the world. Be brave. Make your country a better place.\"All of us human beings will die one day,\" Koofi wrote. \"Maybe today is the day I will die. But if I do, please know that it was for a purpose.\"Despite her security detail receiving a message that the Taliban had planted a bomb under her car, she went, and made it back home safely. This is Koofi, someone who believes without question, even since childhood, that purpose has always guided her. Luck was just something that always showed up when she needed it. She had come from a place where nothing was expected of a woman to being the first female elected to Afghanistan's Parliament, a body reformed after the war. Every outing was a risk.An episode in 2010 proved that. As Koofi's convoy traveled near Kabul, shots were fired at cars carrying her, her daughters and sister. Her security fired back. It was a chaotic nightmare, but they made it out alive. The close call with death is one of many detailed in her new memoir \"The Favored Daughter,\" released as buzz began building about her campaign to become President Hamid Karzai's successor.The country's presidential election is slated for 2014. Under the latest timetable, all U.S. troops are supposed to be gone from the country then. Shuhra and Shaharzad were so young back then. They were too young to remember like their mother does an Afghanistan that, under Taliban rule, forbade girls to go to school and sanctioned the murder of women perceived to have shamed their male relatives. Her girls will only hear of the days when the Taliban ordered homeowners in some parts of Afghanistan to darken their windows so the women inside could not be seen. \"My daughters always feel that I am very exceptional in Afghanistan,\" Koofi said last weekend near Kabul.It was bright out, and she squinted into the sun. Her face lit up when she talked about her daughters. She seemed relaxed and warm, perhaps an unexpected state for a woman who receives constant death threats and changes her phone number all the time. The pressure does get to her, though.\"It's a very difficult life for a woman, to be a woman alone in Afghanistan, to be a mother, to be a single mother and to be a woman politician,\" she said, adjusting her navy headscarf when the breeze catches it. Fawzia Koofi spends time with her daughters Shuhra and Shaharzad. She still laughs as she said in fluent English, \"I get overwhelmed. I get overwhelmed 10 times a day.\"When that happens, she take a few minutes to be alone. And then she turns to her children.\"I forget everything when I'm with my daughters and we watch TV or watch the news.\"She'll sit with them as they message their friends on Facebook.\"Sometimes they are proud of me, and especially when I go to foreign countries,\" Koofi said. \"I tell them that if I don't go, there is no money, so I have to go and raise money for schools for other girls.\"Shuhra and Shaharzad like to tell their classmates, \"My mother builds schools,\" she said.But there are also some mornings when one of her girls will tug at her arm. \"My elder daughter is protective, like a grandmother,\" Koofi said. \"She doesn't want me to go out of the house.\" \"The younger one is realistic. She said, 'Even if a woman becomes president in Afghanistan, it might be difficult to rule Afghanistan.\"The woman who defied Saudi's driving ban and put it on YouTubeDefying death \"Even the day I was born, I was supposed to die.\"That's how Koofi explains her first 24 hours. She was born in 1975 in the remote and wild northeastern province of Badakhshan, near the border of Tajikistan and China. Koofi was the 19th child out of her father's 23 children. Her mother was her father's second wife. Koofi writes in her memoir that she saw him beat her mother badly, tearing out chunks of her hair.But Koofi's mother loved him. This was the way in Afghanistan. Her mother was dignified, strong, yet at the same time she believed that women obeyed their husbands. When wives  failed to please their husbands, they had earned a beating.While her mother was pregnant with Koofi, her father took a seventh wife, a 14-year-old. That depressed her mother terribly, and her pregnancy was troubled. She was pale, sick and exhausted, Koofi wrote.Her mother prayed she would give birth to a boy.Fawzia Koofi photographed in June near Kabul.After a 30-hour labor in a countryside shack, and falling semi-conscious, someone told Koofi's mother disappointing news.The woman turned away from her newborn and refused to hold her child. \"No one cared if the new girl lived, so while they focused on saving my mother, I was wrapped in cloth and placed in the baking sun,\" Koofi wrote.After nearly a day left alone, screaming, and her parents believing that \"nature would take its course\" and she would die, someone went outside and brought the baby indoors.Koofi writes that her mother's instincts to love her kicked in. From then and throughout her early life, Koofi and her mother forged a bond built from surviving circumstances that would probably break most people.Even today, talking with CNN, when Koofi is asked what her mother would think about her running for president, she has no harsh feelings.In fact, she reveres both her mother and her father, who became involved in politics and was killed by Afghan fighters when she was 3.She speaks lovingly about her mother, who died years later. \"My mother always [regarded me] as a special person in her life,\" Koofi said. \"She will always tell me one day you will become something. \"She never told me what that something means for her,\" Koofi said. \"She would be proud, I'm sure. If my mother was alive, my life would be different in a good way because my mother was a big supporter of me.\"She included a letter in her memoir to her late mother.\"I'm a politician now. But sometimes I'm just a silly girl and I make mistakes,\" Koofi wrote. \"When I do make a mistake, I imagine you'll be there, gently chiding me and correcting me.\" Mideast women beat men in education, lose out at workA teenager under the TalibanKoofi laughs as she recalls how she was determined to go to her English classes when she was a girl, before the Taliban took control and prohibited girls from getting an education.  When Koofi was 11, her mother had moved the children to Kabul, where one of her brothers got a job as a police officer.Even during Afghanistan's civil war, Koofi would set out from her family's home to school despite the violence. \"You could see rockets coming from different parts of Kabul, but I could still go,\" she said. Her brothers taunted her unrelentingly. Girls weren't supposed to learn, they said. And her mother was scared  she would get hurt. \"She would tell me, 'If this English class makes you president, I don't want you to be president, I want you to be alive.'\"Kabul introduced Koofi to modernism. She saw women wearing nail polish and makeup. Some of her friends had swimming pools. She talked about poetry and literature with her friends.An Afghan woman shows off her ink-stained finger before casting a vote in Kabul in elections in September 2010.Her life was largely peaceful and fun, she writes, until 1989 when the same rebel fighters who killed her father, the Mujahedeen, were declared the new government. Afghans were still optimistic. The Russians were gone, retreating after years in a war they couldn't win.Afghanistan was changing, and in ways that a 16-year-old girl who was once free to express herself didn't like. With so many male soldiers around, it seemed smart to her family to make Koofi cover herself with a burqa. It was oppressively hot, first of all, young Koofi thought. And what was the point of getting to wear makeup and look pretty when she went to parties? She recalls seeing glamorously dressed female news anchors taken off the air and replaced by \"dowdy women in scarves.\" She was scared about where the country was heading, and went to her mother, who sent her daughter to another city to go to school. Soon, though, the changes in her life got much more serious.One of her brothers who she was especially close to was killed, shot to death in his home. Koofi writes in her memoir that the killing is still a mystery, and the family got little help in solving the crime. The country had become so unstable by this time that justice was in short supply for everyone. As a Muslim, she writes in her memoir, she believes God decides everyone's fate. \"He chooses when we live and when we die. But even that certainty doesn't make the painful events and losses of my life easier to bear.\"One of those heartbreaks came when the man she married was imprisoned by the Taliban shortly after their wedding. He was punished because Taliban leader Mullah Omar wanted to get back at one of her brothers, she writes. Koofi's husband was taken into custody a week after they wed.Koofi's husband was freed and then arrested again. She fought for his freedom, and eventually he was released. But it was too late. He had caught tuberculosis from other prisoners. He lived long enough to see his daughters become adventurous girls who loved to play and dance. But he had to keep his distance, especially when the coughing fits shook him. In his hospital room, Shuhra and Shaharzad came in dressed up like gypsies and sang silly songs. They asked if they could give him a kiss. He refused, too afraid he would infect them. Koofi's husband died later that night. Indian father accused of killing baby 'for being a girl'Taking the burqa offWhen the Taliban came to Kabul, Koofi was in college. At the time, she only vaguely knew who they were, or how they were different from the Mujahedeen. \"In my view, they were all just men with guns,\" she remembered.Soon, the Taliban blasted statues with rocket-propelled grenades and heavy artillery until they fell. \"Then they started destroying our minds,\" she writes, burning schools, books and banning literature.A woman wearing a traditional burqa flees the village of Khanabad U.S. warplanes drop bombs on Taliban positions in 2001.In short order, girls could go nowhere. They were terrified of being accused of \"morality crimes\" and dragged to the Taliban's Ministry of Vice and Virtue.Those were bleak years. But there are bright moments. She had her daughters, and she had started to work for the United Nations Children's Fund, venturing out into the countryside and talking with those who had the worst possible lot under the Taliban.In the frenetic atmosphere in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, she said, for the first time, some of her male counterparts began focusing more on the work they had to do, and how to do it better, than whether she needed to wear a burqa.Before then, she said, \"I never attended a meeting with government officials [without wearing one],\" she said.She was suddenly thrust in the position of initiating school openings for girls. She had to organize vaccine supplies for the children. In her memoir, she writes that a governor who was in meetings with her urged her to take off her burqa. They needed to see her face, he said, to communicate with her.\"They respected me for what I did,\" she recalled.She ached from the loss of her husband and decided she couldn't remarry. She could, however, marry politics. When parliamentary elections were announced, and women were allowed to run, her relatives debated the idea that she put her name on the ballot.She reasoned that she had solid networks from her United Nations work, and she had outreach and support in far-flung displacement camps and villages. Her family name still carried some political weight. She went for it, campaigning as she does today, without wearing a burqa. The Taliban's 'conditions' for womenKoofi believes that in the years since her win in 2005 to her current campaign, life for women in Afghanistan has improved to a degree. There are statistics and reports that support this. In 2004, girls were formally guaranteed a right to an education under the Afghan constitution. Human Rights Watch reported in 2010 that nearly 2 million Afghan girls were enrolled in school (though only a small number advance past elementary school, rights groups have reported). Literacy rates are up for girls between 12 and 16, according to a 2011 Oxfam report. Across Afghanistan, infant mortality rates have dropped and life expectancy has risen, according to Unicef. Women who once had to quit their jobs have gone back to work as doctors, lawyers and police officers, Oxfam reports.But stories of honor killings, poisoned wells at schools for girls and attacks that disfigure women persist. Human Rights Watch reported in March that women are still being targeted for committing \"moral crimes\" like sex outside marriage or running away from home. Koofi said she fears what will happen if the Taliban regains their political footing as a result of ongoing negotiation with the United States intended to stabilize the country.\"You know that [the] Taliban have three conditions -- one of those conditions is women's Islamic rights. I know what that means -- Islamic rights of women. ...\" she said. \"They deprive women from all rights, including the right to [an] education.\" The Taliban must change \"some of its core principles\" and agree that girls can go to school, work and be involved in politics. If they \"come back with the same mentality,\" Koofi said, \"this will be a huge step back for all women, for all citizens.\" \"Our daughters are like the hope, the future of Afghanistan,\" she said. \"I think women have to stand up, they have to raise their voice, demonstrate that they have equal abilities in this country like many other people have.\" Taking chances Her first day in her new job as a lawmaker was the first time Koofi had been inside Afghanistan's parliament building. On her second day, she put her name in for deputy speaker. She knew her chances were slim. Several male members of Parliament practically sneered at her. It was an audacious move. But she made it because she was emboldened by her then 6-year-old daughter, Shuhra. Do you think I should try? Koofi asked her.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Fawzia Koofi and other Afghan women during at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul in October 2011.The little girl promised she'd gather 100 schoolchildren and come down to Parliament and wave flags so that her mom would win.Days later, Koofi was elected deputy speaker.It was an international news event. She felt fantastic, but also like a novelty. She was besieged by expectations. Journalists descended on her. How was she going to fix Afghanistan?   She started with victories that would seem small in the United States but huge in Afghanistan -- getting funding to build a highway, raising awareness about getting girls in school and pushing for women in higher education. She has met with international heavyweights like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and, now in her second parliamentary term, Koofi talked with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She has received praise internationally for championing women's rights, and spoken at the World Economic Forum.Yet, could she really win the presidency in Afghanistan, beating the United States at electing a woman as its top leader? She laughs. \"I don't think any candidate will actually run to lose. I don't run to lose.\"\"Leaders in Afghanistan, once they get elected they don't go back to their community and ask about social problems,\" she said. \"I did. That gives me confidence, esteem, that people will not compare me with other candidates.\" She's sure that villagers in provinces who she worked with during her Unicef days will remember her and support her campaign, she said. When asked if she has any regrets, she pauses. She could have done more in that job, she said. \"I could have mobilized more donors to establish more girls schools in my village or other villages in Badakhshan.\"  The girls who attended schools she did open have always been her biggest supporters, like her daughters.But there's never enough time to do everything she wants, she said. And the pressure on her can come down hard, too much, sometimes.Shuhra and Shaharzad, in those moments, are her peace.\"When I am alone, they fill the gap.\"Saving Face: The struggle and survival of Afghan women",

They fought each other in hand-to-hand combat, running drills at a bucolic encampment near Fort Bragg. Glenn Miller, an ex-Green Beret, ran the place. Wiry and mustached, the Vietnam veteran paced its grounds in fatigues.  A smooth talker, Miller used his contacts in the Army to draw dozens of active-duty military personnel from Bragg, one of the largest US military installations in the world, and Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. It was the early 1980s and the Vietnam War was over.\u202f But Miller tapped into a burning resentment within some soldiers, not only worn down from battles overseas but from ostracization back home.

Come join my \"special forces,\" he appealed to his recruits, claiming that together they would create an all-White utopia by waging a race war and toppling the US government.\u202f\u202f Read MoreGlenn Miller pictured at a White Patriot Party rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1985.A former Marine testified that he obtained a staggering cache of military weapons -- including 200 pounds of C4 explosives, TNT and ammunition -- from active-duty soldiers at Fort Bragg for Miller's White Patriot Party. Undercover agents ultimately infiltrated his group, Miller was sentenced to prison and his grand plans for a race war imploded. But the fact that Miller's ploy advanced as far as it did shocked Department of Defense leaders and revealed to them a painful truth: White supremacists and anti-government extremists had found a home within its ranks. Decades later, they still do.  Since Miller's scheme, cases of service members with racist and extremist ideologies have time and again confronted the Pentagon. Over the years, leaders have taken intermittent stabs at the problem -- providing training on recognizing extremist tattoos, for example. But they have mainly relied on -- and repeatedly revised -- a Defense Department policy intended to prohibit extremism in the ranks, a policy that has not led to meaningful change, experts said. \"Have the policies worked? No. What have we done about it? I'd say not much,\" said Ret. Army Lt. General Mark Hertling, a 37-year veteran who served as the commanding general of the Army in Europe. \"So, here we are again.\"   How many service members harbor extremist views is unknown -- the Defense Department has never kept data on the problem. But the January 6 siege on the US Capitol, in which at least 33 current and former service members have been charged, has reignited concerns at the top echelons of the Pentagon. Lloyd Austin, the new secretary of defense and the first Black person to hold the post, considers the insurrection a \"wake-up call,\" for the military, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told CNN. \"What's vexing about this is we don't have a great sense of the scope of the problem,\" Kirby said. \"Many of these people ... work very hard to conceal their beliefs. We can't be the thought police.\" A new policy fails to stop more attacks Glenn Miller in Raleigh, North Carolina, on April 17, 1984.Miller's 1986 trial made clear that White supremacists were inherently anti-government and that their twisted warrior ethos made joining the military attractive. That same year, hoping to address extremism in the ranks, the Pentagon looked to a 1969 Defense Department policy about anti-Vietnam protesting, and added to it language that prohibited \"active participation,\" such as recruiting or participating in rallies, in \"White supremacy, neo-Nazi and other such groups which espouse or attempt to create overt discrimination.\" But the policy did not ban belonging to those groups, wearing or displaying extremist symbols, distributing propaganda and other ways to passively support extremist views.  In 1988, just two years after Miller went down, a 20-year-old named Timothy McVeigh enlisted in the Army.  While McVeigh was a card-carrying member of the Ku Klux Klan, and even had a White Power T-shirt, there's no record of him being reprimanded for that, said journalist Dan Herbeck, whose book \"American Terrorist\" was culled from more than 70 hours of death row interviews with McVeigh alone, in addition to interviews with more than 150 others. The book details McVeigh's racist exploits and how he openly expressed strident anti-government views. McVeigh also passed around to his Army buddies \"The Turner Diaries,\" dystopian fiction that extremists view as a blueprint for fighting a race war, conquering the US government and creating an all-White paradise. Timothy McVeigh after he joined the US Army, 1988.McVeigh had a successful though short career in the service, leaving in 1991 on the cusp of a promotion. He gradually moved away from the KKK, but his intense hatred for the federal government motivated him, along with fellow Army veteran Terry Nichols, to commit the largest homegrown terror attack in US history, Herbeck said.  In April 1995, they blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people. The men fantasized that the carnage would spark a revolution to bring down the government. \"These guys gravitated toward each other in the Army because they both disliked and distrusted the U.S. government,\" Herbeck said. \"People close to them in the service knew of their views and McVeigh even tried to convert some of his military friends.\" Because McVeigh was a veteran and a so-called lone wolf who didn't belong to any extremist group, the military \"disassociated themselves\" from him, said Ret. US Army Col. Jeff McCausland, who commanded a Gulf War combat battalion and recently wrote about the military's failure to keep out extremists.  \"The attitude in the 1990s in the military unfortunately was he (McVeigh) was in the Gulf War and he was an unhappy guy, kind of dismissive. There was no one saying, 'Gee whiz, maybe we have a problem,'\" McCausland said. \"It was easy to say, 'That guy isn't us.'\" Prosecutors allege Oath Keepers leader and Proud Boys coordinated before Capitol attackAbout eight months after the Oklahoma bombing, it became impossible for the military to keep those blinders on. In December 1995, Army paratrooper James Burmeister and his Fort Bragg friends were drinking at a trailer he kept off base. Burmeister's place was littered with totems of hate -- a Nazi flag, Third Reich books, and neo-Nazi magazines.  When the soldiers headed out to bar hop, Burmeister grabbed his 99 mm Ruger pistol. As the night wore on, Burmeister said that he wanted to earn a coveted neo-Nazi spiderweb tattoo. For that, he needed to hunt and kill Black people.   He and two soldiers slid into a Chevrolet Cavalier and drove to a predominantly Black neighborhood in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Their headlights illuminated two targets: Jackie Burden and Michael James, who were out for a walk.  The car stopped, Burmeister climbed out and fired into the couple's heads at close range.  Arrests and convictions were swift. Burmeister went to prison for life.  James Burmeister listens as he is convicted of two counts of first-degree murder in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Feb. 27, 1997. Shaken by the murders, the Army launched a sweeping investigation that identified at least 22 soldiers with links to extremist groups. And military officials learned Burmeister had been brazen about his beliefs, hanging a Nazi flag in his barracks where he also kept a KKK belt buckle and White supremacist newspapers. But none of that had been enough to violate military rules until the murder, because he wasn't \"actively\" participating in extremism, said Ret. Army Col. George Reed, who was in charge of the criminal investigation into the slayings. \"The Army did a lot of reflecting and soul searching during that time,\" Reed recalled. \"We learned so many lessons from (the murders at Bragg), but I fear we've forgotten them. Instead of tackling the problem in a meaningful way, we've been putting a Band-Aid on a policy every time there's an embarrassing event that happens.\"  At a 1996 Congressional hearing focused on the Bragg killings and Oklahoma City bombing, military leaders admitted that the anti-extremism policy -- unchanged since 1986 -- was flawed. Discerning the \"difficult issue\" of what constituted active or passive participation in extremism left room for confusion, and the military also needed training and tools to help them detect when service members were extremists, a senior Pentagon official testified at the time. So, once again, the Pentagon beefed up the policy to a version that, largely, remains in effect today. It required military personnel to \"reject participation in organizations that espouse supremacist causes\" and prohibited discrimination. Distributing propaganda, training and fundraising on behalf of those groups also violated the policy. And, it firmly placed the onus on commanders to discern if their service members were violating the policy and, if so, how to punish them. But, despite those enhancements, the policy fell short, experts said. It still did not prohibit mere membership in an extremist organization, and its focus on organizations themselves created a blind spot for those who subscribe to a movement but don't belong to any group. Another big flaw, they contend, was that it placed the responsibility of identifying and punishing extremists on commanders, resulting in uneven enforcement. \"You might have a soldier who's posted something racist and one commander may think that's worth a reprimand while another thinks it deserves something more severe,\" said Ret. Lt. Gen. Hertling, who is a CNN military analyst. \"We should be trying to avoid these types of people getting in in the first place.\" 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy toward extremism Several years into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as the need for recruits rose, Pentagon researchers bluntly concluded that the military had a \"'don't ask, don't tell' policy pertaining to extremism.\" \"If individuals can perform satisfactorily, without making their extremist opinions overt through words or actions that violate policy, reflect poorly on the Armed Forces, or disrupt the effectiveness and order of their units, they are likely to be able to complete their contracts,\" according to a 2005 report by the Defense Personnel Security Research Center which was examining how to identify \"terrorists\" in the course of the recruitment process. At about the same time that report was published, military police investigator Scott Barfield was working to identify gang members in the service. While doing that, he also found dozens of White supremacists and other extremists, he told CNN.  \"They didn't try to deny it,\" Barfield said, adding that some enlistees told him that recruiters actually helped them cover up their extremist tattoos or pass them off as meaning something else. \"I'd do an inspection in the barracks and identify extremists and gang members and the response I would get is, 'I have a quota to deploy and we have a mission. If we deploy and get them out of this environment, we'll be fine.'\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\"I reported them all up the chain and I can't remember one person that got in trouble, ever,\" Barfield said. \"Nothing ever happened.\"  Frustrated, Barfield spoke to reporters about his experience. His superiors reprimanded him for talking to the press without prior authorization, he said, and he left his military work in 2006. Today, he works as a civilian police detective. Barfield's assertion that there were dozens of White supremacists and other extremists in uniform is \"overwrought,\" said David S.C. Chu, who was the undersecretary of Defense for personnel and readiness, overseeing recruitment and career development, from 2001 to 2009.   Chu said that while Barfield concluded certain members were extremist, military procedure would have dictated that a larger investigation take place to determine if Barfield's information was correct. In some instances, investigations concluded that Barfield was right and, Chu recalled, those service members were dismissed from the Armed Forces. But in others, Barfield's conclusions were not substantiated, Chu said. Neither he nor Barfield were able to provide records to CNN; they could only recall their experience of what transpired about 15 years ago. As Barfield watched live coverage of the insurrection, his mind raced as he saw the police outnumbered. \"My fear was always (that) you're going to create a much more dangerous extremist when you give him urban warfare training (in the military),\" Barfield said, \"and they come back home and teach their local extremists.\" National Guard soldier posts on neo-Nazi forum Some 14 years after Barfield's warnings, a Defense Department report last year detailed the brazenness of White supremacists in the military. One of several examples in the report shows a National Guard soldier bragging on a neo-Nazi online forum.   \"I'm 100% open about everything with the friends I made in training,\" the service member posted. \"They know about it all ... I'd say the craziest sh*t and get away with it.\" The report also notes that a White supremacist Army veteran trained other extremists in firearms and hand-to-hand combat, encouraging other racists to enlist so they could use their training against the US government.  Made public only after a reporter obtained it in February, the report struck a chord with Daryl Johnson, a former extremism analyst with the US Department of Homeland Security.   In 2009, Johnson authored a DHS report cautioning that right-wing extremists could foment anti-government resentment in veterans struggling to find jobs in the recession or recruit those angry about the election of the first Black President or fearful of possible gun restrictions.  \"The willingness of a small percentage of military personnel to join extremist groups during the 1990s because they were disgruntled, disillusioned, or suffering from the psychological effects of war is being replicated today,\" Johnson wrote. But soon after its release, Johnson's paper was decried by a veterans' group who said it was disparaging to those who served. The controversy prompted the head of DHS, Secretary Janet Napolitano, to apologize to veterans, clarifying that the report was an assessment and not an accusation. The report was revised and an edited version was reissued.  Later that year, Army Major Nidal Hasan shot to death 13 people and injured dozens more at Fort Hood in Texas. Hasan said he'd gunned down soldiers being deployed to Afghanistan in order to protect fellow Muslims.  In this November 10, 2009 file photo, soldiers salute as they honor victims of the Fort Hood shooting at a memorial service at Fort Hood, Texas.Prior to the rampage, Hasan had been emailing about violence with an al Qaeda spokesperson -- emails that were intercepted by the FBI, but the bureau ultimately decided Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities. Service members who knew Hasan told investigators that he had seemed like a \"ticking time bomb\" for openly supporting violent jihad, but the Major was not disciplined for expressing those views. Instead, Hasan was lauded for his military work and promoted. Reacting to the Fort Hood murders, the Defense Department again updated its anti-extremism policy, this time banning service members from communicating extremist ideology through email or online posts.  In 2012, the DOD made its latest addition to the policy -- which remains in effect today -- for the first time explicitly prohibiting service members from actively advocating \"extremist\" and \"criminal gang doctrine.\" The rule warns service members against \"knowingly wearing gang colors or clothing; having tattoos or body markings associated with such gangs or organizations.\" \"What is frustrating about this change is that the Defense Department doesn't tell you what they mean by 'extremist' anywhere in the regulation, so that's left open to debate,\" military law attorney James M. Branum told CNN. \"And you could wear so-called gang colors but how do you prove 'knowingly'?\" JUST WATCHEDNew charges against former Marine One crew member in Capitol riotReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew charges against former Marine One crew member in Capitol riot 03:02Branum said he's never heard of anyone being prosecuted using the policy.  \"In my experience, that's because the policy can be interpreted so many different ways,\" he said. \"It's vague.\" Whether those policy changes resulted in extremist service members being punished or discharged can't be quantified because the Defense Department hasn't kept records on that, Pentagon press secretary Kirby said.  It's clear, however, that tweaking the policy didn't prevent extremist soldiers from committing more high-profile crimes. Most notably, active-duty soldiers from Fort Stewart, Georgia, formed what prosecutors deemed \"an anarchist group and militia\" called FEAR, which stood for Forever Enduring, Always Ready. The group plotted to kill Barack Obama and overthrow the government, prosecutors said in late 2012. The militia was exposed after four soldiers killed two people in order to keep the militia secret. Each was convicted. And, between 2017 and 2019 alone, there have been at least 15 instances of service members accused of acting in the name of extremist ideology, according to the Anti-Defamation League. That includes a Coast Guard lieutenant, sentenced in early 2020 to 13 years behind bars on weapons charges. Prosecutors said he was a White nationalist who plotted to kill liberal politicians and television journalists. \"You look at the Capitol and see these veterans and service members taking part ... it's a shame, but we saw this coming, in a way,\" Johnson told CNN. \"I don't know how many times the Pentagon needs to be told to do something more.\" The Pentagon's policy is 'not working'On January 6, Jason Crow could hear glass breaking and the mob pounding on the doors of the House of Representatives as he, in the gallery a floor above, rushed to make sure those doors were locked.  The Democratic congressman, who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was deflated when he later learned that some of the rioters were active-duty service members and fellow veterans.  \"We had this common experience of service and we all raised our right hands and pledged fidelity to the Constitution,\" he said. \"It's still hard to think about.\" Symbols of the military were everywhere at the Capitol. People in camouflage were spotted heading single file into the building with their hands on each other's shoulders in a military stack. Olive-colored helmets. Body armor. A retired Air Force Reserve officer was photographed on the Senate floor wearing a helmet, green tactical vest and black-and-camo jacket while clutching a white flex cuff, which is used by law enforcement to restrain or detain subjects.Retired Air Force Reserve officer, Larry Rendell Brock, seen on the Senate floor on January 6.The arrest of an Army reservist and Naval contractor prompted the Navy to conduct their own investigation, finding that more than 30 of his naval base coworkers said he expressed extremist views about Jews, minorities and women. Prosecutors said he kept offensive videos on his phone, including one in which he said, \"the Jews did 9/11.\" A manager had also rebuked the contractor, Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, who had a secret-classification security clearance, for wearing a Hitler mustache at the base, according to federal court filings. His attorney recently said in court that Hale-Cusanelli, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, hasn't acted violently based on his beliefs, and that he isn't part of any White supremacist groups. At least three military veterans who have been affiliated with the right-wing militia the Oath Keepers were charged with conspiracy related to the insurrection. The FBI obtained an audio recording of Army veteran Jessica Watkins communicating on a walkie-talkie phone app with others inside the Capitol. A man's voice is heard offering encouragement and, referring to her Army training, \"We'll see you soon, Jess. Airborne.\" Watkins has since disavowed the militia group and pleaded not guilty to the federal charges against her. The Pentagon's policy against extremism is \"not working,\" Crow said.  US Rep. Jason Crow comforts Rep. Susan Wild while taking cover as protesters disrupt the joint session of Congress to certify the Electoral College vote on January 6, 2021. \"You can have binders of policies and it won't matter if they aren't enforced by the command and you aren't trained on them,\" he said. \"When you're in basic training, you're working on marksmanship, how to march, but we don't spend near enough time countering extremism and racism ...\" Lawmakers and experts have called for several changes, from the herculean task of monitoring the social media accounts of some 1.3 million active-duty personnel to coordinating with the FBI on identifying tattoos to better training staff in recognizing the signs of extremism. While those measures might help, they won't completely purge extremists from the Armed Forces, reasoned Ret. Army Gen. Peter Chiarelli, the vice chief of staff of the Army between 2008 and 2012.  The military represents a cross-section of an America where extremism, in all its forms, thrives, he said. \"I know Lloyd (Austin) recognizes this problem: we get these people when they're 18, sometimes older, so we are battling to change all the prejudices and wrong things they've learned up until they put on a uniform.\" New defense secretary 'cannot afford to fail'Two weeks after he was confirmed as defense secretary, Austin ordered a \"stand down,\" instructing military leaders to pick one day in the following two months to discuss extremism with their service members and report back. Austin has already received \"anecdotal feedback,\" Kirby said, which is \"reinforcing for us that there is a problem out there.\"  Kirby declined to elaborate, saying that Austin wants to wait until all commands deliver their assessments, so he can digest that information and plan next steps. \"The stand down is not a one-and-done or a panacea,\" Kirby said. \"Secretary Austin is going to be dealing with this every day, continually raising it with leaders.\"  It's impossible to underscore the complexities that await him. Secretary of Defense Ret. Army Gen. Lloyd Austin answers questions during his confirmation before the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 19, 2021.The military has always tried to walk the line between guaranteeing service members' First Amendment rights to expression, assembly and religion while also recognizing that some ideologies run counter to its oath to defend the Constitution and obey the orders of the president, said Kirby. Then there is the quandary of defining what exactly is extremist. \"What is a radical group or ideology to some will not be to others,\" said Ret. Col. McCausland. \"Is Black Lives Matter an extremist group? Is Antifa an extremist group? I can promise you there are some commanders who will draw that false equivalency. So where is the line drawn?\" Making Austin's challenge even more daunting is that he's operating blind, in a way. The Pentagon has no data pertaining to extremist service members, said Kirby.  Commanders in charge of identifying and punishing service members may have information about how they've handled certain cases, but that information has never been collated across branches. Even if it was, it wouldn't provide much historical context because commanders don't maintain that information for long, Kirby said. \"If the Secretary were to say (to commanders), 'OK, I want you to give me all the accountability on extremist activity, they would be hard-pressed to do that,\" Kirby said. JUST WATCHEDOath Keepers accused of weapons trainingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHOath Keepers accused of weapons training 03:17The lack of data shows that the military \"has not treated the issue of extremists in the ranks as an ongoing and long-term problem,\" said Mark Pitcavage, an extremism expert with the Anti-Defamation League who has a PhD in military history. \"The military has only responded to specific controversies rather than thinking this is something we'll always have to deal with.\" There are several practical changes the military could make right now to address the problem, he said. There should be a central communication pipeline so that anyone can report when they believe a service member is aligned with an extremist group or ideology. When the Anti-Defamation League has identified online posts featuring suspected service members espousing extremist beliefs, the group doesn't always know who to call and if they do, they rarely know if their message was conveyed up the chain of command, Pitcavage said.  Key personnel such as noncommissioned officers, junior officers, equal opportunity trainers and recruiters need training to recognize behavior and symbols that may indicate a service member's extremist leanings. And, there should be a system created that allows service members to report extremist colleagues anonymously, Pitcavage said. \"There are some who fear retribution, who don't want to speak out and figure that there's a big risk in doing that.\" Kirby said Secretary Austin is \"keeping an open mind\" and is considering adding to the policy yet again, this time explicitly prohibiting membership -- or allegiance -- to any extremist movement. Austin's legacy will be shaped by this moment, said McCausland. The nation's first person of color to head the Pentagon not only has an opportunity to clean dangerous ideologues from the ranks, but he is also expected to curb sexual harassment and rape in the military. He has to create a climate that is safe and productive for transgender service members. On top of all of that, he's got to worry about the usual headaches -- Chinese aggression, nuclear advancement in Iran and more. \"But the problem of extremism is higher than it's ever been, and the Capitol riot showed us that,\" McCausland said. \"He cannot afford to fail.\" CNN's Ellie Kaufman, Oren Liebermann and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)As a Georgia state trooper, Jacob Thompson impressed his bosses. They praised him for setting records in his unit for traffic stops and DUI busts. They commended his dedication to serving on the agency's honor guard. And they noted that in his off hours he raised money for a children's hospital and worked as a volunteer firefighter. So representative of the sort of trooper the agency coveted, Thompson was pictured on recruitment brochures. Just last year, he was given a \"Trooper Of The Year\" award. But these days, Thompson's once bright career seems unreconcilable with where he is now: Stripped of his badge and sitting in a county jail awaiting trial for felony murder. On August 7, Thompson shot and killed Julian Lewis, a 60-year-old Black man, following a chase in the quiet town of Sylvania. He was fired a week later.  The shooting quickly thrust this small slice of Georgia into the national spotlight, with some, including the Lewis family attorney, comparing his death to those of George Floyd and Eric Garner. Yet, more than a month on, national attention on this case has dimmed. With the dashcam video and other evidence withheld by state investigators and no known bystander video, the public outcry over Lewis's death was short-lived. Read MoreDespite the lack of details released about the shooting, interviews, transcripts and documents obtained by CNN offer a glimpse into Thompson's seven-year career as a trooper and clues into how a chase along east Georgia's country roads left one man dead and another behind bars.  Protesters march in downtown Sylvania, Georgia, on September 19, 2020 over the shooting of Julian Lewis.The night of the shooting, and the 'ugliest kind of lie'It began with a broken taillight.  Thompson told investigators that's why he tried to pull Lewis over that night, but Lewis kept driving, turned on his hazard lights and made some hand signals to Thompson before heading down a couple of country roads.   Lewis lit a cigarette as he drove. An unopened beer sat in the console. At the time, Lewis was on parole for driving impaired, records show, due to end in late August.  As they sped along, Thompson decided to ram Lewis's car, performing what's known as a PIT maneuver -- a technique allowed if a trooper believes stopping a chase is in the interest of public safety. Lewis's car spun out and stopped in a ditch.  Thompson parked his patrol vehicle \"approximately even\" with Lewis's car and drew his weapon as he stepped out, he wrote in an incident report.  \"At some point, I heard the engine on the violator's vehicle revving at a high rate of speed,\" Thompson said, noting that he activated the light on his gun. Lewis had \"both hands on the steering wheel\" and was wrenching it \"in an aggressive back and forth manner towards me and my patrol vehicle,\" the trooper wrote. \"It appeared to me that the violator was trying to use his vehicle to injure me.\" He fired his gun once, he said, then peered inside the car and realized he'd shot Lewis in the forehead.   \n\n\n\nView note\n\nBut Thompson's account is contrary to what evidence and dashcam video shows happened, GBI agent Dustin Peak testified at the trooper's August 24 bond hearing. The video reveals, \"approximately one second after Mr. Thompson's foot came off the brake and the vehicle went into park, the shot -- one shot was fired,\" Peak said.  Peak also noted that the crash left Lewis's car inoperable and its wheels facing away from Thompson's vehicle.  Lewis's vehicle was a front-wheel-drive car, Peak said, and the driver's side was resting in soft sand, which would have kicked up if the tire had spun. \"There's no indication that the front tire ever rotated,\" the agent said.  Asked by prosecutor J. Barclay Black whether Lewis's car posed a threat to Thompson that justified deadly force, Peak replied, \"No, sir.\"  There were no witnesses to the shooting, Peak added.  While searching the car, agents did not find any firearms or drugs, the agent testified. Apart from the unopened beer can, investigators recovered Lewis's cell phone in the driver's side pocket.  A GBI toxicology report completed a couple weeks after Peak's testimony would show Lewis had cocaine, methamphetamine and the prescription anti-depressant fluoxetine in his system. \n\n\n\nView note\nDefense attorney Robert Persse suggested that Thompson was so traumatized after killing Lewis that he couldn't accurately remember the moments around the shooting. Peak conceded, \"I'm sure it's possible.\"  Julian Lewis's widow, Betty, took the stand at the bond hearing, telling the judge that Thompson's characterization of her husband as threatening is \"the ugliest kind of lie\" when it comes to Black people and police. \"It plays on the stereotypes that Black men are violent,\" she said.The judge denied bond for Thompson, who was arrested on felony murder and aggravated assault charges. He has not entered a plea.  The defense team plans to look into whether the car was actually inoperable, Persse told CNN, declining to comment further. Black declined to comment for the story.  Betty Lewis, wife of the late Julian Lewis, speaks at a candlelight vigil in his honor held in downtown Sylvania, Georgia on August 14, 2020.Betty Lewis told CNN her husband \"wasn't a violent\" man, and that she believes he wasn't fleeing at all. He was probably trying to reach a well-lit spot at an uncle's home nearby, she said. Lewis likely kept driving for the same reason people of color fear being stopped by law enforcement and sometimes don't stop, said family attorney Francys Johnson, the former head of Georgia's NAACP chapter. They suspect that police are \"looking for a reason to confirm ... suspicion of your criminality.\" Trooper praised for being competitiveThompson was fired for what is described in records only as \"negligence or inefficiency in performing assigned duties\" or commission of a felony.  It's an abrupt bookend to a career marked mostly with praise for his work ethic and sense of responsibility, traits rewarded with multiple promotions.  Coworkers liked him. One even took the time to tell his boss about how Thompson delivered diapers and sippy cups -- items belonging to his own young son -- to toddlers who were hospitalized after a car crash. Former Georgia State Trooper Jacob Thompson.Each one of Thompson's annual performance reviews was largely positive, noting his many accomplishments. He received compliments from members of the public and frequently led his post in DUI enforcement. Still, his bosses consistently stressed that he should increase his numbers -- amp up stops for speeding and distracted driving and increase his crash work. It was a competitive environment, one where his numbers were ranked against his coworkers'.  In a 2019 evaluation, a manager wrote that Thompson led his post in DUI busts and won a MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) pin.  His \"results oriented\" personality helped him often lead his post in other achievements. His \"weakest\" category was catching speeders despite making 130 speeding arrests and issuing 140 warnings that year. He was told to increase his numbers.Also, that year his manager praised Thompson for being \"competitive\" and told him that he ranked \"second\" among post colleagues for the number of distracted driving tickets and warnings he gave.  \n\n\n\nView note\nThe manager noted that Thompson's judgment had improved from previous years, during which the trooper was investigated after drivers lodged complaints about him.  He was also called out for being aggressiveIn 2016, Melissa Lee sat on the side of a Georgia highway, holding her boyfriend Brent Thibeaux's hand, praying for their safety. Thompson had just pulled them over.  The Black couple had flown from San Francisco to Atlanta and hopped in a rental car, bound for Sylvania to surprise her dad on his 65th birthday.  On the outskirts of town, they said they noticed Thompson in their rear view. Odd, she thought, because she didn't appear to be speeding or breaking any laws.  Thompson drove up next to their car, looked at them, dropped back and trailed the couple for several miles, they said, causing Lee to become so nervous that she hit the white line. They were convinced they'd been profiled because it seemed that Thompson followed them, just waiting for them to do something to justify a stop, Lee told CNN. And they felt it strange that after Thompson asked for her identification and rental information, he also asked Thibeaux for his identification. Thompson let them go without a ticket.  Thibeaux described their experience in a complaint with the state attorney general's office, insisting that the couple had been victims of \"driving while Black.\"  Thompson's account of the incident is similar, records show, except he alleged he only started following the couple after he saw Lee hitting the white line and then tried to catch her driving pattern on camera.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nA captain who reviewed the incident told Thibeaux that he could understand the couple's concern from \"your point of view\" but that the trooper's actions were \"consistent\" with his job duties.  Lee and Thibeaux weren't happy with that explanation. Thompson's bosses were \"covering\" for him, Thibeaux told CNN.  The encounter changed the way they travel in Georgia. Today, they fly into a city closer to Sylvania to spend less time on the road, hoping that lessens their chances of being pulled over.  In 2017, George S. Hall saw Thompson's blue lights behind him. He, too, was surprised to be pulled over. He'd done nothing wrong, he thought. Thompson would later say he initially believed Hall wasn't wearing a seat belt and Hall's window tinting looked too dark.  The stop quickly devolved into a standoff with Thompson repeatedly questioning the 66-year-old Black man about whether he'd been drinking or doing drugs and Hall refusing to answer, telling the trooper he didn't trust him, records reveal. Thompson's tone was \"authoritative and demeaning,\" Hall wrote in his complaint, and added that it felt like Thompson had racially profiled him.  As the increasingly tense stop bore on, documents show, Hall disclosed he had a firearm and permit. Thompson handcuffed him, later telling a lieutenant investigating the complaint that he did so because he intended to arrest Hall for DUI because Hall's eyes looked \"bloodshot and watery\" and he smelled alcohol on his breath, and because the stop might get out of control.  JUST WATCHEDBreonna Taylor's aunt reads powerful words from Taylor's motherReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBreonna Taylor's aunt reads powerful words from Taylor's mother 03:26But Thompson told the investigator that he began to doubt he'd smelled alcohol and that Hall's dark clothing had made it seem he wasn't wearing a seat belt, so maybe he was wrong. And, in fact, Thompson told the investigator, he realized Hall's tinting was legal. The trooper removed the cuffs and let Hall go.  Thompson had been \"somewhat overly aggressive,\" the investigating lieutenant found, noting that he and a sergeant \"counseled TFC Thompson about his tactics and communication on this particular stop.\"  Thompson \"admitted that he'd never had anyone refuse his requests to this extent,\" the lieutenant wrote, concluding his probe by calling the young trooper an \"asset\" for his \"very aggressive and proactive\" DUI enforcement.  The only substantiated complaint against Thompson happened in 2015 when he called Georgia resident Sean Wood a \"dumbass for wrecking\" after Wood hydroplaned off the road and totaled his car, an internal investigation found.  A captain determined that Thompson was \"unprofessional\" and wrote to Wood, \"You describe TFC Thompson's entire demeanor as uncaring and I would have to agree that he could have definitely shown more compassion and empathy ...\"  Thompson was coached on his behavior, records show.  An internal memo from the captain to a major said that while he wasn't trying to make an excuse for Thompson, the trooper had worked five crashes that day with another two pending.  Wood, who is White, recently saw the news about Thompson's arrest. \"One thing I can say, his demeanor and attitude that day kind of gave us a very strange vibe ...,\" he told CNN. \"It came off to us that he was on a power trip.\"  The shooting has left this town on edgeFrancys Johnson, Statesboro civil rights attorney and co-counsel for the Julian Lewis family, at a caravan in downtown Sylvania on Saturday, September 19, 2020.The national reckoning over race and policing, which has sparked months of protests and fueled anger between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter supporters, hasn't spared Screven County. The community is about two hours north of Glynn County, where in February jogger Ahmaud Arbery was chased by two White men and shot dead.But it doesn't mean folks in Screven want to join the conversation.   Lewis's shooting has \"everybody on edge,\" said Fire Department Chief Harvey Cryder.  \"People are just walking very lightly and trying not to comment on anything. People have disconnected and got off Facebook,\" he said. \"If you say you support him then you don't support Black people but if you support Black Lives Matter, then you're wrong, too.\"  To some there, Thompson is considered, as one person described, a \"local son,\" a kindhearted churchgoing father who comes from a well-respected family.  CNN tried to reach Thompson's parents without success. His wife declined to be interviewed.    Campus police in Texas entered a sleeping student's dorm room with a gun and taser after a false report was filed, university saysAt Thompson's bond hearing, his defense attorney presented 50 letters from supporters, including a former mayor from the area and numerous law enforcement professionals. They exulted Thompson as compassionate and selfless.  Even some who Thompson had pulled over wanted the judge to know that he was kind and fair.  And two felons who had been on fire department work programs weighed in, one gushing that Thompson had helped him \"grow not only as a firefighter but as a human being.\" A man who said he was one of only two Black deputies in adjacent Jenkins County wrote, \"Jake never showed any tendencies of being racist.\" It seemed unfathomable to them that what happened the night of August 7 was anything more than Thompson defending himself. They struggle to picture where he is now, sitting in a cell.  Separated from violent inmates, Thompson bunks with low-level offenders, guys who have odd jobs around the jail.   His family visits. So do troopers.  Sometimes he's allowed outside for a couple hours, able to walk around a concrete enclosure.   He is kept from the unrest stirring outside those walls. On a recent Saturday, in downtown Sylvania, Betty Lewis, her attorney and others gathered in front of city hall and held a peaceful protest, demanding that video of her husband's shooting be released. Marchers held their fists aloft; one carried a sign of the American flag with dozens of white strips of paper fluttering in the breeze. On each read the name of a Black person killed by law enforcement. Men, who were not law enforcement, showed up too, some with long guns and wearing camouflage. Johnson, the family attorney, had his own armed bodyguards because, he said, he'd received death threats.  \"What we were looking for was justice ... I just felt what they trying to do (was) intimidate us,\" Lewis said.  \"We campaigned that day for the videos and tapes of Julian, which I feel we have a right to,\" she continued. \"I'm angry about it ... we shouldn't have to beg.\" \"I need some type of closure here ... There was no reason why Julian had to die that way.\"  CNN's Majlie de Puy Kamp contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, one of the most prominent dance companies in the US and an iconic institution in the world of Black performing arts, on Monday fired a senior artistic director amid allegations of sexual harassment. Troy Powell, the 51-year-old artistic director of Ailey's junior touring company and a teacher at The Ailey School in New York City, was dismissed following an investigation commissioned by the school to look into the misconduct claims, the organization said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a tip or sensitive material to share with CNN?\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation, which was sparked by social media posts, concluded that Powell had \"engaged in inappropriate communications with adults enrolled in the School,\" according to a statement released by the Ailey organization Monday evening. \"Because his conduct was inconsistent with the standards expected of Ailey's staff, executive leadership concluded that Mr. Powell could not continue in his position with the organization, and he is no longer employed in any capacity,\" the organization said. Powell had been placed on a leave of absence in June during the investigation, according to the statement. Powell, who has been a key figure at Ailey for decades, did not respond to requests for comment late Monday. Read MoreFour former students at The Ailey School told CNN over the last two weeks that Powell had abused his position of power, including in ways that went beyond \"inappropriate communications.\" They alleged that Powell touched them inappropriately or made sexual overtures that included sending a student an \"unwanted\" photo. Three of the students said that after they rebuffed Powell's advances, they were cut from performances or rejected during auditions, which they believed to be a form of retaliation by Powell. The allegations against Powell that were detailed by the ex-dancers who spoke to CNN spanned from 2003 to 2011.Two former dancers said they complained to administrators of The Ailey School about Powell's conduct years ago, but he was allowed to remain in his position, traveling with the company and teaching classes. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about that allegation. Powell, a high-profile dancer, choreographer and teacher at Ailey, started his training as a scholarship student at the school at age nine, according to his online biography on the company's website, which was taken down this week. A larger-than-life figure in the halls of the school's glassy building near New York's Columbus Circle, Powell performed around the world and taught at The Ailey School before taking over in 2012 as artistic director of Ailey II, the group's junior touring company which is seen as a stepping-stone to the most prestigious dancing roles.But behind the scenes, rumors about Powell's behavior spread among the close-knit group of Ailey alumni who've interacted with him, dancers said.Last month, those rumors erupted on social media: A TikTok video of two dancers with the caption \"When you wanna be in Ailey 2 ... But guys gotta sleep with Troy Powell\" circulated widely among the school's alumni in recent weeks. And several former students posted sometimes tearful social media videos of themselves detailing the harassment they faced from Powell.Peter Martins retires from NYC Ballet amid sexual harassment allegationsFollowing that, an attorney working with Ailey's general counsel retained by the school reached out to several of the dancers who had commented on the social media posts. Three of the dancers told CNN they had been interviewed by that attorney. Powell's dismissal was first reported by The New York Observer. His downfall represents the latest sexual harassment scandal to hit a leading US dance institution in recent years. Peter Martins, the artistic director at New York City Ballet, retired in 2018 amid allegations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse, which he denied, and Marcelo Gomes, a star dancer at the American Ballet Theater, resigned in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct. Gomes, who has danced with other groups since, has declined to comment about the allegation against him.The Ailey company was launched in 1958, when it was difficult for many Black dancers to perform with mainstream dance groups. Its founder, choreographer and modern dance pioneer Alvin Ailey, used his experiences growing up in deeply segregated rural Texas to create breathtaking dances that incorporate the history and spirituality of Black America.Before his death in 1989, Ailey grew the organization from a small ensemble to an empire that pulled in $48 million in revenue between July 2017 and June 2018, the most recent year for which its financial information is available. Ailey dancers have performed at the presidential inaugurations for Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and the group was deemed a \"vital American cultural ambassador to the world\" in a 2008 Congressional resolution.",

It was more than the place that treated her husband Samuel when his severe allergies make it hard for him to breathe.One doctor there was her grandniece's godfather. Another was a trusted friend.Going to the hospital was \"like going home to us,\" the 73-year-old retired schoolteacher said. \"For Samuel and I, that is the only hospital we have ever known.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely.\n\n\n\nNow, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the hospital will close its doors Tuesday after serving the community for more than 100 years. The only hospital in the coal mining community of Mingo County, West Virginia, Williamson Memorial filed bankruptcy last year.And it's not alone. As the deadly virus has spread beyond urban hotspots, many more small hospitals across the country are on the verge of financial ruin as they've been forced to cancel elective procedures, one of the few dependable sources of revenue. Read MoreWilliamson Memorial and similar facilities have been struggling since long before the pandemic -- at least 170 rural hospitals have shut down since 2005, according to University of North Carolina research on rural hospital closures. \n\nBut even as hospitals in cities like New York City and Detroit have been deluged with coronavirus patients, many rural facilities now have the opposite problem: their beds are near-empty, their operating rooms are silent, and they're bleeding cash.  \"It's a scary time for small, rural hospitals right now,\" said Michael Kozar, CEO of Northwest Florida Community Hospital in Chipley, Florida, a Panhandle town of about 3,500 people. \"If you're not in a surge market, you're sitting there and watching your business go to zero.\"More than 100 hospitals and hospital systems around the country have already furloughed tens of thousands of employees, according to a tally by industry news outlet Becker's Hospital Review. They've sent home nurses and support staffers who would be deemed essential under state stay-home orders. \nAnd many of the rural areas with hospitals that have closed or are at risk of doing so have large elderly populations and patients with heart disease and elevated rates of health complications like obesity and diabetes, which can make the virus more deadly, according to experts. Rural communities also have higher rates of uninsured patients. As of Saturday, more than 80% of rural counties nationwide reported positive cases of Covid-19, totaling more than 34,500 people, according to data from the University of Iowa. If infection numbers rise in those areas, as public health experts predict, cash-strapped hospitals might not have the resources to handle a surge.The crisis is a \"match in a tinder box,\" said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association. \"And when it lights -- it's going to be devastating.\"Closing during a pandemicFor years, rural hospitals have suffered because their patient populations are decreasing and they've been hit with reductions in federal funding through Medicaid and Medicare. Nineteen rural hospitals closed in 2019, the most of any year on record, said Mark Holmes, a health policy professor and the director of UNC's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which has tracked the closings. Slightly less than half of the 170 rural facilities that shuttered in the last 15 years have reopened in some form, finding second lives as nursing homes, rehabilitation centers or part-time urgent care clinics, Holmes said. But most of these provide a fraction of the services they once did. \n\nNow, coronavirus has forced hospitals around the country to cancel non-essential procedures like colonoscopies, mammograms and physical therapy that helped many stay afloat. \"Facilities are just bleeding through cash right now,\" said Ryan Kelly, executive director of the Mississippi and Alabama Rural Health Associations. \"They're just dying on the vine, and it opens up the question of who's going to treat these patients when they close.\"The number of closed hospitals is almost guaranteed to rise in the coming weeks -- starting with Williamson Memorial. A 76-bed hospital tucked into the wooded hills overlooking the riverside town of Williamson -- home to West Virginia's first building constructed entirely of coal -- it's been serving residents since around 1920.Williamson Memorial Hospital closed Tuesday leaving Mingo County West Virginia without a hospitalMingo County's population has steadily declined in recent years, according to the Census Bureau. Many of the patients coming to the hospital have no insurance or depend on Medicaid and Medicare, which don't fully reimburse the costs of treatment, said Dr. Donovan Beckett, who runs a clinic connected with the hospital. By the time it filed for bankruptcy in October 2019, Williamson Memorial was more than $1 million in debt, according to court records.  Gene Preston came on as the hospital's CEO a day after the bankruptcy filing. The plan was to work with Williamson Health & Wellness Center, which bought the hospital's assets, and offload overhead as well as put an urgent care facility alongside the emergency room, he said. The ER generated the hospital's greatest revenue, said Preston.  But along came Covid-19 and, following social distancing rules and governed by the fear of getting close to those possibly infected, fewer people went to the hospital. Emergency room visits dropped significantly and, like other health care facilities, Williamson Memorial stopped doing elective procedures, another dependable profit source, he said. \"If not for Covid, we were on track to work it out,\" Preston said. \"When Covid hit, every hospital that was looking at partnering with us retreated to solve their own issues.\" JUST WATCHEDFunerals turn small town into coronavirus hotspotReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFunerals turn small town into coronavirus hotspot 03:12Beckett and Preston still hope to team with a business partner to reopen the hospital. State officials announced that the clinic had acquired the hospital's assets on April 1. But Beckett fears finding such a partner may now be harder. In the meantime, the clinic is jumping through numerous state and federal regulatory hurdles -- which Beckett said could take months -- to lay the groundwork in case a deal is struck. Doctors at the hospital are used to treating patients who overdose on drugs, victims of grisly car crashes on the region's winding mountain roads, and coal miners injured on the job. During their last days at work, the skeleton staff that remains at the hospital has tackled coronavirus, testing 35 people and treating two patients who came back positive. More than 40 employees lived at their plant for 28 days to make material to protect health care workers\"I'm always amazed at our population,\" said Beckett, who grew up in Williamson. \"We've had people that are coal mining families who have been through hard times, and they get through those by relying on each other.\"Despite its imminent shuttering, the importance of the hospital was highlighted last month when the National Guard inspected the facility as a possible overflow location to help with Covid-19 testing and treatment. The looming closure is devastating news for patients like Steele, who knows that she and her husband are at elevated risk from the coronavirus. Now, if they do get sick, they're going to have to drive across the state line to Kentucky or go to other hospitals that are at least 30 minutes away.\"We care about the people (at the hospital) and they care about us,\" Steele said, her voice breaking a little. \"We will do what we have to do, but we won't enjoy it.\" Hospital workers furloughed: 'This is uncharted water'Usually, Dr. John Tedesco would be performing surgeries. But with most operations put on hold during the pandemic, the cosmetic surgeon, who treats a lot of skin cancer, has hardly seen the inside of his operating room in McAlester, Oklahoma, for weeks.\"We've put those folks off for now, postponed them,\" Tedesco said of his skin cancer surgeries. \"It doesn't stop the cancer from growing. And it doesn't stop anxiety from building that you're left untreated.\"JUST WATCHEDMom died without access to hospital.

Her son vows 'never again' 03:10With surgeries on hold, Tedesco is seeing patients via telemedicine and doing administrative planning as the chief of staff at McAlester Regional Health Center to prepare the hospital for a return to some surgeries next week. And, hospital officials say, 352 employees in the hospital had their hours cut, while everyone else is facing a pay cut. That's the new normal in rural Oklahoma: Even health care employees who seem like they'd be the very definition of essential are seeing their work cut as hospitals struggle to stay solvent.  The staff has never faced anything quite like the pandemic, said David Keith, the hospital's CEO, adding that more than a dozen surrounding counties depend on them. \"Within an hour's drive, there's no one else,\" Keith said. \nOne reason why: Oklahoma, which has the nation's second-highest uninsured rate, is a hotspot for rural hospital closings, with seven shutting down since 2016. The state government's refusal so far to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has likely made an impact -- multiple studies have found that states that didn't expand the program have seen more hospital closures.Oklahoma voters will decide in June on a ballot measure to expand Medicaid, while Gov. Kevin Stitt has proposed his own more limited plan for expansion.Meanwhile, the pandemic has made it even harder for already financially vulnerable rural hospitals to survive. Seventy miles east at Eastern Oklahoma Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital in the small city of Poteau, CEO Bob Carter has spent the last few weeks shutting down two sections of his facility that brought in money -- obstetrics and surgical departments. How two funerals helped turn one small Georgia city into a hotspot for coronavirus The hospital has furloughed 52 employees, while Carter, his administrative team, physicians and mid-level nurse practitioners agreed to take significant pay cuts. \"I think that speaks volume about life in a small community, in a small hospital,\" he said. \"It's about taking care of each other.\"Stitt, one of the few US governors who hasn't issued a sweeping statewide stay-at-home order, announced this month that his administration would allow elective surgeries to resume starting April 24, which some hospital leaders say will be a big help. Still, while Carter said he is confident eastern Oklahoma will come out of this, fears about the hospital's future -- and what it would mean for the community if it closed -- have kept him awake at night.\"This is uncharted water for every one of us,\" Carter said. Federal lifelines only go so farNurses at Scotland County Hospital in Memphis, Missouri, are ready to treat patients with coronavirus. Four patients have tested positive and are at home recovering.The federal government threw struggling hospitals a lifeline last month -- but rural hospital leaders say more help is desperately needed.The relief package passed by Congress, known as the CARES Act, includes a $100 billion fund for hospitals and other health care providers to make up for coronavirus-related expenses or lost revenue. For some hospitals, the relief won't go very far. Eastern Oklahoma hospital received a $502,000 grant from the act -- which will last just two weeks, Carter said. The hospital received $1.75 million in advances on its Medicare payments, but Carter said he was worried to use it because the hospital had to begin repaying that money in 120 days. This is where all 50 states stand on reopeningDr. Randy Tobler is an OB-GYN and CEO of Scotland County Hospital in the northern Missouri town of Memphis. It applied for and received advanced funding from Medicare which will help the struggling hospital cover expenses through at least May, though the funding must be repaid. In March, the hospital eliminated jobs and furloughed staff. All the clinicians took a pay cut, Tobler said.\"It makes me cry -- so many people have banded together,\" he said. \"It's like an Army platoon charging up the hill.\"An emergency room worker at Memphis, Missouri's Scotland County Hospital prepares to triage incoming patients.The hospital has treated coronavirus patients like Danielle and Jake Bair, who tested positive after coming down with fevers and coughs late last month. They say their symptoms have since improved. Being able to talk to a doctor who was intimately familiar with her own history as a cancer survivor was a huge help during the ordeal, said Danielle. Without Scotland, she'd have to drive an hour or two to get to the nearest hospital. \"When I've had to go to the doctor in other [places,] I have to re-explain my case,\" Danielle said. \"But when I go to my local emergency room here, they already know me. Not only does my doctor know me, but he has talked with his colleagues about my case. I know that I'm immediately getting the right care.\"Shuttered hospitals leave holes in careAs more rural hospitals face the possibility of shutting down, communities trying to understand what that would mean can look to Marks, Mississippi, a town in the state's northwest, which lost its only hospital three and a half years ago. Quitman County Hospital served patients in what has long been one of the US's poorest counties -- Martin Luther King Jr. preached about children in Marks \"walking the streets with no shoes to wear\" during his last Sunday sermon before his assassination. Many of those who came to the hospital's emergency room had no insurance, and it couldn't stay in business, local officials said.Known locally as \"the Q,\" the single-floor hospital with about two dozen beds was a community institution and the county's largest employer, said Lonnie Moore, a nurse practitioner who worked at the hospital. When it closed in September 2016, \"it broke peoples' hearts,\" he said. This 16-year-old student pilot is flying medical supplies to rural hospitals during the pandemicNow the county only has a part-time clinic operating across the street from the vacant hospital, with three doctors and several nurse practitioners splitting their work between three neighboring counties, said Moore, who works at the clinic. The nearest hospital still open is about a 20-minute drive from Marks. Paul Hester, who's worked for the county ambulance service since 1972, said one person from Quitman County has died in an ambulance while on the way to a neighboring county since 2016 -- and there have been other close calls. \"Twenty minutes, compared to five minutes, makes a big difference,\" Hester said. Having a 24-hour emergency room in the county would \"help tremendously,\" he said.Amid coronavirus, tribes say they aren't getting help they need from federal governmentQuitman County only has 13 confirmed coronavirus cases so far -- but that puts it in the top 11% of counties in the US by number of cases per capita, according to a CNN analysis of case data from Johns Hopkins University. While the local clinic is providing some testing and treatment to people who test positive, patients who need to be hospitalized are being sent to neighboring counties. \"It's very, very scary and nerve-wracking to be facing this without a hospital,\" said Velma Wilson, the county administrator. \"The numbers are going up, so if we do become a hotspot, managing Covid-19 would be a major concern for this area.\"Heartland hotspots: A sudden rise in coronavirus cases is hitting rural states without stay-at-home orders Mary Williams, a nurse practitioner who started her career at the now-shuttered Quitman hospital, has two family members in the county who tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be driven long distances to get urgent care. One of her relatives had to be transferred to a hospital more than an hour away to be put on a ventilator for more than a week, Williams said. Another of her relatives spent time at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, before being released.If the Quitman hospital was still in business, Williams said she thought both of her family members would be in better situations. \"If the hospital's just down the street, you're going to go there if you're feeling bad,\" Williams said. \"If you know the hospital is miles away, you're going to wait until you can't take it anymore.\"",

Her total collection reached about 13 before the hospitals caught on and shut her down. She asked the state health department for help getting the tests needed to determine whether deaths were linked to the virus. But she said the agency told her it was not providing them to coroners because it was prioritizing the tests for the living. She hasn't been able to get the supplies she needs from private labs either.  \"If you die in my county, I will not know if you died of Covid-19,\" Romann said. \"I will, however, be able to tell if you legally smoked pot.\"Other death investigators are equally frustrated and worried about coronavirus deaths being missed. A coroner in Wyoming, the only state that still hasn't reported any deaths due to the virus, said he seriously doubts its official death count, and told CNN he hasn't been able to test a number of suspected cases. And an Ohio coroner said she believes at least four deaths in her county have already been left uncounted. Read MoreInside the Douglas County, Colorado, morgueAs the country battles a rapidly growing number of coronavirus infections, 13 coroners and medical examiners in nine states told CNN that they are struggling to acquire the supplies needed to test bodies arriving at their facilities for the disease. With concerns growing about the coronavirus death toll being incomplete because of lack of testing for the living, coroners and medical examiners said being unable to test the dead compounds the issue. They said they are worried that deaths are being significantly undercounted and that as a result, the statistics used by the federal and state governments to chart the virus's spread and severity are far from reliable. Contacts of the deceased may not get the warnings they need to help keep the disease from spreading; families may be left not knowing what killed their loved ones.Government employees: What public records should we request as we report on the coronavirus?The CDC's total death count stood at around 9,000 on Monday. When pressed on what deaths it is tracking, the agency told CNN that it is looking at both laboratory-confirmed cases and those without laboratory confirmation. (CNN generally relies on Johns Hopkins University's separate count of coronavirus deaths, which is updated more frequently.)\"The simplest answer is that CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reports the deaths that have Covid-19 listed on the death certificate\" as a contributor to death, a CDC spokesperson said. CDC guidance states that testing should be conducted whenever possible, but that when a definite diagnosis can't be made, it is \"acceptable to report Covid-19 on a death certificate as 'probable' or 'presumed'\" if \"the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty.\"But not every state, and not every coroner and medical examiner, is operating under the same policy when it comes to classifying and reporting deaths potentially linked to the disease. Jill Romann has been scrambling to get Covid-19 test kits, which include tubes used to transport specimens.States vary on how they are currently reporting deaths to the federal government. Some state departments of health told CNN they are reporting only cases confirmed by a positive test, for example, while another said it is also reporting certain unconfirmed cases in which symptoms pointed to coronavirus.But it is ultimately the medical examiners and coroners who decide what ends up on death certificates under their jurisdiction, and some, like Romann, told CNN they don't feel comfortable guessing at the cause of death without a test. \"It is very concerning that this data set will not be included in the overall numbers,\" said Romann, who said she will soon run out of testing swabs. \"We want real facts of this disease.\"'Your fatality rate is not a true fatality rate'Depending on the state, coroners and medical examiners oversee various kinds of deaths where coronavirus is suspected. Some oversee deaths deemed to be unusual or those that have occurred outside of a medical setting -- typically at home. Others said that under current circumstances, they are now certifying all deaths potentially caused by coronavirus, including ones in hospitals. Their official role is to find the cause of death, though their findings can also be important for tracking and heading off the disease.Bodies can be tested for coronavirus after death. But to do so requires access to the same scarce test supplies that are so desperately needed for people who are alive. The CDC has issued official guidance on the use of testing after death, saying coroners and medical examiners \"should use their judgment to determine if a decedent had signs and symptoms compatible with Covid-19 during life and whether postmortem testing should be pursued.\"Send us your stories about coronavirus testingFor some coroners and medical examiners, getting test kits hasn't been an issue, either because there are sufficient tests in their area or because the disease isn't as prevalent there yet. But others, like Romann, have been turned down when they requested tests from public health departments and have been left scrounging for supplies and processing time at backed-up private labs.\"Testing has been so restricted and test kits so unavailable, I do not think we truly know the scope of infection or virus-related deaths here,\" said Dr. Christina VandePol, the coroner in Chester County, Pennsylvania. In several states, including Colorado, Arkansas, and Wyoming, health officials told CNN that coroners who lack tests can use other methods to try to zero in on deaths caused by the virus. Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment said that officials certifying deaths do not need test results to attribute Covid-19 as a cause or contributor to death and can list Covid-19 as a suspected cause on death certificates. \"Counting a death as Covid-19-related relies on physicians' and coroners' best medical judgment, not necessarily test results, and we believe their medical judgment is pretty sound,\" a vital statistics program manager said in a statement. \"Because we are not relying on test results alone to identify Covid-19 deaths, we do not expect significant undercounting of these deaths.\" However, a spokesperson told CNN that in addition to confirmed deaths, the agency's current policy is to report to the CDC only untested deaths where the person had symptoms and a known contact with a confirmed case. Romann said she disagrees with the approach of assuming that someone has died of Covid-19 without testing. Jill Romann, the coroner in Douglas County, Colorado.\"Accurate data can save lives,\" she said. \"We are better than casual reporters, we are professionals whose charge is to report with purpose.\"In Ohio, meanwhile, Franklin County Coroner Dr. Anahi Ortiz believes her office has already seen at least four coronavirus deaths that were not counted. Though she couldn't release personally identifying information, she said two were in their 40s, and two were in their 50s. One woman had been homeless and staying with a friend when she died. Another man had recently traveled to Florida, and his employer called the police when they didn't hear from him. All four had fevers and other common coronavirus symptoms, said Ortiz, and they were all found dead at home. \n\n\n\nWhat should we investigate next?\n\nEmail Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\nBut none of them were tested. With only eight precious tests left, she said, she decided to save them for infant deaths, to test for Covid-19 and other viruses.Ortiz said she has struggled to find both supplies and a facility to process the tests, saying that the city and state health departments told her that coroner cases are not being tested because they are not currently a priority. When she was interviewed by a local ABC affiliate last month, there had been one untested death. But now the situation is getting worse, as the number of bodies needing testing increases. The Ohio Department of Health did not respond to a request for comment. Columbus Public Health said testing is limited and that the state prioritizes people who are hospitalized, healthcare workers and first responders, adding that coroners can use private labs instead. \"They're not going to be counted,\" said Ortiz, who said her office only reports positive cases to the state. \"Your fatality rate is not a true fatality rate.\"  With few tests, states make their own policiesWyoming, which had no recorded deaths from coronavirus as of Monday, may be seeing a similar undercount, according to Fremont County Coroner Mark Stratmoen. Stratmoen, president of the Wyoming Coroners Association, said that with doctors struggling to test even living patients in the state, there are minimal testing resources for the deceased. He's having to stick to his typical investigation, he said, based on the scene, medical history, symptoms and other circumstances. As a result, he is having his staff treat all deaths as possible coronavirus patients and use protective gear he said he ordered in February in preparation for the pandemic. \"We will ever know the true impact on fatalities from Covid,\" said Mark Stratmoen, the coroner in Fremont County, Wyoming.  He described several deaths in his county of around 40,000 people in which the decedents had suffered from pre-existing conditions, and where he suspects that coronavirus may have been -- at the minimum -- the \"tipping point\" in their deaths.  But \"without testing,\" he said, \"you have to go with what you know, not what you suspect.\" He told CNN he is worried that compared to other states, Wyoming is just at the start of its curve, and said he doubts \"we will ever know the true impact on fatalities from Covid, both for the living and the dead.\" A spokesperson for Wyoming's health department said it encourages postmortem testing, but realizes that the state's lack of testing supplies means that not everyone, both living or dead, will get tested. The spokesperson said it has told coroners to classify both confirmed and potential Covid-19 deaths on death certificates for tracking at the state level, though it is only immediately reporting confirmed Covid-19 deaths to the CDC. He added that death certificate data, including those with suspected Covid-19 deaths, would eventually make it to the CDC \"in the standard manner they receive all death certificate data.\" This suggests that in the case of Wyoming and in any other states following similar procedures, two different death numbers would eventually be reported to the CDC.As of Monday, Wyoming hadn't reported any deaths linked to Covid-19. Coroners in Arkansas, which had 16 documented Covid-19 deaths as of Monday, had similar concerns. \"We are having a very tough time getting the supplies we need to complete the testing,\" said Benton County, Arkansas Coroner Daniel Oxford. Oxford said that for two weeks he unsuccessfully wrote and called the state department of health to ask for test kits. After CNN reached out to the state last week, he said on Monday that he had received a few. Another Arkansas coroner, this one in Clark County, expressed his exasperation not to be able to test for the virus. \"Bodies are NOT TESTED for Covid 19!!\" he wrote in an email to CNN. \"Period!\"Like Colorado, Arkansas authorities said that coroners have the last say in the cause of death, and that even suspected but untested Covid-19 deaths would be counted by the state as long as the coroner certified the cause of death as Covid-19. The state health department said it is not reporting those suspected but untested deaths to the CDC. It also said that it has not turned down any requests for the processing of tests, but that the actual supplies needed to swab and transport the specimens are limited, creating a difficult situation for coroners. Some states, however, are not counting suspected deaths. Missouri, for example, said it is only logging Covid-19 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus. Those who did not receive a test but who may have died from the disease are not being recorded, according to a spokesperson.Pennsylvania's Department of Health said the state is also only counting deaths in which tests came back positive. It acknowledged that postmortem testing is an area of concern and could be leading to undercounting.\"We want them to use their judgement as needed. We are working to get them tests,\" said a Pennsylvania Department of Health spokesperson. \"This is a nationwide issue. We know that the data coming out is only as good as the data coming in...we may not have the most accurate count as to how many deaths there are.\"Rationing tests as cases riseCNN reached out to a sampling of coroners and medical examiners in more than a dozen states. Not all responded, and some of those who did have been able to test the bodies they have received so far, while others hadn't yet had any deaths where testing would be indicated. Many said the concern is what happens as the number of deaths rises. \"Orlando hasn't been hit as hard as New York; if that comes down here we will definitely run out of kits, \" said Dr. Joshua Stephany, the Chief Medical Examiner of Orange and Osceola counties in Florida. \"Right now we're okay...but it would only take one or two bad days for that to change.\"  Currently, he said, his office reserves tests for people who suffered more serious Covid-19 symptoms, like high fevers, since he believes his role is to focus on cases where it's clearly a possible cause of death. \"It's the difference of someone dying because of it versus someone dying with it,\" he said. As coronavirus cases grow, hospitals adopt a system to rank patients for treatmentTest processing is typically conducted by local or state health departments or by labs. But the access to test kits often depends on where coroners and medical examiners are located and the connections they have. A CDC spokesperson said that the agency is working with local and state health departments to ensure coroners and medical examiners have access to tests and that the FDA has authorized several commercial labs to conduct testing. \"The situation is constantly evolving, and the availability of testing is a top priority for CDC and our state health department counterparts,\" the spokesperson added. Coroners and medical examiners said that getting tests processed by health departments would typically be free. But since that isn't always an option and supplies are so scarce, some have had better luck paying private labs to send them test kits and process tests. Several said they haven't had any luck with the labs either. Some said they've been placed on waiting lists for supplies. Others said their phone calls haven't been returned.That means they have to get creative. In one case, a coroner said he was prepared to use the testing supplies he had secured for his own private practice as a physician. Another said she has changed her testing procedures to conserve swabs -- she is now using fewer swabs per body than the CDC recommends. Others accept that they can't test at all. The stakes of the unknownThere are many reasons it's a problem if coroners and medical examiners are unable to test people they believe died of coronavirus, says Gary Watts, the president of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners. It skews the overall tally of coronavirus deaths, which some coroners say is already going to be an undercount because a certain number of deaths are always going to be missed. One medical examiner's office, for example, said it actually had tests available, but some of the bodies of patients who reported symptoms have been so decomposed that a specimen could not be obtained. And as a BuzzFeed investigation revealed, doctors and nurses have also reported some deaths not being counted within hospitals. Perhaps more important, Watts and others said, not being able to test the deceased leaves their contacts vulnerable.\"Those that die outside of the hospital, if we don't get them tested, not only do we not get the information in terms of correct data, but we're not getting the information that's lifesaving to those who were potentially exposed,\" said Watts, who is also the Richland County, South Carolina, coroner. \"And families always want to know what happened to their loved ones.\"How did coronavirus break out? Theories abound as researchers race to solve genetic detective storyCoroners and medical examiners also worry that their employees are at risk. Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, said that the risk of transmission after death is reduced because it can no longer be spread by coughing or breathing, but it is still important for officials to use proper protective equipment.Those in the field are facing a shortage of protective supplies like masks and gowns, as is the rest of the health care industry. In some areas, coroners and medical examiners say, they show up to homes without any idea if the person they're examining was suspected to have had coronavirus -- opening up their staff to possible exposure from family members or surfaces in the house.Chester County's VandePol said that when she asks an investigator to respond to a death, she feels like she is \"sending them off to battle with no weapons.\" \"The last responders are a group that no one thinks about,\" said Franklin County's Ortiz. \"But we are essential and we continue working throughout the crisis.\" Is there something about Covid-19 you think we should investigate?

        "content": "(CNN)The parents of a 19-year-old Pennsylvania man who was suffering a mental crisis when he was shot and killed by police while holding a gun are calling for an independent investigation into the events that led to his death.Christian Hall was in the middle of a mental health emergency when Pennsylvania State Police fatally shot him on December 30, 2020, after a nearly two-hour standoff captured on video, authorities say.Troopers responded to \"a report of a distraught and suicidal male\" standing on a bridge in Hamilton Township in Monroe County. Once on site they immediately found Hall standing on the ledge of a concrete barrier overlooking the highway and later determined he had what appeared to be a firearm, according to a police statement and investigative report of the incident produced by the Monroe District Attorney's Office. Following Hall's death, law enforcement determined he was carrying a pellet gun which was manufactured to look like a semi-automatic pistol. Read MoreChristian Hall beside his mother Fe.Hall initially complied with police orders to place his weapon on the ground, according to police, but as troopers continued to negotiate with him, he \"became uncooperative and retrieved the firearm and began walking towards the Troopers. At which time, Hall pointed the firearm in the Troopers direction.\"\"As a result, Troopers fired striking Hall,\" police said in their statement, adding he was taken into custody and provided with medical attention on the scene before being transported to a local medical center where was pronounced dead.Christian's parents -- Gareth and Fe Hall -- maintain their son never pointed a weapon at police, and that he was actually surrendering to the troopers when he was killed, attorney Devon M. Jacob told CNN on Thursday afternoon. Jacob and civil rights attorney Ben Crump are representing the Hall family. The December statement by state police -- which said troopers were justified in their shooting -- was \"misleading\" and \"false,\" Jacob said, and he believes the unedited video later released by a subpoena issued to the Pennsylvania State Police supports that. What the video showsJacob subpoenaed unedited video of the altercation from state police in April and the new footage -- which he received in July -- illustrates the PA State police \"weren't equipped or trained on how to end the incident in a safe way,\" he said.  \"Pennsylvania State Police shot and killed an individual who was clearly surrendering which is an unlawful homicide,\" Jacob added.  The Monroe County DA's office hasn't responded to CNN's questions, including why the Hall family wasn't shown the original, unblurred video of the final moments of their son's life prior to their public determination the officer's actions were justified, and its response to Jacob's assertion the DA's office hasn't referred the case to the state's attorney general for independent review. For its part, the attorney general's office says it \"does not have jurisdiction to investigate this matter unless a referral is sent by a District Attorney for either a conflict or resource need, which did not happen in this case.\"The PA State Police haven't responded to CNN's request for comment. According to CNN's review of the unedited video -- provided to CNN by Jacob -- Hall is not seen pointing his weapon at police, as state police indicated in their December 2020 statement, before troopers fire upon him. He does, as police and the DA's office describe, ignore dozens of police orders to drop his weapon.Following what appears to be warning shots fired by one of the officers on the scene, \"Hall then raises the gun outward toward his side and then upwards by bending his elbow at a ninety-degree angle,\" the DA's office said. \"After ignoring further commands to drop the gun, both Corporal #1 and Trooper #1 fire a total of approximately eight shots striking Hall who falls to the roadway,\" the DA's report describes. The edited version released by the DA's office in March blurs the moment of Hall's death, but his physical gestures and actions are accurately reflected in their report, according to CNN's review. The Halls have filed a complaint with the PA Attorney General, the FBI and the Department of Justice, Jacob told CNN. As of late Thursday evening, CNN had not heard back from the federal offices.",
