With more than 99% of the vote counted, no single party gained an outright majority but the three separatist parties together took 70 seats. They needed 68 to keep their grip on the 135-seat Parliament. To govern the pro-independence parties will need to join in a coalition. Such a scenario would push the Madrid-Barcelona relationship back to where this all began three months ago, with a provocative separatist government in Barcelona rattling Madrid. The anti-independence Ciutadans (Citizens) did win the most seats of any party, but not enough to form a majority government.Junts per Catalunya candidates celebrate during a press conference following the Catalan regional election. 'The Catalan republic has won'Puigdemont's party -- Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) -- won 34 seats in Thursday's vote. He said Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had \"received a hit, a blow by the Catalans.\"\"They lost their coup d'etat,\" he said. Marta Rovira, from the other main separatist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia) party, also declared victory after her party won 32 seats. She shouted \"Freedom\" in concert with party supporters after the results emerged.Prime Minister Rajoy's People's Party (Partido Popular) lost most of its seats in the Thursday election, dropping from 11 to three.The result was also a clear rejection of Madrid's response to the turbulence. The Spanish government sent in thousands of police to shut down the October 1 referendum, and officers were seen pulling elderly voters by the hair from polling stations and firing rubber bullets at relatively clam protesters.Madrid seized control of the region after dismissing the entire Catalan government and Parliament.Oriol Junqueras, leader of the pro-independence Esquerra Republicana de Cataluyna party, is in a Madrid prison over the separatist push. Rise of the center-right Citizens partyDespite the clear support for the pro-independence side, it was actually the anti-independence Ciutadans (Citizens) party that came away with the most seats, winning 37 -- a sweeping gain compared to the 25 the party won in the last vote, and a sign of just how divisive the independence issue has been. The party benefited from a record turnout of 82%.Ciutadans (Citizens) candidate In\u00e9s Arrimadas casts her vote in Barcelona.The party candidate, In\u00e9s Arrimadas, was likely hoping to win and form a coalition of other anti-independence parties, but the numbers do not stack up in her favor.Nonetheless, she gave a victory speech of her own.\"We are all Catalonia and the first political force in the Catalan parliament is called Ciutadans,\" she said. \"The 10 most-populated cities in Catalonia are right now orange, so thank you to all the people who have made that possible,\" she said, referring to the party's color.Political negotiations to comeThe results, however, do not necessarily mean easy sailing for the independence movement. There will probably be intense negotiations, particularly over the issue of who would become Catalonia's next president. The question is further complicated by the fact that Puigdemont is in self-imposed exile in Brussels. He said last week that he would come back if he won, but he could still face arrest by Spanish authorities over the illegal referendum if he does. A man leaves a voting booth after casting a ballot on Thursday in Tarragona.  The other separatist leader -- Oriol Junqueras of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya -- is detained in a Madrid prison over the referendum, on charges of sedition and rebellion. Both leaders face 30-year jail terms.The two parties told CNN last week that they would join in a coalition in this scenario, but the movement has shown signs of fracture and is not as united as it was in the 2015 vote.The two parties will also have to please the marginal Candidatura d'Unitat Popular (Popular Unity Candidacy), as they would not pass the 68-seat threshold without it. The party was kingmaker in 2015 as well, propelling Puigdemont to the presidency in an 11th-hour deal.",

        "content": "Story highlightsReal host Barcelona on 23 December Barca are 11 points ahead of Real in La LigaBarca have won five of last 10 matches  (CNN)It is a rivalry like no other, a match which permeates beyond the white lines of the football pitch. It's a complex cocktail of sport and politics. It's the biggest game on earth. On Saturday, millions will watch arch enemies Real Madrid and Barcelona -- two of the most successful clubs in history, boasting two of the world's greatest players -- battle it out in the 236th edition of the game dubbed El Clasico. Trailing their great rivals by 11 points in the league, Real -- who last week won the Club World Cup -- cannot afford to slip up at home if they are to retain hopes of winning the Spanish league title. Adding spice to the mix is the form of Lionel Messi, the all-time leading scorer in El Clasico history, who has notched 14 goals in 16 La Liga matches this season, overshadowing his long-time foe Cristiano Ronaldo, scorer of four league goals in 11 and recent recipient of a fifth Ballon d'Or. Follow @cnnsport\n\n     But, as everybody knows, El Clasico is about more than goals, galacticos and 88 years of epic footballing rivalry. Read MoreREAD: The match that changed football READ: Catalonia's Parliament declares unilateral independenceFC Barcelona became a symbol of Catalan identity during the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco which ruled between 1939 and 1975, giving rise to the club's motto \"Mes que un club\" (More than a club). Real, meanwhile, were the club of the capital and widely regarded as representing the Spanish establishment.Catalonia's dramatic bid for independence in October -- on Thursday Catalan pro-independence parties held their absolute majority in snap regional elections  -- increases already heightened tensions ahead of Saturday's match.But how will this potent concoction of politics, sport and history impact those closest to the action? Here are the stories of those whose pulses quicken most for the spectacle one observer described to CNN as a \"cattle prod to the senses.\" Who do you think will win Saturday's El Clasico? Have your say on our Facebook page.The Player - 'Losing to Barca feels like falling into the bottom of a well'Former Brazil international Savio played for Real Madrid from 1998 to 2003, making 105 appearance and scoring 16 goals. I've played in a number of big matches in Brazil, in France, and other derbies in Spain -- Zaragoza versus Osasuna in Spain's Aragon region, Flamengo versus Vasco da Gama in Rio -- but none of these can compare to Real versus Barcelona. Everything about this rivalry is different, it's the biggest derby in the world because of the quality of players on display, the greatness of both clubs, the history and, most importantly, the political rivalry -- Catalonia with the independence issue and Madrid being Spain's capital.Savio playing in El Clasico in 1999During the week before the match there's huge expectation. You know that it's a match which will be watched everywhere in the world. As a player who came from Brazil, little by little I started to learn what El Clasico actually means to people.Before joining Real I'd follow the game in Brazil, but when you're living it up close, you learn more about the league, the rivalry, the culture, and I really got to understand what El Clasico was about. We didn't need the Spanish players to explain to us what the match meant, we could see for ourselves. Former Real captain Raul is fourth on the list of all-time leading El Clasico scorers (15)My favorite El Clasico was one whih ended 2-2 in the Camp Nou in 1999.It was very dramatic match. We had gone 1-0 up through Raul, but Barca had hit back and were leading 2-1 until Raul equalized in the 89th minute and did the  \"shushing\" gesture to the Camp Nou crowd, putting his fingers to his lips, which everyone remembers. I assisted two of the goals and ... I cherish this game a lot. When you're in the stadium, be it Camp Nou or Santiago Bernabeu, there's huge pressure. The atmosphere is one of celebration, but there's also tension and the dressing room after an El Clasico can either be one of extreme happiness or sadness. If you win, everything is wonderful, that's why it's such a special game. But when you've lost against Barcelona it feels like you've lost a big title or a trophy. Aside from losing against a rival, you have to face all the criticism -- from the fans to the media -- it feels like you've fallen to the bottom of a well.           The Barca fan - 'I just want to win -- even if it means Messi scoring with his hand'Catalan Pau Riera, 29, is a lifelong Barcelona fan who now lives in London. I live El Clasicos as if they were finals, regardless of the position Barcelona is in the table. It doesn't really matter how your team is performing during the season. This match stands alone and I just want Barca to beat Real, even if it's with an offside goal in the 94th minute, or Messi scoring with his hand. For some people, El Clasico goes beyond football and they see it as the relationship between Spain and Catalonia. However, I prefer to keep it as it is -- a sports event.

When Jose Mourinho was in charge of Real, from 2010 to 2013, it got to a point that both teams were hating each other badly and there was too much tension around it. For me, the worst moment though was when Luis Figo switched teams in 2000. I was a kid when that happened and he was by far my favorite Barca player. It hurt me so much that I hated him and Madrid for years and years.Barca players burn a picture of Luis Figo after he controversially moved to Real for a then world-record fee in 2000During the match, streets are empty as everyone is at the bar. Clasicos are probably the most social football matches because even if they broadcast the match on TV you prefer to gather with your friends and watch it at the local bar.Family-wise my parents and sister don't especially follow football, but they usually do for El Clasico. My Dad enjoys a Real defeat more than a Barca win! Before and during the match, I'm definitely more nervous than I'm an for any other match. I suffer every time Madrid has the possession of the ball. I've always said that the day Barcelona and Madrid play the final of the Champions League I will probably not be able to watch -- it'd be too much for me. When Barca lose to Real, I'm usually in a bad mood until I manage to stop thinking about it. I can't read any sports news for the next couple of days. But beating Real is a great feeling of euphoria and satisfaction. When Barca beat Real 6-2 at the Bernabeu in 2009, the score was so unexpected it meant the celebrations were more explosive too.Every time Barcelona scored my friends and I were jumping, shouting and hugging random people that were also celebrating. People were on the tables, glasses were crashing ... it was a proper mad celebration.I'll probably be watching Saturday's match at a pub with a couple of friends from Barcelona. Clasicos in London are always a lottery because you never know if you'll be surrounded by Madrid supporters. It's fun to see their faces if you win -- but if they beat us you just want to disappear.The Journalist - 'It's a brilliant test of your ability'Graham Hunter is a Spanish-based football journalist and author of 'Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World'.When I began my career, in the late 1980s, early 1990s, worldwide there were fewer people who considered themselves as fans of Real Madrid or Barcelona. It was not an unknown phenomenon, but both clubs have since strategically ballooned their audience and fan base around the world and now there is outright vehement adoration and love for either Real or Barca from people who have never been to Spain and will never go to an El Clasico. JUST WATCHEDEl Clasico: '100,000 people whistling'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEl Clasico: '100,000 people whistling' 01:37I don't believe it's using adjectives for the sake of it, El Clasico is like theater, it's like opera, the grand themes are all there. Year in, year out, almost without exception, certainly with a higher strike rate than any other game in the world -- even the Champions League final -- El Clasico delivers. The last time there was a goalless draw was in 2002. It gives you quality football, dramatic football, it gives you that certain thing that pulsates from the football pitch to the audience in the ground and through a television set. It remorselessly delivers and I think that's a key factor in El Clasico's appeal. If we're absolutely truthful about AC Milan versus Inter Milan in Italy, or Germany's Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund, or the big English games, you can see exceptional contests, but not as often as El Clasico. Reporting on the match is just thrilling. It's a brilliant test of our ability, your learning and your communication powers. The challenge for each and every one of us is to be at our best. If your stomach is not full of butterflies, if you're not genuinely outright nervous -- did I predict it properly, have I analyzed it properly -- then you shouldn't be in the industry. El Clasico is like a cattle prod to the senses. Barcelona fans cheer their team during the Copa del Rey against Real Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features On Saturday, I think Real will probably reignite the league and will show that when they're on form, currently, they're a better side than Barca. A Barca win doesn't make them league champions, but a Barca win means Real won't win the title. I have a sneaky suspicion that Real will win this, and I've a sneaky suspicion that Real are legitimate candidates to become champions again. As far as the impact of Catalan independence vote on this match, irrespective of where you stand in the debate, not one of Barcelona's players has come out and demanded independence.But, when it comes to going to the capital against savvy Real Madrid support, it will be used to heighten the booing, whistling and the tension, to see whether that will put the Barca players off their stride.The Real fan -- 'If we lose Christmas is going to be bad'Colombian born Majin A. Hemer Sierra, 33, is president of the 124-member strong official Real Madrid fan club in Atlanta. Sometimes Americans talk to me, people who don't watch soccer, and think it's just a game, and I try to explain to them that it's not only 22 guys kicking a ball.We're talking about two different ways of seeing things for everything: how to play football, politics, the way you think. Our way of seeing things, as Real Madrid fans, is different to Barcelona fans. We are used to being the best and we say that being a Real Madrid supporter means you're already a winner in anything! I've been receiving text from friends about the match since Monday and every day the intensity gets higher.Real Madrid have won eight trophies under Zinedine ZidaneThe match is 7am Atlanta time, and our regular Irish pub usually opens at 11am, but it will open early on Saturday. The owners have been gracious enough to say they'll have the doors open and the TV on in enough time before kickoff.Personally, I'm OK in the week leading up to an El Clascio but from an hour prior to kick-off that's when I start to get nervous.I'm Catholic so I'll just do the cross and pray. People have their own rituals. I have a member who wears the same Real Madrid jersey for El Clasicos, he'll only wear that jersey for El Clasico. Many of our members have things they do before an El Clasico.Nobody wants to lose an El Clasico. If we lose, I know for sure that my Christmas and the rest of next week is going to be horrible. Even though we're in America we see ourselves as part of Real Madrid and the club makes us feel that way. In football, you feel the same whether you're inside the stadium or not. The passion here is the same as in Madrid - if not more so because most of the people in the stadium are already used to seeing Real every weekend and have seen many Clasicos but, for us, it's something different.

They will be sentenced in coming weeks.Napout, from Paraguay is the former president of CONMEBOL, which presides over soccer in South America.

        "content": "Story highlightsPro-independence parties won 70 seats in the election, enough to form a coalition governmentCiudadanos (Citizens) that is anti independence, became the largest party in Parliament with 37 seats  (CNN)The day after elections in Catalonia deepened the split between its separatist parties and the Spanish government, both sides are in a defiant mood.The elections gave the three pro-independence parties a slight majority in the regional Parliament, underscoring the resilience of their vote after three months of upheaval. After a record turnout of over 80%, they won 70 of the 135 seats, compared with 72 in the 2015 elections.Separatist parties in Spain's Catalonia win majority in electionBut again they won a fraction less than half of the total votes cast (nearly 48%), slightly less than they did in 2015. The party of former Catalan President Carlos Puigdemont won 34 seats -- even though he has been in self-imposed exile in Belgium since October. Puigdemont described the vote as a slap in the face for Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy.\"We have won this election in exceptional circumstances, with candidates in prison, with the government in exile and without having the same resources as the state,\" Puigdemont said in Brussels.Read MoreAnd he issued a challenge to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy: a meeting without preconditions somewhere in Europe to resolve the crisis.Center-right party Ciudadanos (Citizens) candidate In\u00e9s  Arrimadas (R) celebrates the poll results in the Catalan regional election. The party is known locally as CiutadansRajoy wasn't taking the bait. In remarks in Madrid Friday, he said the vote showed that Catalonia was deeply divided. And he pointed out that a pro-union party, Ciudadanos (Citizens), known in Catalonia as Ciutadans, had outpolled every other party. It became the largest in the Catalan parliament, with 37 seats.The trouble for Rajoy is that his own Popular Party was hammered -- losing eight of its 11 seats in the Parliament. His goal of lancing the boil of the Catalan separatist movement through these elections has backfired. Party spokesman Rafael Hernando said only that the government and Senate in Madrid remained the most solid guarantee against the forces of independence. Related:  Spain's Rajoy rejects ex-Catalan leader's call to meetThe result suggests further uncertainty in a region that accounts for a quarter of Spain's gross domestic product, and possibly months of haggling over the formation of a regional government, with seven parties represented in the Parliament. The pro-independence parties are not exactly a coherent bloc, and if they fail to form a government by April next year there would be yet another election. Voters line up outside a polling station in Barcelona, Spain. Forming a majority will be complicated by the fact that several of those elected are either in detention or self-imposed exile. In effect, Rajoy's attempt to resolve the crisis through new elections has only cemented the status quo. But the pro-independence parties will probably think twice before trying an encore in declaring Catalonia's separation from Spain, given the sequence of events that was triggered in October. Additionally, the most radical of the pro-independence parties, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), did very poorly and in winning less than half the popular vote they lack a mandate to declare independence. The upheaval -- the worst constitutional crisis in Spain's four decades as a democracy -- began with the Catalan government  holding a referendum on the region's future on October 1, despite it being declared illegal by Spain's Constitutional Court. The vote was marred by violence, with the Civil Guard sent in by Madrid to try to prevent voting. Despite a boycott by most pro-union voters, the separatist parties used the result to push the declaration of independence through Parliament.

I don't think we can negotiate just yet,\" Puigdemont told a news conference from Brussels, Belgium, where he has been in self-imposed exile since Spanish authorities announced they were seeking his arrest.\"Prime Minister Rajoy has a wonderful opportunity to start siding with the solution seekers and to not create any more problems than he has already created,\" he said.Former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont welcomes the election results in a speech from Brussels.Read MoreAsked about Puigdemont's offer, Rajoy brushed it aside, saying the only person he should sit down with was In\u00e9s Arrimadas, leader of the pro-unity Ciutadans (Citizens) party.Ciutadans, known in the rest of spain as Ciudadanos, came first in Thursday's election. However, its 37 seats are not enough for it to form a majority government.Analysis: No mood for compromise after close voteIn a blow to Madrid, provisional results showed that three separatist parties together took 70 seats. They needed 68 to keep their grip on the 135-seat Parliament. Between them, they took about 48% of the popular vote.Rajoy: 'Deep' social fractureThe election results show that the region in northeastern Spain is deeply divided, Rajoy told a news conference in Madrid, and will take time to heal.Catalonia: Rajoy's efforts to snuff out independence push backfire \"Catalonia is not monolithic, it is plural,\" Rajoy said. \"It is obvious that the social fracture in Catalan society is very deep.\"He called for Catalonia's lawmakers to find a way to meet the demands of all its people. \"What is clear is that no one can speak on behalf of Catalonia if they do not think on behalf of the region,\" said Rajoy. \"An election is always a new beginning in democracy, an opportunity to open a new era and I trust in Catalonia we will start an era based on dialogue, not on confrontation.\"The government in Madrid would like to engage in \"open, constructive and realist dialogue, always within the framework of the law,\" he added.Rajoy said the results showed a decline in support for pro-independence parties since 2010, although \"not as much as we wanted.\"He also commented on the \"judicial position\" of some of the candidates elected, saying that politicians must be subject to the law.Supporters wave flags and banners at the Ciutadans party headquarters as they celebrate the results of the election Thursday.The Spanish government called the early regional election for Catalonia in the hope of quelling the separatist movement, whose push for independence this year triggered the crisis.However, that ambition was thwarted when voters backed the three pro-independence parties.Those parties must now embark on intense negotiations to form a coalition government, with major questions over who might lead it.Puigdemont -- leader of the Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) faction, which won 34 seats Thursday -- said last week that he would come back if he won, but he could still face arrest by Spanish authorities over the illegal referendum if he does. Meanwhile, the other main separatist leader -- Oriol Junqueras of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (Republican Left of Catalonia) -- is detained in a Madrid prison over the referendum, on charges of sedition and rebellion. Both leaders face 30-year jail terms if convicted.Investigation widensPuigdemont was pushed from power after his government held an illegal independence referendum on October 1 and lawmakers unilaterally declared the region's independence from Spain.Thursday's result was a clear rejection of Madrid's response to the turbulence. Rajoy's Partido Popular (People's Party) lost most of its seats in the election, dropping from 11 to three.The millennials voting for Catalan independenceThe Spanish government sent in thousands of police to shut down the referendum, and officers were seen pulling elderly voters by the hair from polling stations and firing rubber bullets at relatively calm protesters.Following Catalan lawmakers' declaration of independence, Madrid dismissed the entire Catalan government and Parliament and seized control of the region.The Spanish Supreme Court has said it is widening the scope of its investigation into leaders of the Catalan independence movement.Judge Pablo Llarena is now investigating not only the deposed Catalan government, but also six more officials. Among them are the former Catalan President Artur Mas; Marta Rovira, the secretary general of the Esquerra Republicana; Marta Pascal, the coordinator of Carles Puigdemont's party; and three others.

        "content": "(CNN)British Prime Minister Theresa May has fired her closest political ally after he admitted lying over the presence of pornography on a computer in his parliamentary office.An investigation by the UK Cabinet Office found that Damian Green's previous denials over the issue were \"inaccurate and misleading.\"Police found thousands of thumbnail pornographic images on the computer during a raid in 2008 that was part of an inquiry into government leaks, a former Scotland Yard detective involved in the case said. None of the material was deemed to be illegal.More recently, Green was accused by by journalist and former Conservative party activist Kate Maltby of making unwanted advances towards her during a meeting in 2015.The loss of Green is a personal blow for May. He was her closest ally in Cabinet, and brokered the deal with the Democratic Unionist Party that kept her in power after her Conservative party lost its parliamentary majority in a botched election in June. Read MoreGreen is the third cabinet member to leave in the past two months, following the resignations of Defense Secretary Michael Fallon over allegations of inappropriate behavior with women, and of International Development Secretary Priti Patel over unauthorized meetings with senior Israeli politicians.The Cabinet Office report found that by lying about the pornography, Green had breached the code of conduct for UK ministers. It also said that Maltby's account was plausible, although it was \"not possible to reach a definitive conclusion on the appropriateness of Mr Green's behavior\" with her.Green said at the time the allegations were \"completely untrue.\"May forced Green, the First Secretary of State and her de facto deputy, to resign after the report was published on Wednesday evening.British 'deputy PM' caught up in pornography claimsMay said Green's behavior fell short of the standards expected from people in British public life and was a \"breach of the ministerial code.\" \"It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the Government and have accepted your resignation,\" May said in a letter to Green and released by Downing Street.In his response to May, Green said he did not download or view pornography on his parliamentary computers, calling the allegations \"unfounded and deeply hurtful,\" but went on to admit that he hadn't been clear when he had previously addressed the claims.\"I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013\", he said. British PM forced to name new defense chief amid sexual harassment crisis \"I apologize that my statements were misleading on this point.\"In November, May said there needed to be a \"new culture of respect\" following a wave of sexual harassment scandals at the UK government offices at Westminster, London.The Prime Minister's Defense Secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, resigned in November over allegations of sexual misconduct.",

Everything went to plan -- there were no awkward encounters, the snow that has buffeted some parts of the UK this week held off, and Markle seemed to be at ease with the flag-waving and camera-wielding residents of Nottingham who had gathered since early in the day to secure the best spots.Read MoreMarkle started off at Harry's side and offered a reassuring hand on his back, but a few minutes later she moved off on her own to meet the crowds further down the street, taking flowers and confidently greeting overjoyed fans. Markle appeared confident during her first official public engagement.One woman proudly showed off a picture she'd managed to snap of Harry as he leaned in to shake her hand.  \"This is my hand and Prince Harry with his tongue out at me, which I think is a pretty cool photo. I was shocked I didn't expect him to shake my hand,\" the woman excitedly told CNN.The fifth-in-line to the throne greeted well-wishers for around 30 minutes before continuing with his official visit. Libby Morton, a university student from Minnesota currently studying in the UK, said she turned out on Friday because Americans \"absolutely adore the royal family.\"  \"It's absolutely amazing to be here while its happening. I'm going to be here for the royal wedding, for the royal baby and its kind of a dream come true,\" she added.Related: Markle intends to become UK citizen after marriageHarry designed the diamond engagement ring he presented to his bride-to-be last month.

        "content": "(CNN)Polls have closed in the Spanish region of Catalonia, in an election seen as a litmus test of the separatist movement's legitimacy after it attempted to break away from Spain.Madrid called the snap regional election with the hope of having a new government to deal with after Catalonia's Parliament in Barcelona declared unilateral independence in October.Spain was plunged into its worst political crisis in decades when the Catalan government held an illegal referendum on October 1 on independence, triggering a monthslong standoff with Madrid.A man wearing a traditional Catalan barretina hat kisses his ballot before voting in Barcelona.Madrid responded to the Catalan administration provocations by firing the government, dissolving the region's Parliament and imposing direct rule.Thursday's vote is being treated as a legal version of the referendum, and polls before the vote suggested it's on a knife-edge, with support for parties that are for and against independence split right down the middle.Read MorePolls closed at 8 p.m.  and the Catalan government reports an estimated turnout of above 80%, which would mark record participation if confirmed. Results are expected late Thursday night.What's going on?'Like the Civil War without the bombs': Catalonia's messy voteThe situation has made for an unusual campaign. Oriol Junqueras -- the president and head candidate of the main pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia -- has run his campaign from prison in Madrid.He has been charged with sedition and rebellion, and is facing a 30-year jail term over his role in the illegal referendum.Carles Puigdemont, who led Catalonia until Madrid fired him, faces the same charges but fled to Brussels to campaign from afar. He leads the Junts per Catalunya (Together for Catalonia) faction and claims he is still the region's legitimate leader. The two leaders, who ran the previous government together, have traded barbs in recent days, accusing one another of hiding from the independence fight, in a sign that movement is truly fractured.The independence movement has sought to characterize the government in Madrid as a continuation of the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, which oppressed the Catalan people over four decades of rule.It points to force used by Spanish police during the October 1 referendum, in which officers sent by Madrid to shut down the vote were seen pulling elderly people from polling stations, and firing rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters.Madrid, on the other hand, has tried to portray independence leaders as rogue elements who have hijacked Catalan politics to promote a cause that does not have popular support. Adding fuel to the fire, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Mar\u00eda Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, given temporary command of Catalonia, declared at the weekend that the country's ruling Popular Party had \"decapitated\" the independence movement, Spanish media reports, stoking outrage in the region.Who's leading the race?The millennials voting for Catalan independenceAccording to Antoni Puigverd, a Catalan analyst with La Vanguardia, 1.5 million eligible voters were still undecided days before the election.This volatility has to do largely with the fracture in the independence movement and the unusual circumstances of the vote, as Madrid retains control over the region and key independence figures are in prison or abroad, Puigverd said.  The outcome is expected to be messy. Catalonia's Parliament is typically split between seven parties and alliances, and no single one is expected to win a majority of the 135 seats.'Without papers, you are nothing': Catalonia's newcomers wooed by promises of citizenshipThis means the votes will almost certainly be followed by weeks of political wrangling, and the party that wins the most seats will not necessarily lead the government -- it is the biggest coalition that will ascend.Ciutadans (Citizens) candidate In\u00e9s Arrimadas casts her vote in Barcelona.Some polls before the vote showed a meteoric rise in the center-right Ciutadans (Citizens) party, which is anti-independence, predicting it could win the highest number of seats, in a sign that there is appetite to end  what the Catalans simply call \"the process.\" The party is led by 36-year-old In\u00e9s Arrimadas, a relatively fresh face in Catalan politics.The two main pro-independence parties appear to be at loggerheads, but they have insisted to CNN that, should they together win a majority of seats, they will form a coalition and show a unified front.Oriol Junqueras, left, with Carles Puigdemont at the Catalan government headquarters in Barcelona in October.Some pre-vote polls show that they could achieve a narrow majority, while others show them falling just short. If they do fall short, the smaller Catalunya en Com\u00fa (Catalonia in Common) could become kingmaker in a coalition. The party has said it will not team up with Ciutadans, but is also tepid on independence.In the absence of a majority, who will become president will depend entirely on talks. Puigdemont was propelled into Catalonia's presidency in a last-minute deal after the previous vote in 2015.Will the vote solve the problems between Barcelona and Madrid?It's unlikely. The pro-independence parties together have a greater chance of forming a government, and if they do, the Madrid-Barcelona feud could be back to square one.If they lose, Madrid is unlikely to show any mercy to the independence leaders in prison, according to Puigverd, the Catalan analyst.  \"The situation will calm down and the independence movement will accept its defeat. They will expect clemency for their prisoners -- clemency that they won't get. The state will take its revenge, at least for a few years,\" he told CNN.A woman casts her ballot in the Catalan election in Sabadell, north of Barcelona, on Thursday.The push for independence is steeped in hundreds of years of history, but it was given new life in 2010, as the effects of the global financial crisis began to bite but also as Madrid began rolling back on the region's powers.Spain's Popular Party -- which now governs the country -- challenged Catalonia's status as a country within Spain in the Constitutional Court in 2010 and won, forcing the region to accept a new status one notch down. The Spanish Parliament has overturned several laws passed by Catalan MPs -- including one to protect poor people from soaring energy costs and another banning bullfighting. Each side accused the other of overstepping its authority.",

The pictures, by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski, present the couple in a modern and intimate light -- a sign of the times and a far cry from the engagement shots of many of their forebears in the British royal family. Alexi Lubomirski via Getty Images\nHere's how royal couples preparing to say, \"I do,\" have been captured through the lens. Princess Elizabeth and Prince PhilipBettmann Archive/Getty ImagesThe engagement of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip of Greece was announced on July 10, 1947.

After they married, Diana assumed the title of Her Royal Highness, Princess of Wales. They would have two sons, Princes William and Harry, but their marriage would be rocked by controversy surrounding Charles' infidelity and his relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Diana and Charles' divorce was finalized in August 1996. Within months, Diana would die following a car wreck in Paris. Sarah Ferguson and Prince AndrewPA Images via Getty ImagesElizabeth and Philip's third child, Andrew, was engaged to Sarah Ferguson -- known as \"Fergie\" -- in March 1986.

        "content": "Story highlights Pope Francis sprinkled holy water on Law's casket Among attendees were Callista and Newt GingrichRome (CNN)Pope Francis offered a short benediction at the funeral Thursday of Cardinal Bernard Law, a move that disappointed some sex-abuse survivors who said the pontiff should not dignify the former Boston archbishop who resigned in disgrace over the Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandal.Francis' participation in the ceremony fueled the controversy over a decision to grant Law a full cardinal's funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.During the Mass, Law's casket lay on a rug in front of an altar, flanked by seated cardinals and bishops wearing white mitres. Francis sprinkled holy water on the casket and circled it with incense, before saying the blessing later in the service, Vatican video showed.Pope Francis attends the funeral Mass of Cardinal Bernard Law on Thursday, December 21, at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.Among those attending were Callista Gingrich, the US ambassador-designate to the Holy See, and her husband, former US House Speaker Newt Gingrich.Law, who died early Wednesday in Rome following a long illness, became a symbol of the sex-abuse scandal after a Boston Globe investigation revealed that he and other bishops had covered up child abuse by priests in the Boston Archdiocese.Read MoreCallista Gingrich, the US ambassador-designate to the Holy See, and her husband, Newt Gingrich, attend a funeral service Thursday for Cardinal Bernard Law at St. Peter's Basilica.The story was made into a celebrated movie, \"Spotlight,\" and the scandal forced the Catholic Church to rethink the way it dealt with child abuse in its midst.'Chop him up:' Accusers seethe over Vatican funeral plans for Cardinal LawIt is protocol for the Pope to give the \"final commendation,\" or blessing, at a cardinal's funeral when he dies in Rome, Vatican officials told CNN. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals, presided over the Mass.The occasion was a funeral, not a tribunal nor a judgment of Law's life, the Vatican added.  But critics have questioned why the Pope, who has previously broken with protocol when it suited him, has not chosen to do so in this case.Francis made no mention of the sex-abuse scandal in a telegram he sent Wednesday to Sodano marking the 86-year-old cardinal's death.'Gates of hell wide open'Alexa MacPherson, a native of the Boston area who says she is a survivor of sexual abuse by a priest, responded angrily Wednesday. \"With his passing, I say I hope the gates of hell are open wide to welcome him, because I feel no redemption for somebody like him is worthwhile,\" she told reporters.Robert Costello, left, and Alexa MacPherson, right, speak at their attorney's Boston office Wednesday about the death of Cardinal Bernard Law.Robert Costello, another Boston-area native, says that Law covered up for the cleric who abused him. Instead of being given a Vatican funeral, Law should just \"disappear,\" he told reporters in the Boston office of attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents many who accuse priests of sex abuse.\"Chop him up and put weights on every piece of body part that he has and drop him in oceans around the world,\" said Costello, 56.Costello added that he believed Pope Francis should have met with every single abuse victim. \"There's not a single day that goes by that I don't remember what happened to me,\" he said.This photo, from April 2005, shows Cardinal Bernard Law celebrating Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.Law moved to Italy to serve as archpriest of the Papal Liberian Basilica of St. Mary Major after he was forced to resign in 2002 as archbishop of Boston. He remained a cardinal.He apologized at the time to victims of John Geoghan, a priest who had been moved from parish to parish, despite Law's knowledge of his abuse of young boys. Geoghan was convicted in 2002 of indecent assault and battery on a 10-year-old boy.Law never faced criminal sanctions for his role in allowing abusive priests to remain in parishes. The scandal reverberated through the church, exposing similar allegations worldwide that compromised its moral authority and led to years of multimillion-dollar settlements.O' Malley: Church failed to care for childrenLaw's successor in Boston, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, told a news conference Wednesday that the funeral Mass Law would receive was what any cardinal in Rome would be given.Cardinal Bernard Law's casket sits at the altar during Thursday's funeral Mass.But he also apologized for the Catholic Church's past failings over sex abuse by clergy. \"Cardinal Law served at a time when the church failed seriously in its responsibilities to provide pastoral care for her people, and with tragic outcomes failed to care for the children of our parish communities. I deeply regret that reality and its consequences,\" O'Malley said.Australian Catholic leaders reject key calls by child abuse inquiry He added that he did not believe someone in Law's situation would receive such a high-profile appointment -- as the archpriest of a basilica -- in Rome today.Before the funeral plans were announced, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests had urged against a \"celebratory focus\" on Law.\"We highly doubt there is a single victim of abuse who will ever receive the same attention, pomp and circumstance by Pope Francis,\" the network said in a news release after Law's death.CNN's Delia Gallagher reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

READ: AI elecric racer makes street track debut\"Going into one of the chicanes is insanely tight, and of course if you get it wrong you are in the wall. You have to get it right every time.\"For Roborace, it wasn't just the track but Hong Kong's unique topography that posed problems. \"This was our first time of running our completely new AI Driver software in a built-up urban environment,\" Roborace's CTO Bryn Balcombe told CNN via email. Roborace hope their work with AI cars can benefit general road users in the future \"The urban canyons created by the tall skyscrapers cause disruptions to GPS which are difficult to replicate in a testing environment.\"READ: Daniel Abt stripped of maiden Formula E win Before completing a flying lap Roborace engineers deploy DevBot at low speed in what they call \"explorer mode\" where track data is gathered using state-of-the-art sensing equipment including LIDAR, radar, ultrasonics and cameras.Once the track has been scanned, the information is processed by an AI computer (a NVIDIA Drive PX2) that uses complex algorithms to determine the fastest route (the racing line) around a track.\"Compared to a human, the main challenge is how fast it takes for the AI Driver to adapt and learn a new track,\" Balcombe said.JUST WATCHEDFormula E: 'You never know what's going to happen'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFormula E: 'You never know what's going to happen' 02:18In the end, it was a rare triumph for humans against AI opposition with Shields posting a fastest lap of 1:26.6 seconds -- 7.4 seconds quicker than the DevBot could manage in AI mode around the 1.2-mile track.For the victor there was pleasure and relief, but also a slight sense of disappointment.  \"I'm a huge fan of this technology, so if the technology had won it would have been awesome,\" Shields said.\"It was amazing to see DevBot go around in complete autonomous mode driving insanely fast around a ridiculously tight street circuit. It makes you think the possibilities are endless.\"DevBot may have lost this time around but its journey of discovery has only just begun as Roborace looks to push the boundaries in autonomous car technology even further.\"We are developing new competition formats that go beyond the limits imposed by human safety -- challenges that will test the performance of intelligent vehicle technologies to the limit,\" Balcombe said.Eliminating human errorConvincing skeptical motorists to climb aboard with the technology is already one of the key challenges for automakers. Earlier this year, an AAA survey found that three-quarters of Americans said they would fear riding in an autonomous car. Inevitably, incidents involving autonomous vehicles attract the headlines. One of Google's self-driving cars crashed last year and a driverless public shuttle service in Las Vegas recently had an accident on its first day in service.Roborace hasn't been immune from crashes either. Last February while track testing in Buenos Aires DevBot plowed into the safety barriers. But ceding control of your car to a computer may be safer and more efficient in the long run, says Professor Paul Jennings, from the UK's Warwick University, one of the UK's leading research centers for autonomous vehicles. \"Over 90% of accidents are down to human error so if in the long term we can eliminate human error we should save lives and reduce the number of accidents,\" Jennings told CNN.

        "content": "(CNN)The European Union has triggered an unprecedented disciplinary process against Poland for a \"serious breach\" of its values, in a dispute over judicial reforms that could lead to Warsaw being stripped of its EU voting rights.The European Commission, the EU's principal administrative body, warned of a \"clear risk of a serious breach in the rule of law\" posed by legal reforms introduced by Poland's rightwing government. It recommended that EU leaders invoke Article 7, a process that could eventually lead to Poland's voting rights being suspended.The dispute involves a series of measures introduced in recent years by Poland's ruling Law and Justice party. They EU believes they have paved the way for political interference in the legal system and put the independence of the Polish judiciary at risk. Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, said that 13 laws adopted by Poland in the past two years had created an environment in which the Polish government \"can systematically politically interfere with the composition, powers, the administration and the functioning\" of the judiciary.Despite efforts for a constructive dialogue for 2 years, we have concluded that there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law in #Poland We therefore proposed to @EUCouncil to adopt a decision under #Article7 (1) of the Treaty on EU https://t.co/EFfnjTOlF6\u2014 European Commission (@EU_Commission) December 20, 2017\n\nRead MoreThe commission also said it had referred Poland to the European Court of Justice over \"breaches of EU law.\"Poland has been given three months to address the EU's concerns.In a statement published Wednesday, the Commission urged Poland to change laws that lowered of the retirement age for judges and gave the President the power to prolong a mandate of Supreme Court justices. It also wants the Polish government to remove an extraordinary appeal procedure, which includes the ability to reopen final judgments taken years earlier, and to restore the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal.Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawieck hit back by saying that reform of the judiciary was a matter for his state, not the EU.\"Poland is as devoted to the rule of law as the rest of the EU. Current judiciary reform is deeply needed,\" he tweeted.He added: \"The dialogue between the commission and Warsaw needs to be both open and honest. I believe that Poland's sovereignty and the idea of United Europe can be reconciled.\"Poland is as devoted to the rule of law as the rest of the EU. Current judiciary reform is deeply needed. The dialogue between the Commission and Warsaw needs to be both open and honest.

The most serious punishment that could be inflicted would be the removal of Poland's voting rights in EU institutions, but that would require a unanimous vote to be passed and Hungary has already said it would reject the proposal.",

Sixteen people suffered serious burns as a result of the incident, which police said resulted from a dance floor argument at the Mangle nightclub in the London borough of Hackney, in April.\"Collins went to the nightclub that night with a bottle of a noxious substance with the intent to use it to inflict serious harm. He indiscriminately and recklessly sprayed the substance in a crowded place, knowing full well the danger this would pose to a large number of people,\" said Hackney Borough commander, Detective Chief Superintendent Simon Laurence.\"This was a barbaric and cowardly act.\"JUST WATCHEDAcid attacks on the rise in BritainReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAcid attacks on the rise in Britain 03:42Read MoreDuring his trial, Collins told the court he didn't know the bottle contained acid; he thought it was a liquid date rape drug, which he took from two men after overhearing them planning to spike a drink, the Press Association reported. Acid attacks in London have increased dramatically in recent years, and police and lawmakers are now mulling ways to make weaponized acid, or \"face melters,\" more difficult to obtain.

He then indiscriminately sprayed it twice more, hitting a number of clubgoers, the report released by the Metropolitan Police said. \"Victims described seeing 'steam' rise above them and there being a chemical smell which made them choke,\" it says. Injuries included chemical burns to some of the victims' faces and bodies, and eye injuries in at least two cases.  A still from security camera footage, which shows the altercation between Arthur Collins and an unidentified manThe perpetrator stayed in the club for almost an hour after the attack as police and emergency services arrived to tend to victims, the report said. He was arrested at a residential address several days after the attack. It added that Collins was captured on camera appearing to laugh and joke as distressed revelers, who had fled the venue, were desperately seeking help at various hospitals.The maximum sentence for acid attacks is life imprisonment, and in September, a burglar who sprayed acid in the eyes of an elderly woman whose house he was robbing was jailed for a similar period. Collins has a daughter with a British reality star, Ferne McCann, British media reports. The couple are no longer together. \n\n\n\n\nRising number of incidentsIn 2016, 454 acid attacks were reported across London, up from 261 the year before, and 166 in 2014. \"Most of the products can be bought off the shelf -- so drain cleaner, oven cleaner -- there are different types of sulfuric acid you can buy, and ammonia,\" Hackney borough  police Chief Superintendent Simon Laurence told CNN earlier this year.Police have suggested that gang members may be switching to acid over knives and guns, as the liquid is harder to detect. \"Acid throwing has been adopted by urban street gangs in a way that perhaps we haven't seen for a very long time,\" Laurence said.And just like knife and gun crimes, acid attacks have become a predominantly male-on-male problem.The attacks can disfigure their victims profoundly, leaving them with both physical and psychologically life-changing injuries.\"They know that acid can be very damaging and very destructive and they are in many ways seeking to mark their victim with an act of dominance or a mark of control, demonstrating their power and their ability to get to you at any time,\" Simon Harding, a criminologist from Middlesex University London says. \"They call (acid) 'torture in a bottle' and they want to be able to take their rival out of the game.\"CNN's Angela Dewan, Muhammad Darwish, Edward Kiernan and Jamie Gray contributed to this report.",

They were later filmed pulling elderly voters from polling booths, and firing rubber bullets and tear gas at people in the streets -- scenes that prompted global outrage.Millennials like Galceran are among Catalonia's most passionate advocates for independence, even though they were born well after Gen. Francisco Franco's decades of dictatorship, a brutal chapter in Spain's history that helps give the secessionist movement its thrust. Alexandra Galceran Latorre, right, with her boyfriend Ricard Ots. The pair bonded over their support for an independent Catalonia.An opinion poll by the Center for Opinion Studies in Catalonia found that more than half of Catalans between the ages of 18 and 34 would vote to break away from Spain given a simple choice of yes or no. Pro-independence parties vying for power in Thursday's regional election are hoping that support will translate into votes.\"We are still seeing Franco in our political parties. They are fascists, and they are strangling us slowly, step by step,\" Galceran told CNN in Barcelona. Read MoreShe plans to vote for Together for Catalonia, headed by deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont.\"We are fighting to defend our language, our traditions and our culture. This is what our ancestors fought for.\"Generation GFCThe global financial crisis has left a generation struggling to find secure work. Job security and having enough income to get a mortgage is a challenge, and many in their 30s still live with their parents.Mir\u00edam Candelera, 28, who lives in Girona, north of Barcelona, said she didn't think she would ever be able to afford her own home. Her parents moved to Girona -- where there is huge support for independence -- from the poorer southern region of Andalusia.Mir\u00edam Candelera, 28, says Madrid takes too much of Catalonia's money.Now she supports independence because she thinks young people in Andalusia get all the help while Catalans are left to fend for themselves.\"They take all our money,\" she said of the central government in Madrid, echoing something separatist leaders frequently argue.Catalonia, Spain's economic engine, accounts for nearly a fifth of the country's economy, and leads all regions in producing 25% of the country's exports.The region has a proven record of attracting investment, with nearly a third of all foreign companies in Spain choosing Barcelona as their base.'Like the Civil War without the bombs': Catalonia's messy voteIt contributes much more in taxes (21% of the country's total) than it gets back from the government.Independence supporters have seized on the imbalance, arguing that stopping transfers to Madrid would turn Catalonia's budget deficit into a surplus.They are numbers that are especially hard to swallow for Catalan millennials, who \u2014 like almost all young people in developed nations around the world \u2014 will be poorer than their parents' generation, according to an OECD study. \"Ever since the economic crisis in 2008, which hit Spain very hard, young people have felt perplexed. They are wondering: 'What happened?' They told us that if we studied, everything would be fine, and now we have no work, no money, no house,\" said Marina Subirats, a sociologist from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. \"You have to understand that it means a lot for a generation that has no job or place in society when someone promises to build a new country where everything will be perfect.\"JUST WATCHEDCatalonia: What you need to knowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCatalonia: What you need to know 01:10According to Artis International, an organization researching violence and conflict, unemployment and support for independence in Catalonia are linked.Support grew every year between 2009 and 2013 in line with unemployment. In 2014, when unemployment began to ease, so did support for independence. That effect is multiplied among young people because joblessness affects them disproportionately.'The independence movement is closed-minded'The younger generation in the region are the first to live completely immersed in Catalan culture since Franco's death in 1975. Catalan is now the official language in schools, and students are taught the region's history, something Franco didn't allow. Madrid claims that schools are indoctrinating children to support independence.MORE: Spain loses 20% of its economy if Catalonia splitsSergi Font, a volunteer with the pro-independence organization \u00d2mnium Cultural in Girona, said that Madrid's accusations of brainwashing were completely unfounded.\"The Spanish government just doesn't like that our schools teach the history of our country, and that they point out that there are differences between Spain and Catalonia,\" said Font, a 35-year-old.But not all Catalans agree.

His response, he says, is to smile and move on.Read MoreEven in a local supermarket in Alicante where he is currently spending 10 days on a training camp, Jonny is now being recognized more readily than he has been at anytime in his career.\"People stop and say how nice he [Alistair] was,\" he says. \"It's actually all people ever say.\"JUST WATCHEDTriathlete helps his brother across the finish lineReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTriathlete helps his brother across the finish line 01:05No day off on Christmas Day    Nice run session this morning on the river loop. Nice to run with the lads and have @alistair.brownlee back running A post shared by  Jonny Brownlee (@jonnybrownleetri) on Dec 16, 2017 at 3:28am PST To their credit, the siblings have embraced the incident, one that has brought the once bickering brothers closer together.Growing up, even playing a game of Monopoly could spark an argument between the brothers. There is also a third Brownlee brother, Edward, who is younger than Alistair and Jonny.Spending this Christmas at their parents' Yorkshire home in northern England, the two triathletes will happily join in the board games but with a surprising lack of desire to win.\"I think we used up all our competitiveness for stuff like that as children, and we get enough competition from the day job,\" says Alistair. \"There will be other people being competitive in the family.\"While they will allow their svelte frames the luxury of gorging on the festive offerings, Christmas Day won't pass without a training session.\"It's never a case that I'm worrying about what my rivals are doing on Christmas Day, it's more a case that I'm used to exercising,\" adds Alistair.

The brothers will represent England at the Games.To date, Alistair has predominantly taken the bragging rights, winning the last two Olympic titles as Jonny finished third and second in 2012 and 2016 respectively.For Jonny, the result in 2012 was easy to bear, less so last summer in Brazil, where he admits the idea of damning his brother crossed his mind.\"I was in such good shape in Rio,\" he says. \"I was training so well and running faster than him so that sort of irritation crossed my mind briefly but, if I hadn't won, I wanted it to be him.\"So will 2018 be the year when youth finally gets the better of experience?\"Well, I hope so but I thought the same thing in 2016 and look what happened then!\" adds Jonny with a laugh.

        "content": "(CNN)A Turkish court has ordered the release of German journalist and translator Mesale Tolu, according to Germany's Foreign Ministry.Tolu, who was detained seven months ago, will be released under judicial control, ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said Monday.\"Although Tolu is not allowed to leave Turkey, (this) is a tremendous relief,\" she said.Why Turkey-US tensions have come to a boilTolu was accused of being a member of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party -- labeled in her indictment as an \"armed terror organization\" -- and with spreading \"terrorist propaganda.\" Human-rights organizations have described the charges as unfounded and part of a crackdown on free speech. Read MoreTolu was facing up to 15 years in prison if convicted. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in a statement: \"This is not only good news, but also a tremendous relief. I believe that all of us in Germany, including me, are pleased with the Mesale Tolu decision. This is not the end of the process, but a big first step has been taken.\"'Worst jailer' of journalistsTurkey was named the \"world's worst jailer\" of journalists for the second year running in a recent report by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Seventy-three journalists are behind bars in the country, compared to 81 in 2016.Following the release of Tolu, one German journalist -- Deniz Y\u00fccel -- remains in jail in Turkey on political charges.\"We are following closely the proceedings against all Germans who are detained or charged for political reasons in Turkey,\" said Gabriel on Monday. \"More Germans, such as Deniz Y\u00fccel, remain in Turkish custody. We continue to offer our support.\" Dilek Mayaturk and her husband Deniz Yucel, who has been in prison in Turkey since February.Y\u00fccel, a Turkish-German journalist for German newspaper \"Die Welt,\" was arrested in February and held in solitary confinement for at least five months. He is accused of spreading propaganda for the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that the Turkish government has branded a terrorist organization.Soon after the arrest, German-Turkish relations began to deteriorate rapidly, with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan likening the German government to that of Adolf Hitler and calling for Turks in Germany to reject the country's biggest parties in September's federal election. German Chancellor Merkel responded to Turkey's stance with a call to pause negotiations for Turkey's accession to the European Union.Relations have since begun to thaw, aided in October by the release on bail of human-rights trainer Peter Steudtner, who was arrested in Turkey in July.",

        "content": "(CNN)Austria's new coalition government, which includes the far-right Freedom Party, was sworn in on Monday as demonstrators protested outside.President Alexander Van der Bellen, a member of the Green Party, presided over the ceremony at Vienna's Hofburg Palace.The new Chancellor is the leader of the center-right People's Party. Sebastian Kurz, at 31, is the youngest leader in the world. The vice chancellor is Heinz Christian Strache, 48, a former dental technician and the Freedom Party's leader.Police say between 5,000 and 6,000 people attended a demonstration against the new government in Heldenplatz square in front of the palace as the inauguration ceremony was underway.Read MoreProtests outside ceremonyBearing placards like \"Don't Let Nazis Govern,\" the protesters included women's groups and left-wing parties. Austrian police said in a tweet some \"pyrotechnical\" missiles were thrown by demonstrators.\"After throwing several pyrotechnical objects, they are being asked to stop doing so,\" the police said.Even so, protests were muted compared to the last time the far-right entered government in Austria in 2000, when demonstrations nearly brought Vienna to a halt.A demonstrator holds a poster 'Nazis out of the parliament' during a demonstration prior to the ceremony. \"As representative of all Austrians I have the will and the well-being of everyone in mind,\" President Van der Bellen said in a tweet.\"Incidentally, the same applies also to the new government. From now on, it too has to take the well-being of all Austrians into account,\" he said.When the Freedom Party joined the coalition in 2000, the European Union slapped sanctions on Vienna to protest the presence of the far right in the birthplace of Adolf Hitler. So far this time, the response from Austria's EU partners has been cautious.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a press conference Monday she hoped Austria would remain \"an active partner in Europe.\" She did not mention the far-right. She later called Kurz and invited him to come to Berlin soon. President of the European Council Donald Tusk issued a statement saying: \"I trust that the Austrian government will continue to play a constructive and pro-European role in the European Union.\"This is especially important at a time when the European Council is engaging more directly on politically sensitive issues in the context of the Leaders' Agenda. I am looking forward to meeting you soon and to closely cooperating with you during the Austrian Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2018\".Kurz is set to travel to Brussels on Tuesday for a meeting with Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. He will meet Wednesday with Antonio Tajani, president of the European Parliament. Immigration on new government's agendaUnlike in Germany, where the success of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in recent elections caused a seismic shock, the Freedom Party has long been part of Austria's political landscape.Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, it first entered government 17 years ago, the first far-right party to do so in postwar Europe.Strache has sought to modernize the party, though accusations of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia continue to linger.Austria took in around 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, representing about 1% of its population, many fleeing the war in Syria.The new Austrian government's program includes pledges to stop illegal immigration and slash taxes, as well as oppose further EU political and economic integration. In a coalition statement following their agreement on Friday, the new government said it wanted to \"steer the EU back in the right direction towards its fundamental ideas,\" meaning less centralized decision making.It also plans a clampdown on asylum seekers, offering only temporary protection.\"Immigration into the Austrian social welfare state...must be stopped,\" the coalition said.The coalition said it was prepared to close Islamic schools to prevent what it described as \"the creation of parallel societies.\"Turkey expresses concernSome of the strongest reactions to the new government came from Turkey.  \"Islamophobic, antisemitic, xenophobic and anti-migrant parties are on the rise. Now this movement is in power in Austria,\" tweeted Omer Celik, Turkey's EU Affairs Minister.The World Jewish Congress also expressed unease.\"It is severely disquieting that despite the many real concerns known and expressed about the (Freedom Party), it will now retain a position of serious influence, giving the Austrian government a real push even further to the right,\"   WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in a statement published on the WJC website. Right-of-center politicians were more positive.Alice Weidel, co-leader of Alternative for Germany, tweeted \"Austria will change, and drastically. And I'm looking forward to that!\"The AfD entered the German Parliament for the first time after emerging from federal elections in September as the country's third-largest party.Nadine Schmidt in Berlin also contributed to this article.",

        "content": "Story highlightsLeading athletes posting workouts on InstagramSome trainers not known to players' teamsInsurance against injury raised as issue (CNN)Hiring personal trainers is officially a trend for leading athletes -- which is both good news and bad news for their teams.  The days of lazing about on a beach gaining weight during the offseason have been replaced by the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James and Lewis Hamilton posting shirtless workout clips to their millions of Instagram followers.And they are not alone -- scores of English Premier League, NBA and NFL players, among others, have jumped on board.      Hard work and preparation for the weekend ahead. Looking forward to getting out on the track after the summer break! #BelgianGP #F1 #Puma A post shared by Lewis Hamilton (@lewishamilton) on Aug 24, 2017 at 4:13am PDT 'Bizarre'It's certainly a testament to the athletes' commitment to fitness, but should a $100 million superstar working out away from a club's training headquarters be a concern to his team?Read MoreSports strength coach Simon Brundish has worked with a number of Premier League clubs over a 21-year career, and is appalled by some of the videos he has seen of top soccer players working with trainers whose qualifications are a mystery.\"Bad strength training just leads to bad injuries,\" he told CNN. \"If it looks bizarre to you, I promise you we find it very strange and a little bit insulting.\"Brundish has compiled a list of notable Premier League players who have raised eyebrows with unusual Instagram workouts, and suggests the trend is a \"fairly new phenomenon\" which first took off in the US. \"Now European players are starting to follow, and I'm pretty sure it's mainly because of Instagram,\" he says. \"It's cool to be seen jumping ropes on social media.\" The most prominent American athlete to have picked up on the Insta-training trend is LeBron James, who has been posting workout clips for the past few years to his nearly 34 million Instagram followers. But James' offseason conditioning is monitored by trainer Mike Mancius, who is also employed by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Reporting back to the club is an essential part of his role.  Any personal trainer working outside of club duties \"has to be great at communicating. That's the bottom line,\" Mancias stressed in an exclusive interview with CNN.\"These teams, these owners, these GMs (general managers), they are the ones investing millions upon millions of dollars in these players' contracts, and so we want to make sure that they are in the right hands of someone with knowledgeable credentials,\" he said. READ: LeBron James -- Keeping a billion-dollar body in shape'00Fitness'However, not every personal trainer believes in working closely with teams. Some prefer operating under the radar with high-profile athletes -- without the knowledge of their clubsMeet German strength and conditioning coach Moritz Klatten, dubbed \"Agent 00Fitness.\" The Hamburg native specializes in training boxers, including recent WBA Light Middleweight champion Jack Culcay-Keth, and is the author of The Klatten Power Boxing System.Over the years Klatten has also discreetly trained a number of Bundesliga players in northern Germany.     #LiveLifeFit @cr7crunchfitness \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaa #Fitness #Madrid A post shared by Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) on Sep 8, 2017 at 11:57am PDT The situation reached a head in November 2014 when Hamburg played Werder Bremen in the Norderby. Bild Sport reported that Klatten was hired by footballers on both clubs, with headlines referring to him as a \"double agent\" and \"00Fitness.\"\"I normally never really have a strong relationship with the club; I only have a relationship with the player,\" the 36-year-old Klatten told CNN. \"The players approach me secretly.\"Klatten, who says he has trained as many as five members of Hamburg at a time, says players approach him because they are often dissatisfied with their club's strength conditioning. \"You would expect in football, because there is so much money, that the way they train is ideal and everything is perfect. But it's not,\" he says. \"There is so much room for improvement.\"I would say that probably 95% of players will never reach their full potential, because they are not training right.\"There is too much emphasis on long-term endurance work and not enough on strength training and speed work. I have my own methods.\"READ: Eat, sleep and work out like an athlete of the future'Best possible care'Klatten spent last summer working with Tolgay Arslan, a former Hamburg player who is now a two-time league winner with Turkish club Be\u015fikta\u015f, and says he previously helped rehabilitate former Hamburg player Piotr Trochowski from injury.     Getting @tarslan18 ready for next season! #TolgayArslan #besiktas #nurderhsv #champperformance A post shared by Moritz Klatten (@champ_performance) on Jun 22, 2017 at 3:41am PDT Remarkably, Klatten says he has worked out with Hamburg players during the season, and even on the day before big matches -- a stark contrast to most independent trainers who are limited to summers or brief in-season breaks. \"On top of their own training, they train with me,\" he explains, adding that he is careful not to double up with exercises the team has already put them through.\"(If) I work with him once and he doesn't perform again because of the work, then I lose my job straight away.\"When asked to comment on Klatten's relationship with Hamburg, a club spokesman said that no member of the current staff was around when his involvement with club players took place.The new policies of head coach Markus Gisdol, who took over last year, appear to be more rigid. \"How and if players can work together with a personal trainer is always decided by the head coach,\" the club said in an email, clarifying that players are allowed to workout externally \"only in close consultation\" with the team's training and medical staff.The club added that Hamburg players are \"getting the best possible care from us, so nobody perceives this possibility\" during this season.

Hide Caption 16 of 16'The unknown is the issue'Naturally, Klatten is quick to downplay the threat of players getting injured or picking up bad habits on his watch. \"I see way less risk,\" he says. \"When you train them individually, you can really adjust the training much better to their needs and to their actual injuries.\"If it's done professionally then I don't see any risk whatsoever.\"In England, West Bromwich Albion's head of physical preparation Paul Caldbeck says his players working out without the team's knowledge is \"not an epidemic, but it definitely happens at times.\" \"The unknown is the issue,\" he told CNN. \"If we are not aware of it, then that is the problem.\"  Having a \"mature discussion\" without vilifying the player -- who is ultimately trying to preserve and maximize his body's earning potential -- while discovering what's lacking from the team is key, says Caldbeck.  \"We have to understand that these guys are adults and we can't just be derogatory or unhappy with their decisions,\" he says. \"We have to support and manage them accordingly.\"The biggest issue for Caldbeck is the lack of adequate insurance taken out by the average personal trainer handling the bodies of multi-million dollar players. \"These guys aren't covered like club staff so it's probably going to blow up in somebody's face at some point,\" he says, explaining that his staff are personally insured for both the loss of a player's earnings in case of injury, as well as any legal expenses that can come up as a result. Klatten, incidentally, says his insurance covers up to $20 million in case of accident or injury to his clients.READ: The doctor transforming elite athletes with her all-seeing eye'Both sides to the argument'Even in Australia, the debate is alive between football clubs and personal trainers. The Socceroos' head of sports science, Dr. Craig Duncan, says he has seen players on the Australian national team receive \"poor training methods\" from their clubs which \"can be detrimental to their earning power.\"\"I can see both sides of the argument,\" he says. \"If you don't have service at the club, why wouldn't you get advice from outside sources?Visit CNN.com/sport for more news, features and videos\"Happy players always perform better.

        "content": "(CNN)British lawmakers used a debate on Monday to express their outrage at the revelations about the slave trade in Libya exposed by a CNN report last month.Chris Law, MP for Dundee West, described the crimes as \"violations of human rights and human dignity that are on an unthinkable scale.\" \"They have no place in our world,\" he added.He urged the United Kingdom not to \"stay silent or stand by in the face of such inhumane atrocities\" but to instead join with the international community to tackle the problem.How one of Africa's richest men is trying to stem the migrant crisisThe debate was triggered by a petition created by Constance Mbassi Manga after CNN released video footage of migrants being sold into slavery in the north African country, some for as little as $400 each.Read MoreThe petition calls for the UK government to \"put pressure on the Libyan government to take immediate action to stop these criminals from selling more people, to set current prisoners free, arrest the criminals and end this.\"It was signed by more than 265,000 people, easily passing the 100,000 threshold qualifying it for a parliamentary debate.'These people matter'Member of Parliament Paul Scully, who lobbied for the petition to be debated, opened the debate with an impassioned call for action on the \"atrocious\" crimes, acknowledging that \"nobody really knows the extent of the problem.\"He argued that the power vacuum in Libya and the root causes of migration need to be addressed before any solutions can be found.Speaking to CNN earlier in the day, Scully said he hoped the debate would further strengthen public awareness of the issue.He said governments must take a long-term view of the problem and focus on directing aid to the right recipients and ending economic migration from sub-Saharan Africa. Today's debate is just \"part of a campaign, not the end of a campaign,\" he said. \"This is just one cog in a wheel.\"Other lawmakers expressed their shock that slave auctions, a phenomenon they believed had been eradicated long ago, still go on.Paul Scully, left, joined anti-slavery campaigners outside parliament earlier on Monday.The images emerging from Libya are shocking and \"have a historical resonance,\" said Lyn Brown, MP for West Ham. \"The victims are black Africans and the people who enslave them are not.\" \"These people matter. African lives matter,\" she said. \"They need us to be their allies, taking action to end this today. This is not a situation that we can simply take note of and move on.\" Middle East Minister Alistair Burt said the UK is committed to tackling the problem head on.\"Eradicating modern slavery is one of our top foreign policy priorities,\" he said. According to Burt, the UK is doubling its aid spending on modern slavery and launching a \u00a375 million ($100 million) migration program to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants traveling from West Africa to Libya and to \"assist those along the way who may wish to return home.\"While some speakers, including Burt, focused on the need to end mass migration from sub-Saharan Africa, others criticized the UK government for failing to provide safe, legal migration routes for Africans hoping to reach Europe, arguing that this leaves them vulnerable to traffickers. \"The EU goes to great lengths to stop migrants coming into its territory, including even training the Libyan coastguard to stop boats reaching Italy,\" said Law. \"As part of the EU, the UK is complicit with the EU's push to tighten its borders.\"JUST WATCHEDMigrants being sold as slavesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMigrants being sold as slaves 06:49Europe is 'complicit'The release of the slave auction footage last month sparked protests and outrage around the world. Nigerians return home with a warning to others: Don't go to LibyaUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was horrified at the reports, which could amount to crimes against humanity, and called on the international community to unite on the issue. The UN Security Council later called for \"all relevant authorities to investigate such activities without delay,\" saying the acts amount to \"heinous abuses of human rights.\"Individual nations added their voices, too. Spain's Foreign Ministry expressed \"deep concern\" over the report, while French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to press for sanctions. In response to the global condemnation, Libyan officials denounced the slave auctions but claimed more support was required from the international community to tackle the issue.\"Addressing this phenomenon exceeds the national capacities,\" said the United Nations-backed Libyan Government of National Accord.

In a report published on December 12, Amnesty International accused European governments of being complicit in the torture and abuse of migrants and refugees in Libya. \"Tens of thousands (of refugees and migrants) are kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centers where they are subjected to systematic abuse,\" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe director.\"European governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses; by actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these abuses.\"Amnesty called on the EU to end what it called a \"policy of containment\" and instead establish \"pathways\" to bring the migrants and refugees to Europe safely.CNN's Hilary Clarke and Lauren Moorhouse contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Oxford Dictionaries has crowned \"youthquake\" as its word of 2017 in a nod to the unexpected level of youth engagement in this summer's election in the United Kingdom. An amalgamation of \"youth\" and \"earthquake\", the noun is defined as \"a significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young people.\"The word was coined in the 1960s by then-Vogue editor, Diana Vreeland, to describe upheavals in fashion and music caused by Britain's youth culture.Diana Vreeland was editor of Vogue US between 1963-1971 and coined the term 'youthquake'.But an almost five-fold resurgence in usage of the word was seen between 2016 and 2017 in a different context -- as a result of surprisingly high youth participation in June's election.Predictions of a big victory for Theresa May's Conservative Party before the election were based partly on assumptions that most young people wouldn't vote. Read MoreBut high youth turnout in favor of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party helped the opposition party gain seats at the expense of the Conservatives, who lost their majority in Parliament. Millennial voters campaigned extensively for Corbyn, hosting grime events and sharing memes on social media. Grime artist JME campaigned for Corbyn this summer.The word \"youthquake\" was also used in New Zealand to describe increasing youth engagement in politics there, according to Oxford Dictionaries. The country's new Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, is the world's youngest female leader at 37. Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Dictionaries, described the term as a less obvious choice for Word of the Year in a statement, but asserted it to be the right one, calling it a \"word on the move.\"\"At a time when our language is reflecting a deepening unrest and exhausted nerves, it is a rare political word that sounds a hopeful note. Hope that our polarized times are creating a more open-minded electorate that will exercise its voice in the times ahead,\" she wrote.The other words in this year's shortlist were: \"antifa,\" \"broflake,\" \"newsjacking,\" \"white fragility,\" \"gorpcore,\" \"kompromat,\" \"Milkshake Duck,\" and unicorn.  Angus Stevenson, Head of Content Development for Oxford Dictionaries, told CNN: \"We also felt it struck a more positive note than some of the other words on the shortlist -- as Casper said, it's great to have a word we can rally behind.\"Some people took to Twitter to express surprise over the choice. 'Youthquake' is the Oxford Dictionary word of the year. Kind of ironic, given that 2017 didn't belong to young people who care about the future. It was dominated by miserable old sods who want to plunge us back into their fantasy of what the past was like.\u2014 Michael Moran (@TheMichaelMoran) December 15, 2017\n\n\"Surely you've remembered the word 'youthquake'?

Oriol Junqueras -- whose pro-independence party, the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), is narrowly leading most polls -- is in a Madrid prison awaiting trail on charges of sedition and rebellion over his role in the referendum.The deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, is in Brussels to avoid facing the same fate as Junqueras: a possible jail term of up to 30 years.In\u00e9s Arrimadas from the Ciutadans party is leading the anti-independence side, campaigning to put an end to the independence movement altogether.An electronic campaign poster of In\u00e9s Arrimadas, lead candidate for the anti-independence  Ciutadans party, at the Barcelona Sants train station.For Rosario Caceres, there isn't much choice. She told her grandson, 35-year-old David Rosello, that she was not necessarily against independence, but that it just didn't seem financially viable. Rosello told her he wasn't so worried about the economic implications.\"Madrid's treatment of us couldn't get any worse,\" he said. \"I'm ready to try something new.\"How did Catalonia get here?JUST WATCHEDHundreds injured in Spain after referendumReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHundreds injured in Spain after referendum 01:05Rosello was referring in part to violent scenes of Spanish police firing rubber bullets at relatively calm protesters and pulling elderly voters by the hair from polling booths.The police crackdown on the October 1 referendum prompted outrage that such violence was going on in modern-day Europe. It also fueled the independence movement's narrative that Catalonia is oppressed by Madrid.The Catalans' frustrations are not completely unfounded. In 2010, the Popular Party (PP) \u2014 which now rules the country \u2014 challenged Catalonia's status as a nation within Spain in the Constitutional Court. The party won that case and when the PP came into power, it began rolling back the autonomous region's powers.It has overturned several laws passed by the Catalan Parliament, including a ban on bullfighting, arguing that the Parliament was overstepping its authority and putting Spanish culture at risk.Read more: A political crisis is scaring tourists away from BarcelonaCatalans now mock Madrid as a strict parent that always says \"No.\" Madrid has said it is open to dialogue with Barcelona, but only if independence is off the table.The independence movement picked up steam after that 2010 case, which came amid the economic woes of the global financial crisis.Before that turning point, only around 20% of people supported independence, when given four options with varying degrees of autonomy, according to Catalonia's Center for Opinion Studies. Support for independence peaked at 49% in 2013 but has now come down to below 40% with the four-way option.But when given a simple binary choice on independence, 48.7% say they want Catalonia to break away from Spain, while 43.6% do not. The rest are undecided.  Many people argue that Madrid would have been smarter to simply allow the referendum. It would almost certainly have won if it ensured that there were more than two options on the ballot.Has the independence movement blown it?   Carles Puigdemont, center, addresses Catalan mayors in Barcelona after Parliament declared unilateral independence on October 27. Oriol Bartomeus, a professor in politics at the Barcelona Autonomous University, suggests the movement has lost steam since the Catalan Parliament unilaterally declared independence in late October.Madrid responded by firing the entire government, dissolving the Catalan Parliament and imposing direct rule over the region.\"It is clear that support for the independist camp is not going up but that they are just maintaining the vote. That means they don't have 50% of the vote, and without 50% of the vote, they cannot push their agenda of independence, no matter what the Spanish state says,\" he said.Current polling numbers are almost identical to those just before the last election in 2015, in which pro-independence parties won just under half the seats and were forced into a coalition to take power.But in such divisive elections, polls can get it wrong. One notable trend is the steady rise of the anti-independence Ciutadans party. Led by 36-year-old Arrimadas, the party threatens to knock one of the two pro-independence groups from the top two spots. If Ciutadans continues its rise, the party could even gain the most seats. In Catalan politics, no single party is ever really expected to win an outright majority and elections are generally followed by weeks, if not months, of negotiations. And regardless of who wins the most seats on December 21, the question of who will be the next President is another matter entirely. After the 2015 election, Puigdemont was propelled to the presidency in a last-minute coalition deal.A crackdown on all things yellow?Firefighters place their helmets to form the shape of a giant yellow ribbon in Barcelona on November 20 to call for the release of jailed separatist activists.The bickering between Madrid and Barcelona has taken odd turns in this campaign, the latest one over the color yellow.Independence supporters are using the color to call for the release of jailed politicians and activists, but Madrid has complained that yellow has become politicized and is being used by public bodies that should be neutral. The country's electoral board \u2014 which goes by the name of the Junta Electoral in Spanish, but is called simply the Junta by its critics \u2014 has banned Barcelona from bathing its fountains in yellow light after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party complained about it.The city began illuminating the fountains with yellow after the president of the pro-independence Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Jordi Sanchez, was imprisoned, along with \u00d2mnium Cultural's leader Jordi Cuixart, for helping organize the referendum. The two civil-society groups work closely with the pro-independence parties.The board has also banned election officials from wearing yellow ties on election day, and yellow is prohibited on all public buildings, as are any symbols showing support for those in prison.Read more: These banks and businesses are leaving CataloniaTensions are high and anger is easily roused. On Monday, scuffles broke out between the people of Lleida, west of Barcelona, and police who began seizing disputed artifacts from a museum there.The neighboring region of Arag\u00f3n also claims the medieval artifacts as theirs, and Madrid used its special temporary powers over Catalonia to order the removal.   In Girona, at the epicenter of the independence movement, the electoral board has also picked a fight with the City Hall.The Girona City Hall bears a banner reading \"Freedom of Expression\" in Catalan.The Junta Electoral forced the building to remove a banner reading: \"Free Our Political Prisoners.\" In response, City Hall has replaced it with another, reading: \"Freedom of Expression.\"\"Because who can argue with that?\" an official wearing a yellow ribbon said to CNN.What happens next?Carles Puigdemont addresses supporters at a campaign event on December 4.Meanwhile, Puigdemont has  been speaking at his campaign events by teleconference, beamed in from Brussels onto giant screens.He has vowed to return to Catalonia if he wins on December 21, but speculation is beginning to swirl that he may return sooner.Junqueras is writing regular impassioned letters and notes from jail as his team portrays him to voters as Madrid's political prisoner.Elsa Artadi, who is running for a seat and is a spokeswoman for Puigdemont's Together for Catalonia campaign, said it had been incredibly difficult to promote the former president and his slate of candidates.\"We can't compete with these unequal conditions,\" she told CNN at the campaign headquarters in Barcelona.In the Catalan parliamentary system, a leader fields a list of candidates who are given a number in order of priority. Puigdemont's list has him at number one and at number two is Sanchez, who was imprisoned as leader of the ANC civil-society group.\"Our number one is in Brussels, our number two is in prison, our number three is in Brussels, our number four was in jail until a week ago. So that makes it very difficult logistically,\" Artadi said.Ernest Maragall, who is running for a seat with Junqueras' ERC party, also complains of an uneven playing field.\"We are playing a lot of basketball, but only with one arm,\" he said. Our number one is in Brussels, our number two is in prison... So that makes it very difficult logistically.Elsa ArtadiBartomeus, from the Barcelona Autonomous University, said that playing up the fact that crucial leaders in prison or abroad is an attempt to create a martyr effect.\"That's because the independist campaign is based on the idea that Spain is not a democratic state but an authoritarian one,\" he said. \"You don't even have to say it, you just have to remind your voters that your leaders are in prison. And that is a very clear message.\"While there is anger about the imprisonments, it isn't necessarily translating to more votes.With less than a week left to go and polls refusing to budge, someone will have to have something extraordinary up their sleeve to swing the balance. Otherwise both the people of Catalonia and the rest of Spain may find themselves where this all began, their wounds unhealed.",

It lasted just over an hour. Members of the Kensington and Chelsea council, which was responsible for the management of the building, did not attend after mourners requested they stay away. At the end of the service, a Grenfell banner was held aloft and carried out of the cathedral, followed by mourners, who held white roses and photographs of their loved ones.Read MoreMourners leave St. Paul's Cathedral in London following the service Thursday.\"It was uplifting, but it was very sad as well,\" Nelissa Mendy, who lost her cousin at Grenfell, told CNN.\"There are still no words. I'm struggling for words but I'm really glad there's an acknowledgment. There's still a lot of pain and a lot of unanswered questions but the service itself was comforting if that's the right word.\"With those who were here today -- national leaders and people like that it was just,  I guess, a recognition of national support for Grenfell, families, victims all the support workers. \"For those that still don't have closure -- this may have gone some way to try and help but ... I can't find the words.\"A government-ordered inquiry into the fire is still underway and many of those who lost their homes remain in temporary accommodation.According to a report published by the government, of the 395 households affected by the fire, 300 were living in hotels, 75 were in apartments, nine were living with friends and family on a temporary basis, and 11 had found new permanent accommodation by the end of September.Mourners arrive at St Paul's cathedral for a Grenfell Tower national memorial service.Speaking at the memorial, Bishop of Kensington, the Right Reverend Graham Tomlin, told the survivors and families of the victims that they had not been forgotten.\"As we come to the end of this difficult year, as we celebrate Christmas, as we move into a new year, nothing can remove the memory of that night, nor do we want to forget those dearly loved people who were lost,\" he said'It's very, very hard'About 1,500 people gathered inside the cathedral for the multi-faith ceremony that included performances from a number of groups close to Grenfell.A prerecorded montage of voices from the local community was also played during the service.\"We were lost for words, we did not know what to do, how to react. I have never known anything like it in my life,\" one voice said.Maria Jafari, whose father Ali Yawar Jafari, died at Grenfell, read a poem by 13th century poet Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi.\"It's very, very hard,\" Jafari told the UK Press Association. \"Still she (my mother) cries, every day, every second when we are talking about our father, all the memories come out again.\"It's six months and it's still very hard for us. I wish nobody could have this in the whole life, in the whole world, I wish nobody would have to go through all these things.\" 'Criminal investigation'Earlier on Thursday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said it would be unlikely that the criminal investigation into the deadly blaze would be concluded until 2019.Speaking to CNN's affiliate ITN, Dick said the investigation had gathered 30 million documents, identified thousands of physical exhibits, and had conducted thousands of interviews.\"We will move as quickly as we possibly can whilst doing a very, very thorough investigation -- using all the expertise that is available to us. We are working closely now with the Crown Prosecution Service and we will move as fast as we possibly can,\" she said.\"But I would be very surprised if our criminal investigation was finished, for example, by the end of the next calendar year.\"",

At the Norwegian Embassy in Britain's capital, Norway's men's and women's captains -- Stefan Johansen and Maren Mjelde -- and representatives of the Norwegian Football Association (NFF) and Norway's players' association (NISO) signed an agreement on equal pay in a deal thought to be the first of its kind in international football.

Parity was achieved after the 550,000 kroner ($60,000) Norway's male players receive for commercial activities was switched to the women's team.\"I am proud to be a Norwegian football player,\" Norway captain Maren Mjelde said in a statement issued on the Norwegian FA's website.

        "content": "London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Theresa May headed to Brussels on Thursday for a major summit of EU leaders, just hours after her government suffered an embarrassing defeat in Parliament in a vote on key Brexit legislation.Lawmakers backed an amendment to the Brexit bill that means the UK Parliament must be given a vote on the final deal with the European Union before withdrawal begins.The narrow defeat -- by 309 to 305 votes -- was May's first as Prime Minister and leaves her in a weakened position at home as she travels to an EU Council meeting in the Belgian capital, during which the bloc's other 27 leaders are set to confirm that Brexit negotiations can move on to to the next stage.May's setback came less than a week after the UK and EU secured a significant breakthrough in Brexit negotiations.That breakthrough, in which the two sides agreed on the terms for Britain's withdrawal, opened the door for the two parties to progress onto a second phase that will include discussions over a transition period and the nature of a future trading relationship -- both crucial to Britain's economy.Read MoreMay, who leads a minority Conservative government since a snap election called last summer, has had to battle bitter divisions within her own party over Brexit -- as well as pressure from opposition parties and business leaders -- as she seeks to negotiate Britain's departure from the EU.Arriving in Brussels for the two-day summit, European Council President Donald Tusk said: \"Tomorrow we will end formally our first phase of the Brexit negotiations. \"Both these achievements demanded courage, realism, but above all our unity. By the way, I have no doubts, the real test of our unity will be the second phase of the Brexit talks.\"May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reached a milestone in Brexit talks last week.'Meaningful vote' Amendment seven to clause nine of the EU withdrawal bill was put forward by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who led a faction of rebels within May's party who demanded a \"meaningful vote\" on the deal reached with Brussels before it is ratified. JUST WATCHEDUK, EU reach breakthrough Brexit agreementReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUK, EU reach breakthrough Brexit agreement 01:53The bill is a key piece of legislation that aims to transfer EU law into UK law upon the country's planned departure from the bloc on March 29, 2019.On Wednesday morning, as the government sought to head off the rebellion, Brexit Secretary David Davis submitted a written statement to the House of Commons in which he promised lawmakers a vote on the deal. The government then offered another concession later in the Commons debate.But the small group of Conservative rebels stuck to their guns to vote alongside opposition Labour and Liberal Democrat lawmakers in favor of the amendment, which gives a legal guarantee that Parliament will be able to vote on the deal before it comes into effect. Grieve had argued that without the amendment, the bill would give ministers powers to implement the deal without proper scrutiny from lawmakers.A spokesman for the government said it was disappointed that Parliament had voted for the bill despite the \"strong assurances\" it had offered. \"We are as clear as ever that this bill, and the powers within it, are essential,\" he said. \"This amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day. We will now determine whether further changes are needed to the bill to ensure it fulfills its vital purpose.\"Corbyn: 'Humiliating loss'Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described the defeat as \"a humiliating loss of authority for the Government on the eve of the European Council meeting\" in a statement on his Facebook page.\"Labour has made the case since the referendum for a meaningful vote in Parliament on the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union,\" he wrote. \"Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Her refusal to listen means she will now have to accept Parliament taking back control.\"The government faces another potential showdown next week over an amendment of its own to the withdrawal bill that seeks to enshrine in law that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union at 11 p.m. GMT on March 29, 2019.Critics argue that this would leave no flexibility at the end of the negotiating process.CNN's Lindsay Isaac and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.",

Over the years, Mancias has become inseparable from James, who once dubbed him \"one of the best trainers in the world.\" He has shadowed him during All-Star breaks, Olympic duties and, crucially, his grueling offseason workouts.

It's my drug!! #StriveForGreatness A post shared by LeBron James (@kingjames) on Jul 12, 2016 at 12:45pm PDT Mancias, who completed degrees in health education and kinesiology before being certified as an athletic trainer, is primarily employed by the Cavaliers with responsibilities towards the entire roster -- a point he repeats often during this rare interview.But the fact that he works with James outside of club duties can be a tricky situation for all parties if mishandled -- especially given the enormous stakes involved. \"I think the number one thing is communication,\" he explains.\"These teams, these owners, these general managers, they are the ones investing millions upon millions of dollars in these players' contracts, and so we want to make sure that they are in the right hands of someone with knowledgeable credentials.\" During James' annual summer workouts in Los Angeles, Mancias often reports back to the Cavaliers' strength and conditioning coach, head athletic trainer and general manager on their star's progress, explaining that \"all three of those people need to be in the loop.\"\"This relationship is 14 years in the making,\" says Mancias. \"(The Cavs management) know that we are tight, we're close, and they know that he's in good hands.\"  Photos: NBA Finals: Warriors win second title in 3 yearsThe Golden State Warriors celebrate with the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy after winning Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Monday, June 12.

Mancias, in fact, got his start as a summer intern for Grover, who was hired by Jordan to get the then-38-year-old in shape for his comeback from retirement with the Washington Wizards. At that point in Jordan's career, the familiarity and trust he had established with Grover during his six-title run with the Chicago Bulls -- which encompassed a brief switch to professional baseball and the death of his father -- led him to seek assistance outside of the Wizards organization.\"He was there through the ups and downs,\" Mancias says of Grover, who was not available for an interview for this article. \"A lot of times players feel like, 'Hey I'm an individual, I'm not your property, I can do what I want,' so they feel comfortable with someone, that's fine,\" he explains. \"That someone just has to be great at communicating, that's the bottom line.\"I think all teams, to be honest with you, would prefer that players stick to their own strength coaches or athletic trainers, but we're in a day and age where every player on the bench can hire a personal trainer for the summer basically to be on call 24/7. \"It's a lot easier, and there is a comfort level as well when you have your own guy,\" he adds. \"Everyone wants individual attention, individual care, and I don't blame them.\"Mancias would know.  When James famously bolted from Cleveland to Miami in 2010 there was no immediate opening for Mancias on the Heat's staff, and in the interim he worked directly with the player on the superstar's payroll.Nervous of being seen as a distraction, Mancias called the Heat's head athletic trainer once he became aware of the move.\"I'm not here to be a sideshow,\" he said. The gesture was appreciated, and the Heat hired Mancias the following season. \"Things went really smoothly because we all communicated, and I was on the same page,\" he recalls. \"It was about winning championships for him, not for me.\"  Photos: The most eye-catching tattoos in sportPerhaps the man who started the trend. Former Manchester United midfielder David Beckham was one of the first high-profile footballers to make tattoos a fashion statement. His first was in 1999 to mark the birth of his first child, Brooklyn. The 42-year-old is reported to now have more than 40 tattoos.Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: The most eye-catching tattoos in sportAll an illusion? During his time with Paris Saint-Germain, Zlatan Ibrahimovic removed his top to unveil a torso covered in ink. The Manchester United striker revealed this year that, at the time, he had 15 removable tattoos on his body which were \"names of real people who are suffering from hunger.\" Those tattoos have now gone, but there's still plenty of ink left on Zlatan. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: The most eye-catching tattoos in sportCleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James is another major athlete with major art work on his body.

Hide Caption 16 of 16After James and the Heat earned two titles in Miami, he returned to Cleveland in 2015. Mancias, of course, went with him and the Cavs welcomed him with open arms. A season later James would lead the Cleveland to its first championship in 52 years in a seven-game Finals classic against the Golden State Warriors.James completed the most statistically dominant performance in Finals history, posting series highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, block and minutes played, with Mancias overseeing his intricate recovery process between games. During flights after particularly grueling games, Mancias has reportedly used a combination of an electro-stimulation machine, air-pumped compression sleeves, and manual soft tissue massage to quicken James' recovery process.The routine is sandwiched between a pre-flight ice-bath and, once James' has gotten some sleep, a post-flight stationary bike spin. READ: The doctor transforming elite athletes with her all-seeing eyeA throwback in the Instagram eraUnlike Grover, who has authored a series of books, patented his own system and is available for speaking engagements, Mancias says he keeps a low profile \"out of respect to my coworkers and the other athletic trainers who work hard as well.\"\"It's not about me,\" he explains. \"I'm a chef at a restaurant, I don't own my own restaurant.\" It's also a way of preserving the unwavering trust between him and the NBA's No. 1 superstar. Simply put, Mancias is loath to draw attention to himself based on James' achievements. In the era of social media, he is nothing short of a throwback. Although James regularly posts clips of his workouts to his 34 million followers on Instagram -- provoking good-natured ribbing from his NBA cohorts -- Mancias doesn't appear in them, is not on Instagram, and rarely tweets.<    Core and mind stability!!

        "content": "Story highlightsRussia banned from 2018 Winter OlympicsThe country denies allegations of systematic doping (CNN)Russia's state-sponsored doping program before and during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics hinged on its ability to break into 'tamper proof' bottles and replace tainted urine samples with clean ones so that dopers passed drugs tests.If that's possible, then surely so too is the reverse -- breaking into a bottle and making a clean sample look dirty -- and that is what scares U.S. Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin the most about the scandal which has engulfed sport over the last 18 months.  Follow @cnnsport\n\n\"The most concerning thing for me is that, in my opinion, it would be much easier to make a clean sample look dirty; than a dirty sample look clean,\" said Shiffrin, 22, who became the youngest ever Olympic slalom gold medalist when she took gold in Sochi at the age of 18 years and 345 days.\"They had to go through an extensive process to cheat the system and make their dirty athletes look clean and it's really scary to think that they could take any sample and be like 'oh let's make this look dirty'.\"I suppose it's a little more complicated than that but that's my biggest concern.\"JUST WATCHEDMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secretReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMikaela Shiffrin's snoozy secret 02:50Read MoreREAD: Doping whistleblower urges Russia to come cleanREAD: Russia backs athletes wanting to take part in Winter Olympics'I take it really seriously'The Swiss company, Berlinger, designed the sample bottles so that they could not be opened without breaking the seal but Grigory Rodchenkov -- the whistleblower who claims to have masterminded the Sochi doping operation with the backing of the Kremlin -- revealed that Russia found a way to beat the bottle-locking system.Rodchenkov, who is currently in witness protection in the United States, told the New York Times that his team would pass sealed bottles through \"a hole in the wall\" to Russian intelligence officers, who would take them to a nearby building and, within a few hours, bring them back with the caps loose and unbroken. That allowed Rodchenkov and his team to swap dirty samples for clean ones and reseal the bottle without leaving a trace, a program that helped Russia finish top of the Sochi medal table with 13 gold medals.Russian President Vladimir Putin at Sochi Games alongside then Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko, who has been banned from all future Olympic Games by the IOC\"Everybody tells athletes that these samples have bottle caps that are impossible to break into, that there's no way to break into them and then put them back on. And then we come to find out that they [Russia] figured out a way to cheat that,\" Shiffrin said during an interview with CNN's Alpine Edge.\"For me, I take it really seriously that I want to compete clean and, even if there are other athletes on the circuit who are doping, I would rather be the clean athlete who is able to win anyway or would end up retiring and not winning because it's just impossible to win without doping. That's just sort of my philosophy.\"IOC President Thomas Bach announced Russia's ban from the 2018 Games on December 5'Clean athletes deserve a chance'The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned Russia's Olympic Committee (ROC) from the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang in the wake of the scandal, which IOC President, Thomas Bach, described as \"an unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport\".Since the start of November, 31 Russian athletes have been handed lifetime bans by the IOC and a total of 12 medals have been stripped, which means Russia has dropped from first in the medal table to fourth behind Norway, Canada and the United States.Nevertheless, any Russian athletes who can meet \"strict conditions\" and prove that they are clean and unconnected to the doping program -- which operated between 2011 and 2015 -- will be invited by the IOC to compete under the Olympic flag as an \"OAR\" -- Olympic Athlete from Russia.Russia's ice hockey players attend a meeting of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow deciding how to respond to IOC banSome predicted that Russia's government, which has consistently denied the doping allegations leveled against it, would boycott the Olympics altogether but President Vladimir Putin said that he would not stand in anyone's way.Indeed, Russia's Olympic Committee has offered its unanimous support to any Russian who competes in South Korea, with ROC President, Alexander Zhukov, saying \"more than 200\" of its athletes could still end up going to PyeongChang.Zhukov confirmed that a Russian delegation will travel to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the \"complex questions\" of Russian participation. The President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, offered unanimous support to those wanting to competeThe head coach of the Russian men's ski team, Urban Planinsek, told CNN that he expects the Russian skiers to be allowed to go to the Olympics.\"Our athletes have been tested by independent agencies for some time,\" Planinsek said. \"Therefore they should be clear to participate. We never had any issue in the past seven years that I have been with the team and I do not expect anyone to be banned.\"The U.S. star Shiffrin is a great admirer the slalom skier Alexandr Koroshilov who, in 2015, became the first Russian to win a World Cup event since 1981 and will be an outside chance of a medal under the Olympic flag if he is sanctioned to take part. She welcomes the decision to ban Russia's federation while at the same time allowing clean athletes to compete -- albeit by invitation only -- when the Games get underway in February.Slalom skier Alexandr Khoroshilov is one of 200 Russian athletes still hoping to compete in South Korea \"For sure, there are athletes who are clean,\" said Shiffrin, who is aiming to become the first female skier to defend an Olympic slalom title.\"In Russia and every country, I'm sure there's dirty athletes and clean athletes, and the clean athletes do deserve the chance to compete. \"I think it's a really nice thing that there's the option for Russian athletes under the Olympic flag and it gives them a chance. Just because there are athletes out there who are cheating doesn't mean that everybody has to be punished.\"Mikaela Shiffrin is Olympic and World slalom champion'Four events is enough'Shiffrin is the world's best slalom skier but made headlines at the start of the 2018 ski season by winning the women's downhill at Lake Louise. But, despite that eye-catching victory, she is sticking to her original plan to sit out the downhill in PyeongChang and compete in just four events -- slalom, giant slalom, combined and super-G -- for now at least.  \"I'm not planning to the race the downhill,\" said Shiffrin, who four years ago originally said she wanted to win five golds in 2018.Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & features \"Right now I haven't changed that plan. I think definitely four events is enough to wrap my head around. \"I had a good experience in Lake Louise but I certainly don't expect to be winning every downhill from here on out.\"",

In the past, a horse like Highland Reel might have gone to stud by now but the rewards are now so immense around the world he's still racing.\"You have to have an owner that wants to do that and I was fortunate with Red Cadeaux, Ouija Board and Snow Fairy that I had that.

        "content": "London (CNN)The UK and the European Union reached a significant milestone in their pursuit of a Brexit deal on Friday, breaking a deadlock that allows talks to move on to a crucial second phase.After a dramatic night of shuttle diplomacy that capped months of tortuous negotiations, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the breakthrough at an early morning press conference in Brussels.Crucially, the two sides reached a deal on the historically sensitive issue of the Irish border, which had threatened to derail the talks as they reached a critical moment earlier this week. Discussions can now move on to the  potentially tougher issue of a future trading relationship between the UK and the EU.British Prime Minister Theresa May addresses the media in Brussels.The breakthrough represents a significant coup for May, whose beleaguered premiership had appeared under threat as talks faltered. It was also a relief for EU negotiators, who feared a complete breakdown in talks if a deal was not done.\"Getting to this point required give and take on both sides,\" May said. \"And I believe the joint report that is being published is in the best interest of the whole of the UK.\"Read MoreWhat has been agreed?Agreement has now been reached on three key issues: Britain's Brexit \"divorce\" bill, the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, and the Irish border. When Brexit negotiations began just under six months ago, the EU was clear on its position: It would not countenance any discussion about a future trading relationship with Britain until \"sufficient progress\" had been made on those three issues.Irish border: The Irish question proved the toughest to resolve. The demilitarization of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was a key element of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal that ended years of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland. Now, the border posts are gone and people can move freely around the island of Ireland.But Brexit raised the prospect of a return to a \"hard\" border, as Northern Ireland would leave the EU while the Republic of Ireland remained in the bloc.Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic near Dundalk.Complicating the issue, May's minority government depends on the support of on a small group of 10 MPs from Northern Ireland, members of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). They were adamantly opposed to any suggestion that, to avoid a hard border, Northern Ireland could retain laws and regulations that were more aligned to the EU than the rest of the UK.Deal or no deal: How a day changed BrexitThe DUP vetoed the text of an earlier deal on Monday, just as May was having lunch with Juncker in Brussels to finalize it. She was forced to return to London as negotiators spent the rest of the week hammering out a solution acceptable to the DUP, the Irish government and the EU.The language of the deal announced on Friday remains ambiguous. It says: \"In the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement.\"That's a backstop. It means that, in the next stage of talks, the UK must come up with solutions that avoid a hard border, otherwise the UK will have to remain tied to EU rules even after Brexit. That scenario would enrage the ardent Brexiteers in May's Conservative Party.Divorce bill: Friday's agreement says the UK would be required to continue making contributions to the EU budget up to the end of 2020 \"as if it had remained in the union\".  The report adds that the UK will remain liable for its outstanding financial commitments and liabilities up to December 3, 2020.A spokesman for the UK government put the estimated net cost of the divorce bill at between \u00a335 billion and \u00a339 billion ($47 billion and $52 billion) adding that this estimation \"represents a fair settlement of our obligations.\"Rights of EU citizens after Brexit: EU citizens living in the UK and vice versa will have their rights to live, work and study protected. British courts will enforce the rights but, in a concession to Europe, the UK has agreed that difficult cases can be referred to the European Court of Justice for eight years after Brexit.Late-night dramaDiscussions stretched into the early hours of Monday morning. When it was clear that a deal was done, May and her chief Brexit negotiator David Davis dashed to Brussels for a breakfast meeting with Juncker and other officials.President @JunckerEU welcomes Prime Minister @theresa_may. Working breakfast underway. pic.twitter.com/9mYXCS1FIj\u2014 Margaritis Schinas (@MargSchinas) December 8, 2017\n\nSpeaking alongside Juncker in the Belgian capital, May said the agreement was \"fair to the British taxpayer\" and resolved the outstanding issues of the Irish border. In Northern Ireland we will guarantee there will be no hard border, and we will uphold the (Good Friday Agreement).\" \"No barrier north-south or east-west,\" she said. Juncker said: \"Sufficient progress has now been made on the three terms of the divorce.\" Negotiations for the UK to leave the EU can now proceed to the next stage, he added. If agreement had not been reached on Friday it would have been impossible to prepare for its ratification at a summit of EU leaders on December 14 and 15, he said. \"We had to make the deal today.\"Reaction The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, claimed she had secured \"substantial changes\" to the text she rejected on Monday, adding she was \"pleased\" to see changes which mean there is \"no red line down the Irish Sea\".In a statement, the DUP said it had won clear that commitments from the Conservatives that \"Northern Ireland will leave the single market and the customs union along with the rest of the United Kingdom.\" JUST WATCHEDBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UK 01:48Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that the UK had guaranteed there would be no hard border and that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement had been fully protected. \"It's a very significant day for the island of Ireland,\" he said.Varadkar added that the common travel area, the arrangement that allows citizens to travel freely between Britain and Ireland, would remain in place and that Irish and British citizens would continue to enjoy the same rights after Brexit as they do now.In London, the reaction from May's colleagues was mostly positive. UK environment secretary Michael Gove, one of the leading figures in the Leave camp during the Brexit referendum, said: \"I think it's important to recognize this is a significant personal political achievement for the Prime Minister.\"Theresa May is scrambling to secure the bad Brexit deal she didn't want\"She got a deal in the interests of the whole of the UK, so the integrity of the UK is absolute and paramount,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who has long championed Brexit, criticized May over the deal, claiming the country could now \"move on to the next stage of humiliation.\"Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, warned that the next stage of negotiations would be even tougher.

But the longer City's undefeated streak lasts, the more it will invite comparisons to Arsenal's \"Invincibles\" and, to a lesser extent, the extraordinary Barcelona teams Guardiola managed between 2008 and 2012. In order to remain undefeated, however, City will need a combination of motivation, leadership and plain old luck to complement its exceptional talent, according to football analyst Pat Nevin.\"I don't think that I have enjoyed watching a team more than I have enjoyed watching (City), purely in a creative and artistic way,\" Nevin, who was twice named Chelsea player of the year during his 20-year career, told CNN Sport.\"They are not dissimilar to (Guardiola's) Barcelona in many ways, who probably were the best team that I've ever seen.

One could argue, however, that this City squad is better equipped to sustain injuries than that Arsenal team -- whose league title might have been in doubt if Thierry Henry had been sidelined. Though Arsenal finished the 2004 campaign with a goal difference of 47, Henry and his 30 league goals did most of the heavy lifting. Robert Pires added 14, with three others contributing four goals each.  City appears to have more balance with an abundance of natural goal scorers.

But Stones, not sure you can replace him to the same level.\" Succumbing to pressure One clear disadvantage for City is all the hype that surrounds an undefeated season -- now that the benchmark has been set, says Amy Lawrence, author of \"Invincible, Inside Arsenal's Unbeaten 2003-2004 Season.\" \"The longer it goes on for Man City, the more people will start to ask the question, 'Can they do it?'\" she explains, noting that exactly three years ago people were asking the same of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side who went on to lose away to Spurs on New Year's Day. \"What was very clear from talking to the players from that Arsenal team is that they didn't start thinking about an unbeaten season until pretty close to the end. I just don't think it was on their minds.\"\"The only person whose mind it was on was Arsene Wenger,\" she adds, referring to the Arsenal manager. \"The players just didn't think it was a thing to try to do because it seemed a bit outlandish.\" Photos: Champions League: Round of 16Manchester United \u2013 Jose Mourinho is on a mission to win a third Champions League title with a third different team.

Nevin says that what most impresses him is the way Guardiola stuck to his guns despite criticism after last season. \"I love the purity of the thought that you must attack, you must keep the ball. Creativity seems to be above everything else,\" he says, using praise that has often been attributed to Wenger. \"A lot of people in British football said, 'Oh you can't do that here in the Premier League,'\" he says. \"And there were one or two of us screaming from the sidelines, 'shut up, he's miles ahead of the rest of you.'\"JUST WATCHEDFootball's pioneering woman refereeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFootball's pioneering woman referee 03:15Leadership and luckEvery great team has its leaders, and the \"Invincibles\" were full of them says Lawrence. She names Sol Campbell, Dennis Bergkamp, Henry and Jens Lehmann as examples of different styles of veteran leadership -- though the unquestioned alpha on the team was bruising defensive midfielder Patrick Vieira. The Senegal-born Frenchman had his teammate's backs on the pitch, and organized dinners for the players and their partners off of it. While City may lack as many dominant older personalities, Vincent Kompany stands out as a Viera-like presence.While Kompany is no longer a first team fixture, the City captain \"is a very good people person\" and a true leader who bridges the cultural divide within the club's diverse squad, says Lawrence. \"You absolutely need luck,\" continues Lawrence. \"There were certain defining points that season that had to go a certain way for Arsenal. And I'm convinced that if Man City are fortunate enough to stay in this, they will have similar things to look back on where it could have gone a certain way.\"Lady Luck appeared to be on Arsenal's side early in the season against Manchester United.With the scored tied 0-0 in the 80th minute, United ace Ruud van Nistelrooy's was awarded a controversial penalty and hit the crossbar. The resulting fracas would come to be known as \"The Battle at Old Trafford.\"JUST WATCHEDCopa90: History of the Merseyside derby ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCopa90: History of the Merseyside derby  01:21Who would win?At least one \"Invincible\" who played in that match thinks City have a good shot at equaling Arsenal's achievement.

I think I would have to say that -- no bias,\" he told ESPN.  One thing is certain, whether this City squad does go undefeated or not, it's built to last. \"If I wasn't such a Chelsea fan, I would be desperate for them to win the league,\" says Nevin, before adding a frightening thought for City's opponents. \"I think by next season they will be even better.\"",

The news comes after nearly three weeks of deadlock following the collapse of coalition talks between Merkel's alliance, the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) and the Green Party after federal elections in September.In a bid to avoid the possibility of fresh elections, Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier stepped in to break the deadlock, issuing what Schulz described as a \"dramatic appeal\" for his party to consider coalition talks.Formal talks between the parties are unlikely to start until the new year.",

Her vast potential and power has been evident from an early age. In 2010, Yin won the first of two California State Women's Amateur Championships a month after her 12th birthday -- the same year she was youngest in the field at the US Women's Amateur Championship.At the 2013 Kraft Nabisco Championship, now known as the ANA Inspiration, she ranked second in entire field for driving distance aged 14.Yin, who turned 19 in October, has averaged drives just over 272 yards in 2017  -- only Lexi Thompson (273 yards), Joanna Klatten (278 yards) and Maude-Aimee Leblanc (279 yards) boast a higher average.

Read More'Right thing'Having consistently denied the allegations of a state-backed doping campaign, Russia was banned from PyeongChang 2018 on Tuesday over the country's \"systemic manipulation\" of the rules, following a 17-month investigation carried out by the former president of Switzerland, Samuel Schmid.Russian athletes who can incontrovertibly prove that they are untainted by doping will be \"invited\" to compete at February's Winter Games but won't be allowed to display any national symbols -- something President Vladimir Putin has previously said would be an humiliation. They'll instead compete under the name \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR), and the Olympic anthem will be played at any medal ceremonies for Russian athletes.\"I mean, if even a small percentage of that is true, I would think the IOC did the right thing,\" said Vonn, telling CNN she was \"not surprised\" to learn of the lengths Russia went to in pursuit of victory,\"Obviously there are potential athletes that are clean but they have the option now to compete under a neutral flag, which I think is a good solution.\"JUST WATCHEDVonn: I won't represent Trump at Winter GamesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVonn: I won't represent Trump at Winter Games 01:11READ: Why Vonn won't be representing the US President at the Winter Olympics READ: Lindsey Vonn delves into fashion'Not about the medals'As the scandal rumbles on, the Oswald Commission -- headed by another Swiss, the IOC member Denis Oswald -- is dealing with the specific cases and determining sanctions against individual athletes.It has so far handed out lifetime bans to 25 Russian competitors since the start of November and stripped 11 medals, which means Russia has dropped from first in the Sochi medal table, to fourth behind Norway, Canada and the US.     Richard McLaren, whose reports into Russian doping provided much of the basis for Tuesday's decision, told CNN that the scandal was a \"sad commentary on sport,\" but added that he was pleased his work had been confirmed by the IOC.Putin spoke out against the ruling, telling reporters \"it all looks like an absolutely staged and politically motivated decision.\"But for Vonn and Shiffrin, sport has always been about more than just winning and losing. \"When you're dealing with corruption like that, you don't expect it but at the same time it's not surprising,\" said Vonn. \"Some people would do anything to win medals and bring home gold for their country. There are rules for a reason and some people just don't want to follow them.\"\"The premise of the Olympics is clean, friendly competition but intense and inspiring competition,\" said Shiffrin. \"I mean I know it's about the medals but it's not about the medals in a way.\" Photos: Skiing's speed queenThe world's greatest female ski racer Lindsey Vonn has officially retired from the sport after her final race at the World Championships in Are.

        "content": "Story highlightsMany prominent Russian athletes suggest they will not compete as neutralsVisitors to South Korea are down almost 25% compared to last year (CNN)South Korean Olympic organizers have expressed shock after Russia was banned from taking part in the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Games. The absence of one of the world's major winter sports powers from the competition adds another stress for the hosts, who are already dealing with lackluster ticket sales in the shadow of the ongoing North Korea crisis. Lee Hee-beom, President of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee, said in a radio interview Tuesday he did not expect the International Olympic Committee (IOC) \"to go this far.\" \"We plan to meet with the chairman of the IOC and deliver our message. The message that it's better to allow as many nations, as many athletes to compete,\" he told South Korea's CBS Radio. Evgenia Medvedeva is one of several Russian athletes who indicated they may boycott the Games rather than compete as neutrals. 'Murder of our national sport'Read MoreUnder the IOC's ruling, which found Russia had engaged in \"systemic manipulation\" of anti-doping rules, \"clean\" sportspeople will be able to participate in the Games under the designation \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Lee said the organizing committee respects the IOC's decision, and that allowing Russians to compete in a personal capacity was the next best option, beyond full participation.Some prominent Russian Olympians say they haven't yet decided if they'll compete.Evgenia Medvedeva, a two-time world figure-skating champion, told reporters after the IOC's decision that it was \"too early\" for her to decide whether she would take part. Figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympics events, and the loss of Medvedeva -- widely tipped for a gold medal -- would be a major blow to fans. In a speech to the IOC panel before the ruling came down, Medvedeva seemed to indicate she would not compete as a neutral athlete, saying she \"could not accept\" that option. \"I am proud of my country, it is a great honor for me to represent it at the Games,\" she said. \"It gives strength and inspires me during the performances.\"Medvedeva told panel members as a \"clean\" athlete she never dreamed she could be banned from the Olympics.\"In 2014, I was 14 years old. I had not even entered the adult national team of my country,\" she said. For me personally, Pyeongchang should be the first chance to plunge into the unique atmosphere of the Olympic Games. I do not understand why my Russian teammates and I can lose this chance.\"Other Russian athletes have reacted similarly. According to state-run broadcaster RT, Irina Avvakumova, a member of the ski jumping team, said she \"did not prepare for so many years just to go and compete without representing my country.\" Figure skating trainer Tatiana Tarasova called the IOC's decision to ban the Russian team \"the murder of our national sport.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously said it would be a humiliation to compete without any national symbols.

Organizers are also likely concerned about a drop in Russian spectators in the stands. According to statistics from the Korea Tourist Organization (KTO), around 18,000 Russian tourists visited South Korea in October, more than any other non-Asian nation except for the US and almost 10,000 more than the next European country. Russia hosted the last Winter Olympics, at Sochi in 2014, a competition which \"restored Russia's status as a leading winter sports nation,\" according to a 2015 IOC report, and many could have been expected to attend next year's event. The loss of Russian spectators at the Games could be a big blow to the Winter Olympics, which have typically attracted fewer attendees than the Summer Games. Lagging ticket sales for the Pyeongchang Games appeared to improve in November, hitting 52%, slightly better than Sochi at the same period.Organizers told CNN they had seen a spike in domestic sales after a concert to promote 100 days until the Games, and the subsequent torch relay. Tourism to South Korea has already been negatively impacted by ongoing tensions with North Korea, which have cast a shadow over the Games, with most of the venues situated just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the border and tensions with Pyongyang dominating coverage of the country in a key period for Olympics marketing. Visits to South Korea in October were down 25% on the same period last year, according to KTO. The country's tourism industry took a big hit earlier this year as China boycotted South Korea over the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system.

Keeler was 75.\"As many of you know my mother, Christine Keeler, fought many fights in her eventful life, some fights she lost but some she won,\" he wrote. \"She earned her place in British history but at a huge personal price. We are all very proud of who she was.\"Platt told the Guardian that Keeler died in a hospital in Farnborough, a town east of London.The Profumo AffairRead MoreIn 1961, Keeler was a 19-year-old cabaret dancer in London when she was introduced to John Profumo. He was the secretary of war, in his mid-40s, and a rising star in Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's government. Keeler and Profumo began an affair while she was seeing Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet military attache. Profumo's relationship with Keeler came to light after police investigated an incident involving Keeler.A former lover of hers fired a gun into a home where she had sought refuge, according to The New York Times. A subsequent police investigation and court proceedings drew out details of her liaison with Profumo.Initially, Profumo tried to tamp down rumors of an affair. He told members of Parliament in 1963 that there had been no impropriety in his relationship with Keeler. As rumors spread, and more details were revealed, particularly the possibility that state secrets might have been exposed through Keeler's relationship with the Russian, Profumo confessed to his wife and then to the Cabinet. He resigned that year. Unable to contain the fallout of the scandal, MacMillan resigned months later. In the national election that followed in 1964 the Tories were defeated by the opposition Labour Party, and its leader Harold Wilson became the next prime minister of the country.As the scandal filled newspapers and captivated the country, Keeler posed for photographer Lewis Morley. He created an iconic portrait of the doe-eyed brunette sitting, apparently naked, astride a chair. The photo became the defining image of the scandal.A private lifeWhile Profumo continued to live in the public eye, and was eventually named a Commander of the British Empire for his philanthropy, Keeler was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for making false statements about a different relationship caught up in the Profumo Affair scandal. She served six months in prison.Christine Keeler stands outside her home in Linhope Street, north west London, shortly after her release from prison on June 9, 1964.Keeler later published several books, including a memoir called The Truth at Last, with journalist Douglas Thompson. The book was updated in 2012, after Profumo's death. The Guardian reported that Keeler lived under the name of Sloane for many years and married twice, both ending in divorce. She had two children.",

A second man, Mohammed Aqib Imran, 21, from Birmingham, appeared in court at the same time, also charged with \"the intention of committing acts of terrorism.\" When asked about his nationality in court, Imran said he was Bangladeshi British.According to court documents, Rahman planned to detonate an explosive device at the gates of Downing Street and then seek to gain access to No. 10 -- May's official residence -- \"in the ensuing chaos with a view to trying to kill the Prime Minister.\"\"The secondary attack on No. 10 was to be carried out with a suicide vest, pepper spray and a knife,\" the document said.

The Texas shooting wasn't. Here's why In a related allegation, Imran is accused of trying to obtain a fake passport in order to leave the UK and travel to Libya.On his arrest, Imran was found in possession of a short video recorded by Rahman \"who was sponsoring Imran in order to assist him to enter Islamic State and fight,\" according to the allegations.Rahman allegedly made the video in November \"with the expectation of becoming a martyr.\" The recording would have given Imran greater credibility with the terrorist organization, the document said. Lawyers for both Rahman and Imran entered \"no indication\" as the suspects' plea, meaning that the case continues as if they had pleaded \"not guilty.\"Both suspects have been remanded in custody without bail and will next appear in court on December 20. The news of the arrests emerged just a few hours after the publication of an official security review, which said that 20 Islamist-inspired terrorist plots had been \"disrupted\" since October 2013, seven of them since the end of March this year.The UK terror threat from Islamist terrorists is operating \"at a scale and pace we've not seen before,\" said Andrew Parker, director general of MI5, in a speech in October. He warned that \"the challenge that we face is undoubtedly a stark one. More threat, coming at us more quickly, and sometimes harder to detect. But it is a challenge that we and our partners are rising to and are facing down.\"This court artist sketch shows Mohammed Aqib Imran, left, and  Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman in the dock at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Wednesday.Over 500 counterterrorism investigationsThirty-six people have been killed in five separate terror attacks in the UK this year.

Now it is time to look ahead to Pyeongchang.\"The IOC stressed that \"due process\" was followed this time, something they claim was impossible prior to the Rio summer Olympics in 2016, when they did not ban Russia and, instead, left it to individual sports' governing bodies to decide. Bach and the rest of the IOC executive board spent most of Tuesday analyzing the findings of the Schmid Commission, one of two commissions set up by the IOC in the wake of the 2016 reports by Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren.     The 17-month investigation carried out by the former president of Switzerland, Samuel Schmid, was tasked with looking at whether or not the Russian government and authorities had played a part in covering up doping of the country's athletes during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Schmid's report confirmed \"the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia.\"Separately, the parallel Oswald Commission -- headed by another Swiss, the IOC member, Denis Oswald -- is dealing with the specific cases and determining sanctions against individual athletes. It has so far handed out lifetime bans to 25 Russian competitors since the start of November and stripped 11 medals, which means Russia has dropped from first in the Sochi medal table, to fourth behind Norway, Canada and the USA.     McLaren's original reports last year, which were commissioned by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), unearthed what he described as a \"cover-up that operated on an unprecedented scale\" in Russia between 2011 and 2015 -- a systematic doping scheme across summer and winter sports that benefited more than 1,000 athletes.The findings were based on the testimony of the primary whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov, the eccentric former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, who was immortalized in the Netflix documentary \"Icarus.\"CheatingRodchenkov, who fled Russia in 2015 to seek refuge in the United States where he is currently enrolled in a witness protection program, claimed to have masterminded the doping and evasion infrastructure that peaked at the Sochi games.Go to CNN.com/sport for more stories & featuresHe alleged the whole thing was backed by the Russian government and that members of the FSB -- Russia's intelligence agency -- were directly involved in the manipulation of samples. However, the Kremlin has consistently denied state involvement and has issued an arrest warrant for Rodchenkov, who they claim acted alone in administering the drugs to coaches and athletes, who themselves did not know they were taking performance enhancing substances.\"Today's decision by the International Olympic Committee sends a powerful message that it will not tolerate state-sponsored cheating by any nation,\" said Rodchenkov's lawyer Jim Walden in a statement.\"Dr. Rodchenkov provided credible and irrefutable evidence of the Russian state-sponsored doping system, which was ultimately supervised and financed by then-Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko and other high-level government officials.\" In 2018, Russia will host the World Cup, but football's world governing body FIFA said in a statement that the IOC's decision \"has no impact on the preparations\" for the tournament.CNN's Sebastian Shukla contributed to this report from Moscow.",

        "content": "London (CNN)Former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson once famously opined that a week was a long time in politics. For today's incumbent, Theresa May, the past 24 hours must have felt even longer.When May traveled to Brussels on Monday, it was in the expectation that she would sign a historic agreement with European Union leaders that would enable Brexit talks to move on to a crucial new stage -- the nature of a future relationship between Europe and the UK.The timetable was tight: The remaining 27 EU nations are set to meet on December 14 and 15 to decide if \"sufficient progress\" has been made to move on to the second phase of negotiations. Even though Britain doesn't leave the EU until 2019, businesses want clarity now so they can make crucial investment decisions.So the choreography was set: a working lunch with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, followed by a meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk and capped off with a triumphant statement to the House of Commons in London on Tuesday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, right, greets British Prime Minister Theresa May in Brussels.It didn't quite work out like that. May relies for support in the UK Parliament from a small but hardline party in Northern Ireland -- the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). And when the DUP's 10 members of Parliament got wind of the language in May's deal around the arcane but historically significant issue of the Irish border, they had something of a public meltdown. May was forced to abandon her plans and return to London.Read MoreMay insisted later that there were merely a \"couple of issues\" that remained outstanding and that she was confident a deal could be done soon. But as the dust settled on Tuesday, it was clear from the previous day's breakneck developments in London, Brussels and Dublin that the contours of a final Brexit deal had fundamentally changed.What's on the table?When Brexit negotiations began just under six months ago, the EU was clear on its position: It would not countenance any discussion about a future relationship with Britain until \"sufficient progress\" had been made on three issues: that Britain pay a substantial \"divorce bill;\" that rights of European citizens in the UK are guaranteed; and that there is no reinstatement of a border infrastructure between Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with the rest of Britain in March 2019, and the Irish republic, which remains in the EU. After tortuous negotiations, the two sides were close on the first two issues, in particular after the UK agreed to make a substantial payment to the EU budget, leaving the Irish border as the final stumbling block.Town at center of Brexit tug-of-war fears border changesIt is a historically delicate issue: The dismantling of border controls and infrastructure was a key plank of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after years of sectarian conflict. Finally, on Monday morning, negotiators appeared to have found common ground. The UK would guarantee that Northern Ireland would continue to be aligned with EU laws and regulations that, if they diverged, would require checks at the border.Unfortunately for May, the text leaked. Members of the DUP -- which devotes its entire energy to preserving the union between Britain and Northern Ireland and opposes any suggestion that its laws and regulations could be hitched to those of Dublin -- were furious. JUST WATCHEDBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UKReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit showdown bringing uncertainty to UK 01:48May was forced to return to London and try to placate the DUP.Her calculation appears to be that the DUP will fall in line. After all, can the party afford to risk the \u00a31.5 billion funding deal for Northern Ireland that it struck with May upon agreeing to support her government?And if the DUP withdrew its support from May and left the possibility open for another general election, would it risk the election of the Labour Party and its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister? Corbyn has in the past expressed support for Irish nationalist causes, anathema to the DUP.So if she can get past her problems with the DUP, what are the options for May? Unfortunately for her, all are replete with problems.Soft BrexitWhat is it? Under a so-called soft Brexit, the UK would remain in or closely aligned with the EU's customs union and single market. It would ensure that the UK would adhere closely to EU rules and standards, although it would not have a say in how they were agreed on. Theresa May's final Brexit hurdle looks a near impossible leapWhy could it work? Such a stance would be well received in Scotland, Wales and London, whose leaders have already backed it. Most large business leaders would welcome a close relationship with the EU. A \"soft Brexit\" template already exists: four non-EU countries participate in the single market through membership of the European Free Trade Association.Why might it fail? Critics will accuse the government of betraying the people who voted to leave, with this deal effectively allowing the UK to remain in the EU. It would also rile the Brexiters in the Conservative Party who would likely protest against the deal.May's majority in Parliament is thin and she cannot afford to alienate members of her own party without risking a vote of no confidence. In any case, she has already ruled out this option and it seems unlikely that she would reverse course.Hard BrexitWhat is it? A hard Brexit involves cutting as many ties with the EU as possible while maintaining some form of trading relationship. It's what the most ardent supporters of leaving the EU demanded -- that Britain \"takes back control\" of its laws and immigration policies. It would require negotiators to conclude a tailor-made trade deal, and is the most complicated of all the options: It took nine years to forge a trade agreement with Canada.Why might it work? It would please the hardcore Brexiters as it would take the UK out of the customs union and single market while also ensuring the country had full autonomy over its legal system. The option has support from some senior figures in May's cabinet and a small but vocal section of her MPs. Why might it fail? If the UK leaves the customs union and single market, it's hard to see how customs checks would not be required at the Irish border, and a hard border wouldn't pass muster with the government in Dublin. It also seems likely that such an option would not command a majority of votes in the House of Commons.Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar wants the UK to make guarantees over the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic.No dealWhat is it?  If talks collapse, and Britain ends up without a trade deal or even a transition arrangement, the logical legal consequence of Britain triggering the Article 50 process of leaving the EU means that it would crash out on March 29, 2019.Theresa May warned to change course over Brexit and Irish borderWhy might it work? In the absence of bespoke trade deals, there is a ready-made framework for world trade: the terms agreed on by the World Trade Organization. Many countries in the world successfully trade with each other on WTO terms. Why might it fail? Theresa May used to insist that \"no deal is better than a bad deal,\" but most business leaders believe WTO terms would be disastrous for British trade. In any case, WTO rules don't cover some crucial areas of pan-European cooperation, such as on security and aviation. It's also highly unlikely MPs would approve leaving the EU without a deal.Staying in the EUWhat is it? If neither \"soft\" nor \"hard\" Brexit can command sufficient support in Parliament, and if MPs refuse to allow a \"no-deal\" Brexit, the only other option would appear to be remaining in the EU.Why might it work? Most legal experts believe the UK could suspend the process of leaving the EU if it wants to. EU leaders have said they would prefer the UK to remain in the bloc. Most business leaders believe leaving the EU would be economically disadvantageous.Why might it fail? Even the most ardent pro-Remain politicians generally accept that Britain is leaving the EU, and the debate is merely about how close a future relationship would be. But the Brexit process has been nothing if not unpredictable, and if no other option is on the table, there is at least a theoretical path to Britain remaining in the EU.British Prime Minister Theresa May (L) and European Council President Donald Tusk are hoping to strike a deal.What will happen now?The European Commission has made it clear that it believes a deal was done. The Irish government's position is the same. The clock is ticking: EU officials say an agreement must be made within days if the UK wants a European summit on December 14 and 15 to agree to move on to trade talks. But all sides are prepared to give May time to square off the 10 MPs of the Democratic Unionist Party. \"The show is now in London,\" one official said.Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Tuesday, British Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted he was \"very confident\" that there would be movement over the coming days. \"We have made a lot of progress over the last weeks,\" he told reporters. \"We have made tremendous steps forward. We are very close, but we are not there yet.\"",

Then, the Air Quality Index (AQI) was over 200, which is considered \"very unhealthy.\"  On Monday morning it was around twice that, what's considered \"hazardous,\" according to the AQI.New Delhi residents have endured dense smog for weeks now that's prompted school closures, partial bans on private cars and a surge in patients at hospitals complaining of chest pain, breathlessness and burning eyes.Captain of Sri Lanka's cricket team, Dinesh Chandimal wears an anti-pollution mask during the cricket match in New Delhi on Sunday, December 3. After Sunday's game in the five-day test, Sri Lankan coach Nic Pothas said some players had become physically ill.Read More\"The match referee was in our change room and the doctors, and Suranga (Lakmal), poor guy, was just continuously vomiting. Doctors were in there as well.  Dhananjaya de Silva was vomiting. It was tough,\" Pothas said, referring to two of the players. The third time play stopped was because Sri Lankan fast bowler Lakmal walked off the field.  \"I mean fast bowling is a very high intensity activity, and you could clearly see that two guys were struggling to perform that activity,\" Pothas said.The match referee was seen getting advice from the doctor, but nevertheless, the game went on, with the majority of the Sri Lankan players resorting to wearing anti-pollution face masks. An Indian woman and her child walk amid heavy smog on a street in New Delhi on December 4, 2017.Flood lights had to be switched on because light readings were so low.  Bharat Arun, India's bowling coach, seemed to downplay the poisonous conditions, saying they weren't too bothered by it. He noted that captain Virat Kohli, who struck a career-best 243, batted for two days without a face mask.\"He didn't need a mask.  We are focused on what we need to do. The conditions are the same for both the teams... I don't think we need to be thinking about what the opposition does. It's their problem to keep their bowlers fit,\" he said in response to reporters' questions about the pollution.Kohli declared the innings on 536 shortly after the match was halted. Match commentators said that could have been because the game was being constantly stopped.\"Our intention was not to halt the play. We wanted to seek clarity of the situation... Safety of our bowlers and our players is paramount,\" Pothas explained. \"The high level of air pollution in Delhi was well-documented, but what happened was a unique and abnormal case. It was not normal the way our players suffered.\"Officiating umpire Nigel Llong, third from right, addresses Sri Lanka's players wearing masks, during a brief break on Sunday's match. In cricket, there aren't a lot of rules regarding pollution.

        "content": "Story highlightsSome in Northern Ireland fear Brexit could lead to border controlsIssue will be discussed in crucial talks MondayMiddletown, Northern Ireland (CNN)Tucked away in the rolling hills of County Armagh in Northern Ireland lies a quiet village called Middletown. Its name couldn't be more apt. That's because Middletown stands amid a Brexit tug-of-war.The reason can be found just yards outside of the village. Here, the Irish border separates Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic. For nearly a century, that boundary has shaped the village's history and its people.During the decades-long sectarian conflict known as The Troubles, a huge British army barracks loomed over the area. Customs officials patrolled the border crossings.A 1998 peace accord ended most of the bombings and kidnappings during a dark period of the country's history that was fueled by a split between unionists who wanted to stay in the United Kingdom and those in the Roman Catholic minority who favored a united Ireland. With that agreement the barracks was torn down, replaced with a housing estate, and crossing the border became seamless.Read MoreNow, local residents fear another change -- a controlled border.A sign on the Irish border warns of a hard border after Brexit.Hard borderBritish Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Monday to meet with European leaders. This marks her deadline to settle three key points that need to be ironed out before Britain quits the European Union: Britain's financial settlement, the rights of EU citizens, and the Northern Irish border. Britain has said it will leave both the single market and customs union when it leaves the bloc in March 2019 -- a move that critics say could lead to a so-called \"hard border,\" with checkpoints  -- something Ireland has indicated it doesn't want. In August, a UK government paper said it favored a border without physical barriers and travel for UK and Irish citizens free of passport controls. Brexit: Is Theresa May's luck about to run out? Finalizing the issue would allow Britain to proceed with talks on its future trading relations with the bloc. When border checks and blocks were removed 20 years ago, trade between the north and south improved. Today an estimated $1.5 billion dollars worth of business flows back and forth between Ireland and the UK each week.Westminster and Brussels feel a long way from Middletown, but the consequences of discussions there could have a profound impact on residents.Trevor Magill runs the post office in Middletown, and knows the importance of cross-border business.\"Sixty to 70% of my business comes from south of the border,\" he tells CNN. \"So, it's the freedom of being able to move across that border freely that impacts on the level of business you are able to do.\"One of the biggest employers in the region is the food company Linwoods Health Foods, which sells items like flaxseed and hemp protein worldwide, as well as bread and milk on both sides of the Irish border.The milk comes from dairy farmers in Northern Ireland and the plastic containers come from a company in the Irish Republic. Linwoods vans cross the border dozens of times a day.John Woods is the company's director, and has been working in the family-owned business for around 50 years. Re-establishing a border with checkpoints would require the business to make big changes.\"We would just have to abandon exports to the south on our dairy and our bakery side, and we would have to look at opening a health food factory in the south, as well,\" he says.Farmer Francie Ward shows CNN's Nic Robertson the border along his road.Invisible lineThe border is a 310-mile meandering, invisible line that cuts through the lush, rolling slopes of the Irish countryside.A few miles outside Middletown that line takes a peculiar twist.  At Ward's Cross, cars motor on one side of the road in the Irish Republic, while cars on the other are travel in Northern Ireland.The crossroads is named for the Ward family. One member of that clan, farmer Francie Ward, says renewed checkpoints could bring a slew of new problems.Theresa May's final Brexit hurdle looks a near impossible leap\"I have land on both sides,\" he tells CNN. \"I don't know what will happen with Brexit.\"Hundreds of small roads like Ward's Cross run across the border. During the decades of sectarian conflict many such routes were blocked, and some were blown up by the British army.  Some Northern Irish lawmakers are warning that a hard border could lead to a return of trouble.May is scheduled to meet Monday with European leaders Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk. Tusk, the European Council president, has insisted that the Ireland border issue be resolved before any Brexit trade discussions can move forward.Traffic crosses the border into Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic next to a poster protesting against a hard brexit near Dundalk on January 30, 2017.Ireland says it is not trying to delay the Brexit process, but wants a detailed plan about how the border would operate. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said Sunday that he was unsure if an agreement on the Northern Ireland border could be managed by Monday's deadline, but he said he hoped that May's meetings in Brussels might lead to agreement. Woods of Linwoods worries more about the long-term economic impact.\"Our success of the peace process was not just the good work done by the peacemakers, but also by increasing employment. Lower unemployment pulls in people who might otherwise see themselves out of the system.\"",

Woods' pain-free comeback at the Hero World Challenge prompted the sport's biggest name to claim he is \"excited\" about the future. Follow @cnnsport\n\nMaking his long-awaited return from a fourth back surgery -- it was his first tournament for 301 days since pulling out the Dubai Desert Classic in February -- Woods posted three sub-70 rounds at the Albany Club in the Bahamas to finish in a tie for ninth place in the 18-man field.He may have finished 10 shots behind winner Rickie Fowler but Woods' eight-under-par total was good enough to beat world No.1 Dustin Johnson, FedEx Cup winner and world No. 3 Justin Thomas and US Open champion Brooks Koepka.Rickie Fowler (right) shot an 11-under-par final round of 61 to win the 2017 Hero World Challenge.Major scheduleRead More.@TigerWoods closed out his return to competitive golf with a 6\u20e38\u20e3 in the final round of the Hero World Challenge. pic.twitter.com/GuqaCjJ0zH\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) December 4, 2017\n\nThe performance lifted Woods from 1,199th to 668th in the world golf rankings, but more crucially, the 41-year-old was swinging freely with no sign of the back pain that has hampered him in recent years.\"I'm excited,\" said Woods, who's had eight long-term injury layoffs for various ailments since winning the last of his 14 majors at the 2008 US Open. \"My expectations are we'll be playing next year. We're going to figure out what's the best way for me to build my schedule for the major championships. \"I don't know what golf courses I'll be playing and what's the best way to go about it. We'll sit down with the whole team and we'll figure it out -- where I'm going to start, how much I'm going to play, rest periods, training cycles, the whole nine yards.\"Tiger Woods plays an approach to the 18th green during the final round of the World Hero Challenge.'Frustrated'Woods, who remains four majors behind Jack Nicklaus' record of 18, had a vertebrae fusion in his lower back in April, and admitted before the Bahamas event that he had no idea how he was going to play.After playing with @TigerWoods in Jupiter, FL, ahead of the Hero World Challenge @RickieFowler knew he would would have to step up his game. pic.twitter.com/4rt9lg0EHt\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) December 4, 2017\n\nBut he twice tied for the lead Friday and wasn't holding back, regularly outdriving his younger playing partners who have taken over the sport in his absence, including Thomas, who is one of the biggest hitters on the PGA Tour with an average of 309.7 yards last season.  \"It's nice to get back out there where I can take it over a couple of corners and extend one on the par 5s,\" said Woods, who joked before the event that his two young children view him as a \"YouTube golfer\" because they never saw him in his pomp.\"I was a little frustrated with my iron game; that has been the hallmark of my career. It's still surprising how far I'm hitting it, and I have to make those adjustments. \"You add in the adrenaline, and you're thinking there is no way you hit it that way. Those are things I have to get a hold of. Overall I am very pleased.\"'And all I get asked about, is Tiger Woods' - PGA Tour player of the year Justin Thomas (left).'Same Tiger'Although this was not a full-field event and it was played on a relatively easy course -- there are five par 5s on the Albany track --  there is a sense there is something different about this latest comeback by Woods, who has won 79 times on the PGA Tour.Miss anything from @TigerWoods return at the Hero World Challenge?We've got you covered. \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/GsePX8kPvG\u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) December 4, 2017\n\nWith the exception of a rough patch during his third round on Saturday -- he was four over for his front nine in windy conditions -- he seemed in control of his game and showed signs of the old magic that made him into what many consider to be the greatest player of all time. \"If you've been asleep for the last eight years and you woke up and the last time you saw Tiger Woods play was in 2009 you'd think, 'what's the big deal? That's exactly the same guy,'\" said Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee after round one. \"This is the best I've seen him swing since before all the injuries and before all that stuff that everybody would rather really not want to talk about.\"His ball speed on one shot was 178 mph, another shot was 180 that's about a 96 mph fastball. That is big league stuff. The last time Tiger played, his clubhead speed was 114 mph. That basically translates to a 10, 12 mph difference in ball speed.\"This is Tiger Woods feeling good, swinging good.\"Woods surprised himself how far he was driving the ball in the Bahamas.'Reasons to be optimistic'Chamblee's bosses at the Golf Channel will no doubt be feeling good and hoping Woods can remain injury free, given that  their viewing figures for day one of the tournament in the Bahamas were up 27% from last year. They were the most-watched cable sports network in the U.S. when Woods teed off on Thursday afternoon.Although the signs are good and Woods claims to be pain free, it could be too soon to say he really is \"back\". This time last year, after carding an impressive 24 birdies at the Hero, he said he felt good heading into the new season, but lasted only three more rounds, missing the cut in California before his back gave way in Dubai.  \"It's exciting, but you have to try and temper it a little bit,\" said his caddie Joe LaCava.\"We felt the same way last year. Let's not get too excited. But you have to like what you see, right? There are more reasons to be optimistic.\" Photos: Tiger Woods: From highs to lowsTiger Woods clinched his fifth Masters and 15th major title with victory at Augusta in April.

Both said they were confident of a deal soon that would allow talks to progress to a future trading relationship.Juncker said that it was not possible to reach a deal on Monday despite \"significant progress\" made in recent days. \"This is not a failure, this is the start of the very last round. I am very confident that we will reach agreement in the course of this week,\" he said.Read MoreEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker greets British PM Theresa May prior to a crucial Brexit meeting at EU headquarters in Brussels on Monday.May said meetings had been \"constructive\" but differences remained on a \"couple of issues.\" The British Prime Minister said she remained confident an agreement could be reached in the coming days.'Critical moment' in talksBritain has been desperate to secure an agreement from the EU that it would move on to discussions about trade.But the EU has insisted that \"sufficient progress\" must first be made on three issues: that Britain pay a substantial \"divorce bill,\" that rights of European citizens in the UK are guaranteed and that there is no reinstatement of a border infrastructure between Northern Ireland, which will leave the EU with the rest of Britain in March 2019, and the Republic of Ireland.The dismantling of a so-called \"hard border\" was a key plank of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland after years of sectarian conflict. The Irish government was determined to secure a cast-iron guarantee from the UK that there would be no return to border controls after Brexit.Substantial progress on the divorce bill and on EU citizens was made last week but wrangling on the Irish border continued through Sunday night and into Monday. It appeared on Monday morning that a deal on the Irish border was close.Opinion: Brexit psychodrama going exactly as expectedDonald Tusk, President of the European Council, scrapped a scheduled trip to Israel, citing a \"critical moment\" in the negotiations. An EU official said the trip was abandoned so that Tusk could be available for \"consultations on draft guidelines\" for potential trade discussions.Flags flap in the wind outside the EU headquarters in Brussels on Monday.Philippe Lamberts, leader of the Greens in the European Parliament, told CNN that the British government had made a key concession: Northern Ireland would continue to be aligned with EU laws and regulations that, if they diverged, would require checks at the border. The concession was first reported by the Irish public broadcaster, RTE.After details of the draft deal leaked, DUP leader Arlene Foster gave a TV statement in which she said that her party \"will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom.\"Leo Varadkar, the Irish Prime Minister, said he was \"suprised and disappointed\" that an agreement was not concluded. He said that the British and Irish governments had agreed the draft wording of a deal on the Irish border on Monday morning. \"That's the agreement we had, I believe it stands,\" Varadkar said at a news conference in Dublin, adding that he was prepared to give May more time. \"I trust her,\" he said.Repercussions in UKEven if the DUP came on board with an eventual deal, there could be other consequences for May. The suggestion that Northern Ireland would enjoy a special status within the UK has infuriated leading figures in areas of the UK that voted to remain in the European Union in the 2016 Brexit referendum.Town at center of Brexit tug-of-war fears border changesNicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, wrote on Twitter: \"If one part of the UK can retain regulatory alignment with EU and effectively stay in the single market (which is the right solution for Northern Ireland) there is surely no good practical reason why others can't.\"Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were \"huge ramifications\" for the city if news of the deal turned out to be accurate. He said on Twitter: \"Londoners overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU and a similar deal here could protect tens of thousands of jobs.\"  The UK still hopes that the EU will deem sufficient progress to have been made in order to give the go-ahead for negotiations to move on to a second phase of negotiations at a summit next week. This phase would focus on a future trade relationship between the UK and EU and transitional arrangements.

He is one of the most spectacular judokas, when he's on the mat something extraordinary invariably happens! He is also one of my favorite judoka of all time. I have two shots of him that I particularly like. This is at the 2011 World Championships in Paris, which he would go on to win to become a double world champion.

It is one my favorites on image alone but, for me, it holds a special place in my heart because 2012 was the first time I had ever been to Japan, the home of judo, and it was my first visit to the legendary Tokyo Grand Slam.

Ono, dubbed the \"thrower of throwers\", was forced to withdraw from the competition with a knee injury ahead of his second match, while Hashimoto was forced to settle for a bronze medal.It was an anticlimactic end to the event for both athletes, with Ono in particular cutting a dejected figure in the stands.\"I realized that this is my ability, this was the best I can do today,\" said the 25-year-old Ono. \"I am starting from zero.\"JUST WATCHEDLegends of judo: Yasuhiro YamashitaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegends of judo: Yasuhiro Yamashita 01:10Japanese men's head coach Kosei Inoue was unconcerned by Ono's withdrawal, saying its more important for him to be in peak condition ahead of major competitions such as the 2019 World Championships, which will be staged in Tokyo.\"He made the correct judgment in pulling out,\" said Inoue, himself a three-time world champion and an Olympic gold medalist in 2000.\"He doesn't need to peak right now.

It rejects the allegations and said in September that it doesn't have \"unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia\" and \"has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts.\"A visitor passes the Kaspersky Lab pavilion at a technology fair in Hanover, Germany, in March.Martin, of the NCSC, said the nature of anti-virus software gave cause for extra concern.In order to work properly, anti-virus (AV) software must \"be highly intrusive within a network so it can find malware\" and \"be able to communicate back to the vendor,\" Martin said.\"We need to be vigilant to the risk that an AV product under the control of a hostile actor could extract sensitive data from that network, or indeed cause damage to the network itself,\" he said. \"That's why the country of origin matters.\"Consumers told 'don't panic'The NCSC said it was in discussions with Kaspersky Lab -- the largest Russian anti-virus software player in the United Kingdom -- with the aim of developing a framework that it can \"independently verify\" in order to ensure security.\"We are seeking verifiable measures to prevent the transfer of UK data to the Russian state,\" Martin said.Martin said the guidance was for the time being directed only toward government departments because the center's \"analysis of Russian state intent is that it targets national security interests.\"The agency saw \"no compelling case at present to extend that advice to wider public sector, more general enterprises, or individuals\" and urged people not to be alarmed, said its technical director, Ian Levy.\"Whatever you do, don't panic,\" Levy said. \"We really don't want people doing things like ripping out Kaspersky software at large, as it makes little sense.\"",

Green has described those allegations as \"completely untrue\" and \"deeply hurtful.\"Read MoreHow much longer can Theresa May stay in power?The latest revelations follow a story in the Sunday Times last month alleged that \"extreme\" pornographic material had been found on Green's computer.Green denied the story when it was published, saying it was \"completely untrue and comes from a tainted and untrustworthy source.\"Lewis says was surprised at Green's denial, and had come forward in support of the Sunday Times source, another senior retired police officer. Lewis said he carried out the raid at Green's office and examined the computer himself.He said that Green's denial of the original allegations was \"quite amazing\" and said he felt compelled to speak out.\"The computer was in Mr Green's office, on his desk, logged in, his account, his name,\" said Lewis told the BBC.\"In between browsing pornography, he was sending emails from his account, his personal account, reading documents ... it was ridiculous to suggest anybody else could have done it.\"Lewis added that none of the images found were \"extreme\" but that analysis of the computer suggested that they had been viewed \"extensively\" over a three-month period, sometimes for hours at a time.A spokesman for Green, who holds the title of First Secretary of State, said he would not comment on the latest claims. \"It would be inappropriate for Mr Green to comment on these allegations while the Cabinet Office investigation is ongoing; however, from the outset he has been very clear that he never watched or downloaded pornography on the computers seized from his office.\"He maintains his innocence of these charges and awaits the outcome of the investigation.\"Another Conservative MP, Andrew Mitchell, questioned why Lewis had come forward.  \"I think it is highly questionable whether a retired police officer should misuse this sort of material in this way and I think the police need to explain why there was any record kept of entirely legal activity,\" he told the BBC.JUST WATCHEDJournalist: Michael Fallon 'just lunged at me'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJournalist: Michael Fallon 'just lunged at me' 09:08In his BBC interview, Lewis rejected suggestions that Green's computer might have been hacked, saying: \"It would be a very bizarre situation for somebody to hack a parliamentary computer to place pornography.\"\"The shocking thing, as I was viewing, I noticed a lot of pornography -- thumbnails -- which indicated web browsing. \"There were a lot of them. I was surprised to see that on a parliamentary computer. I had to take a step back, because I wasn't expecting that. When you ask me a number, I couldn't tell you. There were thousands.\"Lewis also rejected claims somebody else could have been viewing the material on Green's computer, saying:  \"It was so extensive, whoever had done it would have to have pushed Mr Green to one side to say 'Get out, I'm using your computer'.\"",

Following large-scale raids in four German cities on November 21 that resulted in the arrest of six Syrian nationals, a German intelligence officer initially told CNN that the arrests uncovered a possible terror plot on a Christmas market in Germany.But the Syrians were released without charge after initial investigations found there wasn't \"sufficient evidence of a terror plot,\" the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said. There was also \"no concrete evidence\" the suspects belonged to the ISIS terror group, the office said.There are, however, indications the men have had contacts with ISIS and investigations are ongoing, the office's Christian Hartwig said.According to the initial account from police, the Syrian nationals had applied for asylum and were suspected of being ISIS members. An attack \"had not been fully planned yet\" according to the previous statement, but the suspects were believed to have been planning to carry out attacks with \"weapons or bombs on a public target in Germany.\"The German intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, further claimed the suspects had been carrying out target reconnaissance of the areas in which Christmas markets in Essen, Germany, would be held. They'd also surveilled buildings in Berlin, the official alleged.CNN's Paul Cruickshank, Rudolph Birgelen, Josh Berlinger and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.",

Foles was benched for Case Keenum. The Rams made Jared Goff the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 draft, which led to Foles and the Rams working out his release.Foles, then 27, had a decision to make. Was he done?'Grateful to still be playing'Foles said he took a few days to let the emotions settle. He went on a fly-fishing and camping trip with his brother-in-law. He talked to his wife. He talked with his family. He prayed about it.\"That was the greatest thing in the world for me, because it changed my perspective,\" Foles said. \"It changed my heart, and I realize how grateful I am to be here.\"Foles decided not to retire yet. Several teams called, but for him, there was only one real choice: He chose to sign as a backup quarterback with the Chiefs for the 2016 season, reuniting him with former Eagles head coach Andy Reid.\"He's a man that has always believed in me, no matter what has gone on in my career,\" Foles said. \"He drafted me. I knew that if I played for him, I'd give it one more shot -- that he could find the joy. If I had joy in there, he could bring it back out, and he sure did.\"Foles rejoined the Eagles in March, signing a two-year contract to back up the second-year Wentz. Foles said that without Reid, he might not be in the position he's in today.\"With everything that has gone on in my career, I'm just grateful to still be playing, and I'm grateful to be part of a great organization like the Eagles,\" Foles said. \"I was fortunate to play for the Chiefs last year. Playing for Coach Reid will be one of my favorite memories throughout my entire playing career on any level.\"But then to come back to the Philadelphia Eagles, the team that had drafted me, the team that I love, the city I love, never wanted to leave, is really special.\"Things were looking up. The Eagles were rolling. Then came Week 14 at the Rams, when Wentz suffered a torn ACL.'You just want to play'Just like that, Foles became a starter again. And he was ready.\"You get those mental reps, and then, when you go in there, you just want to play,\" Foles said. \"You just want to react. You really lean on the guys next to you.\"You don't try to do anything too crazy. You just let the game come to you. Trust your teammates, trust your protection. It really takes all the pressure off you. ...This is the greatest team sport in the world. You don't have to be Superman. You just have to play.\"Foles threw for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles' win over the Vikings in the NFC championship game.And play he has. Foles completed 78.8% of his passes, going 26 of 33, for 352 yards and three touchdowns in the Eagles' 38-7 win against the Vikings in the NFC championship game. In this postseason, Foles has completed 77.8% of his passes for 598 yards with zero interceptions. His passer rating is 122.1.Foles is just the fourth quarterback in the Super Bowl era to win two postseason games after making three or fewer starts in the regular season. The other three: Doug Williams (1987 Washington Redskins), Jeff Hostetler (1990 New York Giants) and Frank Reich (1992 Buffalo Bills).Now, at age 29, Foles is trying to become the first backup quarterback to win a Super Bowl since Tom Brady did it in the 2001 season.\"He's one of the greatest to play the game,\" Foles said. \"I'm excited for the challenge. When you play this game, you always want to play against the best, and you really want to play against the best on this stage. I'm excited to play on Super Bowl Sunday. I'm excited to go out there with my teammates.\"",

But today, Ben Ryan is trying to transform another nation's rugby fortunes. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAfter guiding the Pacific island nation to its first ever Olympic medal -- rugby sevens gold at Rio 2016 -- Ryan has returned to the touchline as a consultant coach with France.A long-established heavyweight of the fifteen-a-side game, when it comes to sevens the French have some catching up to do. Since 1999, Les Bleus haven't finished above seventh in the World Series with just one tournament victory in that time.\"There's no tradition of seven-a-side in France, they almost have a blank page where they're trying to create a new culture of the game,\" Ryan tells CNN World Rugby at a recent training camp in Marrakech. \"Right now, they're knocking on the door of eighth, ninth in the world. They want to be a lot higher than that. They want to be consistent.\"Read More Photos: An Englishman's island odysseyBen Ryan spent a golden three years with Fiji's sevens team.

He met with investors about the possibility of turning his journey with Fiji into a Hollywood film; he attracted the interest of NBA franchise New York Knicks, and discovered, to his surprise, that he had become the most followed sports coach in China. But as far as rugby sevens goes, France has called upon the right man. Ryan boasts arguably the best CV in the game. After coaching England for six years, he took Fiji to another level. On top of Olympic glory, the Pacific island nation won back-to-back World Series titles in 2015 and 2016. It's this pedigree that is motivating France's players. \"I suppose when the players see someone who has had success at world, Olympic and continental level telling them that they're good players and that they've done something well ... that's going to help them feel good about themselves,\" says Ryan. \"Perhaps I can give them a slightly different set of eyes on how the game could be played ... I've given a few tips for them, some encouragement.\"JUST WATCHEDToulon and Toulouse: The state of French rugbyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHToulon and Toulouse: The state of French rugby 22:32As far as the players are concerned, even as Ryan watches from the side of a training ground, his aura inspires. \"He knows everything about the game of sevens,\" says Pierre-Gilles Lakafia, a relative veteran of the French side with 118 matches under his belt. \"Just the fact that he's here is a big thing for us. He's a superstar, everybody knows him, everybody recognizes what he does.\"Rediscovering France's '\u00e9lan'Over the past 50 years, France has for long periods been the dominant force in the European 15-a-side game.But having recently fallen upon testing times, Ryan believes it is through the free-flowing, razzle-dazzle of sevens that France could rediscover its former glory.\"The French [fifteen-a-side] team of the 1980s played with this \u00e9lan, this French spirit -- that was really beautiful to watch,\" he says\"It's disappeared from French rugby in the last 20 years, probably with professionalism, and if it's going to return it's going to return through these guys. \"Every opportunity to play a game that's based on flare, and skill, and individual decisions -- that would be amazing if we can get them to play like that. That's something perhaps the whole of French rugby has moved away from.\"READ: 'Genderless' mascots unveiled ahead of 2019 World CupREAD: Aussie women stars get pay parityPlaying with flare is one thing.

Currently eighth in the World Series standings, only time will tell whether the effects of Ryan's gold dust will be felt by Les Bleus. But regular season aside, there's a World Cup in the USA on the horizon and any number of sides, says Ryan, could have their hands on silverware come July 22.Visit cnn.com/rugby for more news and videos\"There's every opportunity for a team that gets their tails up and a bit of wind behind their backs to come from the pack,\" he muses. \"I could quite easily see a team that perhaps isn't a favorite for the World Cup getting to the final stages. \"The French hope it's them.\"",

But four hours is a long time to even tangentially care about football if you don't normally care about football. So when the commercials get boring and the nacho cheese gets gummy, here are some super interesting trivia to keep the merriment going.  Trivia about Super Bowl LIIHow cold is it? (Very cold!)Read More1. Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the farthest north the Super Bowl has ever been held.U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Thankfully, it's got a roof. 2.  This year may also be the coldest Super Bowl on record: Some forecasts have the high -- the high! -- as being in the low single digits. Absolutely not. Cruel. Stay inside with your CrockPot dip. 3.  It's no surprise, then, that the NFL has a \"warm weather\" rule: Typically, the game must be hosted by a city where the seasonal predicted temperature is at least 50\u02daF, unless the stadium is covered by a dome (like it is in Minneapolis).4.  So, the coldest open-air Super Bowl? It was 39\u02daF in 1972 at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, of all places.Tulane Stadium in 1972, where the coldest Super Bowl was played at a frigid ... 39 degrees.The Patriots and the Eagles 5.  The New England Patriots hold the record for most Super Bowl appearances at 10.6.  Patriots QB Tom Brady is tied with former NFL linebacker Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl wins by an individual player, at five.7.  Patriots head coach Bill Belichick holds the record for most Super Bowl appearances as a coach -- 10 overall, and seven as a head coach. Legend has it that if Bill Belichick hugs you, you will win the Super Bowl. 8.  He also holds the record for most Super Bowl wins as head coach, at five.9.  The New England Patriots are very good at football.10.  The Philadelphia Eagles? Super Bowl bridesmaids. They've been to two previous Super Bowls, but never won.No pressure, Philadelphia Eagles backup quarterback Nick Foles. 11.  That's okay, because they are one of 13 NFL teams who have yet to hoist the Lombardi.12.  There are four NFL teams that have never even been to a Super Bowl: The Detroit Lions, the Houston Texans, the Jacksonville Jaguars and -- wait for it -- the Cleveland Browns. A Cleveland Browns fan expresses their ... disappointment.13.  Philly is overdue for a win. All four of its major sports teams -- the Eagles, the Phillies (MLB), the 76ers (NBA) and the Flyers (NHL) lost the last championship they appeared in. (The Eagles lost the Super Bowl in 2005. The Phillies lost the World Series in 2009 after winning in 2008. The 76ers lost in the NBA Finals in 2001. The Flyers lost the Stanley Cup in 2010.) Bonus fact: It physically hurt to type that out. Superstitiony things 14.  This is a weird one: You know University Alabama head coach Nick Saban, who is essentially the Bill Belichick of college football? Saban and Belichick have combined for seven championship wins in the last nine years, but they have NEVER WON IN THE SAME SEASON. So in other words, advantage: Eagles. Strange but true: Since his 1st national championship at Alabama in 2009, Nick Saban and Bill Belichick have never won a title in the same season. pic.twitter.com/zheBN7grfx\u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 24, 2018\n15.

        "content": "London (CNN)The Palace of Westminster, often cited as the most famous parliament building in the world, is falling apart. Behind the spectacular facade of Britain's legislature, roofs are leaking, a tangle of electrical cabling and steam pipes presents a fire risk, plumbing systems are inadequate and dangerous asbestos is all around.After putting off a decision for years over what to do about it, MPs on Wednesday voted in favor of moving Parliament out of the building to allow repairs to commence.Renovation at the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben, by the Houses of Parliament.They agreed both chambers of the Houses of Parliament should vacate in a \"timely\" manner, but gave no specific year for when they would. Officials said earlier the move would not likely happen before 2025.MPs had resisted greenlighting the refurbishment largely because they worry about the consequences of spending large amounts of money on their own building while imposing cuts on other public services.Read MoreSecrets of Westminster: Take a 360\u02da virtual reality tourExperts had warned that a decision could not be put off any longer.MPs had the option of delaying the decision until 2022, while vital \"patch and mend\" work would continue in the meantime.Speaking earlier this month, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said that lawmakers had a \"genuinely open decision\" to make.\"The House needs to decide whether we can afford to justify the work that undoubtedly needs to take place to restore this Palace -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with over 1 million visitors a year -- at a time when there are great fiscal constraints,\" she said.\"If the House does believe that now is the time, we need to think about how can we go about doing these things to ensure the very best value for taxpayers' money.\"'Substantial and growing risk'Much of the current Palace of Westminster was built after a major fire in 1834, but parts of the site date back to the 11th century. As a national icon and UNESCO World Heritage Site, its renovation represents a hugely complex -- and costly -- operation.A report issued in September 2016 by a special joint committee of MPs and members of the House of Lords warned of an \"impending crisis\" that cannot responsibly be ignored.Big Ben bongs for final time as restoration plan begins\"It is impossible to say when this will happen, but there is a substantial and growing risk of either a single, catastrophic event, such as a major fire, or a succession of incremental failures in essential systems which would lead to Parliament no longer being able to occupy the Palace,\" the summary said.The committee had recommended a \"complete decant\" of the palace for the duration of the work as the \"best option,\" saying it would allow the work to be completed in the shortest possible time frame, with the least disruption and probably the lowest capital cost, while providing \"the greatest scope for meeting the needs of a 21st Century Parliament.\"This \"full decant\" option could provide enhanced amenities for an estimated \u00a33.52 billion  and significantly enhanced amenities for \u00a33.87 billion, the briefing said.It recommended MPs move to an unoccupied government building nearby, while members of the House of Lords would relocate to a conference center on the other side of Parliament Square.A tangle of wires and cables is pictured in the underbelly of the Palace of Westminster.The committee also put forward two other options, including moving MPs and Lords over consecutive periods as work took place over a longer time frame and at a higher cost. The other was a to carry out a rolling program of work while Parliament continued its work in the middle of a building site. The committee warned that would carry \"a particularly high burden of risk\" and would likely mean the renovation project was not completed until the 2050s or 2060s.Speaking to CNN in 2016, Lady Stowell, then leader of the House of Lords, said: \"This kind of work is what you might think of as surgery to the major arteries and veins and major organs of this building. What it is not, in any way, shape or form, is a facelift or a makeover. It looks great -- but inside it's damaged.\"A cracked stone floor is seen within the Palace of Westminster.Scaffolding is already in place around parts of the Palace of Westminster as essential repair work needed to keep the site running -- itself costing tens of millions of pounds -- is carried out.Big Ben, the bell that marks time in the clock over the Houses of Parliament, was taken out of action last summer as part of a controversial renovation plan of Elizabeth Tower, which houses the clock. Costs have already significantly overrun on that project.CNN's Max Foster and Florence Davey-Attlee contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Carles Puigdemont, the former leader of Spain's restive Catalonia region, appears ready to give up his attempt to return to power.According to text messages caught by a TV camera, Puigdemont conceded that his efforts had failed and accused his own side of giving up on him.\"It's over,\" Puigdemont is alleged to have told an adviser. Madrid \"has won,\" he wrote in the messages, broadcast by journalist Ana Rosa Quintana on her TV show Wednesday. After elections last month, Puigdemont was the only candidate nominated to lead Catalonia's new government. The trouble is, he is in self-imposed exile in Belgium, unable to set foot in his own country without being arrested for his part in holding last year's banned referendum on independence from Spain.On Tuesday, the speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent unexpectedly suspended a session in which MPs were expected to confirm Puigdemont as President. Ostensibly, the decision was taken in order to secure guarantees from Madrid that the vote would be respected. The Spanish government has previously said that it will not allow Puigdemont to return to power.A banner reads \"Independence now!\" at a rally on September 11, 2017, in Barcelona during National Day celebrations.Read MoreTorrent insisted that Puigdemont still had the support of the pro-independence parties that hold a slim majority in the Catalan parliament. But Puigdemont appeared unconvinced.'This has come to an end'According to Telecinco's Ana Rosa show, the messages were written in Catalan and sent via the Signal messaging app to his former health minister, Toni Comin.This what Puigdemont's messages allegedly said:\"We will be living the last days of the Catalan republic...\"\"I suppose you know that it's over. Our people have sacrificed us. At least me. You will still be ministers (I hope and want that), but I have already been sacrificed ...\" \"Moncloa's plan has won.\" (referring to the Spanish government.) \"I don't know what is left of my life (I hope there's a lot!), but I will dedicate it to putting these two years in order and to protecting my reputation. I have been damaged by slander, rumors, lies, I have endured them for a common goal. This has come to an end and I will have to dedicate my life to self defense.\"CNN could not independently verify the messages, but in a tweet addressing the issue Wednesday, Puigdemont appeared to confirm their authenticity, saying he simply had a moment of doubt. He added that he was determined to continue his bid for the presidency.\"I am a human being and there are times when I also have doubts. I am also the President and I will neither shrink nor step back as a matter of respect, thankfulness and compromise with our citizens and the country. We go on!\" he wrote.He also criticized the violation of his privacy.  Carles Puigdemont, center on balcomy, addresses Catalan mayors after parliament voted in favor of independence on October 27, 2017.In his public reaction to the decision of the Catalan parliament to suspend the vote, Puigdemont appeared flustered and defensive. In remarks via teleconference Tuesday, he appeared to have no prior knowledge of the suspension, signaling a major breakdown in the pro-independence alliance. \"We believe that democracy cannot be postponed or suspended,\" he said, according to Spain's El Pais, adding that his intentions remained \"intact.\"\"There is no other candidate or other possible arithmetic combination,\" he said, adding Madrid could not dictate who became president. If Puigdemont loses support from pro-independence MPs, his bid for power would be over.His spokesman, Joan Maria Piqu\u00e9, denied Puigdemont was considering withdrawing his candidacy, explaining that he had come under increased pressure and that he had \"a bad moment.\"Madrid-Barcelona standoffThe national government in Madrid has been involved in a protracted game of chicken with the regional administration in Barcelona since Puigdemont's government defied a Constitutional Court ruling and went ahead with a referendum on independence on October 1 last year.In response, Madrid dissolved the Catalan parliament and called new elections on December 21 in the hope the region would choose a more moderate government. But the vote delivered a return to the status quo and put Madrid and Barcelona back to square one, with a parliament led by separatists.Protesters wave Spanish and Catalan flags during a pro-unity rally in Barcelona on October 29, 2017.Catalonia has now been without a president since late October. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has repeatedly called on parliament to forget Puigdemont and choose a \"clean candidate.\"The Spanish government has sought Puigdemont's arrest after the Catalan parliament declared unilateral independence in late October. The state prosecutor accuses him of sedition, rebellion and misuse of funds. He could face decades in prison if charged and convicted.Several others have already been jailed in Madrid, awaiting trial on the same charges. Their supporters consider them political prisoners. The might of MadridCatalan crisis: No mood for compromise after close voteMadrid has used every legal tool in the box to keep Puigdemont from office, and it now appears to have the upper hand in the standoff.The Spanish government has imposed direct rule in Catalonia, taking control of the autonomous region's public institutions. Rajoy recently threatened to extend direct rule should parliament choose Puigdemont as its leader-at-large. It has also lodged an application to the Constitutional Court to rule that a leader cannot govern from abroad. If the court even accepts this application, the process to vote for a president will be again suspended, prolonging the already lengthy political crisis.  The issue of independence has been deeply divisive in Catalonia and little appears to have shifted in public opinion since the October 1 referendum.As the region has not been allowed a legal referendum on the issue, the December vote was seen as an informal plebiscite on independence.An anti-independence party, Citizens, won the largest number of seats, but it did not have near enough allies to form government. The three pro-independence parties took power in parliament with a slim majority of seats, but they gained less than 50% of the popular vote, suggesting that most Catalans do not necessarily support independence.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Irish cabinet gave the go-ahead for a referendum to relax the country's strict abortion laws on Monday, 35 years after the Catholic-majority country enshrined abortion as a crime in its constitution.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a referendum will be held at the end of May. A statement from the Irish leader added that the exact date of the referendum would be determined following a debate and vote in Parliament, and could extend to early June. #Strike4Repeal: Ireland protests abortion ban on International Women's DaySpeaking on Monday night after a lengthy cabinet meeting, Varadkar said he would advocate a \"yes\" vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution, which gives equal right to life of the mother and the unborn child. Referring to thousands of Irish women who travel abroad each year to terminate their pregnancies and the thousands of others who take abortion pills without medical supervision, Varadkar said: \"We already have abortion -- unsafe, unregulated, unlawful. We cannot continue to export our problem and import our solution.\"He added that he believed that the \"time had come\" to allow the public to make a decision and said that he was convinced that the issue of abortion had no place in the Irish Constitution. Read More\"I do not believe that the Constitution is the place for making absolute statements about medical, moral and legal issues.  An issue that is not black and white can never be explained in black and white.  \"I believe this is a decision about whether we want to continue to stigmatize and criminalize our sisters, our co-workers and our friends.  Or whether we are prepared to make a collective act of leadership to show empathy and compassion,\" he said.Next stepsThe exact language of the referendum has not yet been decided, but the draft bill is expected to include the provision for abortion without restriction up to the 12th week of pregnancy, according to Minister for Health Simon Harris.Terminations past 12 weeks would be allowed only \"in exceptional circumstances\" where serious risk to the woman's health or life were found. The proposed legislation would also provide for cases where a fatal fetal abnormality is identified.Varadkar said that if the referendum passed, only doctors on a specialist register would be able to prescribe a medical abortion, known as the \"abortion pill,\" adding that over-the-counter, \"on-demand\" access was not up for debate.Varadkar has called for respectful debate across the spectrum, acknowledging that the decision would be \"difficult\" for many to make. Abortion laws around the world: from bans to personal choiceLinda Kavanagh, spokeswoman for the Abortion Rights Campaign, told CNN that the organization welcomed the \"repeal and enact\" proposal and that it would \"be keeping a close eye on the wording on the legislation and the referendum to make sure that this is done right.\"\"We've worked so hard to get to this point and we want a very simple question to the people,\" she said. \"We want them to know what this referendum is about, and it is up to the politicians to explain this act to the layperson.\"The anti-abortion rights Pro Life Campaign released a statement calling the government's announcement \"as bad as anyone could have envisaged: the removal of legal protection from unborn babies and providing for abortion on demand.\"The group's spokesperson Ruth Cullen called the referendum \"a very sad and serious moment for our country.\" Evolving viewsVaradkar said over the weekend he would campaign for abortion laws to be liberalized, in his first public comments on his personal position on the vote. His position on the polarizing debate has varied during his political tenure. In 2010, he reportedly said he would not support legalizing abortion; in 2014, as Health Minister, he said he was \"pro-life\" but that women's lives were at risk under current legislation. On Monday evening, Varadkar said that his views had \"evolved over time,\" adding, \"life experience does that.\" A government spokeswoman told CNN that Varadkar's stance was personal and did not necessarily reflect the government's position.Varadkar, who came to power last June, pledged to hold the referendum following the non-binding recommendations of a Citizens' Assembly. The group heard harrowing testimony from scores of Irish women and received more than 13,000 individual submissions.Protesters hold up placards against the Eighth Amendment in on September.Ireland has some of the strictest abortion laws in the developed world. It is among just 50 countries that allow terminations only when a woman's life is at risk, according to the Pew Research Center. Incest or rape do not provide legal grounds for abortion in Ireland.Six other countries ban abortion under all circumstances.The country's current abortion laws stem from the Eighth Amendment, which voters approved in 1983.Abortion was not legal before that, but the laws were ambiguous and ignited debate in the 1970s and 80s, as religious leaders led a campaign to clamp down on the liberalization of Irish society.Related report: Irish girl seeking abortion sent to psychiatric clinic insteadMajority want change A protester holds a \"My Body My Choice'\" sign during the Strike 4 Repeal demonstration in Dublin in March. According to a recent Irish Times poll, 56% of Irish voters support changes to the Eighth Amendment. It also showed that 113 Irish members of Parliament and senators -- a majority -- support the repeal of the amendment, while 52 do not. The other 52 were undecided or chose not to say.Calls to repeal the Eighth Amendment have been steadily growing for years. In March, thousands of activists brought Dublin to a halt during the Strike 4 Repeal rally.In September, some 40,000 people rallied for changes to the Eighth Amendment during the 6th annual \"March for Choice,\" according to organizers. Irish MPs, nonetheless, have traded barbs in Parliament over the issue, and anti-abortion groups have vowed to fiercely protect the Eighth Amendment.Ireland's Union of Students had called on the government to hold the vote in May, saying any later date would potentially \"create barriers\" and cause a drop in the youth vote, due to exam schedules and summer holidays. \"Millions of our young people have not had the opportunity to vote on this issue, and arguably it affects our future generations more than any others,\" it said in a statement.Nada Bashir contributed to this report.",

And in social media, he sees a machine so powerful in spreading hate that it is difficult to see a happy ending. The rise of social media has left Holocaust survivors facing what Goldberg calls \"a losing battle.\"Manfred Goldberg now lives in London with his wife, Shary.\"Instant communication now means that any single person who wants to propagate his race hatred-infected views can do so much, much, much more effectively than the Nazis back then could ever do,\" he says.\"Many years before they gained political power the Nazis initiated and maintained a vicious anti-Semitic propaganda campaign against Jews mainly by the printed word but also by speech railing against Jews at mass meetings.Read More\"They did so in the belief that any lie, no matter how vile or abhorrent, would eventually be accepted as truth if it was repeated often enough and powerfully enough.\"Unfortunately, they were proved correct. The result, as we know, was the Holocaust. And what worries me, tremendously, is that in the name of the freedom of speech, we appear to ignore this lesson of history.\"Read: Facebook, Twitter face fines up to $53 million over hate speechStory of survivalSitting in his London home, surrounded by photographs of his four children and 12 grandchildren, Goldberg recounts his tale of survival.It is a story he has told many times, especially in recent years with the help of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which educates thousands of students and teachers across the UK.Born into a German Orthodox Jewish family, Goldberg was deported from his hometown of Kassel in central Germany to the Riga ghetto in Latvia before being moved on to a number of different labor camps in German-occupied Poland.A gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp, where Goldberg was held by the Nazis.It was there that he worked laying railway tracks while facing selections where Nazi guards would choose which inmates would live, and who would be murdered.He survived eight months of slave labor in Stutthof concentration camp, where gas chambers were used to kill prisoners and their remains were burned in the nearby crematorium.When Stutthof was abandoned, Goldberg had to endure a death march through awful conditions. He was liberated in Neustadt, Germany, in 1945. His mother, another survivor, traveled with him in 1946 to the UK, where they were reunited with his father, who had escaped Germany just weeks before the war broke out. But his younger brother perished, murdered by the Nazis.'Holocaust denial'Last year, Goldberg returned to Stutthof for the first time since the end of the Holocaust, accompanying the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a tour of the camp where 65,000 people lost their lives.Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (L), and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, meet Manfred Goldberg as they visit the former Stutthof Nazi concentration camp during an official visit to Poland.As survivors of the Holocaust grow older, he feels a sense of responsibility to share his story before he leaves this world.And it is a responsibility that grows with each passing day, he says, as those who seek to deny the Holocaust attempt to spread their messages online.William & Kate walk through the death gates at Stutthof concentration camp with survivors Zigi Shipper & Manfred Goldberg #RoyalTourPoland pic.twitter.com/mr3p5N2s6i\u2014 Rhiannon Mills (@SkyRhiannon) July 18, 2017\n\n\"Decades ago when I was young, I did not dream that in my lifetime I would witness a thriving industry of Holocaust denial,\" Goldberg says.\"Despite all our efforts to make people aware of the horrors of the Holocaust, I feel under present conditions, with the freedom granted to these race-hating views, we are fighting a losing battle.\"How can people deny the Holocaust existed?\"Anyone can pay a visit to Stutthof -- the museum is open to the public -- and can see with their own eyes a gas chamber and crematorium as they were 70-odd years ago and yet there are tens, if not, hundreds of thousands, who believe this lie that the Holocaust is a lie from beginning to end, that there never were any gas chambers. It is beyond comprehension but nevertheless it's a fact. \"The numbers of people infected by these views can only grow. Once someone has that attitude of mind, facts are irrelevant.\"'We must not let them get to the top'A five-minute drive from Goldberg's home, fellow survivor Freda Wineman also fears for the future.Freda Wineman looks at a photo of her mother who was killed at Auschwitz.A survivor of Auschwitz, where over a million Jews were murdered including her own mother and brother, she too has traveled far and wide to share her story.Even now, at 94, she is as keen as ever to talk, ensuring the lessons of the Holocaust are heeded by future generations.\"We have to be aware there are some right-wing movements that have to be stopped and eliminated,\" she says. \"We must not let them get to the top because they are evil.

        "content": "(CNN)It may be a bloated, over-hyped spectacle, but the Super Bowl usually is good for a memorable moment or two.Some of them even happen on the field.From dramatic plays to big blunders to a certain dancing fish, here's a look back at some of game's most indelible moments -- in no particular order.2013: The Blackout BowlFans had barely returned to their seats for the second half of Super Bowl XLVII when a partial power outage smothered New Orleans' Superdome in murky dusk.  The Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers left the field, people had to be rescued from a stalled stadium elevator and fans took to their phones to try and decipher what was going on. Some people joked that Beyonce's halftime show was so hot it fried the power. Play was stopped for 34 minutes while the electrical glitch was fixed. Many observers think the blackout stalled the Ravens' momentum and helped the 49ers storm back from a 28-6 deficit to make the game close.Read More1986: 'The Fridge' scores a touchdown The 1985 Chicago Bears were best known for hard-nosed coach Mike Ditka, star running back Walter Payton, their so-bad-it's-good \"Super Bowl Shuffle\" rap video and William Perry, a fun-loving rookie defensive lineman so enormous his nickname was \"The Refrigerator.\" Late in the Bears' beatdown of the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, Dikta put The Fridge in the game at running back and watched him barrel into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown. The stunt amused TV viewers and helped make The Fridge a cult hero.1993: Michael Jackson's dramatic introAfter a Michael Jackson stunt double faked out the Rose Bowl crowd by popping up atop a large video screen, the King of Pop himself emerged from a stage in the middle of the field. As the crowd cheered and swarmed the stage, Jackson stood frozen in place. And stood. And stood ... for a full minute and a half. Finally, he broke into \"Bad,\" \"Billie Jean\" and a medley of other hits, kicking off the modern-day tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows by big-name performers. Nobody could pull that introduction off today, though.1968: Vince Lombardi's players carry him off the fieldIt's one of the most iconic sports moments of the 1960s. Vince Lombardi, coach of the victorious Green Bay Packers, is hoisted off the field on the shoulders of his players at the end of Super Bowl II. Everything about it screams old-school: His suit and tie, the players' retro helmets, the fact that THEY WERE ACTUALLY CARRYING THEIR COACH OFF THE FIELD (teams don't do that anymore). It was Lombardi's last game as the Packers' coach.1984: Apple launches the Macintosh with '1984' adThe Raiders were blowing out the Redskins in the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII when TV viewers were startled from their cheese dip by a striking TV commercial. The ad channeled George Orwell's dystopian novel by featuring a lone female athlete disrupting a drab, conformist society by hurling a hammer at a \"Big Brother\"-like figure. Let the revolution begin! Directed by Ridley Scott, the iconic spot plugged Apple's new Macintosh personal computer -- \"Think Different,\" get it? -- and signaled the upstart company's arrival as a major player. It also helped make the Super Bowl an annual showcase for splashy, big-budget commercials.1973: The Miami Dolphins cap a perfect seasonThe game itself was sort of a yawner. But when the Dolphins beat the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII, they capped a 17-0 season and became the first NFL team to go undefeated on their way to a championship. Today, 45 years later, they remain the only team to do it. They were snubbed by the White House that year -- then-President Richard Nixon was a Redskins fan -- but President Obama made up for it by hosting them in 2013.1991: Whitney Houston's national anthem brings down the housePatriotism was at a peak during the Persian Gulf War in January 1991 when Whitney Houston stepped to the microphone in Tampa to sing the national anthem. And wow, did she nail it. Houston's soaring performance brought goose bumps to listeners around the world and was so popular it became a top-20 single, making her the only singer to turn \"The Star Spangled Banner\" into a pop hit. It was re-released after 9/11, and many consider it the finest version of the national anthem ever.2008: David Tyree's helmet catch It may be the greatest play the Super Bowl has ever seen. In the final moments of the game, with the New York Giants trailing 14-10 and facing third down, quarterback Eli Manning twisted away from three Patriots tacklers and heaved a pass downfield to David Tyree. The little-used receiver leaped in the air, wrestled the ball away from a Patriots defender and somehow pinned it to his helmet as he fell to the ground. The Helmet Catch, as it became known, gained 32 yards and instant renown. Four plays later, the Giants scored the winning touchdown, ending the undefeated Patriots' chance at a perfect season.1991: Scott Norwood misses game-winning kick Super Bowl XXV ended in agony for Buffalo Bills fans when Scott Norwood barely missed what would have been a game-winning 47-yard field goal in the final seconds. Norwood had hit more than 70% of his kicks that season, but this one sailed just wide to the right. The New York Giants erupted in celebration. The Bills and their fans stood stunned. The defeat marked the first of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances by the Bills -- all of them losses. Even today, if you want to make a Buffalo sports fan cringe, just go up to them and whisper, \"Scott Norwood.\"1992: Thurman Thomas misplaces his helmetOh, the poor Bills. It was probably a bad omen when Thomas, their star running back, couldn't find his helmet on the sidelines at the start of the game. The Bills had to run two plays with his backup before Thomas finally found his headgear and dashed onto the field. The miscue personified the Bills' early-'90s Super Bowl woes and was the beginning of a miserable day for Thomas and his team, who lost 37-24 to the Washington Redskins.2004: Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunctionYes, it was the Nipple Seen 'Round the World. When Justin Timberlake closed Super Bowl XXXVIII's halftime show by tearing off part of Janet Jackson's costume, he did much more than briefly expose her right breast to 140 million people. The \"wardrobe malfunction\" sparked outrage, spurred an FCC crackdown on \"indecency\" and became the most TiVo-ed moment ever. Years later, many think the controversy was overblown and unfairly torpedoed Jackson's career. Timberlake, meanwhile, will be this year's Super Bowl halftime act.1993: Leon Lett's goal-line fumbleThe Dallas Cowboys were pounding the Bills (yes, them again) 52-17 late in Super Bowl XXVII when Cowboys lineman Leon Lett scooped up a fumble and rumbled, alone and untouched, some 60 yards towards yet another Dallas touchdown. But Lett began showboating as he neared the end zone, allowing Buffalo receiver Don Beebe to catch him and slap the ball from his hand at the one-yard line. The ball bounced into the end zone for a touchback -- and a little moral victory for the sad-sack Bills.2000: The Tackle With six seconds left in the game and the Tennessee Titans trailing the St. Louis Rams by a touchdown, Titans QB Steve McNair tossed a quick slant pass to receiver Kevin Dyson, who appeared on his way to a game-tying score when he was corralled by Rams linebacker Mike Jones at the 2-yard line. Dyson fell forwards, stretching his right hand -- and the ball -- towards the end zone as time expired. \"Can he get in?\" shouted incredulous announcer Al Michaels as the ball hovered inches from the goal line. \"No, he cannot!\" The Tackle, as it became known, is the most thrilling final play in Super Bowl history.2007: Prince performs in a downpour The rain was coming down in sheets before Prince and his band took the stage in Miami for Super Bowl XLI's halftime show. It had all the makings of a disaster. Water and electricity don't mix. Prince's two backup dancers would be tottering around a slippery stage in 5-inch heels. And yet when the producer asked Prince if he was OK to perform, he responded, \"Can you make it rain harder?\" Then the pop star went out and killed it, closing with a transcendent version of -- what else? -- \"Purple Rain\" as 70,000 fans waved flashlights and the elements raged around him. It was magical, and probably the best Super Bowl halftime show ever.1969: Joe Namath pulls upset after guaranteeing victoryNobody gave flamboyant Joe Namath and the upstart New York Jets much of a chance against the mighty Baltimore Colts, who were 18-point favorites. But three days before the game, a tipsy Namath boasted publicly, \"We're gonna win the game. I guarantee it.\" It's the kind of reckless comment that gets pinned up in the opposing team's locker room and drives coaches crazy. But Namath backed it up, leading the Jets to a 16-7 win and cementing his Broadway Joe legend.2015: Katy Perry is upstaged by #LeftSharkDuring her campy halftime show, pop star Katy Perry rode in on a mechanical lion, dueted with Lenny Kravitz and flew over the stadium crowd on a shooting star. But that's not what anybody remembers. What they remember is Perry singing \"Teenage Dream\" against a cartoony tropical backdrop with palm trees, beach balls and two dancers in cuddly shark costumes. To the internet's great amusement, it soon became clear that the shark to the left of Perry seemed a little ... off. While the other shark followed the choreography, Left Shark flailed and spun around and seemed at times to be making it up as he went along. #LeftShark became a meme before halftime was even over.2015: The Seahawks' disputed play callIt's probably the most-criticized play call in Super Bowl history. Trailing New England 28-24, the Seahawks' Russell Wilson drove his team to the Patriots' 1-yard line with 26 seconds left. Since it was only second down and the Seahawks had a timeout left, everyone figured they knew what was coming next: a handoff or two to star running back Marshawn Lynch, who would go full Beast Mode and rumble into the end zone for the win. Instead, Wilson threw a slant pass to Ricardo Lockette that was intercepted by the Patriots' Malcolm Butler at the goal line. TV announcer Chris Collinsworth spoke for many stunned Seattle fans when he said, \"I'm sorry, but I can't believe the call.\"",

Woods often outdrove his younger adversaries, even with his fused back -- smashing it 358 yards at the first hole Sunday.But he was the first to acknowledge there remains a lot of work to do off the tee.

Navalny wrote that he was released until a court hearing, but did not provide details on when the hearing would be held. He also thanked demonstrators who had gathered near the detention center where he was being held. Navalny, a longtime critic of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested earlier Sunday during nationwide rallies protesting what the opposition leader calls rigged presidential elections set to take place on March 18. \"I've been detained. This doesn't matter. Come to Tverskaya (Street).

On Sunday, water levels were holding at 5.87 meters (just over 19 feet), according to CNN Meteorologist Gene Norman, and were expected to peak later in the evening around 6 meters (about 19.5 feet). The river overflowed in some places this week when water levels reached just over 5 meters (nearly 17 feet). Paris Police previously said the Seine was forecast to reach 5.95 meters (nearly 20 feet) overnight from Sunday into Monday.  That's lower than the last serious flooding in June 2016 when water levels reached 6.1 meters (about 20 feet) and riverside museums were forced to move artwork from their basements.There had previously been fears the water would peak at 6.2 meters (more than 20 feet) on Saturday, but the French meteorological service, Meteo France, said it was unlikely after the rain stopped Friday.

Without a grand slam title from the middle of 2012 to the conclusion of 2016, the Swiss has now won three of his last four following a gripping 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 3-6 6-1 victory over Marin Cilic in Sunday's Australian Open final. Follow @cnnsport\n\nHe has reached the milestone of 20 grand slam titles -- the first man to do so -- and it is a mark that could stand for decades. Or longer. His six Australian Open crowns also drew him level with the all-time men's leaders of Roy Emerson and Novak Djokovic and he is the second oldest man to win a major in the Open Era. \ud83c\udfc620. \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/WqUiSo3fd5\u2014 Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) January 28, 2018\n\nThe 36-year-old has often said other great players will come along when he finally does retire. That could be the case but there might not be another player quite like him. Much to the relief of his legions of supporters, Federer's form suggests he won't be calling it quits anytime soon. The two sets he dropped against the sixth-ranked Cilic were the only ones he conceded the entire fortnight in Melbourne. Read More\"The fairytale continues for us, for me, after the great year I had last year,\" said Federer, who captured the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2017 to end his grand slam drought. \"It's incredible.\" An emotional Federer then thanked the crowd, who had chanted, 'Let's go, Roger' to get him over the finish line in the fifth set.  \"I'd like to thank you for everything,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"You guys make me nervous, you make me practice.\"\ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udfc6#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/WGrf0s1U8g\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 28, 2018\n\nThere were indeed tears from Federer a la the 2009 Australian Open final. But on that occasion, they were tears of sadness as he was defeated by great rival Rafael Nadal in five sets. Federer admitted he was nervous in the buildup as he thought about getting to 20, which would explain why he wasn't his usual efficient self in the second and fourth sets. He had more time to ponder because the Australian Open is the only grand slam where the men's final is contested at night. \"All day I was thinking, 'How would I feel if I won it, how would I feel if I lost it?' I'm so close, yet so far,\" he said. \"I think I was going through the whole match like this.\"I've had these moments in the past, but maybe never as extreme as tonight. Getting to 20 is obviously very, very special, no doubt.\"Federer's late career revival after a knee injury truly began 12 months ago in Melbourne when he overcame Nadal in five sets in the final.  Extreme heat Sunday's affair was played under the roof at an air conditioned Rod Laver Arena as organizers implemented the extreme heat policy for the second day in a row -- the thermometer soared to 37 degrees Celsius outdoors as the match began.  It appeared to contradict an earlier statement from the tournament that stated the temperature had to be at least 40 degrees -- as one criteria -- to institute the rule.  Some felt it was a considerable boost to Federer, since he is an especially fantastic indoor player. He played his semifinal against South Korea's history maker Hyeon Chung under the roof due to rain. Just how much being indoors affected the outcome is up for debate and given it went the distance, it probably shouldn't be dwelt upon.   Cilic said he had the chance to practice indoors Sunday to get used to the conditions but chose not to. \"I didn't mind to have the roof closed,\" said the 2014 US Open champion. \"But it was a huge difference in temperature from having outside 38, then when you came in, it was like 23, 24. It was way cooler than I expected.\" Photos: How the final was won The trophy was sweet for Roger Federer after he won a 20th major at the Australian Open.

Just looking at my own side, I didn't feel those conditions before. I had a slow start in the match, losing straightaway my two service games, then catching up most of the time.\"\"But looking overall, I'm really pleased with the performance.\"For his part Federer said he was surprised the heat rule was in effect for a night encounter but that no matter what the final decision was, it wouldn't have bothered him. \"For me, it doesn't change anything in the preparation,\" he said. \"I was ready for either.\"Cilic's journey to the final included beating an injured Nadal in the quarterfinals Tuesday, a large chunk of luck that sometimes foreshadows even better things. And when Cilic manufactured two break points to begin the fifth, he was certainly in the ascendancy. Could he really upset Federer after losing the Wimbledon final to him in straight sets last July? A fine serve helped Federer on the second break point but on the first, Cilic put a second-serve forehand return into the net. Overall he went 2-for-9 on break points, not good enough against Federer. And averaging 18 aces leading into the final with only one of those matches going to five sets, the 29-year-old dropped to 16 Sunday.   Emerson. Djokovic. Federer. 6 x Australian Open crowns apiece. Astonishing then, incredible now.\u2014 Rod Laver (@rodlaver) January 28, 2018\n\n\"I think I served a little bit better with Rafa,\" said Cilic. \"Today I was not finding just rhythm on my serve as good as against Rafa.\"He was broken in the next game and Federer -- who slammed down 24 aces -- registered the insurance break for 5-1. The \"first game of the fifth set was more or less crucial,\" said Cilic. Missed chancesOnly the aforementioned Federer nerves realistically prevented a three- or four-set win. Cilic faced three break points in three different games in the second set.  On the final one, at 4-4, he delivered a gutsy second-serve ace down the middle. The serve did help him there. It felt like a key moment and Cilic duly earned a set point in the ensuing game after Federer donated two double faults. Cilic however tamely sent a routine backhand -- the backhand is traditionally his stronger side -- into the net. The momentum was thus with Federer in the tiebreak but Cilic overturned a mini-break deficit at 4-3 to level proceedings at a set apiece. #Federer has won a career-best 6 consecutive 5-set matches going back to last year's @AustralianOpen:2018 #AusOpen d.

Yet he was struggling with his first serve in spurts and it caught up with him as he dropped serve to love for 3-3.The back-and-forth nature of the contest continued, with Cilic fending off a break point for 4-3 and duly breaking for 5-3 thanks to a punishing forehand. Federer has only ever lost one grand slam final when leading by two sets to one -- to Juan Martin del Potro at the 2009 US Open -- but could this have been the second occasion? The chair umpire, Jake Garner, was the same as in New York nine years ago.  Turning pointFederer took a rare bathroom break yet it did little to stop Cilic's surge.  In what ultimately was the turning point of the affair, Federer saved those two break points.  Early in the first set the world No. 2 -- he is on the heels of Nadal -- raced to 10 straight points and he ended the fifth by claiming 18 of the last 19. Roger Federer takes his trophy on a tour. Federer had to wait to fully celebrate when Nadal challenged on match point last year and the same thing happened Sunday. But Hawk-Eye showed that Federer's serve out wide struck the line.

        "content": "(CNN)At the ripe old age of 81, Silvio Berlusconi is emerging as the unlikely kingmaker in the Italian general elections in March.The media magnate and former prime minister -- arguably the godfather of modern populism, having launched his Forza Italia party 24 years ago --  is now positioning himself as an anti-populist bulwark. Ever the consummate deal maker, he has brokered a right-wing alliance for the elections with the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy party and the anti-European Union, anti-immigrant Northern League. The group currently seems to be the only contender to gain more votes than the ultra-populist Five Star Movement (M5S) founded by  maverick comedian Beppe Grillo. Silvio Berlusconi is seen leaving a press conference in Rome in 2014.On Monday, Berlusconi flew to Brussels in an attempt to sell his bloc as the responsible choice in the upcoming election. Read MoreHe met with other center-right politicians including Antonio Tajani, the President of the European Parliament and a member of Forza Italia, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, according to Berlusconi's own social-media accounts. Fiscal hawk?There Berlusconi reportedly pledged to keep the Italian budget deficit within 3% of gross domestic product in accordance with EU rules -- quite a change for a man whose government saw Italy's debt soar to 120% of gross domestic product at the height of Europe's debt crisis.\"Until two months ago he was moving to the right to appease the Northern League,\" Lorenzo Codogno, visiting professor at the London School of Economics and former chief economist at the Italian treasury, told CNN. \"Now he is moving in the direction of reassuring Brussels that he is on the moderate wing of the political spectrum.\" Silvio Berlusconi Fast FactsAmid fears that victory for the anti-EU Five Star party would present a threat to the single currency -- and concerns over the indebted Italian banking sector's potential to trigger a new financial crisis -- senior Brussels politicians appear to be prepared to welcome him back into the fold. \"Berlusconi is a great statesman, he doesn't need rehabilitating,\" Manfred Weber, the conservative German politician and head of the center-right group in the European Parliament, was reported as saying by the Italian broadcaster RAI. Widely mocked in the Italian media for his numerous facelifts and hair transplants, Berlusconi knows some tweaks may be needed for his latest comeback. He owns vast swaths of the Italian media, and during numerous past election campaigns he reached out to voters by simply turning up in his television studios. Berlusconi sings with Italian performer Mariano Apicella during a party in 2003.With such a direct line to Italians, he didn't feel the need for social media until now. He joined Facebook late last year, and already has a million followers. Rise to empireBerlusconi began his career as a cruise ship singer before making a fortune in real estate and starting a media empire that grew into the Mediaset conglomerate, a global player in the media business. Berlusconi also owned the Italian soccer club AC Milan for more than 30 years, harnessing the power of the beautiful game with his Forza Italia slogan, which had been a chant of Italian soccer fans. In politics, he has been prime minister in four governments. It seems unlikely he will lead the country again -- from the front, at least. Internationally infamous for allegations surrounding his \"bunga bunga\" sex parties, he was expelled from Parliament and is currently barred from public office following convictions for bribery and tax fraud.Affectionately known as \"Il Cavaliere\" (The Knight) in Italy, Berlusconi is trying to overturn the ban at the European Court of Human Rights, but it is unlikely the case will be heard in time. In his latest incarnation, Berlusconi is promoting himself not just as a fiscal grown-up, but also as an animal lover: His current policies include free veterinarian bills and an end to tax on pet food. He is also pledging to introduce a flat tax for everyone and a minimum income of 1,000 euros for pensioners. He is also a very good friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin -- the pair have holidayed together more than once. Trump comparisonsDuring the 2016 US election campaign, many compared Donald Trump to Berlusconi. Berlusconi said on his Facebook page he has never met the US President but understands why Americans voted for him. \"For many years Donald Trump came into American's homes as a TV star,\" he said. Berlusconi, who has been married twice and has five children, is 48 years older than his current girlfriend, former showgirl Francesca Pascale. Trump is only 23 years older than his wife. Berlusconi is also richer than the US President, according to the 2017 Forbes billionaires list, coming in at number 199, while Trump landed at 248.Even if his legal difficulties mean he cannot hold office, with his infinite access to Italian television screens, there is little to stop Berlusconi being the face as well as the brain behind the next Italian government.",

        "content": "(CNN)The Russians are coming! Except they aren't. Though they already have a bit. And they might well be coming a bit more soon.This is how very bad things happen.The threat posed by Russia to Western interests is unlike anything seen since the 1990s. It has forces or proxies deployed in Syria, Ukraine and, don't forget, parts of what's still called Georgia. There is smoke, but there is also fire and daily there is a lot of fuel being added.CNN EXCLUSIVE: Putin regime is 'built on corruption,' opposition leader Navalny says Dutch state media revealed this week that Dutch cyber spies -- the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU) -- were able to hack into the closed-circuit television of the building where a Russian hacking organization known as Cozy Bear worked, and observe them coming and going from offices where they hacked the Democratic National Committee in the US. The Dutch told the Americans, touching off the US investigations. According to the Dutch, the Americans then helpfully told the media they were tipped off by a Western intelligence agency, prompting the Russians to turn off the Cozy Bear CCTV hack.A Ukrainian serviceman shoots with a grenade launcher during fighting with pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk, Ukraine.There was also a shrill warning from new UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson, who, amid a budget row and internal leadership posturing, chose Friday to unleash a barrage of concerns about \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" -- yes, that many -- deaths that Russia could cause in Britain, if it successfully hacked the electricity grid.Read MoreWilliamson told the Daily Telegraph: \"Why would they [the Russians] keep photographing and looking at power stations, why are they looking at the interconnectors that bring so much electricity and so much energy into our country? They are looking at these things because they are saying, 'These are the ways we can hurt Britain.'\" His officials have also alleged Russia may target the transatlantic cables that ferry the internet to the UK.These new claims were met with the now-predictable Russian derision. Russian defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Williamson had \"lost understanding of what is reasonable in his fierce fight for the banknotes in the military budget,\" and that his \"phobia\" belonged in \"children's comic books\" or an episode of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\"Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov dubbed the Dutch report \"anti-Russian hysteria,\" saying \"if the Dutch newspapers want to supply the coal to the furnace of anti-Russian hysteria which is currently takes place in America, well... let's say it's not the most noble thing to do.\"'All decorum has been cast aside'Russophobia is a familiar and disturbing theme. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recently called it \"unprecedented.\" \"We never saw this during the Cold War. Back then, there were some rules, some decorum... Now, all decorum has been cast aside,\" Lavrov told Russian daily Kommersant in an interview published on January 21.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov gives his annual press conference in Moscow on January 15, 2018.Some Russian state rhetoric is designed to paint a picture of an outside world that hysterically harnesses fear of a resurgent Russia, when really the country means no harm. It is designed to try and distance Russians from an outside world they can increasingly see, even if only through the slanted prism of Russian state media.The xenophobia, homophobia and sometimes outright racism that has grown in Russian society also stem from the idea of a people -- a narod -- under threat. Russophobia, that argument goes, happens because \"they want us gone, but also because they fear us, as we refuse to lie down.\" I saw it in the eyes and anger of many ethnic Russians embattled in eastern Ukraine. They felt abandoned, scorned, left outside the rest of Ukraine, and had to turn to Russia to protect their Russianness.Nikki Haley says Russia is complicit in Syrian atrocitiesSome of Russia's urban elite has seen too much of the outside world to buy this reductive message. But its nationalists and beholden state employees embrace it, and much of rural Russia hasn't seen the glittering globe beyond. Life remains tough there, with even state figures accepting that just under 14% of Russians live below \"the minimum cost of living,\" according to Tass.Into this narrative of \"them and us\" come these increasingly vociferous Western claims of the Russian threat. In the partisan fury of US or UK politics, it is hard to know at times whether Russia did ingeniously undermine the entire US electoral process and infiltrate Team Trump, or just ended up having clumsy hackers steal some emails, and allow some of its sympathizers to get too close to some of Trump's less savvy or wholesome staff. It is hard to know, with Russian-backed tanks still in Donetsk and jets in Syria, whether we are seeing an expansionist Moscow intent on soon probing the Baltic states or switching off the lights in London, or a nervous Russia that is just checking threats it sees in its near abroad.Red Square in Moscow. Russians see the West through the prism of state-run media.The most troubling point is that the distinction doesn't really matter. This perception of Russophobia (or a real Russian threat) is either what the Kremlin wants, to justify its more aggressive schemes, or it is what the Kremlin feels it has to respond to, as to not appear weak.Vladimir Putin has long surrounded himself not with tech-age visionaries, but with men who stem from the same age as him, a period he called the \"greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century\" -- the fall of the Soviet empire. He still feels it personally, wishes to see the shift in power partially redressed and must surely be bemused at how the US public has elected a president so capable of diminishing US influence the world over.The Kremlin takes things personally. It may seem disproportionate to the slight, but not when compared with the extraordinary suffering of the Soviet era and the brutal collapse of the 1990s. But by recognizing Russia as the threat it increasingly shows itself to be, Western figures are also ensuring Moscow has little choice but to fulfill the prophecy.",

Her wait is over. Follow @cnnsport\n\nWozniacki won her first grand slam title Saturday when she beat Simona Halep 7-6 (7-2) 3-6 6-4 in an eventful, absorbing Australian Open final that lasted nearly three hours in the draining Melbourne heat. Indeed the heat rule was implemented for the first time during the fortnight despite higher temperatures in week one. Both players took medical timeouts and a pair of games lasted longer than 10 minutes as the athleticism of the world's two highest-ranked players was on show at Rod Laver Arena.

Hide Caption 10 of 10The Dane admitted she was a \"nervous wreck\" hours before the encounter but now she will be forever labeled a grand slam winner instead of a player who held down the top ranking without landing the big one. Read More\"I think that's one of the most positive things about all of this,\" she said. \"I'm never going to get that question again. I'm just waiting for the question, 'When are you going to win the second one?'\"Right now I'm just happy I have this one, and I'm going to really enjoy this moment.\"She will enjoy replacing Halep as the world No. 1, too, when the rankings are released Monday, six years after she was last atop the summit.  Nervous wreck Wozniacki flung her racket into the air and sank to the court when Halep sent a backhand into the net and there were tears from the 27-year-old as she walked to the net to shake hands with the unfortunate Halep.  She is her country's first grand slam singles champion.She soon thanked those in her box, including new fiance David Lee -- a former NBA all-star -- and dad Piotr, who has been an ever present on tour with his daughter.   \"My voice is shaking,\" said Wozniacki as she hoisted the winners' trophy. \"I never cry but this is an emotional moment.\"I was a nervous wreck this morning because I wanted to win so bad.\"I dreamed of this moment for so many years and to be here today is a dream come true,\" added Wozniacki, who passed $30 million in prize money in her career. \"I've dreamed of this moment for so many years.

But her wait continues. When she led by a break at 4-3 in the third, she was almost there. But having led for the first time in the contest, the dynamic suddenly changed. Now the front runner, Halep waned ever so slightly and it was all Wozniacki needed. The exertions of Halep's long fortnight had taken a toll.  Halep so close againAll three of Halep's defeats in grand slam finals have come in three agonizing sets. \"I can still smile,\" Halep told reporters. \"It's fine. I cried, but now I'm smiling. Is just a tennis match in the end. But I'm really sad I couldn't win it. I was close again but the gas was over in the end.\"She was better. She was fresher. She had actually more energy in the end.\"One could argue that both players had destiny on their side in Melbourne, since they saved match points en route to the final. Wozniacki was the first, fending off two against unseeded Croatian Jana Fett in the second round when she trailed 5-1 in a third set. READ: Wozniacki escapes Halep saved three against another unseeded foe, Lauren Davis of the US, in the third round as part of a record 15-13 third-set victory and two versus the surging 2016 champion Angelique Kerber in the semifinals when she emerged with a 9-7 third-set win. READ: Halep saves match points againIn the end, the tennis gods sided with Wozniacki. She was flawless at the start, clean yet also aggressive, building a 5-2 lead. Serving for the set at 5-3 proved a pressure moment and Wozniacki made a pair of key unforced errors, missing a backhand volley and forehand long. She recovered in the tiebreak in brilliant fashion, striking two winners and forcing Halep into four errors.  Halep took her medical timeout at 3-2 in the second set, having her blood pressure checked after feeling dizzy. This after rolling her left ankle in the first round. It did little to stop her, though, as she became even more aggressive. Cramps to her left leg were setting in and Halep later said she would need MRIs to both feet. Good numbersOverall Halep registered 40 winners and 47 unforced errors, while Wozniacki struck 25 winners and 28 unforced errors.  They were fine numbers for the duo considering the heat and their brilliant movement.  Halep forced a decider and the 10-minute break between the second and third sets through the heat rule -- the final began in temperatures of around 32 degrees Celsius -- was a boost for the 26-year-old though one could argue her momentum was halted. Wozniacki led 3-1 in the third set, only to lose the next three games as the breaks piled up.  That's when Wozniacki called her medical timeout for a left knee issue. Wozniacki held for 5-4 -- it was a rare, quick hold -- to put enormous pressure on Halep and at 30-15, the world No. 1 contributed a double fault. It was her only one of the match. Congratulations to both @CaroWozniacki and @Simona_Halep for gutsy performances tonight and welcome to the Major Winner Club,Caro:), and #1 again!!! https://t.co/LiGWkHNgzA\u2014 Martina Navratilova (@Martina) January 27, 2018\n\nIf she donated that point to Wozniacki, it wasn't the case on the next one. Wozniacki ripped a backhand cross-court from outside the tram lines to bring up match point. \"That was a crazy point,\" said Wozniacki. You'd be hard pressed to decide who has the better backhand. They are both stellar. But on the final point Halep's sailed into the net as Wozniacki got every ball back.  \"I was really tired,\" said Halep. \"I had so many problems at my feet, pain everywhere. But I think I did pretty well with all the things that were going on. After the first set, I just was out. I don't know what happened. No energy, no power. But then I just said that I have to hit all the balls, and then I could take the second set.\"I came back in the third set, but when I had to serve for 5-3, the gas was gone.\" Who will the men's final at the Australian Open?

        "content": "(CNN)Czech voters go to the polls this weekend in an election that pits the country's pro-Russia President against a europhile challenger who has given the incumbent a run for his money that few were expecting.The vote, a second-round runoff between hardline anti-migrant President Milos Zeman, and soft-spoken academic Jiri Drahos, comes as other European countries grapple with populist movements and their future within the EU.\"This is a vote between moving towards a more modern outlook, which is represented by Drahos, and for staying with views which are still influenced by our communist past, which is represented by Zeman,\" said Jiri Pehe, director of New York University in Prague.\"So that's what's at stake here, whether we will manage to make that step beyond the post-communist era, or whether we will remain mentally rooted in it.\"Who's in the running?Read MoreMilos ZemanMilos Zeman was long-time leader of the center-left Social Democrats, before founding the populist Party of Civic Rights in 2009.The tough-talking 73-year-old Zeman, known for his inflammatory remarks against the EU, immigrants, Islam, the media and urban elites, was Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002 before being elected President in 2013. Zeman has campaigned for closer ties with Russia and China, appealing to \"older people, those from small towns and villages, and those who still show some nostalgia for the former communist regime and are afraid of modern trends and globalization,\" according to Pehe. Zeman, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, is also known for his inflammatory style.  \"He's always been a provocateur,\" said Pehe, adding \"he's probably openly the most anti-immigration and anti-Muslim top politician in Europe.\"The Czech Republic is the only EU state to have joined the US in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, though Hungary did block an EU resolution condemning the American decision last year.Jiri Drahos Jiri Drahos and his wife Eva.The 68-year-old Jiri Drahos is a chemist and former head of the prestigious Czech Academy of Sciences, who had no experience in professional politics before he decided to run as an independent in these elections.A centrist, Drahos is pro-EU, pro-NATO, supports the adoption of the euro and sees the Czech Republic's future firmly anchored in the West. \"Drahos is the candidate of the young people who are simply, for lack of a better expression, more modern,\" said Pehe.\"Zeman tends to be seen as more vulgar, whereas Drahos is more dignified.\" How much power does the president actually have? The Czech President is a largely ceremonial role, with limited political power.  Instead, the President's influence lies in appointing the government and Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister, billionaire businessman Andrej Babis, is a firm ally of Zeman. Babis' populist Ano party won the parliamentary election in October. Europe is breathing a sigh of relief over GermanyLast week Babis' minority government resigned after losing a vote of confidence following allegations he had been defrauding the EU, which he denies. For now, the party continues as acting administrators of governmental affairs. Babis' future largely depends on he next President.\"Zeman is an ally of Babis who has said he would appoint him as Prime Minister again,\" said Pehe. \"Whereas Drahos has said he's not going to appoint a criminally prosecuted Prime Minister.\"Who will win? In the first round of voting earlier this month, Zeman polled at 38.6%, ahead of Jiri Drahos on 26.6%.The four other top candidates -- who accounted for 32.5% of the vote -- are now urging voters to back Drahos, so the final outcome is likely to be tight.\"It's not certain Zeman will be reelected because the views of Czech society is really split 50-50,\" said Pehe.\"So I think a lot of it will depend on the turnout, and whether those voters of other candidates in the first round will now back Drahos.\"",

Estonian triplets Lily, Leila and Liina Luik competed in the marathon at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. In the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, meanwhile, American born figure skaters Cathy and Chris Reed represented Japan while their sister Allison competed under the Georgian flag. Yet few family stories can compare to that of the Brandt sisters.READ: North, South Korea to march together under one flag in PyeongchangREAD: Pyeongchang medal predictionsREAD: The skaters who could be North Korea's medal hopeMarissa was adopted in 1992 by Greg and Robin Brandt, a Minnesota couple who had been experiencing difficulties conceiving their own children. Just before they received their first picture of Marissa from the adoption agency, however, Robin discovered she was pregnant. \"We couldn't have been happier because we figured, you know, what a joy it would be like having twins,\" Greg jokes to CNN.The sisters would both start out figure skating in their youth but Hannah was the first to switch to the rough and tumble of hockey.US Olympic hockey player, Hannah Brandt. Both would go on to play hockey at College, Hannah as a star forward for the University of Minnesota and Marissa for the nearby Gustavus Adolphus College. Although they would go for long periods without seeing each other, they were always in touch to catch up or wish each other well before games. That remains the case today even though the pair now live thousands of miles apart. Hannah graduated to play for the Minnesota Whitecaps upon leaving college. Marissa, meanwhile, was on the verge of giving up hockey until she received an unexpected phone call asking her to come for a tryout in South Korea. Seoul sistersAs luck would have it, one of South Korea's goalkeeping coaches lives in Minnesota and word eventually got back that Marissa qualified to represent the Asian nation. Within two weeks of that surprise phone call, she was boarding a plane bound for Seoul.\"Not knowing anyone or the language (it was) a little scary at first but I'm happy I took that leap of faith and I'm happy it all worked out like it did,\" Marissa reflects.Her experiences in the country of her birth have enabled her to connect with her roots in a way she had resisted doing before. As children, Marissa says it was always Hannah who was more interested in learning about Korea. \"Our parents had us in Korean culture camp growing up and I remember my sister loved it because she loved the spicy food, the kimchi, bulgogi, everything like that,\" Marissa recalls. \"I really shied away from it. I didn't really want to embrace being Korean. I just wanted to fit in and look like my sister and not be different in any way.\"READ: US snowboard star returns after horror crashREAD: Nigerian bobsled team make Winter Olympics historyREAD: Afghan skiers making harboring Olympic dreamsThat reticence has been replaced by a warm embrace of Korean culture in recent years. Marissa has also worked to promote adoption within the country, which she describes as \"the most special experience,\" she's had since moving there.Daily contact has, of course, been maintained with her family back home. Marissa married her husband, who remains in the US, a little over two years ago. But regular FaceTime appointments have also been kept with her parents and sister.For Hannah, the distance has \"been tough at times\" but it has done little to diminish her relationship with her sister.\"She's pretty much my best friend and I don't know what I would do without her,\" she adds. Hannah Brandt (center) of the United States shoots during the semifinal match against Germany at the 2017 IIHF Woman's World Championships.Olympic dreamsThe Brandt sisters spoke to CNN before the announcement that South Korea and North Korea would field a joint ice hockey team in PyeongChang.However, Marissa remarked that it was a positive development North Korean athletes, in the shape of figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, would likely be appearing appearing at the Games.\"It just shows unity and kind of shows that with everything going on that people can still, bond through sport,\" she says.  \"When we played in the last world championships, we played against North Korea and there were thousands of people at our game. People in the stands were holding flags that had just Korea as a whole not divided and it was a very special moment,\" she added. Hannah, meanwhile, has eyes on unseating a Canada team that has won gold in hockey at the last four Winter Olympics.After narrowly missing out on Olympic selection four years ago, she hopes to make up for lost time in PyeongChang.\"As a team, we have some major goals of winning a gold medal ... I think that's first and foremost,\" she says. \"But I want to enjoy every second of it because it doesn't come often and I think it's just a huge honor.\" Although both Korean nations are ranked far below the US in the world rankings, there remains a possibility the two teams could meet in the latter stages of the tournament.The unified Korea team would have to surpass the higher ranked Sweden, Switzerland and Japan in the group stages in PyeongChang to make that prospective encounter a reality.While that remains unlikely, such a meeting would be far from outwith the bounds of the remarkable Brandt family tale.",

He wasn't concerned about not playing enough on Friday as he prepares for the tougher test of Cilic. \"You do take the faster matches whenever you can because there's enough wear and tear on the body, there's enough tough matches throughout the season that when they happen, you take them,\" said Federer. \"There's nothing you can do anyway about it. The thought process is not like, 'What would have been better?' I'm just happy I'm in the finals. \"That was the goal before the match. I was able to get there. Not under the circumstances I was hoping to or not planning with. But I played a good match. He struggled clearly with his movement. I was able to take advantage of that.\"In the Wimbledon final, Cilic himself was troubled by blisters on his left foot, but that was their only lopsided duel in the last five meetings. A healthy Cilic memorably cruised past Federer en route to winning the 2014 US Open and held three match points against him in the 2016 Wimbledon quarterfinals. Holiday meetingFederer -- who has never retired from a match in his career -- revealed that he and Cilic played against each other while on holiday in the Maldives a couple of months ago. \"We were both looking for a hitting partner,\" he explained. \"He's a really nice guy. He had a similar problem as Chung in the final at Wimbledon. It will help him that he's had two days off and he hasn't had to come through a tough semifinal. We'll see a fresh Marin. He believes he can come this far, he will go far.\"Hyeon Chung receives a medical timeout. The bespectacled Chung was South Korea's first grand slam quarterfinalist, but his task of upsetting Federer became more difficult when he was broken in the first game. Federer's flawless play, and Chung's injury, meant there was little chance of an upset for the 21-year-old in their first encounter. Chung's agent Stuart Duguid explained the extent of the blister problem in the world No. 58's post-match news conference as the player is still perfecting his English. \"Over the last few days, it was blister under blister under blister,\" said Duguid. \"He had it shaved off. Now it's red raw. They tried injections to see if it numbed the pain. It didn't work. Much worse than a regular blister.\"I think a lot of players get callouses. As they go along, they shave them down. Because he has played so many matches in the row, I think that's why it was a buildup. I think that's how they started.\"Great tournament for ChungStill, it was a fine fortnight for Chung, who had upset both Novak Djokovic and Alexander 'Sascha' Zverev. He'll leave Melbourne with a projected ranking of 29th, the highest ever for a Korean player. Hyeon Chung speaks to reporters.

There were fears that the water could peak at 6.2 meters (just over 20 feet) on Saturday.But after it stopped raining on Friday, the French meteorological service Meteo France said that was unlikely.Record rainfall has caused the banks of the Seine river in Paris to overflow, flooding surrounding streets and causing travel disruptions. In the center of Paris, the downpour disrupted some metro and train services while walkways and roads near the river were  closed.The Louvre, which is next to the river, partially closed one wing as a cautionary measure.  Louvre officials told CNN that the museum expects the lower level of the Islamic wing to remain closed until at least Monday and they have protocols in place to protect valuable artworks should the situation deteriorate.   Parisians were nevertheless unfazed, saying the deluge had not impacted their daily lives\u00a0too much.

A man, pictured above, takes a photo of the Seine on Friday, days after the river burst its banks causing nearby docks, pictured below, to be completely submerged.This isn't the first time the city has experienced severe flooding. In June 2016, riverside museums were forced to move artwork from their basements. Water levels in the rain-swollen Seine are nowhere near those reached  in 1910 when waters rose to more than 28 feet, forcing residents to evacuate. People examine the Seine river from the Leopold-Sedar-Senghor bridge in Paris on Friday. Colombe Brossel, the deputy Paris mayor, told CNN that the city had learned from past mistakes but she thinks more needs to be done to adapt to climate change. \"Two flooding of the Seine river in less than two years -- we have to change, we have to change the way we build this city,\" Brossel said. \"We have to understand that climatic change is not a word, it's a reality.\"Night view of the floods in Paris on Thursday night.

Before him, a horse and rider are primed for action, ready to charge round a custom-made course with the skier in their wake. To some it may look terrifying; to others, exhilarating. Most, however, won't have seen anything like it before in their lives. Follow @cnnsport\n\nThis unlikely trio of horse, rider, and skier, which can reach speeds of up to 40 mph, have been brought together by the sport of skijoring.For Aaron Griffen, the scene is a familiar one. He's the current American champion and a regular face on the skijoring circuit in the US. Read MoreOnce hopeful of competing in the US ski team, Griffen discovered the sport in 2016 and, after winning the first event he entered, hasn't looked back. \"I was originally an alpine skier,\" Griffen tells CNN. \"I raced competitively for probably ten years. I also have a horseman background and know a lot of people that are involved in horses.\"It was actually a friend of mine who contacted me saying that she wanted to try it out and needed a skier ... we tried it and haven't stopped since.\"Horse, skier, and rider get to grips with the course in Saratoga, Wyoming.READ: Ascot boasts record prize money for 2018READ: Mark these racing dates in your diary'Another notch on the trophy'Competitive, western-style skijoring in the US has its origins in Leadville, Colorado. Originally a slow-paced spectacle for winter carnivals, it wasn't until the 1950s that it was transformed into a race, and the 1990s that the modern era of the sport was born.In essence, skijoring is a time trial. Races take place either on round or straight tracks that include jumps, gates, and, on occasion, rings that are collected on the way round. If any of these are missed, time penalties are incurred. Western-style skijoring is just one version of the sport; others exist without riders -- most famously in St. Moritz, Swtizerland -- and with dogs instead of horses. Griffen, who also works as an excavator, competed in 11 events last year.JUST WATCHEDA look at South Africa's horse racing industryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA look at South Africa's horse racing industry 22:20\"Most funding comes out of pocket. I did have a small sponsor last year,\" he explains. \"I do still go back to my other job here and there [during the winter months] -- skijoring is strictly weekends.\" Outside the competitive races organized by the SJA (Ski Joring America), Griffen confesses he hardly practices at all. \"I've probably practiced maybe twice in the past three years outside competition. It's got kind of a backyard, tailgating, BBQ kind of feel to it. It's just a fun event to go to. \"A lot of the competitors are the same every weekend, that travel around. We pick up some locals here and there, but for the majority, everyone knows each other.\"The goal this year is to get another notch on the trophy.\"JUST WATCHEDMan + horse + skis = ??ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMan + horse + skis = ?? 03:03Risky business?While Griffen admits his skiing background doesn't make the speed something he fears, for newcomers to the sport, the sudden acceleration as the horse lurches out the starting blocks takes some getting used to. Injuries happen, though Matt Crossett, board president of the SJA, assures that they're not as common as you might think. \"The most important thing for a skier is the start, learning not to get jerked by the horse because when the horse goes, it goes hard. \"In the last two years, we've had two people who have been injured, some of them more seriously than others. We had a skier tear her ACL because she came off a jump wrong, and there was another skier who dislocated his shoulder and was unconscious for a few minutes coming off a jump. \"But this is few and far between ... It can happen, but I'd say it's pretty rare.\"The biggest priority for us is keeping the horses safe because they don't have a voice. We take a lot of extreme measures to make sure the horses are safe.\" JUST WATCHED  The $238M horse races that keep on givingReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH  The $238M horse races that keep on giving 01:33Winning formulaCrossett acknowledges that it's a technical sport. The most successful trios thrive on chemistry between horse, rider and skier, and it's for this reason that Griffen tries to stick with the same rider, his friend Ebbie Hansen.While Griffen forms part of a group of about 50 who are regular faces on the skijoring circuit, the sport is open for all with specific competitions for novices. Prize purses of $25,000 are up for grabs at the most prestigious courses in Ridgeway, Colorado, and Bozeman, Montana -- taking home $4,000 from a single event is \"pretty darn high,\" according to Crossett. \"All the towns that put it on want to boost their economy ... Some do it right down the main street in their town. Often it's part of a bigger winter carnival. It's a good time to get out and have some fun in the snow.\"\"It's a great mix [of people competing].

        "content": "London (CNN)The organization behind a men-only British fundraising event, mired in scandal after female waiting staff were alleged to have been sexually harassed and degraded, has announced that it is disbanding.The Presidents Club, which for 33 years has held an annual charity dinner in London, folded less than 24 hours after the Financial Times published a remarkable expose that claimed hostesses at the 2018 event last week were paraded for the pleasure of 360 male guests, subjected to lewd remarks and groped.Revelations about the black-tie event, attended by top names from the fields of finance, politics and entertainment in the UK, prompted outrage a time when the issue of sexual harassment is in the spotlight. Comedian David Walliams, the event's emcee, said he was \"appalled\" by the report. Charities vowed to decline donations and the UK government said David Meller, a businessman who helped organize the event, had quit his post as a non-executive director at the Department for Education.Anne Milton, an education minister, announced Meller's resignation in the House of Commons. She said the behavior described was \"totally unacceptable\" and added: \"Words fail me.\" Meller has not responded to a CNN request for comment.Read MoreThe UK Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families, Nadhim Zahawi, who attended the event and whose position as a government minister was called into question, said he would never again accept an invitation to a men-only function. \"I do unequivocally condemn this behavior. The report is truly shocking,\" he wrote on Twitter.'Hands up skirts, hands on bums'The allegations contained in the FT story prompted widespread horror as soon as they were published online Tuesday evening. Financial Times journalist Madison Marriage, one of two FT reporters who worked undercover as hostesses at the event, described being groped multiple times by guests. Many other hostesses among the 130 women hired for the night had told her of similar behavior and worse, she said.\"It was hands up skirts, hands on bums but also hands on hips, hands on stomachs, arms going around your waist unexpectedly,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight program.The Dorchester hotel hosted the Presidents Club dinner.Asked about what she had heard from other hostesses, she said: \"The worst I was told by one of the hostesses was a man taking his penis out during the course of the dinner. The other one was another man telling a hostess to down her glass of champagne, rip off her knickers and dance on the table.\"According to the FT report, the women hired as hostesses were told to wear \"BLACK sexy shoes\" and black underwear. Short, tight, black dresses were provided, the FT said. At the start of the event, the hostesses were paraded on stage, the report said. They were paid \u00a3150 (about $213) for the evening's work.Auction items included lunch with UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and tea with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Another lot offered the successful bidder plastic surgery either for himself or \"to add spice to your wife,\" the newspaper said. Johnson, who did not attend, was unaware that a lunch with him was offered for auction, a Downing Street spokesman told CNN. \"The Foreign Secretary had not agreed to support this event and knew nothing about the inclusion of a lunch with him in any auction,\" the spokesman said.Less than a day after the FT article was published, and as the criticism snowballed, the Presidents Club announced it was disbanding. \"The trustees have decided that the Presidents Club will not host any further fundraising events,\" it said in a statement released through the UK Press Association. According to its website, the Presidents Club Charitable Trust was founded 33 years ago and has raised over \u00a320 million (about $28 million) for underprivileged children. Dozens of charities have been recipients of donations over just the past decade.\"Remaining funds will be distributed in an efficient manner to children's charities and it will then be closed,\" the club said in its statement.It had earlier told the FT that it was shocked at the claims. \"The organizers are appalled by the allegations of bad behavior at the event asserted by the Financial Times reporters. Such behavior is totally unacceptable.\"Storm of criticismIn the aftermath of the bombshell report, various organizations named in the story rushed to distance themselves from the event. The Bank of England told CNN it had not approved any prize for auction, \"nor would it have for that organization under its guidelines for charitable giving.\" London's Dorchester hotel, where the dinner was held, said it was \"deeply concerned\" about the claims made regarding what it described as a private event. \"We were not aware of any claims during or immediately following the charitable event,\" it said in a statement provided to CNN.\"We have zero tolerance of any form of harassment to our guests, employees and suppliers. We are in discussions with the organizers and an investigation is underway.\"Walliams, who emceed the event, tweeted that he was appalled by the reports about the dinner. \"I agreed to host as it is one of the biggest charity fund raising events of the year. I was there in a strictly professional capacity and not as a guest,\" he said.\"I left immediately after I had finished my presenting on stage at 11.30 p.m. I did not witness any of the kind of behavior that allegedly occurred and am absolutely appalled by the reports.\"David Walliams, pictured in 2016, was the emcee for the Presidents Club event.Charities and businesses cut tiesThe fate of the Presidents Club was sealed when charities who have benefited from its activities said they would no longer accept donations, and companies who booked tables at the dinner said they would not do so in future.Great Ormond Street Hospital in London said it was shocked by the reported behavior and would return any past donations. \"We would never knowingly accept donations raised in this way. We have had no involvement in the organization of this event, nor did we attend and we were never due to receive any money from it,\" a spokeswoman said.The hospital told CNN that it received \u00a3530,000 (about $753,000) in three separate donations in 2009 and 2016, and would give the money back.Businesses that paid for tables at the charity dinner, including advertising giant WPP and spread-betting firm CMC Markets, said they would end their association with the event.\"WPP has traditionally sponsored a table at the Presidents Club dinner to support its fundraising for children's charities. Neither the company nor our attendees were aware of the alleged incidents until informed of them by the Financial Times. WPP takes these reports very seriously and, while we will continue to support relevant charities, in light of the allegations we are ending our association with the event.\"\"CMC did attend the event but has no plans to take a table in future,\" the company said in a statement.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, Britain's biggest business lobby group, condemned the behavior described in the report, tweeting:  \"If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable. We want our young women to feel confident and respected in all walks of life. We can and must do better than this.\" If even half of what's been written about this event is true, it is deplorable. We want our young women to feel confident and respected in all walks of life.  We can and must do better than this. #PresidentsClub.\u2014 Carolyn Fairbairn (@cbicarolyn) January 24, 2018\n\nConservative MP Maria Miller, who chairs the Women and Equalities Select Committee in the House of Commons, said she hoped the FT expose would prompt a change in thinking.\"Let's hope every man who attended this event will think twice before accepting another invitation to a 'men only' event with more than 100 female hostesses and an ad in the event brochure that states sexual harassment of staff is unacceptable,\" she tweeted.UK Chancellor Philip Hammond, speaking to CNN on Thursday in Davos, Switzerland, said the dinner had clearly been \"a completely inappropriate forum\" for charity fundraising.\"I think it's the right decision to abandon it, I think it's the right decision by the hospital to return money that it's received from this organization. I think everybody will be glad to put this behind us and move on,\" he said. Asked how the financial industry could prevent a recurrence of this kind of behavior, Hammond responded: \"By people not buying the tickets and not going to that type of event.\" CNN's Anna Stewart, Livvy Doherty and Carol Jordan contributed to this report.",

It is not a bad combination for the towering Croatian. Follow @cnnsport\n\nCilic moved into Sunday's final when he defeated Kyle Edmund of Britain 6-2 7-6 (7-4) 6-2, getting a little help from an unseeded opponent who appeared to be hindered by injury. Two days earlier the world No. 6's quarterfinal opponent -- 16-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal -- had to retire in the fifth set after picking up a leg injury. A big \ud83d\udc4d to the 18,951 people who came along to the #AusOpen tonight.

But it is not like Cilic hasn't experienced health woes on court himself. Last year an injured foot in the Wimbledon final greatly hindered a crestfallen Cilic and he was barely able to test Roger Federer. He could get another crack at Federer Sunday, as the defending champion and 19-time grand slam winner will be expected to beat the exciting but inexperienced Hyeon Chung of South Korea in Friday's second semifinal. Read MoreREAD: Chung beats Djokovic\"I had ... one amazing experience in a final and one not so amazing,\" said Cilic, who beat Federer en route to his US Open crown. \"So I had both emotionally great and not great.\"I think it's gonna help me to stay focused on what I have to do. Now I have two days off. It's slightly different of the routine that I had during all the tournament, but I have to stay focused mentally and to be ready from the first point on the final. \"It's big motivation for me to play that final and obviously to win, and I'm feeling really good with my game, and so hopefully I can have a great match and also great energy on the court.\"Cilic (left) eased past Edmund to make his first Australian Open final.First for FedererAll the time Edmund spent on court during the grand slam fortnight -- he contested two five-set matches and a pair of four-setters -- might have caught up with the world No. 49. His forehand lacked its customary punch. Edmund went off court for a medical timeout to end the first set, the reason unknown. He didn't elaborate when he spoke to reporters. But after the 23-year-old felt he received a bad call from chair umpire John Blom early in the second set he became reinvigorated. Edmund desperately needed to claim the second set to have any chance of registering a second consecutive win over a top-10 player but his hopes vanished when Cilic grabbed the tiebreak. The third set was a mere formality.   Kyle Edmund played in his first grand slam semifinal. Still it was a memorable Australian Open for Edmund, who landed in a first grand slam quarterfinal and was Britain's most successful player in the absence of the injured Andy Murray and with Johanna Konta ousted in the second round. \"There's something, but whatever,\" Edmund said when asked if there was an injury issue. \"It's unfortunate. It happens. I'm definitely disappointed about it, but yeah, it's one of those things where I have to look at the whole week. \"Making semifinals of a grand slam is definitely something that I can be very happy with and really take that forward, yeah, just take that forward with me and build from it for sure. I mean, take belief and confidence from it.\"Who will the Australian Open? Have your say on our Facebook pageThere are not many firsts for Federer nowadays but when he meets Chung, it will be the first time in any of his grand slam semifinals that he has never previously faced that opponent. The top two women in the rankings -- Simona Halep and Caroline Wozniacki -- will do battle in Saturday's final after they won their semifinals at Melbourne Park in contrasting fashion earlier Thursday.",

They were contrasting victories for the players who share much in common.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nWhile Wozniacki, 27, enjoyed the more comfortable outing against the unseeded Elise Mertens on Rod Laver Arena -- triumphing 6-3 7-6 (7-2) -- Halep dug deep once again to dispatch a rejuvenated Angelique Kerber 6-3 4-6 9-7 in an almighty scrap sure to be listed among the best of 2018 once the long campaign concludes. It sets up a tantalizing battle between the world's two highest-ranked players Saturday. Croatia's Marin Cilic meanwhile progressed to the men's final, topping surprise package Kyle Edmund of Britain 6-2 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 and awaits the winner of Friday's second semifinal between behemoth Roger Federer and another upstart, Hyeon Chung. Halep, 26, just might be the player of destiny in Melbourne, since it was the second time the world No. 1 saved match points during her stay. On Saturday, the Romanian incredibly fended off three in succession to finally overcome plucky American Lauren Davis 15-13 in the third.

Based on their head-to-head record, Wozniacki holds the psychological advantage over Halep, winning three in a row. READ: Wozniacki's comebackTwo crowd-pleasers, two big moversBattling back from the brink of defeat isn't the lone similarity between them.  Both will be competing in a third grand slam final and first in Australia after receiving their share of criticism for holding down the top ranking without ever bagging a major. They are two of the top movers around and only separated by a year in age.  Call them crowd-pleasers, too. Halep, in fact, was voted as the WTA's Fan Favorite last season, ending the reign of Polish magician Agnieszka Radwanska. Saturday's champion is guaranteed of holding down No. 1 in the rankings Monday, but for Halep winning a first major is the bigger target. Wozniacki presumably feels the same way.  Simona Halep celebrates. It would be \"bigger than No. 1,\" said Halep, enjoying a perfect 11-0 in the new season. \"It's also my dream to win a grand slam title. But it's always tough when you are close. I had this opportunity two times. The last one was very close.\"Maybe Saturday I will be better. You never know. But if I make it again, the final, looks like I have enough power to redo this result and if it's not gonna happen Saturday, I will stay strong and I will keep thinking and dreaming for others.\"Wozniacki wasn't dwelling on Saturday's potential result, either. \"I think it's been a great two weeks so far,\" she said. \"I'm really happy and proud of how I've managed to turn things around when things weren't going my way and keep it up whenever it was going my way.\"I'm just excited. It's another finals. It's another great two weeks. Regardless of what happens now, I've done my best. When you go out there on Saturday, you have everything to win.\"Halep has a history of playing in dramatic encounters at majors. Last year, for example, she relinquished a set and a break lead against Jelena Ostapenko in the French Open final and fell to home hope Johanna Konta in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. Angelique Kerber was left floored by some extended rallies. Then in New York, an unseeded Maria Sharapova topped Halep in a lengthy first-round slugfest. It looked like she would be on the receiving end of another painful reverse when Kerber broke in a lung-busting 26-shot rally to get to 4-5 in the third and proceeded to save two match points serving in the next game. The 21st seed -- who had won 14 matches in succession -- manufactured two match points of her own serving at 6-5, only to see Halep escape. By this time, every rally seemed like a mini-marathon. Fatigue? All the matches for Kerber already in 2018 appeared to have caught up with the newly turned 30-year-old. She lacked the usual pace on her serve and groundstrokes and left balls short. Halep, however, was executing almost perfectly. There was no sign of apprehension or nerves, unlike in years past on the big stage. Kerber saved a third match point but not a fourth, seeing her backhand sail long. Halep finished with 50 winners and unforced errors, to Kerber's 33 winners and unforced. \"I feel more experienced,\" said Halep. \"Also stronger mentally. And the way I play, it's different. I feel I'm more aggressive. I did 50 winners. Eight aces, if you can imagine. It's different, and I hope to keep this also Saturday.\"Handshake after a long battle. 'It was a battle to the end'As disappointed as Kerber is sure to be, she'll leave Melbourne in much better spirits than 12 months ago. Kerber struggled to back up her phenomenal 2016 but this year the former No. 1 has already registered more top-10 wins than in all of 2017. \"Of course I had the two match points, but ... she played good, so I couldn't do anything,\" said Kerber. \"It was just a battle at the end. It's just one or two points which decides the match.\"I gave everything. This is what I will tell myself in the next few days. And looking back what I achieved in the last three weeks, it was not so bad.

Wagner did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. He previously told German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel that his conversion was a \"private matter\" but that his party had not pressured him to step down.Originally formed as an anti-euro party in 2013, the AfD has more recently campaigned on an anti-immigrant, anti-Islam platform, strongly criticizing the decision to allow more than a million refugees into Germany in 2015.

File Tuesday in that latter category.Having lifted the trophy in 2009, the Spaniard entered this year's tournament once again bidding to become the first man in the Open Era to win each of the majors twice. Alas perhaps it is not meant to be for one of tennis' greatest ever players, whose career has been punctuated by injury.Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe injury curse at Melbourne Park struck Nadal again Tuesday when the Spaniard was forced to retire against Marin Cilic with an upper right leg injury in the fifth set of their quarterfinal.The frustrated world No. 1 exited to give the sixth-ranked Cilic a 3-6 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 2-0 victory in front of a stunned, disappointed crowd at Rod Laver Arena. READ: Edmund, Mertens reach semifinalsRead MoreWhen was the last time Nadal retired in a grand slam match? In 2010 against Andy Murray at you guessed it, the Australian Open. And the woes didn't stop there. A hamstring injury in the 2011 quarterfinals against David Ferrer ended his hopes of achieving the \"Rafa Slam\" -- winning four straight majors -- while a back injury in the warmup of the 2014 final rendered him far from his usual self against Stan Wawrinka. Rafael Nadal receives a medical timeout. None of the injuries were pre-existing, unlike in some of his surprising defeats at Wimbledon. \"In this tournament already happened a couple of times in my life, so it's really I don't want to say frustration, but is really tough to accept,\" Nadal acknowledged to reporters afterward. Unable to put in his usual preparation in the off-season because of his ever troubled knees may have been a contributing factor Tuesday. Nadal skipped an exhibition in Abu Dhabi the first week of January and then the Brisbane International. Preparation goodThe 16-time grand slam winner was thus short of match fitness.   \"Maybe if I had the chance to work as hard as I worked last year, maybe will not happen,\" said Nadal. \"But was not the case. I had the knee, and I had to go slower, step by step.\"We worked as much as we could to be ready. We think we were ready. At least we were in quarterfinals only losing a set. Preparation went quite good. I was playing good tennis. I was fighting for a grand slam.\"It was a shame the contest under the lights finished with the rare retirement given the quality provided by both Nadal and 2014 US Open champion Cilic. Nadal might look back and think that if he won the second set -- and he led by a break at 3-2 -- the encounter wouldn't have gone to a fourth set  and the injury wouldn't have happened. Sadly leaving the #ausopen tonight. I'll get an MRI tomorrow morning to see what is the injury. Thanks for the support to all my fans pic.twitter.com/KwTf56G7aG\u2014 Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) January 23, 2018\n\nBut an on-fire Cilic stormed to the last four games of the second and his power game had Nadal on the ropes for most of the gripping third set. Nadal withstood two break points in two different games to lead 5-4 on serve. A tense Cilic waned slightly under the pressure of serving to stay in the set but saved a set point when Nadal failed to connect on a backhand pass with his opponent in trouble. A dramatic tiebreak ensued, featuring a punishing backhand winner from Cilic and later a crushing return from Nadal. At 5-5 Cilic overhit his forehand with Nadal stranded and when the Mallorcan put away a smash to claim the set, most justifiably thought the affair was done. Nadal celebrated in style, his bulging biceps on show in his sleeveless shirt. .@RafaelNadal takes a 2\ufe0f\u20e3 sets to 1\ufe0f\u20e3 lead!6-3 3-6 7-6(5) #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/3Uj1UPDPQ7\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 23, 2018\n\nHow could Cilic -- who had lost five in a row to Nadal, claiming one set -- recover from that? Respite for the Croatian came courtesy of the Nadal injury. Nadal suspected it happened on a particular shot in the fourth set. The trainer visited Nadal at 4-1 but ultimately it had little effect. Nadal glumly walked to the net to shake hands when he was broken at deuce in the second game of the fifth and swiped his arm in angst when at his chair. \"Start to feel the muscle little bit tired in the third, but playing normal, no limits, no limitation,\" he said. \"Then in the fourth at one movement, one drop shot I think, I felt something. At that moment I thought something happened, but I didn't realize how bad, how bad was what's going on in that moment.\"Just happened and accept the situation. That's all.\"Rafael Nadal and Marin Cilic exchange a handshake. Nadal is due to have an MRI on Wednesday to discover the extent of the injury. The result ensured no repeat of the dream 2017 final between Nadal and Roger Federer -- the Mallorcan also endured a difficult moment back then in surrendering a break lead in the fifth set -- but a repeat of the Wimbledon final remains a possibility. 'Very unfortunate'Cilic lost to Federer at SW19 when hampered by a foot injury, so he knows what it is like to be less than 100% on court. \"In the end very unfortunate because Rafa is always fighting really hard, always giving the best on the court,\" said Cilic. \"I guess in the pre-season he had some troubles with the injuries, but he came here prepared really, really well. \"He played a very good tournament. Obviously very sad for him to finish the way he did.\"To reach the final Cilic must beat the unseeded Kyle Edmund, who upset third-seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. Marin Cilic celebrates. Federer meanwhile meets 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych. The Czech star is ever dangerous but is 6-19 against Federer. In the other quarterfinal, the unlikely duo of Hyeon Chung and Tennys Sandgren battle. Chung is a prospect but had never made a slam quarterfinal while No. 97 Sandgren had never won a grand slam match prior to this fortnight.  READ: Chung beats injured Djokovic Nadal has won plenty of grand slam matches in his career but Tuesday wasn't one of them. \"Always in the tough moments, even if difficult to think about it, there is so many positive things that happened in my career,\" he said. \"It's a negative thing, but I don't going to complain because happened to me more than others. But on other hand I was winning more than almost anyone. Who will the Australian Open? Have your say on our Facebook page\"That's the real thing. But who knows, if I didn't have all these injuries...\"",

Edmund beats Dimitrov 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4Mertens upsets Svitolina 6-4 6-0 in women's draw  (CNN)There was more heartbreak for Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open as the world No. 1 retired in his quarterfinal against Marin Cilic in the fifth set. Follow @cnnsport\n\nNadal appeared on his way to the semifinals at Melbourne Park when he won a dramatic third-set tiebreak but once he became injured in the fourth set Tuesday, it was apparent his stay at the year's first major would come to an end. A limping Nadal called it quits early in the fifth set -- his first grand slam retirement since the Australian Open in 2010 against Andy Murray -- and Cilic triumphed 3-6 6-3 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 2-0 ret. If there was some comfort for Nadal's fans, his perennially troubled knees weren't the issue. Instead, it looked like his right thigh was the problem. The Spaniard, 31, has indeed endured tough times in Melbourne, despite edging great rival Roger Federer in a classic five-set final in 2009. Read MoreHe injured his hamstring in the 2011 quarterfinals against David Ferrer, hurt his back in the warmup of the 2014 final against Stan Wawrinka and has now suffered the leg issue against Cilic. Cilic next meets Kyle Edmund, who is admirably carrying the torch for Britain in the absence of the injured Murray as he upset last year's semifinalist Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. Edmund wasn't alone in springing a surprise Tuesday, with the surging Elise Mertens becoming the latest unexpected women's semifinalist in Melbourne when the Belgian crushed Elina Svitolina 6-4 6-0. The fourth seed said she was banged up, too, bothered by a hip injury. Edmund, who moved to England from South Africa aged three and is now based in the Bahamas, is just the sixth British man to go this deep at a grand slam in the Open Era and the first other than Murray since Tim Henman at the 2004 US Open. \"I am loving it right now, just the way I'm playing,\" Edmund told reporters. \"I'm 23 years old, my first grand slam semifinal. First time I played on one of the biggest courts in the world, to beat a quality of player like Grigor. Of course, all these things I'm aware of. \"They're great feelings. You don't obviously play in the semifinals of a grand slam every day, or a quarters like today.\"Henman usually doesn't travel to grand slams nowadays as he prefers to be at home but he was in attendance at Rod Laver Arena to watch Edmund's heroics.

When asked how he was dealing with all the attention, Edmund quipped: \"I know what it feels like to be Andy Murray for the last eight years!\"  But Edmund also knows it is a good position to be in because it means he is still in the tournament. First top-10 winEdmund began his Melbourne campaign by ousting US Open finalist Kevin Anderson and in defeating Dimitrov, collected his first top-10 win in 15 attempts. He faces more top-10 opposition in Cilic.

He needed five sets to beat the unheralded Mackenzie McDonald in the second round and four to see off Andrey Rublev thereafter. He subsequently defeated Australia's Nick Kyrgios in a draining, three-set night match Sunday.  \"I would say all the matches out here, especially I think from day one I was not playing well,\" said Dimitrov, the 2017 year-end winner who beat Edmund just a few weeks ago in Brisbane. \"It took me a lot of work to get back to playing a decent match once again.\"Against Nick, for sure, you played the crowd, you played him, you played your own expectations. There's a lot of components that come into the game.\"In the same time, I was at least happy I found the way. But all that behind the scenes, what you do in order for you to feel better on the court, takes a lot out of you. Doesn't matter how fit I am, I think also mentally I was just a little bit tired.\"Grigor Dimitrov was down -- and out -- against Kyle Edmund.Mertens may be a relative unknown to casual tennis fans but her start to 2018 suggests her sojourn in Melbourne is no fluke: The world No. 36 became the first player to successfully defend her title in Hobart on the eve of the Australian Open. The 22-year-old Belgian was due to play Australian Open qualifying in 2017 but because of her deep run in Hobart, had to miss out. So this is her first time in the main draw. \"Didn't really have a lot of expectations here,\" Mertens, who rallied from a 0-5 deficit against home favorite Daria Gavrilova in the second round, told reporters.\"I played a qualifier first round, so I was expected to win. Not always easy, but yeah, as it moved forward, first round, second round, I didn't really expect to be in the semis.\" In recent years at the Australian Open, Sloane Stephens, Eugenie Bouchard, Madison Keys and Mirjana Lucic-Baroni all landed in the semis unexpectedly. Mertens grew up close to Kim Clijsters' home town of Bree and idolized the four-time grand slam winner. She trains at Clijsters' academy and has been in touch with her during the fortnight. \"She has been here before,\" said Mertens. \"She has the experience, so it's always nice to talk to her. And also, for the emotions, to see what she has to tell me or can, yeah, communicate.\"Visit our tennis page for more Australian Open coverageMertens' next challenger is second-seed Caroline Wozniacki, who overcame a blip in the second set to beat Carla Suarez Navarro 6-0 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 following Nadal's defeat.

Chung upset one of the Australian Open's most successful players, Novak Djokovic, in a fierce 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 7-6 (7-3) battle that repeatedly had the crowd on its feet Monday thanks to an abundance of breathtaking, extensive rallies.Indeed with Chung's athleticism and ability to produce big shots on defense, Djokovic could have been forgiven for thinking he was playing a younger version of himself.   Follow @cnnsport\n\nThe 21-year-old Chung became the first South Korean to ever make a grand slam quarterfinal, quite the memorable sporting achievement weeks before the nation will be in the spotlight hosting the Winter Olympics. \"I'm just trying to copy Novak because he is my idol,\" Chung, who earned the nickname because he is one of tennis' few players to wear glasses, told the crowd afterward. \"Dreams (came) true tonight.Read More\"Yeah today victory for my country, I think tennis coming up after this tonight,\" he later told reporters. \"When I was young I just tried to copy Novak (Djokovic) because he was my idol.\" - Hyeon #Chung \ud83c\udf1f#AusOpen pic.twitter.com/zeyAjA6Rx0\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 22, 2018\n\nThe world No. 58 thus proved his win over fourth-seed Alexander Zverev was no fluke and he'll be favored to next beat another surprise quarterfinalist, Tennys Sandgren.The 97th-ranked American stunned fifth-seed Dominic Thiem 6-2 4-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (7-9) 6-3 after the Austrian saved a match point in the fourth set tiebreak with a courageous backhand down the line.  READ: Players sent to the 'abattoir' Trailed in each set Early deficits proved too much for Djokovic to overcome against the tenacious Chung. The six-time champion in Melbourne fell behind 4-0 in the first, 4-1 in the second and 3-1 in the third. Seeking the respite of another tiebreak in the second at 5-6, the tennis gods certainly assisted Chung with a net-cord winner on the opening point. Djokovic rallied in the game but became unhinged when contributing a double fault on game point.  In the third-set tiebreak Djokovic trailed again, 3-0, got back to 3-3, only to witness Chung engineer yet more magic by delivering a curled forehand passing shot winner that lit up the stadium. Hyeon Chung roars in delight. Overall Chung was the more efficient on break points, going 6-for-10 to Djokovic's 5-for-19. \"We do play very similar,\" said Djokovic. \"He definitely has the game to be a top-10 player, without a doubt. How far he can go, that depends on him. \"Obviously I respect him a lot because he's a hard worker, he's disciplined, he's a nice guy, he's quiet. You can see that he cares about his career and his performances. So I'm sure that he's going to get some really good results in the future.\"Despite his pedigree even Djokovic probably wouldn't have expected to leave Melbourne with the title given this was his first tournament since being sidelined by a right elbow injury at Wimbledon in July. Instead his first priority simply would have been to depart Australia healthy. But that won't be the case. Djokovic took a medical timeout due to the elbow and said it affected his serve, which he's tweaked following the elbow issue. He'll assess what to do next with his entourage that includes coaches Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek. Novak Djokovic was visited by the trainer Monday. \"Kind of end of the first set it started hurting more,\" Djokovic told reporters. \"So, yeah, I had to deal with it till the end of the match.\"I was hoping I can go through it. As I was mentioning before, as a professional athlete, you have to deal with pain at a certain level, a certain degree. You kind of get used that.\"But, yeah, I don't want to talk about my injury tonight because then I'm taking away Chung's victory, the credit that he deserves.\"He just played, in the clutch moments, some really high-quality tennis.\"Another top-10 win for SandgrenSo did Sandgren, who had never even won a grand slam match prior to this fortnight. If his victory over three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka in the second round didn't raise eyebrows -- the Swiss himself hadn't competed since Wimbledon because of a knee injury -- there was no asterisk needed Monday. In another milestone for the 26-year-old, Sandgren played -- and won -- his first ever fifth set. \"Obviously the first three matches were more than I expected,\" said Sandgren. \"This one was about as hard-fought as I've ever had a match before. My biggest match, as well, pretty neat.\"I definitely had a real pinch-me moment. Wow, this is hopefully real, you know.

The hand required stitches, and Brady acknowledged that he wasn't sure on Wednesday if he could play.Another hurdle was the opponent. The Jaguars had a 20-10 lead early in the fourth quarter at Gillette Stadium on Sunday. But Brady orchestrated another New England comeback, throwing a 4-yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola with 2:48 left, giving the Patriots a 24-20 win.Danny Amendola celebrates a touchdown with Chris Hogan in the fourth quarter.\"It's just been an unbelievable run, and I think everyone should be really proud of what we accomplished,\" the 40-year-old Brady said. \"This is a different team than last year's team. It didn't look good at 2-2, and you just keep showing up to work every day, and we sit in these chairs and Coach Belichick gets up here and he demands a lot out of us and he tries to get the most out of us every day.

It hasn't sunk in.\"Philadelphia is listed as the underdog heading into the Super Bowl, which is February 4 in Minneapolis, but that's nothing new for the Eagles. They've embraced the role and, despite being the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the Eagles weren't favored in the divisional round against the Falcons and the NFC championship game against the Vikings.In response, some of the players wore dog masks after their win against Atlanta, inspiring fans to get their own. The masks were brought out again Sunday after routing Minnesota.Beau Allen and Chris Long celebrate after the Eagles defeated the Vikings to advance to Super Bowl LII.Still, questions remain for the favorites: Will Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who left Sunday's AFC title game with a head injury, be cleared to play? Will Brady's hand heal in time?There may be an answer to the latter. Brady said he hopes to have the stitches removed from his hand this week.\"I think as soon as I get the stitches out, then I think it will be good to go,\" he said.",

He has a good team attitude as well. I'm confident it will work.\"He can play in all kinds of positions. He is very versatile and it should help us going forward.\"Mkhitaryan's route to Arsenal has taken him from his native Armenia, to Ukraine, Russia, Brazil -- where he went on trial to Sao Paulo as a 14-year-old -- then to Germany with Borussia Dortmund and now England.Under now Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund, Mkhitaryan won the German Supercup, scoring against Bayern Munich to help his club lift the title.His habit of performing on the big occasion continued in his first season at Manchester United, scoring in the final of the Europa League as Mourinho's side beat Ajax 2-0.Mkhitaryan also lifted the League Cup and Community Shield in his stint at Old Trafford.Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored with an audacious scorpion kick against Sunderland in 2016.\"I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to Manchester United players and staff and especially the fans for your love, passion and support,\" the 29-year-old wrote on Instagram. \"I enjoyed having the honor of contributing to the history of your great club by winning the Europa League cup.\"I will always cherish the memory of that moment and that match.

Al Kazeem, a winner of multiple Group 1 races, made a winning return to the track after an unsuccessful year at stud, but the trainer can't recall any horses returning from three years out.\"It's very rarely tried,\" said Osborne. \"One of the reasons is it's perceived there are lots of obstacles in the way.\"The general feeling is that once they've tasted stud life the desire to going back to being a racing animal is probably unlikely. \"There is also the physical thing -- they are full of testosterone and building muscle in different places, they're getting heavy, they're out of shape, so can you bring a horse back that's being doing that for any length of time?\"It's unheard of.\"'Ultra-competitive animal'However, Osborne and the team spotted a rare quality in Toast.\"One of this horse's strengths has always been his mentality, his desire to run faster than the horse next to him,\" said Osborne.\"We always hoped there would be some of it left and what has become quite apparent to us in the last few months is that the whole amount of that desire is still there. \"He's an ultra-competitive animal. The world is littered with talented horses that don't have the desire and they don't become champions. This horse is a very talented horse and he has desire and that's what makes him what he is.\"Gun Runner beat Collected to win the Breeders' Cup Classic in November.'Florida weather'Toast was campaigned internationally as a three-year-old in 2014, running in Dubai, New York, San Diego and Los Angeles, clinching one win, two seconds and a sixth.\"He's got plenty of air miles,\" said Osborne. \"He's a particularly good traveler. Some horses get a little bit tense with traveling, he doesn't. He couldn't care less as long as he's got his food and his drink he's happy. I'm pretty certain this horse will take it in his stride.\"The motivation for the Pegasus run is not difficult to work out.\"We like the weather in Florida,\" laughs Osborne. \"Look, it's the richest race ever run in the world. Ever. It's nine furlongs on dirt. It's his ideal distance, the ideal surface for him and it's $16 million dollars. What more do you need?\"The whole story of Toast, the moderately bred animal that was left out unsold as a yearling, then I couldn't sell him ... it's been a magnificent story to this point but it would get a bit mushy if he won a Pegasus.\"RE AD: The rise of the globetrotting racehorseVeteran jockey Frankie Dettori will ride Toast of New York at Gulfstream Park. 'Career-defining'This year's favorite is the Steve Asmussen-trained Gun Runner, who won the Breeders Cup Classic in 2017. Other Pegasus entries Collected, West Coast and Gunnevera were second, third and fifth respectively in the race at Del Mar in November, while a host of other Group 1 winners will line up for a shot at the lucrative prize at Gulfstream Park. The rest of the world has taken notice of the size of the pot, according to Stronach, who says it will be \"awesome\" should it spark a prize-money arms race with Dubai and others. Veteran Italian jockey Frankie Dettori, 47, will once again ride Toast and will bring a wealth of big-race experience, according to Osborne.\"Clearly Gun Runner is the outstanding mile-and-a-quarter dirt horse in America at this moment in time,\" said Osborne.\"What Toast may do is enable people to compare the California Chrome/Shared Belief era with the Gun Runner era.\" Photos: Horse racing's new powerplayBelinda Stronach is the brains behind Saturday's Pegasus World Cup, which was the world's richest horse race last year -- with a $16 million prize purse.Hide Caption 1 of 7 Photos: Horse racing's new powerplayA former politician, Stronach ran to become leader of the Canada's Conservative Party in 2004.

Her medals hang alongside a framed photograph of her with President Putin at the Sochi Games.\"I've never doped, I'm against doping,\" she adds.Olga Zaytseva says she is determined to clear her name.Zaytseva retired from the sport in 2015, but she is appealing in the hope of keeping that 2014 medal and also to protect her legacy. \"For me it's very important to prove it and I'm doing everything possible to prove that I was a clean athlete. And that all my results were achieved with me being clean,\" she says.Many of the athletes appealing say they are part of a \"collective punishment\" against Russia, which historically has been an Olympic superpower, both at the Summer and Winter Games.\"In my opinion, this evidence is fabricated and it comes out of nowhere. I think these are some people's fantasies, and I don't know why they believe them. These accusations are unreal, and I can't comprehend them, they're baseless,' says Zaytseva.JUST WATCHEDUS skiers back Russia doping punishmentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHUS skiers back Russia doping punishment 01:36Those 42 Russian athletes are likely to have a tough fight on their hands in Lausanne.Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov will testify against the athletes, even though his life is under \"serious threat\", his lawyer Jim Walden tells CNN from his office in New York.Rodchenkov was the head of the Sochi lab during the 2014 games, and he has detailed epic \"systematic manipulation\" to swap drug-tainted urine samples for clean ones, though Russia has consistently denied the allegations of a state-backed doping program.Rodchenkov is now in a US witness protection program and will testify from a secure location.  Walden is helping  Rodchenkov prepare his testimony and is a loud advocate of \"clean sport.\"\"We have heard the 'I'm clean, I'm clean, I've been tested a hundred times' so many times in the history of doping,\" said Walden, who places a lot of the blame on the Russian state. \"Dr. Rodchenkov indicated quite clearly that at some level the athletes probably had no choice but to participate in the the doping system.\"Russia's investigations committee says Rodchenkov gave drugs to athletes, \"who were unaware they were taking banned substances.\"  President Putin has described him as \"a man with a scandalous reputation.\"Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren will also testify. His report for the World Anti-Doping Agency laid bare a system that allowed more than a 1,000 athletes to cheat, despite the repeated Russia denials. McLaren says they have more than enough evidence -- that of Rodchenkov as well as their own findings -- to back up the Russian doctor's conclusions and dismisses claims by the athletes that their samples were tampered with. \"We checked the DNA and the DNA is consistent with their DNA,' McLaren told CNN from his home in London, Ontario.\"There is no doubt in my mind that they are their samples and they were the samples that they produced when they were at the Olympic Games in Sochi.\"Olga Zaytseva won a silver medal at Sochi.Meanwhile, Zaytseva fights on, determined to clear her name for the sake of her children.\"It's very important to me and my kids should know. I want to remove this stain because it's a real smear on my clean career. I want to remove it, I want my children to never see anything about this, to hear anything about this.'As for Kryukov, he hopes for a return to the glory of the Olympic stage and reclaim his status as Russia's golden boy. He will appear in court on January 25 to plead his case. A decision is expected on or before January 31 -- less than two weeks before the opening ceremonies in Pyeongchang.",

        "content": "(CNN)Germany's leaders have taken a crucial step towards breaking a deadlock that has prevented the formation of a new government since elections four months ago. At a special party congress in Bonn, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) voted to begin formal coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU alliance, a move that brings a new, Merkel-led administration closer to reality.Although Merkel's political alliance emerged as the largest group in last September's elections, its support was significantly dented. Since then, Merkel has struggled to put together a viable coalition.Some 600 SPD delegates debated the motion for several hours on Sunday before voting to launch official talks that will likely lead to a renewal of the CDU/SPD partnership of the last four years -- a so-called grand coalition (\"GroKo\").'The least bad option:' Germany limps toward a new governmentAt the party meeting, 362 delegates voted \"yes\" while 279 voted against the talks.Read MoreA \"no\" vote would have forced Merkel either to govern alone in a weak minority government or set the country on a path to new elections.Speaking at a press conference in Berlin, Merkel expressed hope for the coalition.\"The most important thing for us in these coalition negotiations is that Germany build a stable government which is able to handle future questions and can find answers to them,\" she said.SPD leader Martin Schulz initially ruled out a new grand coalition in September after his party's share of the vote also slumped. He repeated his pledge two months later, after initial coalition talks between the CDU/CSU and two smaller parties collapsed.Schulz insisted that voters had given the grand coalition \"the red card\" and that his party, whose share of the vote fell to its lowest level since World War II, needed to rebuild itself in opposition.He also was concerned that rejoining Merkel in government would mean the far-right Alternative for Germany, which entered the national parliament for the first time with 12.6% of the votes, would become the main opposition party.Why Germany still doesn't have a new government, four months after voteBut with few viable options remaining and the prospect of new elections looming if a government could not be formed, Schulz came under pressure to reconsider and make his party available for talks.Delegates at a party conference in December voted by a large majority to begin exploratory discussions, which concluded last week when the parties reached a preliminary deal. Since then, Schulz has been on the road, lobbying SPD delegates around the country to support him in what was expected to be a knife-edge vote.Many voters seem unhappy with the prospect of a new grand coalition. A recent poll from public broadcaster ARD showed that 52% of respondents did not think another \"GroKo\" was a good idea. Nevertheless, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani hailed the agreement.\"The political agreement in Berlin is positive news for stability across Europe,\" Tajani said in a tweet. \"Germany is an important player in advancing the necessary reform process for Europe to be more effective in providing answers to citizens.\"Talks will begin in the next few weeks. Once a coalition deal has been reached, SPD delegates will vote on whether to approve it.If that final hurdle is cleared a new government will be formed, but that is unlikely to happen before April or May.",

And why wouldn't they? As presidential candidate, Trump promised to turn US policy towards Russia on its head.He criticized Russia's Cold War nemesis, NATO, a mainstay of US military power in Europe. He had spoken of working with Russia in Syria, where Moscow supports Bashar al-Assad, whom Washington opposes.Trump hinted at easing painful sanctions imposed by Washington on Moscow over its intervention in Ukraine, even at recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea -- the Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014.Read MoreTrump seemed, in other words, to be a business-minded president with whom Moscow thought it could do a deal.Wrong.Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, with US President Donald Trump at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 7, 2017.In fairness to Russian lawmakers, it didn't take long for the high hopes to fade and for the disillusionment to set in.State television was fawning in its Trump coverage in the early months of his presidency, only to abruptly drop all mention of the man once it emerged the widely anticipated d\u00e9tente in US-Russian relations wasn't going to happen.Trump's failure to deliver on his promises about Russia -- amid congressional and federal investigations into members of his administration potentially colluding with Russian actors interfering with the 2016 election -- and the tightening of US sanctions all came as a bitter disappointment to the Kremlin. Trump has consistently denied any collusion with Russia.Despite Trump often praising the Russian leader, those around President Putin always said they never viewed the incoming Trump administration with rose-tinted spectacles.But behind the Kremlin's walls, hopes had clearly been dashed.JUST WATCHEDPutin: Claims of election interference are 'anti-Russia hysteria'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPutin: Claims of election interference are 'anti-Russia hysteria' 01:33In July last year, I asked President Putin whether he regretted, given the poor state of US-Russian relations, Donald Trump's election.\"What we see is merely the growth of anti-Russian hysteria,\" he told me.\"And, yes, I regret it,\" he added, \"because acting together we are more able to solve the acute problems that exist in the world.\"Even in July, Putin understood that the Russian dream of a sympathetic US president who would help Moscow restore its status as a major power was slipping ever further out of view.In the next few weeks, the US Congress is expected to consider a further ratcheting up of economic sanctions against Russia and the Mueller probe may yield ever more clarity on Russian meddling in US politics.So if Moscow is going to mark the first anniversary of Trump's entering the Oval Office, we can be certain of one thing: It's unlikely to do so with a celebratory glass of fizz, or with any sense of optimism in the air.",

As unlikely as it sounds, it has happened at the Australian Open. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAfter Caroline Wozniacki fended off a pair of match points and rallied from 1-5 in the third set against little known Croatian Jana Fett on Wednesday, world No. 1 Simona Halep saved three against Lauren Davis in a 4-6 6-4 15-13 classic that was no less dramatic Saturday. Maria Sharapova couldn't escape later, ousted by tennis' most in-form player, Angelique Kerber. Many thought that match would be a classic too but the twice grand slam champion needed only 64 minutes to dispatch Sharapova 6-1 6-3. Three times in the third set, incredibly, Halep couldn't serve it out against her 76th-ranked rival and it looked like the Romanian would pay the ultimate price as she served at 10-11, 0-40. READ: Players sent to 'abattoir' Read MoreREAD: Wozniacki's great escapeBut Halep dug deep to hold. Davis then took a medical timeout due to a toe injury and Halep officially progressed to the fourth round when a forehand down the line from the American went wide. At three hours, 44 minutes it wasn't the longest women's match in time at the Australian Open but it did tie the longest match in games alongside Chanda Rubin's 1996 victory over Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.\"I'm almost dead,\" Halep told the crowd in her on-court interview at Rod Laver Arena. Simona Halep was understandably drained after her marathon win.In her briefing with reporters, Halep admitted she thought she was on her way home when staring at the trio of match points. \"Honestly, I thought it's over at that moment, but it was good because I relaxed my arm and I served pretty well those three balls,\" she said. \"And then she took the medical (timeout). I had time to calm down. I had come to believe again, to restart the mind.Lucky number\"And also I found more energy after that three minutes' break. But at 13-all when I took the game, I said it's my lucky number.\"I think in the past I wouldn't have fought that hard. Maybe when she had the match balls, maybe I would have lost it. But now I improved in that way and it makes me really happy that I change myself in a good way.\"She has often credited her much respected coach, Darren Cahill, for improving all facets of her game. So how was your morning, @SimonaHalep? \ud83d\ude4a\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udcaa Amazing effort by both ladies. Epic match. Really proud of you Simo \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc4a #teamhugs pic.twitter.com/mjE5CjtacK\u2014 Darren Cahill (@darrencahill) January 20, 2018\n\nThankfully for Halep and all parties involved, the blazing temperatures of the previous two days in Melbourne dipped considerably. From a high of 40.2 degrees Celsius Friday, Saturday's peak reached just under 25 degrees. That can happen in Melbourne, where the weather is famously unpredictable.  The win maintained Halep's chances of winning that first major but unlike Wozniacki -- who is still seeking a first one as well -- her immediate prospects might not be rosy. Halep -- the WTA's most popular player last season as voted by fans -- continues to play on an injured left ankle and leg after taking a tumble in the first round. Spending so much time on court Saturday won't have helped, despite the momentum garnered by such a marathon outing.  \"It's sore,\" Halep said of the ankle. \"I felt the pain. It's not recovered. It's impossible to recover after. After this match I think tomorrow is gonna be worse, but I just push, push myself, and we will see what's gonna happen.\"Lauren Davis is clapped off court by HalepAnd Halep certainly sits in the tougher section of the draw, with Karolina Pliskova and Kerber her possible foes deep into the second week. Naomi Osaka is the dual French Open finalist's next opponent, the Japanese crushing -- 'crushing' is apt given the pace on her groundstrokes -- local hopes by defeating Ashley Barty 6-4 6-2 in a match shifted from Rod Laver Arena to Margaret Court because of the length of Halep's slugfest. Davis -- one of the shortest elite players on the tour at 5-foor-2 -- didn't appear too downbeat in defeat. Keep in mind that in her lone other confrontation with Halep, she claimed only two games. \"There is a lot to take away from that match,\" said Davis, whose father Bill is a prominent cardiologist who wrote the foreword to Novak Djokovic's book, 'Serve to Win.' \"I played really, really well. Left all that I had out there on the court, and I did all that I could do.\"Kerber too good for SharapovaSharapova's tussle with Kerber was, on paper, meant to be Saturday's marquee tussle. Former No. 1 Kerber has sizzled to begin the season after a difficult 2017 while the Russian is a five-time grand slam winner who -- even if she is seeking top form after returning from a drug suspension last year -- remains one of tennis' top competitors. Kerber however never allowed Sharapova to settle, setting the tone by breaking in the first game. Sharapova found respite by recovering a break early in the second but the 21st seed broke again for 5-3 and served it out for a 12th successive win, including the Hopman Cup. \"I think there are a lot of things that I need to get better at and improve on,\" said Sharapova. \"But looking at the overall picture, the overall beginning of this year, finishing the tournament, first thing is that I'm healthy. \"That, to me, is a big thing because I'll be back on the practice court, I'm not starting from zero. There's a lot to build from.\"It just wasn't Maria Sharapova's day. Alexander Zverev followed Halep on centre court and was upset by South Korea's Hyeon Chung 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 2-6 6-3 6-0 to continue his struggles at majors. The German fourth seed has received much hype but at the grand slams he has yet to make a quarterfinal or beat top-50 opposition. Three of the 20-year-old's last five losses at slams have come in five sets. \"I have some figuring out to do, what happens to me in deciding moments in grand slams,\" he said. \"I'm still young, so I got time. I definitely have some figuring out to do for myself.\"Two threats to Roger Federer in the Swiss' quarter are now out. Following the departure of David Goffin, a weakened Juan Martin del Potro was swept aside by his fellow thumping baseliner Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-3 6-2. Del Potro said he felt jaded following his second-round win. Djokovic medical timeoutDjokovic, in Federer's half, was untroubled by Albert Ramos Vinolas, going through 6-2 6-3 6-3. In his first tournament in six months as he recovers from an elbow injury, the Serb though required a medical timeout in the second set for what may have been a hip issue. \"Nothing major,\" he insisted. \"I haven't played in six months. We have to take that in consideration. I mean, this didn't happen too many times in my career that I have maybe some tensions in the muscles or whatever, some kind of physical challenges.\"Novak Djokovic needed a medical timeout but said it was nothing serious.Federer improved to 17-2 against Richard Gasquet in a battle of one-handed backhands, prevailing 6-2 7-5 6-4. Tennis was also a winner. Or 'Tennys' that is. Tennys Sandgren is the unlikely last American man standing, overcoming Zverev's countryman Maximilian Marterer 5-7 6-3 7-5 7-6 (7-5).

        "content": "(CNN)Six hundred delegates from Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) will descend on the city of Bonn this Sunday for a special party congress.All eyes are on one agenda item: A vote on starting official coalition negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and their more conservative sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Just six weeks ago, the SPD voted overwhelmingly to start the initial exploratory talks. This time, it looks to be on a knife edge.But if the vote passes, the collective sigh of relief is likely to drown out any celebrations.Merkel, Schulz reach deal for German coalition talks after all-night marathonIt's nearly four months since Germany's federal election, in which support for the country's two largest parties slumped leaving Merkel with a mathematical and ideological quandary in her effort to form a new government. Read MoreTalks with the liberal FDP (Free Democratic Party) and Green Party collapsed, leaving a renewal of the so-called \"GroKo\" (Grosse Koalition or Grand Coalition) as the only option -- unless Merkel opts to rule alone in a minority government or put the country on the path to new elections.\"No one is particularly excited about another grand coalition,\" said Christoph Nguyen, political scientist at Free University Berlin. \"But most of the alternatives are even less pleasant to consider.\"\"It's a bad option, but probably the least bad option.\"Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured here on a vandalized campaign billboard, has struggled to build a new government since elections in September.\nGermany's had this government for the last four years. So what's the problem?After leading the SPD to its worst election performance since World War II, Martin Schulz immediately and categorically ruled out a new GroKo.Voters had called for change, he argued, and the party needed time to regroup and redefine itself in opposition. Launching into a new GroKo would also mean granting the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) a set of privileges enjoyed by the largest opposition party -- which Schulz was keen to avoid.After the FDP walked out of coalition talks two months later, Schulz was quick to stifle rumors of a U-turn.\"I am not available for entering a grand coalition,\" he said. \"It's quite clear that the grand coalition got the red card.\"But, under pressure from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who urged the country's leading politicians not to rush headlong into new elections, Schulz soon began to change his tune.Schulz voted in December alongside his SPD colleagues to start exploratory talks with Merkel's party.Leopold Traugott, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe, thinks he had little choice. \"The SPD is stuck between a rock and a hard place,\" he told CNN. Frank-Walter Steinmeier: Can Germany's 'anti-Trump' end Merkel's political crisis?With the party currently polling at its lowest ever level, new elections aren't a good option. But during the last GroKo, the far-right AfD grew into the country's third-largest party, with the SPD and CDU/CSU losing votes to fringe parties on both the left and right.\"Another four years of this government is likely to strengthen that trend,\" Traugott said. \"The political landscape is becoming more fragmented -- the fringes keep growing.\"That's definitely bad news for Schulz -- and the youth wing of his party isn't allowing him to forget it.Traveling around Germany this week, lobbying for \"yes\" votes, Schulz has been greeted by groups of protesting \"Jusos\" (young social democrats), chanting \"Never, never, never again GroKo.\"Their hashtag #NoGroko has been gaining significant traction on social media.The Jusos have a \"somewhat justified fear that the SPD is ruling itself out of existence,\" said Nguyen, \"that they will continue to lose votes until they become a minority party.\"A new GroKo -- which is fast becoming the status quo in German politics and is widely considered an obstacle to genuine debate and real reform -- seems unpopular among the general public too.A recent poll from public broadcaster ARD showed that 52% of respondents did not think another grand coalition was a good idea.\"There's dissatisfaction about the way the main parties have ruled and the way they've disregarded criticism,\" said Traugott. Is anyone happy about it?Merkel's sigh of relief will likely be the loudest if the motion passes on Sunday. She has repeatedly stated her preference for a new GroKo -- and the sooner the better. \"She knows how to handle the SPD,\" said Traugott. \"It's a comfy solution for her.\"Despite their many public protestations, the opposition parties are likely to be pleased too. They all profited from the demise of the CDU/CSU and SPD after the last grand coalition and will be hoping for more of the same.One branch of the AfD has already made its ambitions clear. A new GroKo \"could make the #AfD the second strongest party in the polls,\" the party's Thuringia branch wrote in a tweet on Monday.Co-leaders of the AfD's parliamentary group Joerg Meuthen (L) and Alice Weidel (R) will likely be pleased about the prospect of a new grand coalition.It is already relishing the prospect of being the largest opposition group in parliament, which the party's co-chairman, Joerg Meuthen, described in a Facebook post as the \"only bright spot\" in a so-called \"LoKo\" (\"loser coalition\").Indeed, politicians of all stripes -- well versed in the practice of attacking a CDU/SPD government -- have already begun launching grenades from left, right and center.Germany's future: Merkel without MerkelismThis is \"not the renewal project for our country that we need,\" said FDP leader Christian Lindner in a video posted to Twitter, while Green Party co-leader Cem Oezdemir accused the CDU and SPD of behaving like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, forever splitting up and remarrying.If Merkel and Schulz do eventually limp over the finish line -- which probably won't happen before April or May even if things go well -- their new GroKo is likely to be weaker than the old one and even easier to attack.The parties involved lost more than 100 seats between them at the last election -- and they're facing four opposition parties now, instead of just two.Moreover, the very visible \"internal split\" in the SPD won't heal easily, according to Nguyen, and Merkel, who seemed almost indestructible before the election, is weaker too, despite weathering this particular storm better than most politicians.So how should the SPD vote on Sunday? Nguyen sees little hope either way: \"They're damned if they do and damned if they don't.\"",

        "content": "Story highlightsAlize Cornet overcome by the heat in MelbourneCornet finishes her match but loses in third roundRafael Nadal continues to cruise Grigor Dimitrov, Elina Svitolina also advance  (CNN)It was another scorcher at the Australian Open and for the second day in a row, a French player bore the worst of it then took aim at organizers. Follow @cnnsport\n\nAfter Gael Monfils suspected he sustained a heat stroke in Thursday's blazing conditions, Alize Cornet crumpled to the court Friday as temperatures peaked at 40.2 degrees Celsius in Melbourne. A visibly distressed Cornet stayed down for a few moments in her third-round match against Elise Mertens on Hisense Arena before gingerly walking to her chair and receiving medical attention.The world No. 42 -- who famously upset Serena Williams at Wimbledon four years ago -- was able to continue but lost to the Belgian 7-5 6-4. Alize Cornet was in distress at the Australian Open Friday. Afterward Cornet said the players were being sent to the \"abattoir\" by being asked to play in such weather. She echoed Novak Djokovic's sentiments, too, that the tournament's extreme heat rule needed a revamp. Read MoreREAD: 'Brutal' conditions in MelbourneREAD: Venus exits Home hope Nick Kyrgios, Grigor Dimitrov, Caroline Wozniacki and Elina Svitolina progressed to the last 16 but Jelena Ostapenko was upset, while Andreas Seppi and Kyle Edmund -- opponents in the next round -- defied the heat to win five setters.  \"They sent us a little bit to the abattoir,\" Cornet told French media. \"I get the impression that they are waiting for a drama to change the rule, a drama that can happen anytime in these conditions. \"Maybe there can be a coalition of players and we say we are boycotting, that we're not going (to play).\"We are not robots.\"Tournament respondsThe organizers didn't use the roof on any of the three courts where it was available, going against the suggestion of Rafael Nadal -- who crushed 28th seed Damir Dzumhur 6-1 6-3 6-1 and has yet to surrender a set -- two days ago. They defended their stance in a statement issued following Cornet's ample criticism. Tournament referee Wayne McKewen said the heat rule was close to being implemented Friday but that the temperature subsequently dropped. \"Protecting our players and the fairness of the competition is paramount in these conditions, which we acknowledge can be challenging,\" tournament director Craig Tiley said in the statement, adding that all policies are reexamined on a regular basis. Tournament director Craig Tiley has come under fire. \"I've said before that many of the players train hard for these conditions and expect to be able to play,\" said Tiley.\"Their preparation is admirable, and although many have found the past couple of days challenging, they've worked hard to compete at this level.\"The conditions of play are established prior to the event, and this includes the Extreme Heat Policy. We start the event with this set of rules and policies in place, and in the interest of fairness, can't change them halfway through.\"Of course we all understand that to compete in these conditions is not easy. It's also challenging for our team, particularly those working out on court, including the ball kids and officials.\"We do everything we can to help ease everyone's discomfort in these conditions.\"The tournament appeared to have a backer in likely tennis' most popular player, Roger Federer, who largely stayed out of the heat by playing in Thursday's night session but has found himself in sweltering Melbourne conditions in the past. Roger Federer played under the lights Thursday. \"We know it can be very hot here in Australia,\" said the 19-time grand slam winner. \"I remember the days when we had four days of 40 degrees in a row a few years back. Now we got two. Most of the guys now have to play in 30-plus degrees conditions.\"It's definitely a challenge. It's hard to prepare for that in some ways. But you know when you come down here that can happen.\"Sure, I'm happy I played at nighttime. But ... I would back myself playing during the daytime also. Used to go to Dubai when it was 45. Thirty eight seems almost okay.\"The problem is at that temperature, sometimes your body just reacts funny just because it does. It is hard to get out of it, that feeling of not feeling well. Sure, I was watching the other players suffer. As long as nothing bad happens, it's all good.\"Thankfully for players, fans and organizers, the temperature fell to 24 degrees at 8 p.m. local time Friday and the forecast the rest of the event looks manageable. However, a spike is expected next Friday, Saturday and Sunday but on those days only one singles match is scheduled and all are at night. Kyrgios wins in front of Will SmithKyrgios moved ever closer to facing Nadal in the semifinals by downing 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-5) in front of actor Will Smith during the night session at Rod Laver Arena. Kyrgios usually prefers the smaller Hisense Arena, which can be more boisterous. The hugely talented, controversial Aussie has been composed through three rounds, getting over temporary blips in his game and not letting distractions bother him. He was clutch against one of his idols, Tsonga, saving a set point in the third-set tiebreak and coming back from 2-5 in the fourth-set tiebreak. Tsonga, not Kyrgios, became irate early in the fourth set after someone in the stands yelled at him in the previous tiebreak while he faced a set point. He duly earned a code violation. \"Between the first serve and the second, the guy was talking to me and telling me, 'You are under pressure now, you are under pressure now,' when I was bouncing my balls,\" Tsonga told reporters. \"That's it. I lost it and I (went) a little bit crazy.\"The guy was feeling safe because he was, you know, upstairs. I just told him, 'Come now to see if you feel the pressure or not.' That's it.\"Asked on court afterward who he'd like to play him in a movie, Kyrgios opted for, bang on cue, Smith. \"When I saw him out here I was so nervous... People think I'm cool but I wanted him to think I was the coolest.\" @NickKyrgios declares his love for Will Smith in his post-match interview \ud83d\ude05 #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/NuRKsNWg1F\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 19, 2018\n\nKyrgios may not be lacking in confidence against Dimitrov in the next round, given he beat him in Brisbane several weeks ago. But \"he's played well here in the past,\" said Kyrgios. \"I know it's going to be incredibly tough, but I'm not going to think about it right now.\"Dimitrov played in the afternoon sun and got the better of Andrey Rublev 6-3 4-6 6-4 6-4, gaining some revenge after the young, big-hitting Russian won their encounter at the US Open. Shade on the main show court provided a little respite.  Dimitrov was in control at a set and 4-2 but then had to overturn a 2-4 deficit in the third.   The Bulgarian entered Melbourne as the third seed after winning the year-end championships. But he is bidding to reach a first grand slam quarterfinal since making the semis and losing a marathon match to Nadal 12 months ago. He was nearly upset in the second round, stretched to 8-6 in the fifth set by US qualifier Mackenzie McDonald.

Svitolina -- considered by some to be the favorite in the women's draw after winning in Brisbane -- needed just 59 minutes to advance. Free lessonAsked what she took away from the experience, Kostyuk joked: \"A lot. How much you have to pay Svitolina to have a one-hour lesson, so I got it for free.\"After saving two match points and rallying from 5-1 down in the third set against Jana Fett, second-seed Wozniacki had an easier time Friday, dispatching 30th-seed Kiki Bertens 6-4 6-3. But French Open winner Ostapenko was upset by Estonia's 32nd seed Anett Kontaveit 6-3 1-6 6-3. Edmund, 23, is the last British player remaining in singles after Andy Murray's injury withdrawal and Johanna Konta's upset loss Thursday. He outlasted Nikoloz Basilashvili 7-6 3-6 4-6 6-0 7-5, with the turning point perhaps coming when the world No. 49 broke the Georgian on his eighth chance in the second game of the fourth. Veteran Seppi has enjoyed his finest grand slam moments in Melbourne, claiming the scalp of Federer in 2015 and Kyrgios last season.Friday was certainly another high, as the world No. 76 defeated the huge-serving Ivo Karlovic 6-3 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (3-7) 6-7 (5-7) 9-7 in nearly four hours.It was a brave effort, though, from Karlovic, who ousted Yuichi Sugita 12-10 in a fifth set Wednesday.

The November Test ended in a 23-23 draw, ensuring France wasn't condemned to the same fate as South Africa at the 2015 World Cup. The result, however, was symptomatic of larger problems afflicting France, a rugby-proud nation with a rich history of success in the sport.While its wealthy club sides have thrived in recent years, the national team has endured a torrid run of form. \"The results are extremely disappointing,\" French captain Guilhem Guirado, who has lead the side since 2015, tells CNN World Rugby.Read More\"It's very difficult, especially as a captain.

When the Englishman waved goodbye to an illustrious playing career in 2014, he did so as thousands of French fans sang his country's national anthem in the Stade de France. After retiring from national duty, Wilkinson enjoyed five years at Toulon where he endeared himself to the supporters on the French Riviera. \"Sir Jonny,\" as he affectionately became known, steered the side to two European Cup victories and a Top 14 title.South African winger Bryan Habana, who played alongside Wilkinson in each of those finals, goes all far as calling him the \"most-loved Englishman I've ever seen in France.\"Jonny Wilkinson (left) celebrates winning the Heineken Cup with Bryan Habana and a number of Toulon fans in 2014.Both Habana and Wilkinson joined Toulon as part of an ambitious project, driven by millionaire owner Mourad Boudjellal, to bring the world's best players to the South of France. Boudjellal succeeded, and a bulging trophy cabinet is just one part of that success.\"The crowds just totally embrace the flare, the love of the game, and the passion,\" says Habana.\"Just to get a glimpse of what this team has done for the city, for the supporters, of what they meant through this region -- it's really special.\"Habana, who scored 67 tries in 124 matches for South Africa, joined a side dubbed rugby's \"galacticos\"In the Toulon squad that won the 2014 European Cup final, for example, 10 players had won over 50 caps for their countries -- four South Africans, two Australians, and one each from England, Argentina, New Zealand and Italy.It's a trend that has emerged in French over the past decade. Roughly 43% of Top 14 players are thought to be foreign, and over half the players at four clubs have come from overseas.

You are my type of woman. I will make you orgasm all night.\"'I will fight this'Writing on her Facebook page, Muller said that she is being sued for \u20ac50,000 (about $61,235) in damages and \u20ac10,000 ($12,239) worth of legal fees.Women who marched, one year later: 'We are exhausted but we're here and we're still marching'Read MoreThe move comes despite Brion admitting he made the comments and making a public apology in a column published in Le Monde newspaper on December 30.\"Eric Brion has finally changed his strategy and decided, against all decency, to take me to court,\" she wrote.\"I will fight this until the end with the help of my lawyer, and I hope that this trial will be an opportunity to hold a real debate on the ways to combat sexual harassment.\"Read: Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of #MeTooSpeaking to CNN Friday, Muller's lawyer said his team would prove the statements were not defamatory.Brion maintains that he has never worked with Muller but her lawyer, Alexis Guedj, believes his client has a strong case.\"Of course, there was no work relationship between my client and Eric at the time, but since they were at a work event when everything happened, it can still be considered as sexual harassment in the workplace.\"JUST WATCHEDGretchen Carlson: Sexual harassment 'an epidemic'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGretchen Carlson: Sexual harassment 'an epidemic' 11:40Brion's legal representatives told CNN they would not speak to the media until they are ready to disclose more information.Writing in Le Monde late last month, Brion admitted making \"inappropriate remarks\" to Muller, \"very late at night, during a drink-fueled cocktail party evening, but I did it only once.\"He added: \"I liked her.

Monfils suspected that he suffered a heat stroke in his outing against Novak Djokovic Thursday, when the thermometer -- according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology -- peaked at 39.9 degrees Celsius in Melbourne. Commentators claimed temperatures on court were even higher, soaring to 60 degrees Celsius. READ: Wozniacki's great escapeRead MoreREAD: Sharapova beats Maria The Frenchman managed to see out his second-round match after a visit from the tournament doctor, but he lost to Djokovic 4-6 6-3 6-1 6-3 in another eventful encounter between the pair who have both recently been hampered by injuries.  \"I got super dizzy,\" said Monfils, who fell to his 15th straight defeat by the 12-time grand slam winner. \"I think I had a small heat stroke for 40 minutes. Couldn't feel fresh.\"Gael Monfils tried to stay cool Thursday in Melbourne. 'Brutal'Monfils trained in the heat of Miami in the off-season -- a base in the past for three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray -- but said it was no match for what he encountered on Rod Laver Arena. \"Was pretty hot in Miami,\" said Monfils. \"I thought I was very good. I'm telling you, I was dying on the court for 40 minutes.\"Even six-time Australian Open champion Djokovic described the weather as \"brutal.\" He has had his own issues with the heat, memorably at the 2009 Australian Open against Andy Roddick and 2014 US Open against Kei Nishikori. \"It was obvious that we both suffered today,\" the Serb, playing his second official match after missing six months with an elbow problem, told on-court interviewer Jim Courier and the crowd. \"Really tough conditions, brutal, especially for the first hour and a half. \"I was coming into the match knowing it was going to be a big challenge for both of us. Just hanging in there, trying to use every single opportunity that is presented. Obviously he wasn't at his best at the end of the second and the entire third set.\"Ice towels were the order of the day for players, including for Novak Djokovic. Courier -- the former No. 1 and Australian Open winner -- told Djokovic he would limit his questions so the 30-year-old could escape the heat, prompting this reply: \"You can ask me as many questions as you want in the locker room, ice bath.\"Rafael Nadal, who contests his third-round match Friday when the temperature is forecast to rise to 42 degrees Celsius, called for organizers to use the roof on the three courts that have cover at Melbourne Park -- as much for the fans as players. That didn't happen Thursday. There was continuous play as the tournament's extreme heat policy wasn't implemented. For the Aus Open the Extreme Heat Policy comes into effect once the ambient temperature exceeds 40C and the Wet Bulb index (WBGT) exceeds 32.5C. The health of our players is of paramount concern to us, and we are constantly monitoring conditions. Let's hope it cools down!\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 18, 2018\n\nDjokovic later told reporters the heat rule should be revisited since players were being pushed to the limit. \"There is a rule about index, combination between temperature and humidity. I'm not so sure about that,\" he said. \"I think there are certain days where you just have to, as a tournament supervisor, recognize that you might need to give players a few extra hours until (the heat) comes down. \"People might say, 'Well, at this level you have to be as a professional tennis player, fit,'\" he added. \"It's the beginning of the season. You kind of work and train hard to be able to sustain these kind of conditions, to be tough. But I think there is a limit, and that is a level of I guess tolerance between being fit and being, I think, in danger in terms of health.\"It was right at the limit.\"'No shame in giving up'Monfils spared a thought for those in action Friday. \"Good luck to them,\" he said. \"I think sometimes, yeah, we put our body at risk. Just be smart. If you have to give up, it's not a shame.\"Monfils appeared to be the player most troubled Thursday. No players retired and men's fifth seed Dominic Thiem even engineered a two-set comeback, rallying against  American Denis Kudla 6-7 (6-8) 3-6 6-3 6-2 6-3. Two-time grand slam champion Garbine Muguruza and Johanna Konta were upset in the open women's draw but neither blamed the conditions, while Maria Sharapova set up a blockbuster clash with resurgent 2016 champion Angelique Kerber. Stan Wawrinka lost to 97th ranked American Tennys Sandgren 6-2 6-1 6-4, clearly not at his best in his first event since knee surgery and his own six-month layoff, but pal and defending champion Roger Federer eased past Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4 6-4 7-6 (7-4) to close play Thursday. JUST WATCHEDDoes he have the best name in sports?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDoes he have the best name in sports? 02:00\"I wouldn't have minded to play during the day,\" Federer said. \"I hope I thrive under those conditions, too, because if you want to get to the top you gotta be able to play in all conditions.\" Wimbledon champion Muguruza suffered from full body cramps amid the heat in Brisbane earlier in January and then withdrew mid-tournament in Sydney, foreshadowing a rocky Australian Open. Sure enough, world No. 88 Hsieh Su-wei of Taiwan defeated Muguruza 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 and twice grand slam semifinalist Konta -- downed by Hsieh at the French Open last May -- succumbed to lucky loser Bernarda Pera 6-4 7-5.

Sharapova returned to Melbourne Park this year after sitting out the 2017 edition due to a drug suspension.\"I was watching this tournament with a box of Kleenex next to me, sick,\" the five-time grand slam winner said. \"So I feel like I transported myself into the TV this year and I'm finding myself on Rod Laver Arena competing. A lot of things to smile about.Great to be back\"I wanted to be here. I got myself here. Yeah, it's great to be back.\"Women's No. 1 Simona Halep showed no ill-effects from the ankle injury she sustained in the first round, comfortably dispatching 2014 Wimbledon finalist Eugenie Bouchard 6-2 6-2 in the night session.Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open winner, overcame a medical timeout for a left leg injury to oust Karen Khachanov 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (0-7) 6-4.

Beginning Wednesday, the ex-49ers quarterback said he will give $10,000 a day for the next 10 days to an organization of his choice, and one celebrity will match that donation.The Colin Kaepernick Foundation announced the first $10,000 will go to Silicon Valley De-Bug, a community-organizing, advocacy and multimedia storytelling organization in San Jose, California. Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant has made a matching $10,000 donation.\"KD, thank you so much, brother, for continuing to uplift and empower our communities,\" Kaepernick said in a video posted to his Twitter account. \"We love and appreciate you.\"Read MoreMy brother Kevin Durant @KDTrey5 has generously decided to match my donation of $10,000, with $10,000 of his own, making the total donation to De-Bug $20,000!!!

He drew fierce criticism from some by kneeling but also inspired other athletes -- from elementary schools to professional leagues -- to join his movement.In March, Kaepernick opted out of his 49ers contract and became a free agent. No NFL team signed him. Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL in October, accusing it of collusion.\"With or without the NFL's platform, I will continue to work for the people,\" Kaepernick said in December when accepting the 2017 Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. \"Because my platform is the people.\"Kaepernick has kept a list on his website of the recipients of his donations and how the money has been earmarked. A large portion of the donations have gone to grass-roots groups, including veterans, the homeless, students, immigrants, single mothers, families affected by violent crime, those fighting for reproductive rights and those impacted by incarceration.Kaepernick's money has been distributed all over the country, including to groups in New York, Phoenix, Chicago, Dallas, Baltimore, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Los Angeles and Milwaukee as well as organizations in smaller communities such as Fayetteville, North Carolina, and Lithonia, Georgia.Another donation, according to Kaepernick's website, was $50,000 for a plane to deliver food and water to famine areas of Somalia.",

        "content": "(CNN)A former Nazi officer known as \"the bookkeeper of Auschwitz\" has been told he must serve out his four-year prison sentence, despite lodging an appeal for clemency.Oskar Groening's plea for mercy was denied by German prosecutors in Lueneberg on Wednesday, one day after his appeal was made public.Groening, 96, was sentenced in 2015 after being found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War II.He was accused of counting the cash found in the belongings of new arrivals at the camp, where more than 1 million Jews died, and sending it to Nazi headquarters in Berlin.Holocaust memorial built outside home of far-right German politicianDuring the trial, Groening admitted that he was \"morally complicit\" in the crimes but denied that he was legally guilty.Read MoreA request by Groening's lawyers for his sentence to be suspended on the grounds of old age was rejected by the prosecutor in Hannover last August.Groening can appeal Wednesday's decision to the Hannover Ministry of Justice, but it is not yet clear if he will do so.According to Hannover prosecutor Kathrin Soefker, Groening will have a week to turn himself in once the Hannover Justice Ministry receives official notice from the local prosecutor. If that deadline passes, police will be sent to carry out the sentence.Soefker told CNN that Groening remains at home and has not yet served any time in prison. Groening's lawyer declined to comment on the case.Auschwitz concentration camp is now home to a Holocaust museum.Door open to further trials?The trial of the \"bookkeeper\" is one of a number of criminal proceedings recently carried out against former Nazis.In 2016, Reinhold Hanning, a former SS guard at Auschwitz, was convicted of having assisted in the deaths of 170,000 people and sentenced to five years in prison.The trial of Hubert Zafke -- then 95 and accused of being an accessory to at least 3,681 murders at the same camp -- also began in 2016, but ended in September last year after he was deemed no longer fit to stand trial due to dementia, according to Reuters.About six million Jewish people died in Nazi concentration camps during the war. Hundreds of thousands of Roma people, homosexuals, disabled people and other persecuted minorities were also killed.Nazi-era art dealer's hidden hoard on show for the first time Only in the last few years have former Nazis who were not directly involved in the killings been successfully convicted. The legal doctrine under which Nazis can be tried in Germany began to evolve with the conviction in 2011 of John Demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 Jews in the Sobibor death camp in Poland.After the sentencing of Groening in 2015, Efraim Zuroff, the chief Nazi hunter for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, told CNN that the conviction extended that doctrine even further and opened a door to further trials of alleged Nazi criminals.As a guard, Demjanjuk dealt with prisoners and moved them around, but Groening had a desk job, Zuroff explained. Groening was, he once said, a mere \"cog in the gears.\"But that was enough to convict him, making new prosecutions more feasible, according to Zuroff.CNN's Atika Schubert, Claudia Otto and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.",

I was kind of lucky.\"Then I felt her tighten up just slightly. I thought to myself, 'You know what, at this point, make her win it, don't give it to her.' When I managed to win it to 5-2, I said, 'Okay, I'm still alive. She still has four more balls to win in a row or in the game.' \"I was like, 'Just try and stay aggressive.' That was that.\"It's the type of win that could be the spur for Wozniacki, the former world No. 1 who is still chasing an elusive first grand slam title. \"At 5-1, 40-15, I felt like I was one foot out of the tournament.

Sibling rivalry provided extra motivation. \"Growing up, I never wanted to lose, and the worst was to lose to my brother,\" she said. \"Giving him the opportunity to be ahead, being able to talk st to me -- sorry for the word -- was not pleasurable. \"So I think from that point, you just learn and fight. You don't give up, even if it's a board game, tennis, soccer, whatever it is.\"Wozniacki was unquestionably one of the form players heading into 2018, winning the year-end championships in October for the first time and seeing her ranking climb to No. 2 -- her highest spot since 2012. Not having her good pal Serena Williams in the field bodes well for Wozniacki -- as well as everyone else. READ: New mom Serena skips MelbourneWozniacki's next challenge is to get past 30th seed Kiki Bertens in round three.   Another comebackAlthough not as dramatic as Wozniacki's comeback, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also rallied against Canada's Denis Shapovalov -- one of tennis' breakout artists in 2017 -- in his 3-6 6-3 1-6 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 victory. The 2008 finalist was almost out of the tournament at 2-5 in the fifth set but claimed five straight games to gain some revenge after Shapovalov ousted him at the US Open. Grigor Dimitrov seemed to have a comfortable second-round pairing but the third seed was pushed all the way by a flat-hitting US qualifier, Mackenzie McDonald, 4-6 6-2 6-4 0-6 8-6 in an outing that finished 15 minutes shy of midnight on Rod Laver Arena -- with another match to come. Dimitrov landed the biggest title of his career at the men's year-end championships in November yet in grand slams, hasn't made a quarterfinal since advancing to the semis in Melbourne 12 months ago. His opponent on Friday, Andrey Rublev, beat the Bulgarian at the US Open so he'll know about the danger the Russian presents. READ: Bulgaria rejoices after Dimitrov's London triumphMeanwhile, 15-year-old Marta Kostyuk became the youngest player to reach the third round of a grand slam since 1997 when the Ukrainian qualifier defeated Australia's Olivia Rogowska 6-3 7-5. At the other end of the age spectrum, the evergeen Ivo Karlovic became the oldest man in 40 years to make the third round at the Australian Open when the 38-year-old edged Yuichi Sugita 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (3-7) 7-5 4-6 12-10 in four-and-a-half hours. The huge serving Croatian struck 53 aces and saved 11 of 12 break points a year after outlasting Horacio Zeballos 22-20 in a fifth set in Melbourne. Ivo Karlovic won a marathon in Melbourne for the second straight year. Men's No. 1 Rafael Nadal couldn't serve out his contest against Leonardo Mayer -- a flashy shotmaker who tested the Spaniard at the US Open -- in the third set but recovered in the tiebreak with a pair of sizzling passing shots for a 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-4) win. Ahead of his tussle with 28th seed Damir Dzumhur on Friday, Nadal called for organizers to use the roof on the three main showcourts that have cover at Melbourne Park. He said, too, that he wouldn't be practicing outdoors Thursday. \"If it's extreme conditions, I hope the organization puts the roof,\" he told reporters. \"That's all. I think it's a health issue, even if I like sometimes (to play in the heat). \"When it's too much, becomes dangerous for the health. I would not like to see here retirements, conditions that create a bad show for the crowd. \"The crowd is suffering ... in the courts that we have the roof, why not put the roof when the conditions are so extreme?\"Rafael Nadal advanced in straight sets over Leonardo Mayer. Nick Kyrgios like Nadal initially failed to serve out the third set against Viktor Troicki on his favored Hisense Arena but wrapped proceedings up in a tiebreak, 7-5 6-4 7-6 (7-2). That tiebreak featured chair umpire James Keothavong inadvertently being struck in the head by a soft Troicki backhand. He was okay. Umpire takes one for the team #AusOpen pic.twitter.com/leo5UVtq14\u2014 #AusOpen (@AustralianOpen) January 17, 2018\n\n A fan had been earlier ejected for yelling out during play, Kyrgios wasn't pleased with excess noise stemming from Keothavong's microphone and at another stage, a helicopter hovered above. It led Kyrgios to proclaim afterward: \"The helicopter, that's when I was thinking like, 'Of course, it's at my match.' It's just hovering there. Of course it is.\"The combustible 22-year-old raised expectations of a long stay in Melbourne when he won the title in Brisbane and has appeared mostly composed through two rounds, not surrendering a set. The 17th seed is Tsonga's next opponent and could tangle with Nadal in the last four.

Cornet has a history of engineering surprises at majors, memorably ousting Williams at Wimbledon in 2014. Belinda Bencic was unable to follow up her first-round upset of 2017 finalist Venus Williams, Serena's older sister.

(CNN)A library in Ankara gives new meaning to the notion that books are timeless. Garbage collectors in the Turkish capital have opened a public library comprised entirely of books once destined for the landfills. The library, located in the \u00c7ankaya district of Ankara, was founded after sanitation workers started collecting discarded books.Read More For months, the garbage men gathered forsaken books. As word of the collection spread,  residents also began donating books directly.  A garbage collector in Ankara browses for books at the library.Initially, the books were only for employees and their families to borrow. But as the collection grew and interest spread throughout the community, the library was eventually opened to the public in September of last year.  \"We started to discuss the idea of creating a library from these books. And when everyone supported it, this project happened,\" said \u00c7ankaya Mayor Alper Tasdelen, whose local government oversaw the opening of the library. Today, the library has over 6,000 books ranging from literature to nonfiction. There is also a popular kid's section with comic books and an entire section for scientific research. Books in English and French are also available for bilingual visitors.  The library is housed in a previously vacant brick factory at the sanitation department headquarters. With an aged brick fa\u00e7ade and long corridors, the space was ideal for a library.The library is housed in an old brick factory at the headquarters of the city's sanitation department. Books are loaned out on a two-week basis, which can be extended if needed, according to state media.  \"On one hand, there were those who were leaving these books on the streets. On the other hand others were looking for these books,\" Tasdelen said.  The collection grew so large the library now loans the salvaged books to schools, educational programs, and even prisons. \"Village schoolteachers from all over Turkey are requesting books,\" Tasdelen said. The city government also hired a full-time employee to manage the library.  The library is often filled with children of municipal employees and students from nearby schools. There is also a lounge area for readers and chess boards for visitors. The library is especially popular with cyclists who bike in the nearby valley and break for a quick read and cup of tea.  \"Before, I wished that I had a library in my house. Now we have a library here,\" Serhat Baytemur, a 32-year-old garbage collector, told state media.Garbage collectors started the library with books salvaged from the trash.",

Not least because of the large number of those charged,\" North Sealand police inspector Lau Thygesen said in a statement. \"We have taken the case very seriously as it has major implications for those involved when such material is spread.\"The majority of those charged shared the video a couple of times, but some did so hundreds of times, police said.

Many jurisdictions have taken a tough line on the dissemination of explicit images and videos starring people under 18, regardless of the age of those doing the sharing. In early 2016, three US teens were arrested and accused of involvement in a \"sexting\" ring that circulated sexually explicit images and videos of other students, sometimes for money.

        "content": "St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN)In pre-fabricated buildings, down a muddy track on the outskirts of St. Petersburg lies a world of hidden North Korean labor in Russia.On a construction site near their shabby living quarters, a group of laborers building apartment blocks told CNN they are from North Korea. Working in conditions the US State Department calls \"slave-like\" labor, they are among an estimated 50,000 workers in Russia from the isolated state.US diplomats say up to 80% of their earnings are sent back to Pyongyang to help prop up the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.North Korean workers employed on this construction site are very likely to send funds back to their families.The United Nations has expressed concern that this money \u2014 totalling $500 million a year from North Korea's expatriate workers globally \u2014 helps to fund Kim's missile and nuclear programs.According to a UN Security Council resolution aimed at curbing North Korea's nuclear ambitions, countries are allowed to employ quotas of North Korean workers but not to authorize new work permits. Read MoreUnder the most recent round of sanctions, Resolution 2397 states that all North Korean workers must be sent home by December 2019, cutting off a crucial source of income for Pyongyang. However, because it is unclear how many North Korean workers are currently in Russia, analysts say it is not clear whether all of them will go home.The restriction placed on workers was part of a package of sanctions passed by the Security Council last December, which included limiting North Korea's oil imports and expanding bans on exports to the country of industrial equipment, machinery and metals.The tougher sanctions were implemented following another North Korean missile test. Launched on November 29, the Hwasong-15 reached the highest-ever altitude by a North Korean missile, putting the entire US mainland in range, state media said.JUST WATCHEDWatch North Korea's huge new missile launchReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch North Korea's huge new missile launch 00:51Tighter sanctionsAlthough Russia backed the December UN resolution against North Korea, one senior Russian lawmaker has expressed doubts about the effectiveness of sanctions as a way to limit Kim Jong Un's ability to develop his weapons program. \"Like North Korea, Russia is also under economic sanctions. I am sure that these economic sanctions, including American sanctions, have never had any impact on our domestic or foreign policy,' Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, told CNN.\"Sanctions are the wrong instrument. This is not the solution to the problem of North Korea,\" he said.Tensions easingNorth Korea dubbed the latest round of sanctions an \"act of war\" but since they were introduced, tensions have eased on the Korean peninsula with the start of the first face-to-face talks between North and South Korea in almost two years. South Korean President Moon Jae-In credited US President Donald Trump's pressure campaign with producing the right environment for talks but North Korea's state news agency hit back, saying that the breakthrough came with better inter-Korean relations. A North Korean worker walks through the building site.\"It is unbearable to look at South Korea's servile attitude of thanking Trump as if the results of inter-Korean talks happened because of their international sanctions and pressures,\" said the report.Russia has been widely accused of undermining the spirit of the sanctions on Pyongyang by employing North Korean workers and the Russian Foreign Ministry has defended the country against reports that it has provided North Korea with shipments of fuel, saying, under the sanctions, countries are allowed to supply oil under a \"quota.\"Sen. Konstantin Kosachev denied any suggestion that Russia was not committed to the UN resolution on North Korea, telling CNN that Russia firmly adheres to \"any sanctions which are supported by the Security Council.\"Russian lifelineHowever, according to Alexander Gabuev, chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center, Russia's support of sanctions is begrudging and stems from a desire to prevent pro-western regime change in Pyongyang. \"I don't think Russia really believes in the sanctions,\" Gabuev said. \"There comes a point when Russia cannot afford to be the villain\" and rip up sanctions against Pyongyang, Gabuev said, as \"this may worsen an already bad relationship with the United States.\"\"While signing the international sanctions,\" he said, \"Russia fights to make them as toothless as it can.\"North Korean workers eat lunch in their canteen.Ahead of the adoption of additional sanctions against North Korea last December, Russian President Vladimir Putin was reported by the South Korean presidential spokesman as saying that Russia was against cutting off oil supplies to North Korea.\"Keeping Pyongyang afloat is an important task,\" Gabuev said. \"The country cannot do without imported fuel, which is why Russia concentrated its diplomatic effort on this, in order not to squeeze the regime too hard.\" On the building site in St Petersburg, CNN approached camera-shy workers having their lunch in a canteen with signs in Korean on the walls. Positions as overseas laborers are coveted, according to Gabuev, as workers can provide for their families as they take home better wages abroad. But although Russia insists that the money earned by workers is used to help North Koreans to survive, critics believe the reason it continues to employ them is because it wants to avoid pro-western regime change.\"The uncontrolled collapse of North Korea means either refugee flows or war, but also ultimately a reunified Korea which is allied to the United States,\" Gabuev told CNN. \"This could mean US troops on the Russian border which is definitely not something Russia would like to see,\" he added.Moscow is engaged in a delicate balancing act \u2014 formally backing international sanctions to pressure the North Korean regime, but also extending Pyongyang a crucial lifeline.

Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as an independent country.Read MoreHowever after Ivanovic's death, the Belgrade delegation left Brussels to return to Serbia, the Serbian government said in a statement.Regional Chief of Police for Northern Kosovo, Zeljko Bojic, said in a statement that at 9:15 a.m. a burned out Opel Astra vehicle was found, with special units conducting an investigation of the site.Serb President: 'An act of terror' Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic described the murder as \"an act of terror\" and vowed to find those responsible.\"Serbia will take all necessary measures, and I promised the same to Oliver Ivanovic's wife, and we will find the killer or killers,\" Vucic said in a  statement following an emergency meeting of the National Security Council.Vucic said that Serbia had made a request to EU and UN missions in Kosovo to participate in the investigation.Major test for Kosovo's rule of law The Head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Mission in Kosovo, Jan Braathu, said the murder was \"profoundly distressing\" and a \"major test for the rule of law in Kosovo.\"\"He (Ivanovic) was among the most prominent Kosovo Serb representatives for almost two decades,\" Braathu said. \"He demonstrated relentless engagement for the benefit of his community and has been a valued interlocutor in Kosovo.\"\"I have had the privilege of knowing him personally over the years and have always admired his intellect, composure, and commitment. To see that a politician can be murdered in cold blood in 2018 in Kosovo is a devastating thought.\" Ivanovic was facing a retrial for alleged war crimes against ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo war.The war between 1998 and 1999 led to thousands of deaths and the displacement of nearly 90% of Kosovo's population.This story has been updated to clarify the details around Ivanovic's death.

Novak Djokovic, Maria Sharapova, Stan Wawrinka and Petra Kvitova all returned to Melbourne Park and all but one reached the second round Tuesday ahead of one of the city's summer heat waves. In a roller-coaster ride not unusual for a Kvitova match, the twice Wimbledon champion fell 6-3 4-6 10-8 to Andrea Petkovic in nearly three hours. Follow @cnnsport\n\nDjokovic fared better. He is the undisputed King of Melbourne, with six of his 12 grand slam titles capped in glory at Rod Laver Arena. Amid sunshine in hot but not overpowering conditions on the second day of the fortnight, the Serb cruised past American Donald Young 6-1 6-2 6-4 -- on the secondary Margaret Court Arena -- in his first official match since being sidelined with an elbow injury at Wimbledon in July. The Serb sported a grey sleeve on his serving arm and owns a new, abbreviated service motion, one that lessens the impact on his right elbow. Read MoreThere is, noticeably, less take back and serve rotation, but Djokovic didn't seem bothered as he faced a mere two break points. His first serve speed, too, averaged around 114 miles per hour, higher than his figure when he won the US Open in 2011 and Madrid Masters in 2016, for example. Djokovic said before the tournament that surgery wasn't out of the question if he experienced discomfort in the future but simply judging by Tuesday's performance, he looked sharp. Playing several matches, though, will provide a different test. It was just a week ago that his participation in Melbourne looked in doubt after skipping an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and pulling out of Doha as the defending champion. Different emotions\"I did have various emotions, mostly good ones,\" said Djokovic, whose ranking has dropped to 14th.  \"Excitement, joy, gratitude for being able to have an opportunity to compete. Not a while ago, about three weeks ago, I didn't know whether I'm going to play Australia or not.\"I was looking forward to get out on the court and compete. I did feel nerves and I did feel a bit skeptical whether I'm going to be able to continue playing well as I have the last couple weeks in the practice sessions.\"But I thought I controlled it well. I didn't get carried away by anything, even though I was a couple times in the match that things could have maybe gotten different way and different direction. I just didn't allow it to happen. Very, very solid performance.\"Djokovic spent as much time in his post-match media conference discussing a players' meeting last week, one in which he reportedly said that the players should seek more prize money at grand slams and set up a separate players' union. Those are issues that have surfaced in the past in men's tennis. READ: Americans struggle on Day OneREAD: Murray targets Wimbledon returnAccording to the Daily Mail, Djokovic asked ATP officials who were present -- that is standard -- to leave the meeting and brought a lawyer with him. The newspaper also said boycotting next year's Australian Open was an idea that was mentioned. Djokovic -- who encounters another player affected by injury, Gael Monfils, in round two -- refuted much of the claims. \"I saw that you've portrayed me as someone who is very greedy, asks for more money and wants to boycott,\" Djokovic told reporters.\"What happened is that we players just wanted to have us players talk about certain topics. I don't think there is anything unhealthy about that. We get together, 100 players get together two or three times in a whole year. This is one of the places where we get together.\"We wanted to use this opportunity to speak about certain subjects and see how everyone reacts to that, and I guess see what opinions are. There was no decisions being made. There was no talks about boycott or anything like that.\"Sharapova beats Maria You could have been forgiven for thinking that Sharapova was playing herself Tuesday, glancing at the TV scoreboard accompanying her match  -- she was facing Germany's Tatjana Maria and won comfortably 6-1 6-4. Maria Sharapova is playing Tatjana Maria right now in the #AusOpen, but it just looks like the scoreboard is biased. pic.twitter.com/n8ieH0fRvJ\u2014 Matt L. Stephens (@MattStephens) January 16, 2018\n\nIt was two years ago that Sharapova tested positive for meldonium at the Australian Open and ultimately served a 15-month ban. She is still searching for top form after being limited to eight tournaments when she returned to the circuit in 2017. \"I feel like I'm building,\" the five-time grand slam winner told reporters. \"I feel like with every tournament and every week I have different feelings about different things. Some things are coming a little slower than I wanted. Some things I feel good about.\"Still feel like I'm building physically and getting the match play in. I'm motivated to, with every week, to keep taking in what I have learned from that week and using it to my advantage in the following tournament. As long as I have that in my mind, it's okay.\"The unseeded Sharapova faces a tough challenge in the second round against 14th seed Anastasija Sevastova, who beat the Russian at the US Open prior to the tables being turned in another marathon in Beijing. Wawrinka -- the 2014 champion in Melbourne -- sported a scar on his surgically repaired left knee as he, too, contested his first match since Wimbledon but battled past Ricardas Berankis 6-3 6-4 2-6 7-6 (7-2).  \"I still have some pain,\" said the Swiss. \"It depends the way I'm moving, how I push on it. In general, it's going the right direction. That's the best news.\"The news wasn't as good for Kvitova, who missed last year's tournament after she was attacked in her home by a knife-wielding intruder and needed surgery on her left, playing hand. Her career was in jeopardy. Kvitova loses heartbreaker Kvitova appeared to be on course for victory Tuesday when she saved three match points at 4-5 in the third set. Unable to serve the contest out once, Kvitova got another chance at 8-7. But leading 15-0, Kvitova missed a short forehand into the net with Petkovic completely out of position and never recovered. A former world No. 9, Petkovic could battle world No. 1 Simona Halep in the third round. Halep won in straight sets over 17-year-old Australian wildcard Destanee Aiava 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 but it was far from smooth for the popular Romanian. Halep trailed 5-2 in the opener -- having to save two set points -- then hyper-extended her left leg and rolled her left ankle in the same motion in the second set. Halep next meets Eugenie Bouchard, with the Canadian ending a nine match losing streak by topping Oceane Dodin 6-3 7-6 (7-5). Although Bouchard has struggled since her breakout year of 2014, the former Wimbledon finalist defeated Sharapova in Madrid in a \"grudge match\" last year.

The 31-year-old physical education teacher's lung-busting record was set at the UK's Tiverton Golf Club last August and was recently ratified by Guinness World Records. His time betters a mark of one minute 52 seconds set by fellow Brit Phil Naylor back in 2005.  \"I probably spent four months working on my sprinting,\" Jeffs told CNN. \"When I first tried (to break the record) I got quite close and thought it would be easy.\"Read MoreThe rule for the record attempt, according to Guinness World Records, is that the hole must be at least 500 yards long. The clock begins the moment the ball is first struck and stops when it drops into the hole. The golfer can ride in a cart, but must finish the hole with as many clubs as they started with.Jeffs chose to sprint between shots instead of riding, but on the day of the record attempt he almost ran out of puff.  \"I only had three attempts,\" he explains. \"My first two failed because I went out a bit too hard.\"Jeffs on course during his speed golf record attempt. The nine handicapper had just enough in the tank for one final attempt, taking three shots to get onto the green before stopping the clock with the simplest of tap-ins after his first putt rolled up millimeters short of the cup.As the news sunk in Jeffs dropped to his knees in joyful exhaustion before being swamped by well-wishers including his wife Kelly who had been holding the flag. Jeffs and his wife Kelly savor the record-breaking moment at Tiverton Golf ClubThe new landmark means that British golfers now hold the individual and team world records. Last October, European Tour pros Ian Poulter, Matt Fitzpatrick,  Tyrrell Hatton and Matthew Southgate clocked a time of 32.70 seconds at the Regnum Carya Golf & Spa Resort, Belek Antalya, Turkey.  Keeping 'fit and healthy'Jeffs is an enthusiastic promoter of speed golf -- a fast-paced version of the game where players complete 18 holes in about 80-90 minutes. The father of two is hopeful his new record-breaking feat will inspire his daughters and encourage more people to take up the sport. Visit CNN.com/golf for more news and features\"I feel like speed golf can improve people's golf and also keep them fit and healthy,\" he said.\"I want to have a legacy for my daughters and I also want to people to recognise British SpeedGolf.

I usually order with my boyfriend, and to be honest, he answers the door most of the time and this has certainly never happened to him.\"The incident took place on Saturday after Midwinter and her friend ordered takeaway from one of their favorite restaurants via the Just Eat app.According to the messages, the driver even asked Midwinter if she had a boyfriend, and signed off saying: \"Good night bby see you next time when I get your meal.\"Midwinter said she didn't feel comfortable going directly to the restaurant as she was worried about repercussions.\"I did not want them to find out who made the complaint -- after all my privacy had already been breached by the and how was I to know they would not tell the driver it was me who filed the complaint?\" she said.But Just Eat's response left Midwinter \"extremely disappointed,\" she said. \"I was offered \u00a35 for the 'inconvenience' and when I said that was insulting, they offered me \u00a310,\" Midwinter said.Just Eat, which works with over 20,000 restaurants and takeaways across the UK, according to its website, said it was \"appalled\" by the handling of the initial complaint.\"This lacked empathy and does not reflect our policies or the way Just Eat would expect something like this to be dealt with,\" the company said in statement provided to CNN.Just Eat added it had launched an investigation with the partner restaurant in question.\"This driver has acted in a way that does not represent Just Eat and our core values,\" Just Eat said. \"We are also speaking to this customer offline and if the customer decides this is a criminal matter and reports it to the police, we will of course assist the police with any investigation.\"'First complaint of its kind'The Information Commissioner's Office said it was looking into the allegations as a possible breach of the Data Protection Act. A statement on the ICO's website read: \"If a customer's phone number is used for reasons for which it was not originally taken, it could be a breach of the Data Protection Act. Organizations have a legal duty to make sure personal data is only used for the purposes for which it was obtained. We are aware of reports of an incident involving Just Eat and will be looking into it.\"An ICO spokesman told CNN it was the first complaint of its kind.Midwinter's tweet gained a lot of traction on social media, with dozens of women sharing similar experiences and raising questions of privacy and data protection.\"The scary thing is the sheer number of females who have had similar experiences -- a few with Just Eat, but generally this issue is much bigger and more widespread than I initially anticipated,\" Midwinter said. \"We trust companies with our personal details and for them to be used in this way is unacceptable.\"",

After a storming season last year, we thought Venus Williams would go deep at this year's Australian Open... The world No. 5 lost in the first round to Swiss Belinda Bencic, making this year's tournament the first since 1997 without a Williams sister. . . . #venuswilliams #ausopen #tennislife #melbourne #australia #grandslam #graphicdesign A post shared by  CNNSport (@cnnsport) on Jan 15, 2018 at 1:25am PST Having climbed to seventh in the rankings in 2016, back and wrist injuries heavily contributed to the Swiss dropping to 317th last season. Bencic, however, finished 2017 by going 28-3 at all levels and combined with Roger Federer to help Switzerland win this month's Hopman Cup. Federer's parents were in the 20-year-old's player box at Rod Laver Arena. The Swiss took the final four games of the first set, then rallied from a break down in the second to register a first win over Williams in five attempts. \"I don't think I played a bad match. She just played above and beyond. I just have to give her credit for that.\"@Venuseswilliams  - @AustralianOpen 2018 #AusOpenhttps://t.co/83sjChTtue @raviubha @cnnsport pic.twitter.com/zI5vV0gcA2\u2014 Gianluca Costantini (@channeldraw) January 15, 2018\n\n\"It was amazing, this match,\" Bencic told reporters. \"I think the level was great. Also she beat me four times before, so I was really happy, took my chance this time.\"Obviously just happy to be back playing. It was a very, very long time when I was out. I couldn't wait to come back, so it means a lot.\"READ: Legend wants arena renamed READ: Murray undergoes hip surgeryGiven Bencic's form, don't discount a long stay in Melbourne. With Serena out of action -- just as she was for the final three majors of 2017 -- the women's draw is fairly wide open as Vandeweghe's conqueror, Timea Babos, acknowledged. \"In women's tennis, I think we see it -- anything can happen when there is no Serena Williams,\" said the Hungarian, who triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-2. Vandeweghe received a code violation from chair umpire Fergus Murphy, as she wasn't ready to take to the court because she was eating a banana. Vandeweghe said she had to wait for the bananas -- a good source of potassium -- to be brought courtside, hence the delay. Eight straight losses for Stephens\"Not going to get too down,\" said Stephens after her latest defeatStephens was ruled out of this month's Brisbane International with a knee injury and lost in straight sets to Camila Giorgi in the first round in Sydney, hardly the best preparation for Melbourne. Not serving out the match at 5-4 in the second set Monday was the obvious turning point and the 13th seed went out to China's Zhang Shuai -- somewhat of a fan favorite at the Australian Open -- 2-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 to suffer an eighth straight defeat. \"I did everything that I could to be ready for Sydney last week and for here,\" Stephens told reporters. \"It's just unfortunate, but it's definitely only the beginning of the season, first two tournaments. Not going to get too down.\"Zhang was close to quitting tennis following an 0-for-14 skid at grand slams. Her fortunes changed, though, when she upset Simona Halep in the first round in Melbourne two years ago and last week she narrowly missed out on a seeding for Melbourne, coming in ranked 34th. Rafael Nadal progressed to the second round in 94 minutes, downing 37-year-old Victor Estrella Burgos 6-1 6-1 6-1. It was a flawless start from  the world No. 1, who is playing the Australian Open for the first time without competing at a warmup tournament. Blame his knees. It was a routine win for Nadal Visit our tennis page for more tennis storiesNadal drew as much attention for his attire, going back to a sleeveless look for the first time in nearly a decade. The man Nadal lost to in last year's gripping men's finale, Federer, begins his quest for a 20th major Tuesday against Slovenia's Aljaz Bedene. Six-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, plays his first official match since Wimbledon against Donald Young. If Young topples Djokovic, it would no doubt bring some joy to American tennis in Melbourne following Monday's dreadful start.",

From the moment it's created, a painting begins to deteriorate; dirt accumulates on its surface, its colors lose their luster and its paint cracks and flakes.Conserving precious artworks is the job of the restorers at London's Courtauld Institute of Art. Their work is a combination of science and, appropriately, art, as they combine cutting-edge technology and painstaking manual techniques.  \"Inevitably, pictures will need to be cared for and those works that have been cared for, we retain them, we benefit from them and we can still see them,\" said professor Aviva Burnstock, head of conservation and technology at The Courtauld. \"Things that have been very neglected -- we've lost them. That's why conservation is important.\" Photos: The Courtauld Gallery's collection includes impressionistic and post-impressionistic masterpieces, as well as works from the Middle Ages and Renaissance.Shown here: Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, by Vincent Van Gogh.

And despite technological advances, it's impossible to completely restore an artwork to the way it originally looked. \"A painting will change from the moment it's made so there's no chance of restoring it to the way it looked when it was first made,\" said Burnstock. \"But you can appreciate how it might have looked by doing the research that's needed and present it in the best way it can be presented.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)President Donald Trump blamed his decision not to visit the UK on a \"bad deal\" cut by the Obama administration over the relocation of the US embassy in London.\"Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for \"peanuts,\" only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!\" Trump tweeted.But Trump was wrong to pin all of the blame for the move on former President Barack Obama.It is true that the final sale of the imposing Chancery Building in central London and the contract to build a new structure south of the River Thames were signed off under the Obama administration.But the original decision to move the embassy from its prime location in the plush Mayfair district to a regeneration site in Battersea was made by the administration of a Republican President, George W. Bush. Read MoreHere's how the deal went down:1. The decision move the US embassy from its Grosvenor Square location was made in the second term of the Bush administration. The modernist concrete structure, designed by Finnish architect Eero Saarinen and opened in 1960, was proving harder to secure in an age of terrorist threats. Part of Grosvenor Square had already been closed to vehicles in order to protect the building, and its inadequacies were quickly becoming obvious.The London embassy is also believed to have been the only one in the world that was not owned outright by the US government. In a quirk of UK property law, the land on which the old embassy stood was owned by the property company of a British aristocrat, the Duke of Westminster, and leased to the US, which merely owned the bricks and mortar above.So in 2008, before Obama took office, the decision was made to purchase outright a site in the regeneration neighborhood of Nine Elms, in the Battersea district of London.\"In the end, we realized that the goal of a modern, secure and environmentally sustainable embassy could best be met by constructing a new facility,\" former US ambassador Robert Tuttle said of the decision to move.The US embassy in central London is pictured on November 6, 2009.\n2. In 2009, under the Obama administration, the historic Mayfair building was sold to Qatari Diar, a real estate investment arm of the government of Qatar. It's now set to be converted into a luxury hotel. In the same year, a shortlist of nine architecture firms were selected to take forward the plans for the new embassy.3. In 2010, Philadelphia architecture firm KieranTimberlake won the contract. The new site, a 12-story glass cube replete with moat and gardens, will house around 800 staff and is expected to receive 1,000 visitors daily. It has been cautiously welcomed by critics: \"For all its security features and monolithic presence, the Nine Elms complex is as benign as could be hoped, allowing the public to wander off the street into its garden and meander along a waterside path, if always under the watchful eye of armed guards,\" concluded The Guardian's respected architecture writer, Oliver Wainwright.The newly constructed US embassy building in Nine Elms.4. But the billion-dollar cost of the building -- likely the most expensive US embassy in the world -- raised eyebrows in the US. In 2015, members of Congress criticized the project's hefty price tag, blaming the State Department. At a House oversight committee hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and chairman of the committee, slammed the administration's construction process as mismanaged, resulting in a building with an \"opulent-looking\" glass facade that favored aesthetics over security\". The building was ultimately financed for by selling other US government properties in London.5. The new embassy is due to open its doors to the public on January 16, 2018. In an article for London's Evening Standard, published the morning after Trump tweeted his decision to abandon his visit to the UK, the US ambassador Robert Johnson tried to strike a reassuring note about the new era. \"The United States is re-investing in the Special Relationship,\" he said. \"President Trump has told me he views the UK as one of the closest friends and partners of the American people we serve. Our new embassy reflects not just America's special history with the UK but the special future ahead of us as we advance the prosperity and security of both our nations.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)During a meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, US President Donald Trump reportedly blasted a number of nations as \"shithole countries.\" Then he turned his attention to Norway. Trump singled out the wealthy Scandinavian nation, whose Prime Minister he met the day before, and said that he would welcome immigrants from the oil-rich, majority white country.But despite the President's offer, it's unlikely that an influx of Norwegians will begin to settle in the US anytime soon. Norwegians become American citizens at a much lower rate than most other countries.From 2007-2016, less than 1,000 Norwegians naturalized as US citizens, according to US Department of Homeland Security data. That's an average of 100 Norwegians a year -- less than .000001 percent of Norway's population. Read More665 Americans became Norwegian citizens between 2006-2016, according to Statistics Norway. READ MORE: World reacts to Trump's vulgar commentWhy might that be?Norway has a rich economy, generous social welfare programs, a highly-rated (and free) education system, and exemplary gender parity practices, to name a few of the benefits. And to top it off, the United Nations named Norway the \"happiest country in the world\" last year. The US came in 14th place.Where are the world's happiest countries?Norway, a major oil producer, has harnessed its energy earnings into a giant pension fund worth over $1 trillion. The government uses the fund, one of the largest in the world, to divvy out pensions and other government expenses.Norway also boasts low unemployment, with only 4% of the labor force without a job according to Statistics Norway. Although US unemployment nearly mirrors that, at 4.1%, wages have not grown accordingly with inflation and to counter the cost of living. And when it comes to health care, Norway has their citizens covered. The government has a system of universal health care which covers all citizens for free, regardless of their socioeconomic status, country of origin or where they reside. In the US, patients wanting to see a doctor will shelve out at least $30-200 per visit, depending on their insurance plan, according to OECD data. For women, Norway ranks the second best in the world, according to the 2017 World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report. The annual report examines gender imbalances in economics and the workplace, education, politics and health. The US ranks 49th on the list. Norway's footballers sign historic equal pay agreement Norwegian sports took a further step in the right direction for gender equality in December, when the Norwegian Football Association decided they would pay the women's team the same as the men's team, a deal thought to be the first of its kind in international soccer.Norwegians also love the great outdoors; hiking across some of the country's 46 national parks is something of a national pastime. It's unlikely that many Norwegians would agree with Trump's decision to cut funding to the US National Parks Service and slash the size of some of the country's most beloved monuments. In December, Trump signed a proclamation that split Utah's famed Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by roughly 45%.'Why would Norwegians want to immigrate here?'None of this was lost on social media users familiar with the benefits of living in Norway. \"If you want to attract more immigration from Norway, you're going to need to provide Universal Healthcare, Free College, and robust social safety nets.

He must sign a series of waivers every few months to maintain the suspension of sanctions on Iran, and to keep the deal fully intact. After a meeting of European diplomats in Brussels on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made a direct appeal to the US to sign the latest waiver, due Friday. He said France remained dedicated to the agreement.\"All parties should uphold the deal,\" he said, speaking through a translator. \"It is also necessary that our US allies do the same and should be seen doing the same,\" Le Drian said after meeting with his Iranian, British, German and French counterparts.

He added that the European parties are \"fully aware that Iran's continued compliance (is) conditioned on full compliance by the US.\"'A very dangerous signal'3,700 people were arrested during Iran protests, lawmaker saysThe deal is one of several foreign policy issues where Europe's most powerful economies stand in opposition to the Trump administration. European countries are banking on the deal, as many began investing in Iran after the sanctions were lifted. But the European diplomats appear to have allies in Trump's own camp. US officials told CNN that the President's top national security advisers are encouraging him to renew the waivers.Trump however, is known to often ignore his counsel on foreign policy issues, and it was not clear Thursday whether he had yet made a decision.It will be politically difficult for him to to walk away from the deal without proving Iran has violated the agreement. His decision is also further complicated by recent mass anti-government protests in Iran, made up mostly of youths complaining of economic hardship. Trump openly supported those protesters on Twitter.Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif before the meeting in Brussels on Thursday.UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insisted that Iran had not violated the deal, citing the International Atomic Energy Agency's assessment. He called the agreement a \"considerable diplomatic accomplishment.\" \"I want to stress that I don't think anybody has so far produced a better alternative as a way of preventing the Iranians from going ahead with the acquisition of its nuclear capability,\" he said, challenging the deal's opponents to come up with a better solution. \"It is also clearly important to build worldwide support for this deal, that Iran should be able to show that it is a good neighbor in the region.\"Germany Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that the deal showed that diplomatic approaches to preventing the development of nuclear weapons were possible. \"It would send a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world if the only agreement which prevents us from the proliferation of nuclear weapons would be negatively affected,\" he said.  Trump will have a series of decisions to make on the deal in the days following the first waiver deadline on Friday.He is expected to reject at least one, which essentially decertifies Iran's compliance with the deal, a senior administration official told CNN last week.

        "content": "Paris (CNN)A collective of 100 French women including film star Catherine Deneuve have signed an open letter defending men's \"freedom to pester\" women, sparking an angry response from a group of feminist activists.The open letter, which criticized the #MeToo movement and warned about a new \"puritanism\" sparked by recent sexual harassment allegations, was published Tuesday in French newspaper Le Monde.OPINION: Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of #MeTooThe group of writers, performers, academics and businesswomen denounced a \"hatred of men and sexuality\" and the recent wave of \"denunciations.\" Men's \"freedom to pester\" is \"indispensable to sexual freedom,\" they wrote.\"Rape is a crime, but insistent or clumsy flirting is not an offense, nor is gallantry macho aggression.\" A group of around 30 activists, led by prominent feminist Caroline De Haas, responded on Wednesday with a scathing critique, published on France Info. Read MoreLawmakers invited to wear black to State of the Union to support #MeToo movementThey accused the signatories of deliberately mixing \"seduction, based on respect and pleasure, with violence.\" \"Sexual violence is not 'intensified flirting,'\" they wrote. \"One means treating the other as your equal, respecting their desires, whatever they may be. The other is treating them as an object at your disposal, paying no attention to their own desires, or their consent.\"They also criticized the letter's claim that the movement risks going \"too far,\" and the suggestion that it's the responsibility of women to protect themselves from intimidation. \"When will we ask the question about men's responsibility to not rape or abuse?\" they wrote, describing the letter as \"a bit like the annoying colleague or the tiring uncle who doesn't really understand what's going on around him.\"Sandra Muller, founder of the #BalanceTonPorc (\"squeal on your pig\") movement -- the French equivalent of #MeToo -- also denounced Tuesday's letter. Speaking to CNN, she described it as \"buzz for the sake of buzz\" and criticized the signatories, saying \"they are just going to sap the morale of the numerous victims who try to have a bit of courage.\"\"Feminism is not about protecting sexual liberation,\" she added, \"but about protecting women.\"French feminist Caroline de Haas (center) has criticized Tuesday's letter in Le Monde. Here, she is shown protesting with others against violence against women in Paris last November. #MeToo reduces women to 'poor little things'The dispute comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has ushered in a new social climate in which women feel increasingly comfortable to speak out against sexual harassment and abuse.  In Wednesday's letter, De Haas and her fellow activists welcomed these changes, but said that \"every time that women's rights progress...resistance appears.\"They see that resistance in Tuesday's letter, in which Deneuve and others argue that while the Harvey Weinstein scandal had led to a \"legitimate wake-up call to the sexual violence exercised against women,\" the \"fever\" of publicly denouncing abusers \"really only serves the enemies of sexual freedom.\" Cycle of shame: Harassed in the street, then again on social mediaTo make matters worse, they wrote, \"the movement chains women to the status of the eternal victim\" by framing them as \"poor little things who are dominated by demon phallocrats.\"Not only that, but the movement has spawned a wave of hatred toward the accused, they said, who are mentioned in the same breath as sexual aggressors without being given the chance to defend themselves. This new type of \"swift justice\" has already claimed its victims, they wrote, citing men forced to resign \"when all they did wrong was touch a knee.\" This comment is a clear reference to the resignation of former UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, who stepped down in November after admitting to touching journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee in 2002. The article also criticized the \"confusion of the man and the work,\" chastising a campaign to ban a Roman Polanski retrospective at a Paris cinema last November. Deneuve, who has previously worked on films with Polanski, came out publicly in support of him last March amid persistent accusations of pedophilia and rape.Frank Andrews and Yelena Peigne wrote from Paris.

Of this, the Royal Navy and RAF fell 10% short of their recruitment target and the Army was 30% below its goal. Black, Asian and ethnic minority personnel represented just over 7% of the armed forces, the report found, versus 14% of the 53 million-strong population in England and Wales in the 2011 census. Minority percentages in Scotland and Northern Ireland are significantly lower, according to official figures.",

A post shared by Alex Bunt (@a.bunt) on Aug 11, 2017 at 2:05am PDT Although strength is important for ski racers -- Vonn can squat 100 kilos -- her work on the spin bike, which trains quad muscles that are so important for skiing, is what sets her apart from the rest.\"She's extremely fit on the bike,\" Bunt said, who tracks Vonn's heart rate, number of watts produced and lactate levels during spin sessions to make sure she is working at the correct intensity.\"Her bike and cardiovascular fitness is amazing,\" Bunt said. \"That's what allows her to ski the number of runs that she does, the number of successive days in a row of skiing.

But to merely remember Sweden's Fanny Sunesson as the first is to overlook the fact she was also for a time the best.  Follow @cnnsport\n\nStanding by Nick Faldo's side throughout the 1990s, Sunesson guided the legendary English golfer to four major titles. The caddy went on to work with other European stars including Sergio Garcia and compatriot Henrik Stenson -- guiding the Swede to the 2007 World Match Play Championship and 2009 Players Championship -- before retiring in 2012.She has inspired a whole new generation of women to carry the bag, from former professionals Meaghan Francella and Michelle Simpson, to Brittany Henderson -- sister of 2016 PGA winner Brooke. Read MoreIn at the deep endAfter over two decades at the top, it's hard to believe a teenage Sunesson initially envisaged caddying for a matter of months, thinking of it \"as a chance to see the world.\"  Everything changed in late 1989 when Faldo, one of the game's top players, decided he wanted someone by his side as single-minded as he was. Sunesson, who had cut her teeth with Spaniard Jose Rivero and Englishman Howard Clark on the European Tour, jumped at the chance. Caddying at Augusta was \"like a fairytale\" according to Sweden's Fanny Sunesson, pictured here with Nick Faldo at the prestigious course in 1990.Just a few months into her new role, the girl born in Gothenburg was going to Augusta National for the 1990 Masters. \"It was like a fairytale, a dream for golfers,\" Sunesson tells CNN Living Golf in a rare interview. \"The architecture and aura there -- it was amazing to be there, and to caddy for the defending champion wasn't bad either.\"Faldo went on to win a playoff against Raymond Floyd for his second Masters title, making Sunesson the first female caddy in the history of the game to win a major.Fanny Sunesson poses with the Claret Jug alongside Nick Faldo and his two children at the 1990 British Open.Just three months later, the duo added the Open Championship title at the home of golf, St Andrews. And Sunesson chokes up as she recalls walking up the 18th with Faldo by her side. \"When we hit our tee shot on the 18th, we knew were going to win,\" says Sunesson. \"I'm so grateful for what Nick did walking off the tee: he turned around to me and said 'savor this moment!'.\" READ: Brooke and Brittany Henderson: Golf's sister act'One of the best rounds I've seen'Sunesson grew up in the Baltic port town of Karlshamn and was a keen amateur golfer who harbored dreams of playing professionally herself. Those ambitions may not have materialized but her winning partnership with Faldo more than made up for the disappointment. Another Open victory came two years later, but the most iconic moment of all was still yet to come at the 1996 Masters -- a tournament enshrined in golf folklore forever. Faldo and Sunesson follow Greg Norman past the leaderboard to the eighteenth green during the final round action at the 1996 Masters.It all came down to Faldo against Australia's Greg Norman on the final day. And, as they began play on the Sunday, Norman had a seemingly insurmountable six-shot lead.Sunesson never lost hope. \"History-wise, we had beaten Greg almost every time except once,\" she says, recalling the spectacular eventual 11-shot swing.Norman's game famously fell apart -- the Australian stumbled to a six-over-par 78 -- while the ever-reliable Faldo posted a  near flawless round of 67, birdieing the last to clinch his sixth and final major title by five shots.\"I was very focused on what we were doing. You couldn't miss what was happening with Greg, of course, but then you still have to do it. It's a long way back.\"To shoot 67 that day? I think Nick deserves more credit for that round. They said Greg lost the tournament but I think that's a bit unfair. It was one of the best rounds, if not the best I've seen.\"JUST WATCHEDCaddying for an all-time greatReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCaddying for an all-time great 01:28'A great caddy, a great girl'Preferring to ignore gender, Faldo credits Sunesson for the most successful spell of his career. \"I didn't get the relevance of having Fanny Sunesson -- a lady on my golf bag,\" Faldo tells CNN Living Golf. \"I thought she was a great caddy, a great girl, good entertainment. \"You know, the most important thing is you've got to be able to communicate. She was very professional, did her yardage books which take eight hours to do, so you got every bit of information. We had a great relationship.\"Earning a wage plus a significant percentage of prize money -- reportedly worth between 5-10% -- caddying has brought Sunesson well in excess of \u00a31M ($1.35M). But it's her unique relationship with Faldo she treasures most -- one that endures to this day. \"I think that we were a fantastic team,\" she says. \"We worked so well together; it was almost like we were one person thinking.\"Faldo and Sunesson at Augusta National -- an enduring sight for golf fans throughout the 1990s.That inextricable bond was perhaps summed up best by the fact that Faldo and Sunesson got married on 28 July 2001 -- though not to each other. Many miles apart, wedding separate partners, Faldo addressed the coincidence at the time saying: \"We're thinking of having an internet link for a laugh.\"Visit CNN.com/golf for more news and featuresFor Sunesson, currently the only woman in the Caddy Hall of Fame, many more like her might one day walk the fairways, but one thing will never change. \"You know, we're still friends today,\" she says. \"He's like a brother to me.\"",

He added that 86 people were plucked from the waters by the Italian Coast Guard. Di Giacomo said eight bodies were recovered and the remaining 56 are still missing and presumed dead.This is the first reported Mediterranean shipwreck to claim migrants' lives in 2018, according to CNN research.In a statement released on Monday, the Italian coast guard confirmed it had rescued 86 migrants off the Libyan coast but did not go into detail on how many people were still missing.

Of those, 2,832 migrants died on the central Mediterranean route. Each year, tens of thousands of people pour across Libya's borders, seeking to be smuggled onwards to European shores. It has become a hotbed for human traffickers, whose network of smuggling operations have gone widely unchecked because of Libya's lack of effective central governance.People for sale: Where lives are auctioned for $400It is not uncommon for less-than-seaworthy boats to be crammed with desperate migrants fleeing conflict and economic hardship and hoping to start a new life in Europe.

Exclusive footage of a slave auction filmed by CNN last October sparked protests and international condemnation. In November, the United Nations urged Libya to \"take urgent action\" to end the practice exposed by CNN's reporting.

They must also urgently prioritize the release of all those people who have been enslaved.

Korea 02:10Sport underpinning talksFor South and North Korea, two countries still technically at war, sport has, throughout the years, helped ease tensions on the peninsula and after a year of escalating hostility over Pyongyang's ballistic missile program, it is next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea which has given the two countries reason to talk again.Last week there was a diplomatic breakthrough as North Korea called South Korea, a hotline which has been dormant for two years, and on Tuesday the two countries held high-level discussions in the border village of Panmunjom, with the North agreeing to send a delegation to the Olympics.It should be of no surprise that it is sport, specifically the Olympics, which has underpinned the first bit of dialogue between the two neighboring states in over two years. After all, the Olympic flame burns during a Games to remind people of the Olympic Truce, the ancient Greek tradition of a temporary peace between warring states competing at the Games.For all their differences, the North and South have shared interests: a desire to bolster their reputations, to wave their flags in jubilation and to make a gesture before the watching world.\"Any effort which makes it look like the Koreans aren't fighting each other all the time, both Pyongyang and Seoul are going to embrace that,\" said Madden.\"They will both look good. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un are looking for a photo opportunity from this.\"Kim Jong Un recognizes the importance of sport in projecting an image of his country to the world.READ: Kim's moment of unearned legitimacy READ: Talks keep North Korean skaters' dream aliveSport and politics entwinedTo solely focus on US President Donald Trump's Twitter feed and headlines of impending nuclear annihilation would be to overlook the fact that these warring nations often compete against each other in a sporting field, and even put on a united front during the so-called Sunshine Policy of South Korea's liberal governments of 1998 to 2008.At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, athletes of the Koreas walked as one for the first time in an Olympic opening ceremony under a \"unification flag\" which displayed a blue map of the Korean peninsula. They entered the Olympic stadium to the tune of a Korean folk song. Four years later, in Athens, they marched again and did so in 2006 at the Turin Winter Olympics, though athletes from the two countries have not walked together since the Asian Winter Games in 2007.If sport and politics are entwined the Olympics can't always be a facilitator of peace.The International Olympic Committee says it aims to \"contribute to building a peaceful and better world,\" but throughout history there have been serious repercussions when sport and politics meet head-on.North Korea boycotted the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, following the Soviet Union's lead after the US did not take part in the Moscow Olympics four years earlier, and ahead of  the 1988 Games in Seoul, two North Koreans blew up a Korean Airlines plane in 1987, killing 115 people.Athletes are a 'prized elite group'Under the sports-loving Kim Jong Un athletes are said to enjoy relatively luxurious lifestyles. Successful athletes, their victories playing a part in chest-thumping nationalism, are regarded as part of the elite.North Korea, a country which excels in boxing and weightlifting, has often performed well at the Summer Olympics, winning 54 medals, including 16 golds. According to one calculation, the country is seventh in terms of overall medal success relative to economic output. It is less successful at the Winter Olympics. Having competed in seven of the last 12 Winter Games, the north has won just two medals.North Korea's Rim Jong Sim won gold in the women's weightlifting 75kg at Rio 2016.Since he assumed power in 2011, Kim has given sport greater prominence in the communist state and, according to state media, spending on sport in the nation's annual budgets has risen faster than in most other areas. \"There are a lot more discussion about athletic culture and sport in North Korean state media than there ever was under his father,\" explains Washington-based Madden.\"One of the first acts Kim implemented when he came into power was to create a national commission called the Ministry of Physical Culture and Sports and put some of the country's top leaders on that.\"North Korea is such a pariah state, so isolated, that sports events are one of the only ways they can effectively engage the outside world.JUST WATCHEDA glimpse of life in PyongyangReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA glimpse of life in Pyongyang 01:01\"That doesn't mean the North Korean athletes are going to go for dinner with their American counterparts at the Olympic village, but it's a way of showing that they're a country, that their citizens are not robots and that they have some pretty good athletes.\"We don't have to look far to see that athletes in any culture are a prized elite group.\"The state funds sport and so if you're in that system, and you happen to succeed, then of course you're going to be an honored person.\"You're not necessarily going to be in decision-making, but you're going to be pretty prominent in North Korean media and society.\"Soccer a precursor to Tuesday's talksSoccer players holds unification flags after a friendly match between South and North Korea on August 14, 2005 in SeoulNorth Korea is one of the most secretive countries in the world -- and up to 120,000 men, women and children are imprisoned in the gulags, known as \"kwanliso\" in Korean, according to the United Nations.Sporting failure can also reportedly have consequences.In 2010 there were reports of the North Korean football team being shamed in a six-hour public enquiry over their failure at that year's World Cup.They had lost all three of their group games, including a 7-0 defeat by Portugal, a match which is believed to be the country's first live sports broadcast. FIFA, soccer's governing body, even enquired about the whereabouts of the coach.But soccer has given the North, one of the world's last Communist dictatorships, one of its proudest sporting moments: the 2006 FIFA Under-20 World Championship title won by its women.Both the North and the South have competed against each other frequently on the soccer pitch. They faced each other four times during qualification for the 2010 World Cup, though the North's home matches were played in Shanghai as the regime had refused to allow the South Korean national anthem to be played or the South's flag to be flown.JUST WATCHEDMoon: Olympics an opportunity for peace (2017)ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMoon: Olympics an opportunity for peace (2017) 02:41Last December, despite UN Security Council sanctions which means North Koreans aren't allowed to travel to Japan, North Korea's soccer team were permitted to travel to Tokyo for the EAFF E-1 Football Championship.North Korea's women, who have been far more successful than their male counterparts in recent years, beat South Korea's women 1-0 and went on to win the women's competition.According to Madden, soccer is the precursor to Tuesday's talks following the North and the South's informal agreement, made in China in December, to compete against each other in the sporting arena this year.\"Right now, it looks like they want three or four soccer events between the two Koreas in 2018,\" says Madden.\"The talks we're going to see happen, they are a result of off-the-record meetings that happened in December 2017.\"In 2017, a football official went to China and he brought with him a provincial governor, a liberal governor, who basically said 'look, if you guys want to come to the Olympics we're all for it and we'll send a cruise ship to your harbor to pick up your athletes and delegation.'\"So, when we get to January 1 and the leaders of the North and South make their new year's message statements and talk about better ties in 2018, this was deliberately timed, based on these interactions and the informal agreement that they had to compete in sports in 2018.\"What if North Korea competes in PyeongChang?Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik of North Korea perform during their pairs free skating program of the 49th Nebelhorn trophy figure skating competition in Oberstdorf.So far only figure skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik have qualified for PyeongChang, though their participation has yet to be confirmed.However South Korean President Moon is said to be willing to let more North Korean athletes compete, especially if it ensures the Games can pass without any disruptive weapons' test, a pressing concern given PyeongChang is only 40 kilometers from the border.Should North Korea participate in the Winter Olympics it would be the first time in post-war Olympic history that a country has hosted a team from a nation with which it is officially at war. Will it lead to better political relations?Visit CNN.com/sport for more stories & features\"If we're going to talk about a unified Korean peninsula based on some figure staking, I don't think that's going to happen for some four decades. But it's a tension reducer,\" says Madden.\"The Olympics, and sports, has got North Korea opening a phone line they haven't answered for years.\"The Olympics will provide a cover for senior South and North Koreans to talk to each other. The North will send officials who have negotiating powers to make some basic agreement in theory.\"They will use it as a cover to have further discussions and that's all we can hope for. These are baby steps.\"The two countries are approaching each other wearily and cautiously. This is an engagement that will be supported by Russia and China and has some approval from the United States.\"Do we want the Koreans talking to each other and playing sports, or do you want them killing each other?\"",

        "content": "(CNN)Hello and welcome to your preview of the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship! Pay attention, because this game should be a thriller and by the time the announcers actually get through the phrase \"2018 College Football Playoff National Championship,\" it will be half over. Let's do this. What time is it?Kickoff is at 8:17 p.m. ET Monday.What channel is it on? The game will be broadcast on ESPN, and if you don't have cable, you can catch it on Watch ESPN, the channel's streaming service. Read MoreWhere is it?The game will be played at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. What team usually plays there?It's the home of the Atlanta Falcons, winners of the 2017 Super Bowl Participation Award. I thought they played at the Georgia Dome?They did! But the Georgia Dome was imploded at the end of November, in an event that captured the attention and imagination of literally every single Atlantan within the city limits. If you're ever bored, find a building implosion to go observe. It will change your life.JUST WATCHEDWatch the historic Georgia Dome implodeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch the historic Georgia Dome implode 00:28Now they play in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, a cavernous metal Bundt cake that looks like aliens reassembled the Coliseum using space garbage. Oh, it's not that bad! Even behind the walls of the neighboring CNN Center, one can feel its looming presence. Anyway, who's playing in this thing?This year's matchup will pit perennial southern powerhouse the Alabama Crimson Tide against uh, perennial southern powerhouse the Georgia Bulldogs.What schools do these teams represent and where are they?The University of Alabama is in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and the University of Georgia is in Athens, Georgia. Do they even still play football in the North?It's hard to say. What colors will they be wearing?Red. Just a lot of red. The Crimson Tide will be wearing white jerseys accented with, you guessed it, crimson. The Bulldogs will be wearing red jerseys with black and white accents. Alabama QB Jalen Hurts, #2, in red. Tell me more about the matchup!Both of the teams vying for the championship are from the Southeastern Conference, typically referred to as the SEC. (A conference is one of the ways college football teams are organized. Think of conferences like leagues.)The SEC connection makes the matchup absolutely thrilling to some, and extremely boring to others. One reason people may find it boring is that the SEC routinely churns out top championship contenders, so it can get a little old seeing the same teams consistently rise to the top. Excellence is so monotonous.Who are the coaches?The Georgia coach is Kirby Smart, and the Alabama coach is former Alabama senate write-in candidate Nick Saban.Nick Saban. That name sounds familiar.He's an extremely important college football man. He has coached the Tide to four (!) of their 16 (!!!) national titles and as of last year, he was also the highest paid public employee in America. (And yes, opinions differ on how many national titles Bama REALLY has  \u2014 some say 10 or 13, and it turns out there's not one right answer.)Nick Saban could buy your entire life. How many national titles has Georgia won?Two, one in 1942 and one in 1980.  So it's been 38 years since the Bulldogs claimed a crown.How long has it been since Alabama won?Two years. Like we said, excellence is monotonous. Who are the quarterbacks? The Alabama quarterback is Jalen Hurts. The Georgia quarterback is Jake Fromm. Georgia QB Jake Fromm, #11.Who's going to win and what are the odds? As of Saturday morning, experts are going with Alabama by 4 points. And if it comes down to that narrow of a spread this game is going to be an absolute rager.Can I get tickets?Well, you can, if you want to spend an entire car's worth of money on them. The lowest-price nosebleed section ticket on Stubhub as of Saturday morning is $1,598. The most expensive ticket is a suite situation that will set you back $87,300. .....Hello?Sorry, I just died there for a minute. That's a lot of money.AND you probably won't even get to see the President. The President is coming?Oh, yeah. President Trump is scheduled to attend the game, so if you have any plans of driving anywhere around Atlanta, um, don't. Who should I root for?It's hard to say. Both Alabama and Georgia are SEC powerhouses and their fan bases literally border each other, but it's not necessarily a rivalry, per se. So if you're a fan of tradition and the status quo, root for Alabama. If you want the city of Atlanta to experience even the tiniest sliver of sports happiness, root for the Dawgs. What should I say to express my allegiance to these teams? If you're rooting for Alabama, it's \"Roll Tide.\" Roll Tide is the state motto of Alabama; it's written into the preamble of their constitution. Instead of \"good morning,\" or \"I love you,\" Alabama fans say \"Roll Tide.\" It's every Alabama baby's first words. Its power cannot be overstated.If you're rooting for Georgia, it's \"Go Dawgs,\" with a \"w.\"Who has the cuter mascot? Well, the Alabama mascot is actually an elephant, which is a really cool story. The Bulldogs have -- you'll never guess this -- a live bulldog named Uga (pronounced Ugga) who always looks exhausted. \"I am so tired of being alive.\"What's the prize for the champions?The point of all of this is to be the team to claim that gilded yonic totem, the College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy. It's up there at the top. Here's another look. Frankly, not impressed. Any other fun fact I can think about during Monday's game? Mercedes-Benz Stadium is home to the largest bird sculpture in the world. The giant stainless steel falcon, grasping a football in its talons, stands (flies?) 41.5 feet tall and weights 73,000 pounds with its pedestal. SKREEE!Now THAT'S a worthy trophy.

Salah and Mane next faced a race to be back in Liverpool for the Merseyside FA Cup clash against Liverpool on Friday.It was reported Liverpool had a charter jet on standby to fly the pair straight back after the awards ceremony, which finished less than 24 hours before kick-off.In total, Salah and Mane completed the 9,000-mile trip to Ghana in a day.",

In a study conducted by Soccerex -- organizers of the world's biggest football finance forum -- City were deemed the world's most financially powerful club, beating traditional powerhouses like Real Madrid, Barcelona and cross-city rivals Manchester United.David Wright, Soccerex Marketing Director, said the company's first study into football finance highlighted how the football landscape has changed globally over the last two decades. Read More\"We wanted to create a study that provided a broader evaluation of football finances, one that reflected the modern reality of football, impacted by increased owner investment and the need for better financial management,\" Wright said in a statement. \"The results have certainly been eye-catching.\"Financial cloutCity's rivals are also starting to realize the implications of the financial might of the club, which is owned by an Abu Dhabi-based multibillionaire.In December, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, who has spent over $400 million on players since his arrival at the start of the 2016/2017 season, complained about how City had bought defenders for the usual value of strikers at the start of this season.\"It is not enough,\" Mourinho said of United's recent spending after his team drew 2-2 with Burnley. \"And the price for the big clubs, the price for the big clubs is different from the other clubs. So the big, historical clubs are normally punished in the market for that history.\"When you tell [describe] a club like Manchester United, do you think AC Milan is not as big as us? You think they are not as big as we are? Do you think Real Madrid are not as big as we are? You think Inter Milan is not as big as we are? There are many big clubs and you say big clubs, I know what is a big club.\"Barcelona currently top La Liga and in Lionel Messi have one of the world's greatest players, but the club did not break into the top 10 of Soccerex's Football Financial Index.While City, managed by former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach Guardiola, came top, fellow EPL side Arsenal were second and big-spending French club Paris St-Germain, who broke the world record last summer to acquire Neymar from Barcelona, third. Reflecting China's growing influence in the sport, Guangzhou Evergrande, regarded as the country's glamor side, were fourth -- two places ahead of reigning Spanish champions and 12-time European Cup winners Real Madrid and nine places above Barca, who are 13th. According to the study, the financial clout of Barca, five-time winners of the European Cup, and Real was stifled by the clubs' member ownership structures and the lack of potential owner investment. However, the study did point out that should Real be capitalized on the stock markets, their overall financial power would make them worth more than any other club, regardless of the wealth of billionaire owners. Last season Real became the first team in 27 years to retain the Champions League trophy.READ: Inside China's quest for world football domination READ: China unveils plans to achieve global soccer domination READ: Ronaldo & Man Utd lead the digital way China on the riseNine Chinese Super League clubs, which have spent heavily in the last couple of years to attract superstar players, were in the top 100, equal to Spain and more than France, Germany and Italy.

The club's owners have invested $781 million in the playing squad and infrastructure and the billion dollar television deal signed by EPL clubs has further boosted the coffers. In November, City -- who top the EPL table after a record-breaking 17 win sequence -- announced record revenues of $639m for the 2016-17 season, though profits were down from $27m to $1.49m during that period. According to the Guardian, the corporation which owns the club (City Football Group) already owns, or co-owns, six clubs on four continents and the contracts of 240 male professional players and two dozen women as it seeks to dominate football globally. On the pitch, the investment in City has paid dividends, with the club twice winning the EPL title (2011-12 & 2013-14) and are overwhelming favorites to capture a third with Guardiola's side leading nearest challengers United by 15 points.",

        "content": "Paris (CNN)Emmanuel Macron has earned the reputation of a man who dreams impossible dreams and then turns them into reality. His improbable rise to the French presidency, the near-historic parliamentary majority achieved just a month later by his fledgling movement, and the reform of France's notoriously rigid labor laws were all derided as pipe dreams ... until he proved that they were not. A dose of luck and good timing undoubtedly helped, but so too did his determination and the almost messianic sense of mission that he seems to bring to everything he does. How world leaders fared in a turbulent yearNow he wants to bring it to Europe. In his New Year's Eve address he told not only the French, but also his \"fellow European citizens,\" that the European Union needed to rediscover its ambition in order to become \"a more sovereign, more united, more democratic\" union. It is a theme he is likely to raise again this week in his New Year wishes to the French diplomatic corps.Read MoreHis plan is no mystery since it was the subject of three major speeches in 2017 and has already been presented to the European Council. And it is, as you would expect, nothing if not ambitious. The French President wants to do away with the Europe of nations to create something much closer to a nation of Europe. He wants the EU to have its own finance minister, its own budget, its own economic governance. He believes it should have its own army and border police force. He wants a harmonized tax system and, politically, a stronger European Parliament with transnational parties and lists. Along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron is seen as one of the key players in forging Europe's future.In short, the sort of federal Europe that has, over the last few decades, been an almost taboo subject, spoken of in hushed voices in the corridors of Brussels, and certainly not called for by the leader of one of Europe's most powerful nations.In order to achieve that, he wants a consultation this year with Europe's people and its nations, several of whom have spoken of their outright opposition to any moves toward federalism, precisely because their governments face electorates that have, in the past few years, voted for less Europe rather than more of it. Among them are not just the Eastern countries, which would be excluded from the heart of the multi-tiered union that Macron envisages, but Germany, Holland and, possibly soon, Italy, which goes to the polls this year. France's Macron announces first 'Make our Planet Great Again' winnersJean Monnet, one of the architects and founding fathers of the EU, had predicted that Europe would be forged in its crises. But the recent ones, focused on sovereign debt and migrants, were born precisely of the fact that Europe had not yet forged itself, and seemed therefore to threaten the union existentially by reinforcing the positions and popularity of those who wanted it destroyed -- the very nationalists and skeptics that Macron is calling on Europeans to resist. The answer, he believes, is for Europe at last to answer the question of what it is: a loose federation of European nations or a federal European Union. It is the question that has divided and bedeviled Europe since its creation. And until Macron's meteoric rise to power, the former had been defended with far more vigor than the latter. Now the latter has a champion, willing not only to speak up for it, but to stake his substantial political capital on the necessity of its success. The real question is whether in 2018 -- after all that has happened these last few years, from the debt crisis to Brexit -- it is too late or, on the contrary, precisely the right time.If Macron gets his way, Europe will take a massive leap to become much closer, in the end, to what its founding fathers had envisaged, but very different from what it has become. And, as with so many things in France these days, the feeling seems to be that if he can't do it, then it simply cannot be done.",

        "content": "(CNN)Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said he aspires to a united Ireland based on \"cross-community support\" in remarks released on Tuesday, the UK Press Association reported.\"In terms of a united Ireland, our constitution is clear on this,\" he said. \"Our constitution aspires to there being a united Ireland. I share that aspiration.\"But Varadkar made clear that unity between Ireland and Northern Ireland -- which is part of the United Kingdom -- could come about only \"by consent.\"\"When it does come about I would like to see it command a degree of cross-community support,\" he added.The remarks, which are likely to provoke criticism from unionist Northern Irish politicians, come just a few weeks after a deal was reached during Brexit negotiations between the UK government and the European Union on the historically sensitive issue of the Irish border. Read MoreThe question had threatened to derail the talks and brought the controversial issue of a united Ireland to the fore.The demilitarization of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland was a key element of the Good Friday Agreement, the 1998 deal that ended years of sectarian conflict.The UK's planned departure from the European Union raised the prospect of a return to a \"hard\" border, as Northern Ireland would leave the EU while the Republic of Ireland remained in the bloc. But in an agreement reached in December, the UK and EU pledged that there would be no hard border.Even after the border deal was struck, concerns remained in Dublin over the UK government's handling of the issue. There is also unease that the commitments made by British Prime Minister Theresa May regarding the border may not be as solid as the initial wording suggested, which could strengthen support for Irish nationalism.Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, accused Varadkar of exploiting the Brexit talks to serve his aspirations for a united Ireland.Jennifer Todd, professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at University College Dublin, said Varadkar's remarks were a direct response to the British government's approach to Brexit negotiations.Todd said the British government -- under pressure from pro-Brexit lawmakers -- is \"asserting an unreformed traditionalist concept of sovereignty over Northern Ireland\" and has not listened when the Irish government \"tried to say this diplomatically.\"But Paul Bew, emeritus professor of politics at Queen's University Belfast and cross-bench peer in the British House of Lords, said that Varadkar's insistence on the need for consent and cross-community support had brought a new, more conciliatory tone to the debate.\"It's not actually provocative, it's meant to be the opposite,\" Bew said. \"What he's doing here is trying to pull back from the irritation he has caused in the unionist community by the stance he took over the past several weeks ... this is an attempt to conciliate.\"Building support for Irish unity across both Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland is \"a 50-year project,\" Bew said. Varadkar's remarks are \"a way of saying ... we don't want unity any time soon.\"JUST WATCHEDBrexit brings worries for those on the borderReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit brings worries for those on the border 03:31Whatever his motivation, Varadkar is likely to come under renewed fire from pro-unionist parties in Northern Ireland.In the days before the border deal was brokered, Varadkar and his government were accused of exploiting the negotiations to forward their ambitions for a united Ireland. Varadkar was insisting that talks should not progress until London committed to preventing a \"hard\" border.Members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) -- a Northern Irishle party fiercely loyal to the British monarch -- were particularly outspoken, with the party's leader, Arlene Foster, accusing the Irish government of hijacking the talks.READ MORE: Who are the DUP?In an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today program in November, Foster was particularly critical of Simon Coveney, Ireland's Foreign Minister, who had previously said he \"would like to see a united Ireland in my lifetime. If possible, in my political Iifetime.\"\"He's of course entitled to have that aspiration but he should not be using European Union negotiations to talk about those issues,\" Foster said. Ten days later in the UK Parliament, DUP politician Nigel Dodds described the Irish government's approach as \"aggressive\" and \"disgraceful.\"Varadkar rejected the claims at the time, insisting: \"There is no question of us trying to exploit Brexit ... we want to build bridges, not borders.\"CNN's Nic Robertson and James Masters contributed to this piece.",

He's even punched a shark.But the 36-year-old dubbed \"White Lightning\" for his speed on the board is calling it a day, admitting in an Instagram post on Wednesday that he had lost the \"motivation and dedication to compete.\"\"I feel like I've just lost the drive to compete day-in day-out now,\" said Fanning, who will surf competitively for the last time at the Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach, which starts on March 29 and runs until April 8.'It was, like, me or the shark': Surfer Mick Fanning describes attack\"I'm just not enjoying it as much as I was in the past. I still love surfing, and I'm still super excited by it, but I feel that's there's other paths for me to take at this stage in my life.\"Read MoreIn 2015, the wave Fanning caught at Jeffrey's Bay became one of his career defining moments as he famously fought off a shark -- though miraculously he was unharmed. The shark did little damage to Fanning though it did bite through his leg rope and caused some damage to his surfboard.\"I had this feeling that something was behind [me], and all of a sudden I felt like I started getting pulled underwater. And then the thing came up and I was on my board and it was right there,\" he said.\"I had this thought, 'What if it comes around for another go at me? Before I knew it, the boat was there... I can't believe it, I was tripping out. I'm totally tripping out.\"It was his competitor Julian Wilson's account of the incident which revealed Fanning's close call with death.\"I saw him get knocked off his board, I came over the wave and his board was over here and he was swimming that way, and I thought it was going to grab him and take him under.\" Photos: Surfing culture captured through a 19th-century lensHaleiwa, Oahu \u2013 \"I really wanted to shoot a picture where you cannot tell when it was taken ... it could be from 150 years ago,\" says photographer Bernard Testemale.

This image is of Ross Clarke-Jones, who became the first non-Hawaiian victor in the 2000-01 staging. \"He's from Australia and he has such a strong face,\" says Testemale.

        "content": "(CNN)Italian elections are always complicated affairs, but Sunday's vote could take complicated to a new level.Anti-establishment parties are thriving as Italians have become frustrated over unprecedented migration and continuing economic woes. Combine this with a new, untested electoral system and a high number of undecided voters, and observers say the outcome is highly unpredictable.What's happening and why should you care?Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi could play kingmaker in Sunday's election. Italians head to the polls on Sunday in a vote that will be closely watched by European leaders fearful of any instability in the eurozone's third-largest economy.The populist, anti-European Union Five Star Movement (M5S) is likely to emerge as the single largest party, according to recent polls, but a coalition of center-right parties cobbled together by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi could emerge with more seats in parliament.Read MoreFurther complicating things, around 40% of voters remain undecided. No party or alliance is expected by analysts to earn an outright majority, meaning Italy could be plunged into months of further political deadlock at a time of financial uncertainty for the country.      While there have been some indications of an economic recovery recently, unemployment remains stubbornly high, according to the EU's statistical agency. And the International Monetary Fund puts Italy's government debt at 120% of gross domestic product, compared to 45% in Germany and 82% in the US.\"Some of the main parties adopted an ambivalent stance towards the European Union during this legislature. Some of them were openly euroskeptic ... That's why many European partners fear the prospect of an Italian parliament dominated by these forces,\" says Fabio Bordignon, a political scientist at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo.\"This political uncertainty, government instability and the prospect of repeated elections configure to a 'perfect storm' which could harm one of the main European democracies and further destabilize an already weak continental alliance.\"Related: Facing a new crisis, Italians turn back to BerlusconiWhy now? Women walk past  candidates' posters in Rome ahead of Sunday's general elections.Until December, Italy had been under the leadership of a caretaker government run by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.Back in 2014, his center-left predecessor Matteo Renzi was thrust onto the world stage amid great fanfare as the country's youngest-ever leader. Hailed as an energetic reformer, he quickly ushered in a host of legislative amendments aimed at boosting growth and prosperity. But it was too much too soon, and Renzi ended up gambling on a constitutional referendum that culminated in a resounding defeat and his resignation in late 2016. As the leader of the center-left Democratic Party, Renzi is competing in the election.What are the main parties?Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, hopes to become the next prime minister.More than 20 parties are in the ring, but Italian voters are largely split into three political camps, according to recent polls. The center-left coalition, dominated by Renzi's Democratic Party and including several smaller parties, polled at 27.4% in the final pre-election poll of voter's intentions. The Five Star Movement -- led by 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio -- polled at 28%. The party has ruled out entering coalitions with other parties in the past.  A right-wing bloc, constructed by four-time prime minister Berlusconi, leads the same poll at 36.8% and could end up as the largest grouping in parliament.The Northern League's Matteo Salvini smiles during a press conference in Rome last week. The deal-making media mogul has brokered an alliance that includes his center-right Forza Italia party, Matteo Salvini's far-right Northern League, and the neo-fascist Brothers of Italy.Berlusconi is currently banned from holding office as a result of a tax fraud conviction, but he could play a key role in helping to choose the country's next leader.Related: The maverick populists striking fear into Italy's mainstream partiesWhat are the issues?Jobs, the economy and security remain concerns for voters, but one issue has dominated the pre-election debate: immigration. More than 600,000 people have arrived by sea from North Africa since 2013 when Italy last went to the polls, including 114,000 in 2017, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration. And the debate over immigration has highlighted racial tensions ahead of Sunday's vote. Right-wing parties have pushed an anti-immigration agenda, including the Northern League, which has advocated for mass expulsions and pledged to put \"Italians first.\" Berlusconi has warned that the number of migrants in Italy has caused \"serious social alarm,\" and vowed to deport more than 600,000 undocumented migrants. The narrative around immigration took a darker turn after a man linked with neo-fascist political parties apparently went on a shooting rampage targeting African migrants in the town of Macerata. The incident fueled serious political debate about how the country is reconciling its fascist past. On Saturday, anti-fascist groups and far-right supporters took part in rival demonstrations in cities across Italy, Reuters reported. Protesters hold a banner reading \"Against fascism, racism and sexism, everyday, in all cities'' during a demonstration in Macerata on February 10. Daniele Albertazzi, a senior lecturer in European politics at the University of Birmingham in England, says migration has been a contentious issue in Italian elections going back to the 1990s.  \"First it was people from northern Africa coming to Italy to work, then it was the collapse of the Albanian state, then after 9/11 we didn't see the word 'African' anymore in Italian newspapers, it became all about 'Muslims,'\" Albertazzi told CNN. \"In the last three years, you have people crossing the Mediterranean on boats ... and of course, the terrorist attacks by Islamic State inside Europe.\"All of that has been used by political leaders very effectively because the discourse never focuses on the millions of people, for instance, who work in northern Italy and keep the northern Italian factories afloat,\" Albertazzi added. \"There is absolutely no discussion whatsoever about (working immigrants) -- they are invisible. Instead, what is discussed is, for instance, Macerata.\"Related: Migrants are causing 'social alarm' in Italy - BerlusconiHow does the new system work?Italy has introduced a new hybrid electoral system for this year's vote which combines a first-past-the-post (FPTP) method with proportional representation (PR). First-past-the-post means the candidate who gets the most votes in a constituency wins a seat in parliament; proportional representation means that additional seats will allotted to parties based on the proportion of votes they win nationwide.Of the 630 seats in lower house of parliament -- the Chamber of Deputies -- 232 will be elected through FPTP, and 386 through PR. The remaining 12 seats are determined by overseas constituencies. A similar split will be used for Italy's upper house -- the Senate -- with 102 members elected by FPTP and 207 through PR.

In this case, it is likely that the Gentiloni government will continue to sit in a provisional capacity while parties enter long discussions on whether (to build) an 'all-party' technical government limited to a set of specific reforms or call new general elections.\"CNN's Gianluca Mezzofiore contributed to this report.",

Now, on the eve of the Italian elections on Sunday, the 81-year-old has emerged as a grandfatherly elder statesman, the kingmaker of a right-wing alliance and a bulwark against populism, even if a 2012 conviction for tax fraud means he can't hold public office himself. According to the final poll of voter intentions, the center-right alliance he brokered looks set to take the largest share of the vote at 36.8%.

Berlusconi -- nicknamed \"Il Cavaliere\" (The Knight) -- has been prime minister four times for a total of nine years, longer than anyone since fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.  Even before he took office for the first time in 1994, accusations of Mafia involvement, corruption and bribery already circled round the former cruise-ship entertainer. Using a loan from a bank his father worked for, Berlusconi built a property fortune developing up-market housing estates outside Milan before buying the soccer team AC Milan (which he recently sold) and moving into television, where he now owns Italy's largest private broadcaster as well as its largest publishing house. He has been tried 22 times on charges ranging from tax evasion and bribery to corruption and association with the Cosa Nostra. Berlusconi pictured with girlfriend Francesca Pascale (L) in 2013. His penchant for much younger women is overlooked by his often traditionally Catholic support base. Berlusconi's current partner, Francesca Pascale, is nearly 50 years younger than him.None of this has damaged the father of five permanently because all but one of his convictions, including that of paying for sex with \"bunga-bunga\" participant Karima el Mahroug, who was 17 at the time of the alleged offense, were either thrown out of court or overturned on appeal. Indeed, despite an estimated 2,500 court appearances, only one case against Berlusconi has stuck -- a 2012 conviction for tax evasion in a deal involving television rights.Related: Why Italy's unpredictable election is testing nerves in EuropeBack on the stageBerlusconi addresses a crowd in Milan on Sunday. On Sunday, Berlusconi made his first major public appearance in the campaign, speaking for two hours and 20 minutes to more than 800 supporters gathered in a theater in his hometown of Milan. Dressed all in black -- his once balding head now covered in hair, his facial movements stilted from what many believe to be a face lift and wearing thick make-up -- he looked more like the Godfather than the Messiah.The program he has presented for government includes a 23% flat tax for individuals as well as companies, a promise to deport more than 600,000 undocumented migrants, and a 1,000 euro minimum pension. He is also proposing new laws to protect victims of gender-based violence, a direct appeal to women who form a large part of Italy's army of undecided voters. If that wasn't enough, Berlusconi has thrown in free veterinarian bills and an end to tax on pet food. Silvio Berlusconi says migrants causing 'serious social alarm' in ItalySunday evening, relaxed and avuncular, Berlusconi gave an hour-long interview on Rete 4, one of the television stations he owns, ending with a direct face-to-camera political broadcast.Listing his own achievements, he gave himself credit for ending the Cold War in 2002 because his \"talent for friendship\" drew George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin together. Most historians believe the Cold War ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.No one in Italy expects Berlusconi's center-right bloc to be able to fulfill his electoral promises. The Italian financial newspaper Il Sole 24 has estimated the domestic program alone would cost as much as 72 billion euros, a bill Italy's already indebted treasury would struggle to pay.\"Nothing is going to be decided until after the vote,\" said the Economist Intelligence Unit's Ceretti. The great survivorIf the center-right coalition is victorious, Berlusconi's preferred candidate for prime minister is likely to be Forza Italia politician Antonio Tajani, currently President of the European Parliament. In January, Berlusconi received a warm welcome from other EU politicians in Brussels including Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. Berlusconi has said if the center-right moves into government he would introduce direct elections for the presidency.The maverick populists striking fear into Italy's mainstream partiesHe can't be prime minister this time because of the outstanding conviction against him. Although he was given a four-year prison sentence in that case, he escaped with a year of community service in an old people's home because in Italy the over-70s don't usually go to jail.  He has challenged the 2012 government decree barring people convicted of certain offenses from holding office, including tax evasion, at the European Court of Human Rights. The case is currently being heard, but a conclusion is unlikely to be reached until after the election. But if the center-right wins on March 4, the constitutional changes are successful, and if the court finds in his favor, the path would be paved for the great survivor of Italian politics to become president, a role traditionally filled in Italy by older men at the end of their careers.",

The first ever Dusseldorf Grand Slam wasn't supposed to end like this. Follow @cnnsport\n\nOver 400 judoka from 65 different nations had convened at the ISS Dome in western Germany for one of the most important competitions on the International Judo Federation (IJF) calendar.And, after three days of action across 13 weight categories, all eyes were on Sunday's heavyweight (100kg+) final. Japan had already won seven gold medals at the Grand Slam and looked certain to add another, with Japanese competitors Hisayoshi Harasawa and Takeshi Ojitani going head-to-head to be crowned champion.Read MoreBut Honduran referee Jose Ordonez had other ideas.Instead both fighters were disqualified at exactly the same time, less than two minutes into the fight. It meant neither man won the contest. Both stood on the podium with silver medals around their necks. The gold remained unclaimed. READ: Meet Lukas Krpalek, the heavyweight with the toughest task in sportDouble hansoku-makeHarasawa and Ojitani were both penalized for excessive \"passivity,\" meaning neither competitor had shown sufficient intent to fight. The IJF called the outcome -- known as \"double hansoku-make\" --  a worldwide \"first\" at this level, but offered no apology to the disappointed competitors. \"The IJF Supervisors and our team deemed that this contest and the way it unfolded was unacceptable,\" said IJF head referee director Juan Carlos Barcos. \"There was no intention to fight from either judoka and with the recently amended rules we can now reprimand two judoka in this way. \"This is what we decided as there was no judoka worthy of winning in the +100kg final.\"Harasawa and Ojitani can have few complaints; they had both been warned.The first shido -- akin to a yellow card -- was awarded to both after just 38 seconds. And the match wasn't even halfway complete when Ordonez again stopped proceedings, dishing out a second shido to each competitor after one minute and 16 seconds. The referee had left them no room for further error or infraction, but even that did not spur the Japanese fighters into action. With 2:11 left on the clock, the third and final shidos were signaled, and the four-minute match was ended. READ: Five things we learned at the Paris Grand SlamBewilderment Perplexed by the outcome, unsure whether their journey had ended in victory or defeat, both competitors looked to their coaches for some form of reassurance.

Harasawa, hands on hips, remained rooted to the spot. It took the repeated hand gestures of the referee to awaken the fighters from their stupor. A bemused bow and cursory handshake later, they slowly ambled off the mat. \"It is against the spirit of judo to turn up and not fight,\" explained Sheldon Franco-Rooks, official commentator of the IJF.\"Neither fighter has demonstrated the desire to compete here.

The frigid Pyeongchang weather proved too much for the three, who said they took a vehicle they found unattended with the engine running because it was too cold outside, according to the South Korean police source, who was not authorized to speak to the media. The three were pulled over while driving the stolen vehicle, a pink Hummer, from downtown Pyeongchang to the Olympic Village, a distance of less than 2 miles.David Duncan competes in the freestyle skiing men's ski cross seeding on Wednesday.A South Korean police source told CNN that Raine, the driver, had a blood alcohol level of 0.162 when tested one hour after stealing the car. That's more than three times South Korea's legal blood alcohol limit of 0.05%. All three Canadians were arrested for car theft, with Raine also charged with drunken driving, according to the police source.Read MoreThe PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games acknowledged the incident and said those involved cooperated with authorities. The Canadian Olympic Committee sent apologies from the three on Saturday. \"We are deeply sorry. We engaged in behavior that demonstrated poor judgment and was not up to the standards expected of us as members of the Canadian Olympic Team or as Canadians,\" the statement from David and Maja Margrethe Duncan read. William Ryan Raine, the ski cross high-performance director, called his actions \"inexcusable\" and apologized to the owner of the involved vehicle in his statement. \"Words are not enough to express how sorry I am. I have let my teammates, friends and my family down,\" Raine said. The Canadians were released and Korean police concluded their investigation the next day, according to the apology statements, which were released on Saturday by Chris Overholt, the CEO and secretary general of the Canadian Olympic Committee. \"We expect our athletes and team members to conduct themselves responsibly and in keeping with our Canadian and Olympic values. We are deeply disappointed in the behaviors of these individuals,\" Overholt said.CNN's Taehoon Lee and Jo Shelley reported from Pyeongchang. Sarah Faidell wrote in Atlanta.",

But Tusk's remarks raise questions over how well it will go down in Brussels.\"I'm afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion. It looks like the 'cake philosophy' is still alive,\" Tusk said. \"From the very start, there has been a key principle of the EU 27 members that there can be no cherry-picking and no single market \u00e0 la carte.\"JUST WATCHEDMay: 'Ideology' must not impede security dealReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMay: 'Ideology' must not impede security deal 02:37Tusk has previously accused May of holding a philosophy of \"having her cake and eating it\" over Brexit by trying to keep the benefits of EU membership without having to follow its rules.Read MoreTusk said he had informed EU leaders that he would present draft guidelines in the future EU-UK relationship at a European Council summit next month.\"Our intention is to adopt these guidelines, whether the UK is ready with its vision of our future relations, or not.

However, that process has been fraught with difficulty in the past few months.UK media reports indicate that Cabinet ministers agreed Thursday on an approach of \"managed divergence\" by which Britain would take control of its own regulations but maintain the standards required by the EU in certain key areas to protect trade and jobs.\"The Brexit committee made a step forward yesterday by agreeing (to) the basics of the future relationship,\" a Downing Street representative told CNN.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond tweeted Friday that the Chequers meeting had been \"positive and constructive\" and that \"steady progress\" was being made toward delivering Brexit.Positive and constructive meeting at #Chequers last night.

After a stunning showdown at the Gangneung Ice Arena,  the 15-year-old took the top spot after her rival, 18-year-old fellow Russian Evgenia Medvedeva, just couldn't quite catch her. Both women scored 156.65 in the free skate, but Zagitova's 1.31 extra points in the short program on Wednesday put her over the edge, meaning Medvedeva had to settle for silver. Intense attention has been paid to Russian athletes at this year's Olympics, after the country was banned from competing due to allegations of widespread, state-sponsored doping.More than 160 athletes who could prove they were clean from doping are competing as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR), under the Olympic flag and anthem.Read MoreCanada's Kaetlyn Osmond took the bronze medal, adding to her gold already won in the team competition.

Then the 15-year-old from Izhevsk, in Russia's Volga region -- who had only been competing internationally for a year -- beat her at the most recent European Championships in January, and suddenly, everything was up for grabs. Zagitova underlined this in the short program Wednesday, breaking a world record set by Medvedeva only minutes before. She described that as \"the best performance of my life,\" but added she still had room to grow. In the end it was that skate which earned her the gold.

        "content": "(CNN)All-electric motorsport took a giant leap into the future earlier this year, with Formula E unveiling it's Batmobile-like Gen2 race car.Now three races into its fourth season, FE unveiled the vehicle its racers will be piloting when season five gets under way later this year.With its futuristic styling and increase in power and range, the Gen2 car further distances itself from established racing categories like Formula One and IndyCar.Young, all-electric and innovative, FE appear is the millennial of racing series.READ: \"Straight outta Gotham!\" FE unveils BatmobileRead More Breaking TaboosBeing an electric racing car, Formula E is already bucking the trend in motive power. It's also challenging other motor racing taboos.  One unwritten rule is that a single-seater race car should have an open cockpit and open wheels. The Gen2 is still a single-seater race car and, even with the mandatory Halo protection system designed to prevent debris hitting the drivers, it's still an open cockpit car.  But, the new car no longer meets the strict definition of being open wheeled, as it partially covers the tires with bodywork. The wheels of the Gen2 are partially covered by the car's bodywork. Having open wheels is a throwback to days when racing without bodywork might have saved some weight and complexity. The problem is that open wheels create over third of the cars aerodynamic drag. With FE being a category that emphasizes efficiency, enclosing the wheels in bodywork cuts drag and extends the car's range.  When we look at the new car, it's clear this isn't a race car designed by studious engineers, solely focusing on form equaling function.FE is a single-make racing category, meaning teams can't make changes to the car's chassis.The car's bodywork has an aerodynamic function -- creating downforce, cutting drag and feeding cool air to the radiators. But that doesn't mean it can't look Batmobile-cool at the same time.  So much of the Gen2's design is style as well as function.The rear wing is effectively reduced to two tiny aero foils joined by a dramatic \"V\" shaped mount.Other flourishes in the shape of the add-on bodywork serve little function other than to look good.  This means the unseen underside of the car creates the majority of the downforce needed to make sure the Gen2 sticks to the road through corners. The car's V-shaped rear wing also reduces drag, as a conventional rear wing is the second biggest contributor to aerodynamic drag on a race car.The cars underside, with its huge diffuser, creates down force efficiently without battery-draining drag.The Gen2's V-shaped rear wing reduces drag.Like a road car, much of the bodywork is added to an inner chassis structure. So the Gen2 car be \"reskinned\" with new bodywork without a completely new car being needed. Clever, cool and efficient.FE has also thought about how the Gen2 can be a more entertaining spectacle and how it can encourage more overtaking during races.  Already the lack of rear wing and the large diffuser diminish the amount of turbulence experienced by the car behind.But the Gen2 also reduces the turbulence spread out from along the cars flanks, caused by the open front wheels.  Covering up the front wheels, and placing a curved vane behind them, prevents chaotic air messing up the performance of the trailing car.WATCH: Orlando Bloom crashes a race car Electro Motive ForceWith FE now firmly embedded on the motorsport landscape, its proven formula allows a number of major manufacturers to join the sport for a reasonable cost.The Gen2 car will be raced by automotive institutions like Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, BMW, Jaguar, Nissan, DS-Citroen, as well as the burgeoning EV (electric vehicle) manufacturers Mahindra and NIO.JUST WATCHEDThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race carReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race car 00:55Their job isn't to design an entire car, not even the battery. They provide the motor, along with the electronics hardware and software to exploit the Gen2's innovative design. This 335hp electric powertrain package bolts on to the end of the standard chassis, meaning this is the difference maker between the teams.At the heart of the car, literally, the battery sits inside the rear of the carbon fiber survival cell.  The Gen2 car now has a battery supplied by McLaren Applied Technology, the offshoot of the McLaren F1 team.  Through the first four seasons, the battery wasn't specified to last a full 45-minute race, instead the drivers had to pit and jump into another fully-charged car to complete the second half of the race. Not a great advert for electric vehicles. Now the battery will last the full race, meaning no pit stop to swap or recharge. The longer-range battery is a clear sign that the sport is improving the technology.  In future seasons, the battery technology may be opened to competition. Given the expense of research and development and materials needed to develop cell technology, this is a step FE will take only when it feels the sport is ready for it.With the advent of the Gen2, FE continues to laud its green credentials and brings the racing spectacle into the center of some of the world's major cities.Formula E has been taking motorsport to the world's major cities since 2014.READ: Formula E partners with tech giant to \"write the future\"It's also not conforming to the status quo, making changes to suit its agenda rather than sticking to what's always been done in the past.FE achieves the balance of making the car and the racing exciting with careful design, while encouraging major manufacturers to race electric cars at a manageable cost.  The Gen2 car will make its public debut at the Geneva Motor Show on March 6.The world is waiting.",

But a shot by Canadian skip Kevin Koe was too light, and the US was able to steal two to take the lead for good.Just days ago, the US looked to be on the verge of elimination, having won just twice in six games. But the Americans rallied to win three in a row to win the remainder of their round robin games, including Monday against Canada.\"It's a little surreal right now still, just coming off of where we were to where we are now,\" American Tyler George said. \"It feels like two different tournaments.

After the race, Hirscher said he knew even before the first run that there would be \"no chance\" of a medal because training had gone badly.  \"The feeling was really bad the whole week on slalom skis and this is the final result,\" he told reporters.\"I had absolutely no confidence on this kind of snow. I skied really badly. This is what also can happen and is part of the game, part of the sport.

The much-vaunted US stars were both looking to put some gloss on a mixed Games, with Shiffrin winning gold in the giant slalom but finishing fourth in her preferred slalom, and Vonn settling for bronze in the downhill.Speed specialist Vonn was first after the downhill section of the combined and on course to add to her Olympic downhill title from 2010.  But the most successful female skier of all time missed a gate in the slalom, in all likelihood her final ever Olympic race. \n\n\n\n\nShiffrin went into the slalom in sixth place and skied into gold-medal position until Gisin bettered her combined time of 2:21.87 by 0.97 seconds.

But there is still time for the 22-year-old to match, and even surpass, that feat.\n\n\nAfter the race, Shiffrin said she was happy with her Pyeongchang haul of gold and silver. \"It feels good. It's a nice way to end the Olympics. I started off with a bang, and ending with a medal on the podium is really cool,\" the three-time slalom world champion said. \"I came into these Olympics knowing I could be a medal threat in multiple disciplines. I didn't even know how many I would ski.\"After the gold in the giant slalom, I was really hopeful and positive. Then I had a tougher day in the slalom but it still feels good though.\"Before the Games, there was much talk of Shiffrin, the overall World Cup leader and the most dominant female skier of recent seasons, competing in all five alpine events. But with races postponed in the first week because of strong winds, the new schedule made such a task difficult and so she withdrew from the super-G and the downhill. She also failed to defend her slalom title. Asked about the pressure of going for multiple golds, Shiffrin said: \"It's a pressure I put on myself. But I have an incredible amount of support from fans, friends and family.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)A piece of gray pipe hangs among the potted plants on Susanne Jallow's apartment balcony. Hidden inside the nondescript tube is a tiny computer, seven cables and a particle sensor.In most places, the device would make for an unusual garden accessory. But it is a common sight in Stuttgart, southwest Germany, where hundreds of the gadgets hang in homes and backyards across the city. Jallow, 55, is a lively mother of two who has lived in Stuttgart for 30 years. She uses her sensor every day to check the level of pollution -- but it's not just the numbers that tell her the air is dirty. On bad days, she can see the pollutants on the sensor itself.\"You can feel it,\" she told CNN last year. \"When you go outside, you notice it. You get breathing problems, your throat hurts, you start being short of breath easier.\" The air in Jallow's neighborhood is some of the most polluted in the country, with levels of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) -- both products of diesel vehicles -- often reaching dangerous levels.Susanne Jallow got her particle sensor from Luftdaten (\"air data\"), a local citizens' initiative.Read MoreLast year, she and a neighbor lodged a criminal complaint against the city's mayor and district president, alleging bodily harm caused by air pollution. Jallow lost the case but hasn't stopped campaigning.On Tuesday, Germany's highest court will decide whether diesel cars can be partially banned in German cities, including Stuttgart and D\u00fcsseldorf. Two lower courts ruled in favor of the bans last year, but the two states in which the cities are located appealed those rulings.Jallow is eagerly awaiting the verdict, which could have far-reaching consequences for other German cities.It's not the first time diesel is under debate in a courtroom. Since the German automaker Volkswagen was first exposed for cheating emissions tests in the United States in September 2015, hundreds of thousands of lawsuits have been launched against the company by angry owners of VW diesel cars and investors around the world.VW admitted to illegally programming the engines in several of its diesel models to activate emission controls only during lab testing. But outside the lab, these cars -- marketed as \"clean diesel\" -- were spewing out up to 40 times more nitrogen oxides (known as NOx, a group of gases that includes NO2) than the maximum allowed by US law, and up to 19 times the amount permitted in the European Union.Several VW models marketed as \"clean diesel\" were later implicated in the fraud.In the months that followed the announcement, the scale of the conspiracy -- which allegedly began in 2006 and was the subject of multiple cover-ups -- became clear. Volkswagen said 11 million cars worldwide were fitted with software designed to cheat emissions tests. The company is facing around $30 billion in costs related to the scandal. While two VW employees were sentenced to prison in the US in the past year, to date there have been no criminal prosecutions in Germany, the country that gave birth to the \"Dieselgate\" scandal. Profits are growing, record numbers of VW cars are being sold, and last month was the company's best ever January for vehicle sales.     \"There's that old adage, that crime shouldn't pay,\" said Michael D. Hausfeld, founder and chairman of global law firm Hausfeld, which helped secure a $15 billion settlement to compensate owners of VW vehicles in the US. \"In this instance Volkswagen has basically proven that adage wrong.\" Several other car manufacturers -- including Audi, Porsche (both owned by VW), Daimler and Chrysler -- are now also facing allegations from authorities in the US and Germany that they cheated emissions tests. Multiple investigations are underway and hundreds of thousands of diesel cars have been recalled.\"Volkswagen deeply regrets the behavior that gave rise to the diesel issue,\" spokesman Dirk Ameer told CNN in a statement. \"The Volkswagen Group will leave no stone unturned to prevent violations of any laws and identify such violations as early as possible.\"\"We have been fully cooperating with the US authorities for more than two years and have provided comprehensive transparency,\" Daimler spokeswoman Ute W\u00fcest von Vellberg said in a statement. \"The authorities know the documents and no complaint has been filed.\" A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles referred CNN to a statement from last May in which the company said it would defend itself \"vigorously\" from any claims that it \"engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat US emissions tests.\"READ MORE: Why Germany has a dirty climate secretThe revelationDaniel Carder wasn't expecting to expose a scandal. When the engineer at West Virginia University took on a project in 2012 to investigate diesel emissions, it seemed like a run-of-the-mill job for a man who had spent his whole career in the diesel industry.The goal was to find out why the same supposedly low-emission diesel engine cars being driven around the US were pumping out so many more pollutants on Europe's roads.\"We set out to show that diesels ... are a good option,\" Carder said.Instead, Carder's team discovered that the low emission performance of the US vehicles was a mirage.Gregory J. Thompson, Daniel Carder and Arvind Thiruvengadam (l to r) were part of the research team that discovered the fraud. The discrepancies between emissions in the lab and on the road in two of the three vehicles they tested -- both Volkswagens -- were so shocking that he wondered at first if they had made a mistake.The VW Passat and VW Jetta were emitting 20 to 40 times the amount of NOx they should be.Companies cutting corners on emissions tests was nothing new for Carder.\"But the things that we've encountered in the past have not been at this level, this egregious,\" he said.After several unsuccessful attempts by the California Air Resources Board to get Volkswagen to fix the problem, the news of the fraud broke on September 18, 2015.The scandal made headlines around the world, but hit the people of Wolfsburg, Germany -- home to VW headquarters -- especially hard. Antonio Potalivo, one of more than 60,000 people who work at the VW manufacturing plant in Wolfsburg, recalled his sadness and anger at the news.\"One of my first thoughts was that we have top engineers and it was disappointing to know they used those tricks,\" he told CNN last year.But he said the company's employees -- many of whom have worked at the factory their whole lives, often following in their parents' and grandparents' footsteps -- remained loyal.\"One of my colleagues launched a solidarity campaign: 'In good or bad days we stick to VW'. The kind of phrases you hear when your football team is going downhill,\" he said. \"Volkswagen has done a lot for us.\"The VW factory in Wolfsburg is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world.The fallout The first criminal convictions were handed down two years later.At a hearing in a federal court in Detroit, Michigan last March, VW pleaded guilty to three felony counts -- conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing justice, and importing merchandise by means of false statements.In August 2017, former VW engineer James Liang was sentenced by the same US court to 40 months in jail. In December, the former head of VW's US environment and engineering office, Oliver Schmidt, was sentenced to seven years in prison. The company's crimes have cost it around $30 billion in fines, compensation paid to defrauded diesel car owners, buy-back schemes and \"fixes.\"But while share prices haven't yet recovered, VW's vehicle sales have hardly budged since the scandal broke. That's despite falling diesel sales across the automotive market in the US and most European countries.     READ MORE: Volkswagen used to love diesel. Not anymoreAnd the majority of the penalties -- including the two criminal convictions -- have been issued by the United States, despite less than five percent of the affected cars being driven on US roads.\"At this point, clearly no justice has been done -- or insufficient justice,\" said the lawyer Michael Hausfeld.His firm is trying to redress the balance. In November, they filed a $416 million complaint in a court in Germany on behalf of more than 15,000 defrauded VW customers -- and they're working towards similar cases in several other European countries.  \"Volkswagen committed a most egregious wrong... just to increase its profitability,\" he said. \"They did it for ten years and concealed it. That should be unacceptable everywhere in the world.\"US lawyer Michael Hausfeld said there has been \"no accountability\" for VW's actions in Europe so far. The victimsThe majority of the affected vehicles were sold in Europe, a continent engaged in a largely silent battle against dangerously polluted air.According to the World Health Organization, more than 200,000 deaths in Europe every year can be attributed to particulate matter alone -- of which diesel vehicles are a significant source. Nitrogen dioxide was responsible for around 78,000 deaths in Europe in 2014, according to the European Environment Agency. That's the same gas that was pumped out by VW's diesel cars in far greater quantities than legally allowed.      Nitrogen oxides including NO2 \"cause inflammation on the bronchial mucous membrane,\" explains Andreas Hellmann, a respiratory specialist in Berlin. \"Then we see inflammatory reactions from bronchitis to asthma and the development of lung tumors in some cases.\"According to Hellmann, children living close to main roads can be particularly badly affected and face an increased risk of developing asthma, which in turn makes them even more vulnerable to the effects of nitrogen oxides.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate that 1,200 people in Europe will die early -- each losing as much as a decade of their life -- solely because of the excess emissions generated by VW cars sold in Germany between 2008 and 2015.\"We're slowly and secretly poisoning ourselves,\" Florian H., a Berlin resident who asked CNN not to publish his full last name, told CNN last year. Florian developed asthma two years ago and doesn't leave the house when the smog in the German capital is bad. \"Every time I walk or drive along a main road ... I can't escape the clouds (of air pollution) surrounding me,\" he said. \"Just the sound of a diesel car makes me want to run away.\"\"I used to drive a gasoline car and then I realized it's irresponsible,\" said Florian H. He now has an electric car.READ MORE: Monkeys were used to test diesel fumes, German carmakers sayThe road aheadA number of cities across the world are now banning the most polluting diesel cars, including several in Europe.But no city in Germany has done so -- yet -- and there have been no criminal convictions in the country.In June, the US issued international arrest warrants for five former senior VW employees, Reuters reported -- but they remain safe while in Germany as the country doesn't extradite its own citizens outside the European Union.Oliver Krischer, a leading member of Germany's Green Party and a diesel car owner, blamed his country's government for the lack of punitive measures there.By outsourcing regulation of the car industry to the car industry itself, the government \"opened the floodgates for car manipulations,\" he told CNN last year. \"[It's an] organized failure of the state.\"And he believes that it's an industry-wide problem. \"This is not about a few engineers at VW doing some manipulations but about the entire car industry -- in various ways and to a varying extent -- manipulating emission values instead of reducing the emissions in reality, and they relied on manipulation and fraud,\" Krischer said.One of 8.5 million owners of manipulated VW cars in Europe, Krischer feels personally affected too.\"We thought we were getting a clean car, but in reality we got a dirty one.\"While thousands of duped diesel car owners are successfully suing VW, legal action on health grounds is much more difficult.It's virtually impossible to prove that someone has died because of exposure to high levels of NOx -- or any other kind of air pollution.That's why, according to Susanne Jallow, her case against the mayor failed. She said that when her son developed a cough last year, it could have been due to the air, or due to the flu. \"That's the problem -- it has to be proven.\"And as court cases drag on -- and as bans are implemented slowly, if at all -- the problem is only getting worse.Jallow feels helpless. \"We have to breathe,\" she said. \"We can't just stop breathing when the air quality is bad.\"CNN's Atika Shubert, Claudia Otto, Melina Borcak and Henrik Pettersson contributed to this report.",

He has no real weaknesses. But definitely I would like to take him on, and try to defeat him.\"Krpalek leads a pack of pretenders to Riner's throne alongside 2018 Paris Grand Slam winner Kokomo Kageura and explosive Georgian youngster, Guram Tushishvili.

Still, stepping onto the tatami with the sport's heaviest men -- some of which have been known to tip the scales at over 200kg -- is a \"very different\" challenge.\"This weight category is more about sheer power,\" Krpalek explains. \"It's not as technical, it's not as dynamic or as fast, but great strength dominates here.\"Certainly I would like to gain a few kilos, but it's not as important for me as the strength that I would like to gain.\"Krpalek is still adapting to the 100kg+ category, and was defeated at the Paris Grand Slam by South Korea's Sungmin Kim.Now around 115kg, Krpalek anticipates he'll reach his peak at 120kg. Bulk up too much, and the Czech fighter would sacrifice his secret weapon: stamina.One Czech Judo Federation official privately believes Krpalek would also thrive in cross country skiing, such is the fighter's capacity for endurance.He'll need to summon all his energies if he's to fulfill his ultimate ambition: taking down the six-foot-eight, 141-kilogram Riner.READ: Legends of Judo -- Mongolian icon T\u00fcvshinbayar NaidanAn idol and inspirationIn his bid to make the step up, Krpalek takes inspiration from retired Japanese great Kosei Inoue, who similarly fought in both divisions.\"He is a judoka who achieved outstanding results and one of the best technically in the history of the sport,\" says Krpalek, calling Inoue \"a huge role model.\"JUST WATCHEDLegends of judo: Kosei InoueReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLegends of judo: Kosei Inoue 01:12\"It was wonderful to watch his matches, but not only is he an excellent judoka, I also feel that he is an excellent person too.\"Krpalek, himself a gentle giant off the mat, is reminded of a particular tournament attended by the Japanese contingent in Prague.

Ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast, two shooters -- Englishman Mick Gault and Australian Philip Adams -- lead the way with 18 medals.The pair amassed their totals over six Games.

Aged 20 at the time, he was placed in the lane next to his idol, swimming legend Michael Phelps, for the 200m butterfly final.In the race's early stages everything had been going to plan for Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time. But over the final 50m, Le Clos chased him down and took gold by a fingertip margin of 0.05 seconds -- ending the American's domination of the event since the 2004 Games.READ: How a viral video redefined the Brownlee brothersProud fatherLe Clos became an instant hero -- as did his father Bert, whose ecstatic and breathless reaction in a subsequent TV interview went viral.Bert Le Clos is not just his son's most enthusiastic fan but also the driving force behind his swimming career, convincing him to give up football -- which he also played at a national level until about 13 years old -- and focus on the pool.Le Clos' father cheers on his son during the 2014 Commonwealth GamesIt proved the right decision. By the age of 14, Le Clos had made the senior Olympic squad, and by 18 he held two South African records. He is now his country's most-decorated Olympian.Getting to such an elite level requires more than physical strength. As Le Clos readies himself for the start of the Commonwealth Games on April 5, there will be long hours in the pool and the gym, but also \"a lot of mental, emotional and psychological preparation.\"\"My biggest attribute is my mind,\" he explains, \"and my willpower to try to be the best that I can be.\"",

Alina Zagitova, a 15-year-old skating prodigy, set a huge score of 82.92 at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, 1.31 points clear of Medvedeva's short-lived world record. The gold medal will be decided after scores from the short program are added to those from the free skate on Friday, which means it's all but guaranteed that a Russian skater will take the top spot.For months leading up to the Games, Medvedeva was firm favorite for the gold -- she is, after all, the current World Champion.Zagitova has come out of nowhere however, only entering international competition last year, and going on to win the European Championships in Moscow in January. Read MoreOn the official Pyeongchang website, she lists Medvedeva as one of her heroes, along with Russian rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Speaking after the event, Zagitova said she was nervous going into it and \"didn't expect\" such a big score. She added that, despite it being the \"best performance of (her) life,\" there was still room to grow. \"I could have had more speed going into the jumps, the landings of the jumps could have been smoother, there could have been more emotions,\" she said.\"The important thing is to show progress with each competition. You need to get better and better.\"Medvedeva was sanguine about breaking her own record from the team event -- only to see it smashed minutes later: \"I am not chasing after numbers, but after inner feelings. Today I felt better than in the team event, but I still could have had a higher score if the (jump) combination would have been better.\"Evgenia Medvedeva competes during the Women's Single Skating Short Program on day twelve of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games.Skating prodigyWhile Zagitova has shown why a Gold medal would be well deserved, it would be a heartbreaking loss for Medvedeva, who has laser-focused on these Olympics. As well as being technically incredible, Medvedeva is also a character. Her world record winning program is built around the theme of \"clinical death,\" and in the past she's courted controversy by skating to a track from \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" that included audio from the September 11 terrorist attacks. On the more cheery side, at an event in Tokyo last year, the self-professed KPop and anime fan took to the ice dressed as a character from \"Sailor Moon.\" Evgenia Medvedeva of Russia performs at the ISU World Team Trophy on April 23, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan.The daughter of a figure skater, Medvedeva began skating aged three, but while her success has brought her parental pride, it's also caused massive nerves, according to the official Pyeongchang Olympics website. \"My mother never watches my performance,\" Medvedeva told Russian media last year.\"Probably, our connection is so strong that mum's anxiety comes to me even at a distance. That's why we've agreed that she does not go to competitions and does not even watch the live broadcast. It started since I was 13 when I began competing at international junior events.\"CNN's Euan McKirdy contributed to this report.",

It was a knee injury which prevented her from defending her downhill title in Sochi four years ago, but Vonn said her injury problems had made her stronger. \n\n\n\n\n\"The last eight years have been full of ups and downs. Lots of downs I'd say, especially from 2013 to now,\" she said.\"I've never thought of quitting because of an injury, but it's taken its toll and that's why I can't keep ski racing. \"My injuries have made me stronger because I wouldn't be the same person that I am today. \"When you're young you ski and you win and you don't appreciate things. I've been in the fences so many times, I know so many doctors on a first name basis that it's ridiculous. \"But that's what makes life interesting, what makes you appreciate all of the moments like this because I've been through the hard times.\"I have a huge metal rod in my right arm, that makes me a stronger person.

Multiple Olympics later she has fulfilled that early promise.Vonn still has an outside chance of capping her final Games with Olympic gold when she competes in the combined on Thursday.After the race Vonn revealed she had invited Goggia to her house in November to discuss dealing with pressure and expectation. \"I'm happy to do that: that's sportsmanship,\" said Vonn. \"I appreciate that she even asked me. And I want to give back, I want to see the next generation of ski racers raise the level of our sport.\"Goggia told reporters that Vonn was \"the greatest skier.\"\"She has 81 victories, I have four - five with this,\" said the Italian. \"She's unbelievable.

After finishing her race, the skier cried when asked about her grandad but said that despite not taking gold she hoped she had made him proud. \"That's another reason I've been crying all day. I just wish he was here and wish he could've watched me,\" she said, adding that it was also special to have her father, Alan Kildow, in the crowd. \"It's very special to have my family here, especially my dad.

This is the Olympics, we cheer for every country, instead of someone hoping that someone takes a fall or skis off a cliff and dies. \"It's hard for me to understand the thought process of the savage abuse I've taken on the internet. In real life most people wouldn't say that to me to my face. \"I will not be beaten.

First, eliminate the Polish elites which started in the first weeks and days of the war, and then to turn Poland into a country of undereducated slaves for the Nazis to serve as a  nation of physical laborers to serve their masters.\"I believe that previously we lost the chance to tell this story in the current Museum of World War Two in Poland the current Museum doesn't fulfill this aim.\"JUST WATCHEDHolocaust survivors fear rise of hate and nationalismReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHolocaust survivors fear rise of hate and nationalism 02:13Sellim's comments came in a response to a suggestion made by writer and academic  Marek Kochan, for what he had called a 'Polocaust' museum, to be built in at article for the Polish daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita.While there is no indication that such a museum will be built, Sellim believes it if were, it would provide education for those he says are \"very ignorant\" of the suffering of the Poles.\"The situation that we are in today, this hard unnecessary discussion, which is hurtful mainly for the victims from both sides, the most important Jewish and Polish victims,\" he added.\"It is unfortunate for both Jews and Poles.

Zambia has been drawn in a pool with Canada, Kenya, and -- wait for it -- New Zealand. The All Blacks, as well as being the world's most famous rugby-playing nation, are four-time Commonwealth champions. A terrifying prospect on the one hand. But on the other, it presents Zambia's semi-professional players with massive opportunities to achieve recognition on a global scale and for the sport to gain popularity back home. Read MoreThe atmosphere within the team, needless to say, is buoyant. \"It will be a once in a lifetime opportunity,\" vice-captain Guy Lipschitz tells CNN Sport. \"I'm really excited to play against the game's biggest, top-tier sides.

Others are still in college and university, training three times a week with clubs and playing league games at the weekend.Qualification for the Commonwealths came courtesy of a fourth-place finish in the 2017 Africa Sevens Cup which saw Zambia notch victories over Morocco, Tunisia, Ghana and Senegal.Despite losing the third-place playoff to Magadascar, Zambia finished as the second-ranked Commonwealth nation behind tournament champion Uganda.The team has two tournaments before it arrives on the Gold Coast -- the Royal Bafokeng Sevens in Sun City, South Africa, followed by the Victoria Falls Sevens in Zimbabwe. Two new coaches have also been recruited -- Nyundo Artmitage, a former captain of Zambia sevens, and Neill Nortje, who brings experience of coaching South African side the Golden Lions. \"It's a very big milestone for us to be able to play in the Commonwealths,\" Clement Sinkamba, president of the Zambian Rugby Union, tells CNN Sport. \"This opens up our country as an emerging rugby-playing nation.  \"We are also hoping that by playing such big names as the All Blacks, that should really give us impetus to move forward ...

Having qualified for the Commonwealths, Sinkamba says that he wants to see Zambia crowned African champions and to be given a berth in the Sevens World Series alongside Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe.Developing Zambian rugby at an elite level is one thing; there are also ambitions that the grassroots can grow. The fast-paced, seven-a-side format of the game could be key in this regard.\"Fifteen-a-side is physically quite tough,\" explains Lipschitz. \"In Zambia, we are not physically as big as other teams -- we can't dominate that aspect of the game. \"In sevens you can just hold your own in the physical department and make up for the difference with speed.

Follow @cnnsport\n\nFederer has enjoyed a remarkable 14 months -- winning three grand slams -- after returning to the sport following a lengthy layoff due to a knee injury.But at the age of 36, and the oldest person to become world No. 1 in the sport, the reality is that the 20-time grand slam champion is closer to the end of his career than the beginning.So how does someone whose life has been dominated by tennis feel about eventually having to retire?\"I got a little glimpse into it when I was out for six to eight months in 2016,\" Federer told CNN Sport's Don Riddell, referring to his rehabilitation from that knee injury, \"and I actually enjoyed it a lot!\"Federer is dominating the men's game -- at the age of 36.Read MoreHe says he was able to spend time at home with his family in Switzerland and focused more on his charity -- the Roger Federer Foundation -- which supports child education projects in Southern Africa.\"I'll never get bored, so I'm looking forward to it actually,\" added Federer.\"I have a great group of friends around me, in particularly my wife and parents are amazing so I always know I'll be fine once I retire and when I'm home.\"JUST WATCHED\u200bRoger Federer's tattooed superfan\u200bReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH\u200bRoger Federer's tattooed superfan\u200b 01:01'Great moments'However, Federer's fans can breathe a sigh of relief: he's in no rush to call time on his tennis career.READ: Roger Federer wins Australian Open and 20th major after beating Marin Cilic\"In a way I can't wait for it (retirement), but it should wait for the moment.\"Times are great at the moment as a tennis player.

He then blackmailed them into sending him \"increasingly sickening images -- whose poses he directed -- by threatening to send the original pictures to their family, friends, employers and school pals,\" according to the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA). Read MoreBy the time he was arrested, Falder had approached more than 300 people across the world. Forty-five victims were represented on the court indictment.Matthew Falder admitted 137 offenses, including blackmail and encouraging the rape of a child.Prosecutors described Falder as a man living double life; a Cambridge University graduate and Birmingham University researcher in geophysics by day and a sexual predator by night.\"In more than 30 years of law enforcement I've never come across an offender whose sole motivation was to inflict such profound anguish and pain. Matthew Falder reveled in it,\" said Matt Sutton, a senior investigating officer at the NCA.Matthew Falder was sentenced to 32 years today at Birmingham Crown CourtThe Cambridge University graduate called himself 'evilmind' and '666devil' during years of horrific online offending.

I've just never seen anything like this, where someone is willing to go to these extreme to torment people,\" Scott Crabb with the United States Homeland Security Department told the BBC. Evading law enforcementFalder managed to dodge investigators for years.One of his online aliases first came to authorities' attention in 2012, according to the NCA, when they discovered a UK-based suspect with the username \"Inthegarden\" was using a hurt core site called \"Hurt 2 The Core (H2TC)\" to post blackmail images of a teenage girl.At the time, authorities considered H2TC the world's worst website. Investigators weren't able to identify Falder as the person behind \"Inthegarden\" but in 2015 realized the same person was behind two other usernames on hurt core forums.In order to identify the individual, the NCA said it set up a task force involving British law enforcement, the US Department of Homeland Security, Australian Federal Police and Europol.The partnership helped produce a breakthrough in the case in early 2017 that led authorities to Falder. He was arrested in June.Sutton, the investigating officer, said he had never seen an offender who was able to stay hidden for so long.\"The internet is a virtual scene. I had no forensics whatsoever, nothing, no trace whatsoever,\" Sutton said according to the PA. \"I basically had a needle in a haystack.\"Falder used more than 70 online identities to hide his tracks, the PA reported.\"There was a high degree of sophistication and significant planning by Falder due to his encryption of software and technology in his electronic communication, and the use of multiple fake online identities and encrypted email addresses,\" said Ruona Iguyovwe of the Crown Prosecution Service's International Justice and Organized Crime Division.CNN's James Griffiths contributed to this report",

        "content": "(CNN)A Turkish court sentenced six journalists and other media professionals to life in prison Friday, Turkey's Anadolu state news agency reported, roughly an hour after another court freed a German-Turkish reporter who had been behind bars for a year.The six were all sentenced for being associated with the movement of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Turkey accuses of being behind a failed coup attempt in July 2016.Journalists Ahmet Altan, Mehmet Altan and Nazli Ilicak received life sentences on the charge of being informed about the coup attempt beforehand. Their sentence officially means they must serve 40 years.They were also sentenced for attempting to disrupt constitutional order, as were Fevzi Yaz\u0131c\u0131, Yakup \u015eim\u015fek and \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Tu\u011frul \u00d6z\u015feng\u00fcl, who worked at Gulen-linked newspapers and a television station.\"This is a dark day for press freedom and for justice in Turkey and sets a chilling precedent for scores of other journalists facing trials on similar trumped-up terrorism charges,\" said Gauri van Gulik, Europe director for Amnesty International, of the sentencing.Read MoreFreed journalist returns to GermanyEarlier Friday, a separate court in Istanbul freed Deniz Yucel, a correspondent for Germany's Die Welt newspaper, according to the German government.The German-Turkish journalist was accused of spreading propaganda for the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that the Turkish government has branded a terrorist organization. He was also accused of inciting violence in support of Gulen's movement. Yucel was detained February 14, 2017, and has always denied the accusations. His case had become a cause of serious friction between Berlin and Ankara.#FreeDeniz & #FreeDilek pic.twitter.com/YlWNMYXlBL\u2014 Veysel Ok (@shemmoshemmo) February 16, 2018\n\nA few hours after the release order, his attorney, Veysel Ok, tweeted a photo of Yucel and his wife outside the Istanbul prison. Yucel arrived in Berlin late Friday, posting a message to the official Free Deniz Twitter page.Yucel's charges have not been dropped, and his trial will go ahead as planned. The Istanbul state prosecutor is calling for Yucel to be jailed for up to 18 years, Anadolu reported.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was pleased that Yucel had been released from jail and thanked those who had worked on his behalf.\"I am pleased for him, I am pleased for his wife and his family who had to endure a tough year of separation,\" she said. \"I want to thank the civil society in Germany who did not forget Deniz Yucel and others who are in prison.\"Jailed journalist remains 'patient' despite 150 days of solitary, wife saysThe order to release Yucel came a day after Merkel met with Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Berlin.\"It seems that some problems that occurred in the past in Turkish-German relations are solved today,\" Yildirim said Friday. \"We will take reciprocal steps to develop relations. We expect them not to tolerate terror organizations and not to allow activities that target our unity.\"Yucel was one of a number of German nationals imprisoned in Turkey last year as a diplomatic row between the two countries intensified.Relations have since improved, and two high-profile prisoners -- human rights activist Peter Steudtner and journalist Mesale Tolu -- were released late last year, although judicial proceedings against them are continuing.Five German nationals remain in custody in Turkey, \"whom we must assume are held for political allegations,\" according to the German Foreign Office. Protesters gather outside the Turkish Embassy in Berlin in February 2017 to call for Yucel's release.Friday's announcement coincided with a two-day visit to Turkey by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who held meetings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.Yucel's wife, Dilek Mayaturk, moved from Munich to Istanbul last year to be closer to her husband and tweeted regularly about his imprisonment.As Friday's news broke, she tweeted in Turkish: \"At last!!! At last!!! At last!! Deniz is free!\"sonunda!!! sonunda !!! sonunda!!

There are tears and cries of joy in our newsroom,\" he said in a TV interview.Dozens of journalists have been imprisoned without trial in Turkey since the failed coup, according to Reporters Without Borders. The country is ranked 155 out of 180 countries in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index. CNN's Atika Shubert and Isil Sariyuce also contributed to this report.",

She is also competing in this Saturday's alpine combined slalom. If she wins either she'd become only the third alpine skier to secure three Olympic medals.She claimed Olympic downhill gold and super-G bronze in Vancouver in 2010, but missed the 2014 Sochi Games because of a knee injury.

Medals are decided by the pair's combined score in the short program and the free skate, and even a new world record in the latter, set minutes earlier by French skaters Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, couldn't top Virtue and Moir's combined score of 206.07.That score itself is a new world record under rules which have been in place since 2010. Scores under the previous system, which involved three segments rather than two, were higher.Speaking after her victory was announced, Virtue said the experience was \"amazing.\" Speechless.

They suffered a wardrobe malfunction in their run Monday, frazzling them and costing points. But for the slightly lower score in that skate, it could have been them going home Tuesday in first place.

The pair first began skating together when Virtue was seven and Moir nine, according to the official Pyeongchang website, and made history by becoming the first North American Olympic Ice Dance champions in 2010, winning in their home country at the Vancouver Winter Olympics. Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada perform during the ice dance, free dance figure skating final in the Gangneung Ice Arena at the 2018 Winter Olympics.They are currently Canada's most decorated Ice Dance team of all time, according to CBC.Virtue and Moir, who are known for their passionate -- sometimes overly so, according to some observers -- performances, train up to 35 hours a week together in Montreal, under coaches Marie-France Dubreuil, Patrice Lauzon, and Romain Haguenauer. Bronze for the Shibutanis Maia Shibutani and Alex Shibutani of the United States won bronze in the Ice Dance. Taking their second bronze medal of this Olympics, US siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani came third in the Ice Dance.  Speaking after the final scores were announced, Alex said he was overjoyed by the result. \"It feels like gold. It's unbelievable. I am so proud of the way we fought through this week and the season. We are so emotional,\" he said.Maia added \"it's obviously a strong event.\" \"This was an incredible ice-dance event and to know we gave it our very best means everything,\" she said, adding the two had maintained a belief they could win a medal Tuesday, despite a comparatively low score in the short program. \"We felt that our short dance was amazing.

As representatives of Polish Jewish organizations, we call on public institutions, police, media outlets, schools, and members of the Polish public to combat anti-Semitism, and we are eager to cooperate with them in this critical mission.\"'Deafening silence by the leadership'Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, told CNN on Tuesday that the fallout from the new law has been so fierce it has left many members of the Jewish community wondering if they are still welcome in Poland.Polish Holocaust law sows 'distortions,' Poland's chief rabbi saysSchudrich said the open letter was not a political move but more of an opportunity to show how the community is feeling.\"This is one of the most devastating effects of the past few weeks,\" Schudrich said.'It is devastating that such questions are asked and speaks to the fragility of the situation. It's not just the new law but the tone of the discussion with almost no reaction from leadership to that tone.

Recent Polish governments have sought to challenge that narrative.Earlier this month, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki told CNN that the new law was \"not meant to revise the history whatsoever; this is meant to guard the truth about the Holocaust.\"\"We have to realize that when he or she says that the Polish state or the Polish nation is responsible for the Holocaust, they diminish the responsibility of the real perpetrators,\" Cichocki said.",

The company began life in the 19th century making bicycles and motorcycles before switching attention to their Atom car series in 2000. It's raw, stripped back look -- no roofs, no doors -- cut down on weight, maximized performance and generated rave reviews throughout the motoring press. Ariel's most recent offering, the \"Nomad\" a rugged, sporty off-roader, was released in 2014 -- the same year Saunders started thinking seriously about turning the company's expertise to EVs.JUST WATCHEDThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race carReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Gen2: Formula E's F22-inspired race car 00:55READ: \"Straight outta Gotham!\" -- Batmobile to debut in 2019\"The reason why we've taken such an interest in (electric vehicles) is that the technology is now at a point where an EV can beat a internal combustion engine car,\" Saunders said.\"For Ariel, and our customers, that becomes very interesting. For us it's all about performance but it obviously about efficiency and emissions as well.\" The HIPERCAR will also feature a lightweight gas turbine that will extend the car's range to an estimated 500 miles, a huge step up from the current crop of EVs -- Tesla's Model S tops out at around 315 miles. It's still early days. A research and development phase was completed last September and the first model won't be available until 2019, but Saunders is confident that the technology they're developing will eventually find its way into the mainstream electric car market.

You stole their childhoods and their innocence to satisfy your own perversion.\"Barry Bennell is shown in a court sketch during his appearance for sentencing at Liverpool Crown Court.Read MoreBennell was a 'monster' As the clapping that met the sentencing subsided, victims and their families began to embrace at the conclusion of the six-week trial.Monday marked the first time during the trial that Bennell -- who had watched the proceedings via video link from prison, where he is receiving medical treatment -- had come face to face with his victims.Bennell sat and listened impassively as four victims read out impact statements, detailing how his abuse had wrecked their lives.Andy Woodward: Pedophile football coach could 'do what he wanted'One victim told the court of Bennell: \"That monster decided it was fun for him to use me as a sex toy, someone he could get his kicks from.\"Another victim said that the abuse had made him thinking of taking his own life.\"Not a day goes by without thinking about the abuse I suffered. I loved football and like most boys it was my dream to play professionally,\" he said. \"My dreams were shattered and I often think what could have been.\"The revelation of Bennell's crimes and the sheer scale of his abuse sent shockwaves through English soccer when the allegations burst into the public consciousness in November 2016.A former youth team coach with Crewe Alexandra and a Manchester City junior scout, Bennell's influence spanned across the northwest of England.But it was only after former player Andy Woodward broke his 30-year silence over how he was abused by Bennell during a 2016 interview with the Guardian that others began to come forward.Former footballer Andy Woodward (L) arrives with his partner Zelda (R) at court on Monday.Speaking outside court after the sentence, Woodward, who had previously described Bennell as a \"monster,\" told reporters: \"No sentence is long enough for that man and right to the death he didn't show any remorse or say sorry to anyone.\"I'm proud that I did speak out. If I hadn't have done, we all wouldn't be stood here now today.\"Another victim, Steve Walters, told reporters that Bennell had not shown \"one ounce of remorse, not one shred of decency.\"\"He is calculated, devious and scheming. He was then and he is now,\" said Walters. \"But he has finally been held to account for his horrific crimes against children.\"'Master of control'Since Woodward broke his 30-year silence in his interview with the Guardian, several others have spoken of how Bennell abused them.A statement from another victim, Chris Unsworth, which was read out at court, revealed that he had chosen against having children out of fear he would be unable to protect them against \"predatory people like Bennell.In an interview with the BBC, Unsworth described how Bennell raped him between 50-100 times from the age of nine.Ex-Manchester City youth football player Chris Unsworth (C) arrives at court on Monday.\"Barry Bennell abused me, groomed me, manipulated me and destroyed all my childhood and dreams of becoming a professional footballer,\" Unsworth said in a statement, according to the UK Press Association.He added: \"Despite trying to bury what happened to me all those years ago this continues affect me now.\"Who is Barry Bennell?A highly regarded youth team coach during the 1980s, Bennell was described by Woodward as a \"master of control\" when it came to charming children and their parents.JUST WATCHEDEx-footballer speaks out about sexual abuseReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHEx-footballer speaks out about sexual abuse 02:16A former youth player at Chelsea, Bennell gained a reputation for developing young players while at Crewe Alexandra, a club in the northwest of England, as well as enjoying links with Manchester City.The court heard how Bennell would hoodwink parents into gaining their trust before taking their children and abusing them at his home, in his car, on football tours and at holiday parks.Prosecutors spoke of how Bennell had a \"power hold\" over his victims, who were fearful that speaking out could jeopardize their dreams of becoming professional footballers.Several of his victims had turned to alcohol in later life, while others had spoken of their depression and having suicidal thoughts.Bennell's victims -- (L-R) Steve Walters, Gary Cliffe, Chris Unsworth and Micky Fallon -- speak outside court on Monday.This is not the first time Bennell has been prosecuted for offenses against children.He has been jailed three other times for child abuse, including once in the United States where he was reportedly described by Florida police as having \"almost an insatiable appetite\" for young boys.In 1998, Bennell was jailed for nine years after pleading guilty to 23 charges of sexually abusing six children. Woodward was among his victims at Crewe football club.Bennell was convicted and sentenced to prison most recently in 2015 for two years for a past sexual offense against a 12-year-old boy.CNN's James Masters wrote from London.

        "content": "(CNN)Some Olympians are destined for greatness, others are there just to make up the numbers, but some manage to defy expectations or even shock the world.More than a century of Olympic competition has provided no end of heartwarming tales, and the Winter Games are no exception. Here are some of the greatest underdog moments at the Winter Olympics:1980: Miracle on Ice Read MoreFinal minute of the \"Miracle on Ice\". #tbthttps://t.co/GzkmBD8H7a\u2014 Olympics (@Olympics) March 17, 2016\n\n The idea of the USA being underdogs in pretty much any Olympic sport -- let alone ice hockey, where the country is a traditional powerhouse -- is a faintly ridiculous prospect. But at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, the USA entered the Games seeded seventh out of 12 teams.The team was made up primarily of college and amateur athletes but they surprised many by cruising through the preliminary rounds against more fancied opposition. But it was in the medal round when the Americans really shone. They were up against the legendary Soviet team, which had won gold in the previous four Olympics. It didn't look good for Team USA -- their then-Cold War foe had wiped the ice with the Americans 10-3 in an exhibition match earlier that month. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the sides were tied 2-2 after the first period, before the Soviets edged ahead in the second. When Mark Johnson brought the scores level in the third period, the scene was set for one of winter sport's most memorable triumphs. In a made-for-movie finish -- the triumph got the Hollywood treatment with a made-for-TV film in 1981 and again with the release of \"Miracle\" in 2004 -- captain Mike Eruzione scored the famous fourth and winning goal to seal the unlikeliest of triumphs.The USA beat Finland to win gold but it was the semifinal victory over the Soviets that was the stuff of miracles. 1988: It's bobsled timeThe Jamaican bobsled team at Calgary in 1988 inspired the film \"Cool Runnings.\"  No Olympic underdog story would be complete without the inclusion of arguably the greatest underdogs of all time -- the Jamaican bobsled team from the Calgary Games. The novelty of four Jamaicans swapping their tropical Caribbean homeland to become their country's first bobsled competitors at a Winter Olympics resonated around the world. The quartet started the sport from scratch, coached by a former US Olympic bobsledder, and five months later made their splash in Calgary. They famously crashed before the line, but their tale was the inspiration for the 1993 Disney film \"Cool Runnings.\"  After a 12-year absence, Jamaica returned to the Olympic bobsled arena in the two-man event when Winston Watts and Marvin Dixon crowdfunded their way to Sochi in 2014. The first Jamaican women's team of Carrie Russel and Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian is set to keep the tradition moving forward in Pyeongchang, though their time in South Korea has not been without incident following the departure of driving coach Sandra Kiriasis.JUST WATCHEDThe Jamaican women evoking 'Cool Runnings'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Jamaican women evoking 'Cool Runnings' 03:09READ: Jamaican women's bobsled's Olympic teething problems1988: The Eagle soarsAnother Winter Olympian immortalized on the silver screen -- for his unlikely contribution to the pantheon of athletes, rather than his towering achievements -- was Michael \"Eddie\" Edwards, subject of the 2016 film \"Eddie the Eagle.\" \n\n\nEdwards became famous in Calgary as the backstory came out of a struggling skier desperate to become an Olympian despite a lack of ski-jumping experience, money, trainer, kit or facilities.\"Eddie the Eagle is quintessentially British,\" former Olympian and Edwards' countryman Kriss Akabusi said in a documentary about the ski jumper. \"Eddie the Eagle could not be a star in any other country than the United Kingdom. He had a go. He dared to go where most of us won't. He stood on the top of a precipice and said, 'Geronimo!'\"While his jump at Calgary -- 71 meters -- was a British record, it placed him 58th out of 58 competitors. But he remains one of the sport's most-beloved competitors -- and the only one to have a movie made about them.

However, it clinched gold in the 1,000-meter short-track final in Salt Lake City in 2002 through a remarkable set of circumstances.Steven Bradbury, then 28 and in his fourth Games, was something of a veteran in the world of short track, but he reached the final courtesy of a disqualification to another racer in the quarters and a crash taking out his three of his rivals in the semifinal. In the medal race, Bradbury knew he couldn't match the pace of the other finalists, so he stuck to his cautious gameplan of staying at the back out of trouble. But when the four skaters in front of him, including US star Apolo Ohno, went down in a pile-up on the last bend, the incredulous Bradbury glided past for an improbable victory.It was the first gold medal for Australia at a Winter Olympics and cemented Bradbury's place in history as the \"accidental hero.\"2018: This year's underdogsWho says you can't swap the Summer Games for the Winter ones?Tonga's Pita Taufatofua, a former taekwondo practitioner who set hearts aflame in Rio with his oiled-up opening ceremony appearance, became only the second Tongan to appear at the Winter Olympics when he strapped on his cross-country skis this month. The athlete, who reportedly had only seen snow once before he took up the sport, qualified for the tournament last month with only one day of qualification left.

The lack of some of the world's best players, including a disproportionate number of US team players, means the field will be more open -- and the US potentially considered an underdog for the first time this century.",

Moments later, Team LeBron's Kevin Durant connected with Russell Westbrook, on a layup to cut the lead to one.The defensive effort picked up intensity as well, as Team LeBron forced Giannis Antetokounmpo to commit a double-dribble while Team Stephen clung to a slim, one-point lead.Read MoreFirst-time All-Star Joel Embiid scored a layup to push the lead to three. However, James would exploit Embiid on the other end, pulling up for a three, as the center gave up a wide gap of space.

However, following an extensive replay review, the officials would -- incorrectly -- award Team Stephen the ball. Embiid would make-up for the near turnover on the defensive end, blocking a layup attempt by Paul George.Down one point, following a free throw by DeMar DeRozan, Kyrie Irving would again connect with James for the go-ahead layup. Irving finished with a team-high nine assists to go with his 13 points. James Harden would miss a three-point shot, and DeRozan would throw a bad pass, giving the ball back to Team LeBron.On the ensuing inbounds play, LeBron would toss the ball full-court to Russell Westbrook for a layup to push the lead to three.Of course, the testament to whether the new format and increased player incentives would actually work would be defense. Fitting, then, that the final play of the game -- with a three-point lead in-hand -- was a defensive trap in the corner that prevented Team Stephen from getting a good look to tie the game.A near-triple-double resulted in LeBron James being awarded the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player award, as he finished with a game-high 29 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists.'Can you dig it!'The night was a spectacle, both good and bad, from start to finish.

He finished with just 11 points on 4-of-14 shooting from the floor.Following a run by Team LeBron to, briefly, take the lead in the second quarter, Joel Embiid and Giannis Antetokounmpo led the charge to push Team Stephen back to a double-digit lead, 70-58. However, Paul George came up big, scoring eight of Team LeBron's final 11 points to cut the lead to two at halftime.Stephen Curry's moment to shine really came late in the third quarter, when trailing by four, 105-109, he scored a short runner, assisted on a layup by Karl-Anthony Towns, and hit a three-pointer to retake the lead, 112-109, going into the final 12-minutes of regulation.New rulesConsidering the changes made to the All-Star Game format were intended to give fans a more competitive game to watch, commissioner Adam Silver and the league office should consider this year's format a success. No conference teams, no problems. This year, the two players who received the most fan votes were named team captains. That honor went to both James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Curry from the defending league-champion Golden State Warriors.

A logistical and practical impossibility, right?Perhaps not. On February 22, in an event known simply as \"the Open,\" an estimated 500,000 CrossFit athletes from all over the world will begin a five-week fitness competition, which will test strength, endurance, and aspects of gymnastics. The Open works like this: every Thursday at 8 p.m. Eastern, a set workout, kept secret ahead of time, is released live online. Everyone, then, has four days to complete it in front of a judge or on tape and to submit their scores. Simple.Every Thursday, CrossFit athletes are given a set workout which is released online. They then, have four days to complete it and to submit their scores.After five weeks the top few hundred in the world advance to the next stage of competition, eventually working towards the CrossFit Games in August. The other 99.9% however, go back to the drawing board -- or in CrossFit terms, the whiteboard.Read MoreFrom 30 competitors to a global phenomenonIn recent years the Open has become truly global with competitors participating from every continent, including Antarctica and at sea. But it wasn't always this way. The competition began back in 2007, when CrossFit founder Greg Glassman visited the family ranch of one of his employees, Dave Castro.Glassman was already making a name for himself for the new workout practices he was putting into place, fostering a sizable following online, and suggested to Castro they hold an event and make it \"the Woodstock of Fitness.\" From that, the CrossFit Games were born. On February 22, in an event known simply as \"the Open,\" an estimated 500,000 CrossFit athletes from all over the world will begin a five-week fitness competition.With just 30 competitors in its first year the event quickly flourished, eventually outgrowing the ranch. Then, just a few years later it was selling out arenas. During that time the qualification pool grew equally as rapidly, adding regional qualifying events in 2009, and by 2011 the introduction of the worldwide Open. Within a matter of years the CrossFit Games had expanded from a Californian curiosity to a global phenomenon, annually crowning what CrossFit calls the \"Fittest on Earth.\"The top secret facilityCrossFit's reputation as a \"cult\", simultaneously with trepidation from the outside and strong affection from within, is not diminished by the secrecy surrounding this competition.JUST WATCHEDYou've heard of it, but what is Crossfit?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHYou've heard of it, but what is Crossfit? 02:36Part of Glassman's original creed of CrossFit was to prepare athletes for anything, \"not only for the unknown but for the unknowable,\" and as such, the weekly workouts are kept top secret.Athletes expecting to advance beyond the Open must prepare for every possible eventuality, and any beforehand knowledge of the specifics of the competition would create a massive unfair advantage.Therefore the competition is created and tested at an undisclosed location where prior to our arriving, no outside media had ever been given access.READ: How to talk to someone who does CrossFit, if you really mustIn a nondescript industrial park, behind an unmarked door we found Dave Castro, director of the CrossFit Games and a former Navy SEAL, who closely protects his work with the discipline of a security guard at Area 51. JUST WATCHEDCNN gets exclusive access inside CrossFit's secret gymReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCNN gets exclusive access inside CrossFit's secret gym 01:44We were driven to the gym blindfolded and the location data was scrubbed from pictures and videos taken within the facility. All confidential information pertaining to the competitions seen on camera had to be pixelated before going to air and both my photographer and I had to sign non-disclosure agreements. The gym itself is a miniature version of the competition floor at the CrossFit Regional and Games events.The walls are plastered with equipment used at previous years' Games, as well as equipment being tested for future competitions which, of course, is forbidden for me to talk about. In addition to testing workouts Castro uses the facility to design each competition -- behind a locked door to which only he has the key -- where no other CrossFit employee is allowed.After some deliberation Castro agreed to give us a brief tour of his secret room, but told us not to look too closely and swiftly ushered us out. Workout speculationWhile he insists on keeping everything tightly under wraps, Castro cannot help but issue tantalizing hints on his Instagram account. Often seemingly random, always cryptic, and sure to cause a swarm of online activity among the CrossFit obsessed. Castro, in a rare interview he granted CNN, insists that none of his hints are deliberate red herrings and that every post relates to a workout -- at least it does to him.Dave Castro drops cryptic hints about the Open on social media to keep CrossFitters guessing\"People really enjoy speculating,\" Castro says, \"sometimes I'll see something and it will remind me of the workout. I'll see a fire hydrant and it will remind me how I felt after I did the workout, so I'll take a picture and post it and people will go crazy speculating on what it can be.\"The actual workouts will remain secret -- that is until they are announced on a live online broadcast.In what has evolved to become a highly produced roadshow hosted in a different international city every week, Castro will write out the workout on a whiteboard before an increasingly large and fervent studio audience. He will then be joined by some of the best CrossFitters in the world, including many of the former \"Fittest on Earth\" winners, who will step up to become the first to take on the challenge, live online. Then it's the rest of the world's turn.  The no-nonsense authoritarian taskmasterWithin the CrossFit community Castro has garnered somewhat of an interesting reputation.His name has become synonymous with a degree of difficulty considered by many as above and beyond the norm for CrossFit, with a sizable number of people proudly wearing potentially offensive t-shirts proclaiming \"Dave Castro is a prk.\"Instead of taking it personally or shying away from the remark, Castro accepts his reputation.Castro doesn't take his reputation too seriously, and says he's testing athletes - not making friends.\"That actually started before my CrossFit career when I was a Navy SEAL instructor, because I was preparing these kids for war,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to be their friends. That was my mentality then and it kind of is my mentality now. I'm testing these athletes to find out who the fittest in the world is and I'm not trying to make friends.\"In person, Castro is amiable and engaging, leading me to believe his no-nonsense authoritarian taskmaster persona is largely a front, a workplace necessity when running a sport jam-packed full of alphas.Compete directly with the best athletes in the worldThe Open has become a focal point for the CrossFit community offering an opportunity to measure your personal progress since last year's competition.But the event also has another feature, and one which is perhaps unique within the sporting world. Unlike most, if not all sporting events, the Open provides an opportunity to compete directly with the very best athletes in the world. No matter how good my tennis game is on any given day, I would never have the opportunity to go head-to-head with Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal.The Open provides the rare opportunity to compete directly with the very best athletes in the world.However, in theory (very much in theory), on your best day in the Open you could come out on top against the athletes who will eventually go on to compete in the sports' world championships at the CrossFit Games in August. Just as equally, if you continue to perform well, you could join them there.This is unlike any other sporting event because no professional would ever begin their championship campaign at the same round as weekend warriors and enthusiastic amateurs. More realistically though, this system of direct competition allows you to go head-to-head with friends, colleagues and family, which makes the Open a true coming together of the CrossFit community.",

Violations would be punished by a fine or a jail sentence of up to three years.Read MoreIsrael has been vociferous in its criticism of the new law, accusing Poland of attempting to rewrite history.But Morawiecki's comments on Saturday at a security conference in Munich prompted a fresh wave of anger.Replying to an Israeli journalist when questioned about whether a person could be imprisoned for claiming there were Polish collaborators in the Holocaust, Reuters reported Morawiecki as saying, \"Of course it's not going to be punishable, not going to be seen as criminal, to say that there were Polish perpetrators, as there were Jewish perpetrators, as there were Russian perpetrators, as there were Ukrainian, not only German perpetrators.\"Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has been fiercely criticized for his comments.The comments sparked an outcry from Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who phoned Morawiecki to register his disgust.Netanyahu labeled the comments as \"unacceptable\" and insisted \"there was no basis for comparing the actions of Poles during the Holocaust to those of Jews.\" Netanyahu added that the \"distortion regarding Poland could not be corrected by means of another distortion.\"Israeli President Reuben Rivlin described Morawiecki's remarks as a \"new low.\"Read: Poland's Holocaust law should terrify youJUST WATCHEDHolocaust survivors fear rise of hate and nationalismReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHolocaust survivors fear rise of hate and nationalism 02:13A Polish government spokesperson sought to clarity Morawiecki's comments, insisting they were not \"intended to deny the Holocaust, or charge the Jewish victims of the Holocaust with responsibility for what was a Nazi German perpetrated genocide.\"\"The Prime Minister has repeatedly and categorically opposed denial of the Holocaust -- the murder of European Jewry -- as well as anti-Semitism in all its forms,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\"Attempts to equate the crimes of Nazi German perpetrators with the actions of their victims -- Jewish, Polish, Romani among others -- who struggled for survival should be met with resolute, outright condemnation.\"The Holocaust, the genocide of the Jews committed by the German Nazis, was a horrific crime. Even during those dark hours of war and murder, there were individuals of all nations who bravely carried out gestures of the greatest mercy. 1/2\u2014 Mateusz Morawiecki (@MorawieckiM) February 18, 2018\n\nSadly,this period also exposed dark parts of human nature, which for some meant collaboration with German Nazis. Dialogue on these difficult chapters of our history is essential\u2014a dialogue we hope to continue w/ Israel. Today, I spoke about this with Prime Minister @netanyahu 2/2\u2014 Mateusz Morawiecki (@MorawieckiM) February 18, 2018\n\nPoland was the center of Ashkenazi Jewry before the Holocaust, with around 3.5 million Jews living in the country before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. By the end of the war, just 10% of the community remained. Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall.Polish Holocaust law sows 'distortions,' Poland's chief rabbi saysAccording to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem, between 30,000 and 35,000 Polish Jews were saved with the help of non-Jewish Polish citizens.Despite more Poles being honored as Righteous Among the Nations -- non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust -- than any other country, there is a consensus among historians that certain Polish individuals and groups did collaborate with the Nazi occupiers. Recent Polish governments have sought to challenge that narrative.Earlier this month, Poland's deputy foreign minister Bartosz Cichocki told CNN that the new law was \"not meant to revise the history whatsoever, this is meant to guard the truth about the Holocaust.\"\"We have to realize that when he or she says that the Polish state or the Polish nation is responsible for the Holocaust, they diminish the responsibility of the real perpetrators,\" Cichocki added. CNN's Oren Liebermann reported from Jerusalem. James Masters wrote from London.",

But having yet to reveal he was gay, the slopestyle silver medalist had second thoughts. He was not ready for that to be his coming-out-moment. But on a sun-kissed morning at the Phoenix Snow Park in Pyeongchang, the 26-year-old spotted his boyfriend Matthew Wilkas and the rest is LGBT history. \"It was the tiniest kiss in the world.

He has spoken at length about initially fearing losing sponsors and friends. He has since emerged as a prominent voice in the LGBT community, has more well-known sponsors than ever before and in 2017 was awarded a Visibility Award by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group.\n\n\n\n\n\"We're here. We're queer. Get used to it,\" Kenworthy, one of a number of openly gay athletes competing at the Games, tweeted with a picture of him and his teammate Adam Rippon, another openly gay Olympian. When he announced Saturday he had a broken thumb, Kenworthy also took a swipe at US Vice President Mike Pence. \"Broke my thumb yesterday in practice,\" he wrote. \"It won't stop me from competing (obvi) but it does prevent me from shaking Pence's hand so... Silver linings!\" he tweeted.Kenworthy's open contempt of Pence stems over the Vice President's record on same-sex marriage and LGBT issues.READ: Kenworthy's silver lining at having a broken thumb My Seoul mate!

Though was to be no glory on the slopes, at least he was no longer hiding his true self. \"I'm bummed but I'm not sulking I'm not crying,\" he said. \"I'm really proud to be here and being out at these Olympics has meant the world to me, just getting to be myself and be authentic.\"Afterwards a forlorn-looking Kenworthy met with his friends and boyfriend near the bottom of the course. Throughout the competition they had been waving rainbow flags and the Stars and Stripes.Some wore jumpers with USGAY embossed on the front, while Wilkas held aloft a rainbow flag with 'We love you Gus' inked on it. Among the Kenworthy crowd was Tyler Oakley, a YouTube star, television host and LGBT activist. The American described Kenworthy and Wilkas' kiss as a \"moment to celebrate.\"\"At a time when his home country has officials that don't celebrate that type of love, it's important, it means something,\" he added. As fans filtered out of the park Kenworthy was still being asked for selfies. Even with no new Olympic medal to hang around his neck, this eloquent skier's voice will still be heard.",

Krushelnitckii, who won bronze in the mixed doubles event at this year's Olympics, is awaiting the results of a so-called \"B sample,\" which could be known as early as this evening local time in South Korea. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said in a statement Monday it has initiated the process of reviewing Krushelnitckii's case after a request by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). A hearing date has not been set, the statement said. Earlier in the day, Konstantin Vybornov, a spokesman for the Olympic Athletes from Russia, declined to name Krushelnitckii but said an official comment would be made after the results of the second test.Aleksandr Krushelnitckii of Olympic Athletes from Russia looks on during the Curling Mixed Doubles bronze medal game.More than 160 Russian athletes who could prove they were clean from doping are competing in a Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) team after the nation was banned from the Games because of state-sponsored doping leading up to and including the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.

It's not quite as apparent as something like a cross-country skier or maybe a distance runner or even a weightlifter, but there is absolutely strength and conditioning and fitness in curling and it will give you a little bit of an edge even if it's not on every shot in every end.\" Photos: Winter Olympics: Monday, February 19Gigi Marvin, top right, celebrates with her American teammates after scoring the opening goal against Finland.

They would like nothing more than to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what's most practical and effective in keeping our people safe,\" she said. \"So let the message ring out loud and clear today: We will not let that happen. We will together protect and project our values in the world. And we will keep our people safe now and in the years to come.\"Britain currently cooperates with its European partners on security through intelligence sharing and its membership in the European police agency, Europol, and the European Arrest Warrant system.In an important concession, May said Britain would continue to respect the remit of the European Court of Justice when participating in EU agencies.She previously insisted that Britain would pull out of the ECJ, a position Brexit supporters in her own party insist she maintains.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker follows May at the security conference Saturday.Addressing the conference after May, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the \"security bridge\" between Britain and the EU would be maintained and was still needed.\"However, you cannot mix up this question with other questions that are important in the context with Brexit,\" Juncker said. \"You have to look at them individually. And you have to answer question by question, matter by matter. But I do not want to mix up security policy considerations with other considerations.\"Brexit is far from Europe's biggest problemIn her speech, May said a new treaty must preserve current operational capabilities but also be respectful of the UK's and the EU's separate and sovereign legal systems.It should also include a form of independent dispute resolution across all areas of future partnership, May said.On the matter of data protection, the UK will \"align\" with the EU framework, but the UK will still have its own, separate, customized data protection plan, she said.\"I recognize there is no existing security agreement between the EU and a third country that captures the full depth and breadth of our existing relationship,\" May said.\"But there is precedent for comprehensive, strategic relationships between the EU and third countries in other fields, such as trade. And there is no legal or operational reason why such an agreement could not be reached in the area of internal security.\"The EU and UK are set to embark on negotiations on the terms of a transition period after Britain's departure before moving onto future trade and security relations.CNN's Nic Robertson and Simon Cullen contributed to this report.",

The Austrian skier made history after winning the men's giant slalom Sunday, becoming the first man to win that and the men's alpine combined skiing event in the same Winter Games. \n\n\n\n\nHirscher went into Sunday's race as a heavy favorite as one of the most successful skiers of his generation. \"Wow. It was not so easy to be the absolute favorite in this discipline, then sitting up there as the leader from the first run knowing that Henrik (Kristoffersen) ripped it. I had no choice, I knew I have to give 100% and I have to go into this battle,\" Hirscher said, reflecting on his win. Read MoreHirscher also spoke about how his efforts have finally paid off. \"The first Olympics, they were not so successful. I mean, finishing fourth and fifth, it was OK.

And now, I think it pays off.\"READ: Winter Olympics day 9: Live updatesREAD: Best  photos from day 9 at PyeongChang 2018\n\n\nGoing into the Games, Hirscher had won 55 World Cup races and a record six consecutive World Cup overall crowns.

Hirscher skied two nearly flawless runs to finish 1.27 seconds ahead of silver medal winner Henrik Kristoffersen, the second-ranked giant slalom skier.That's the largest margin of victory in the competition since Jean-Claude Killy won it by 2.22 seconds in 1968.

Unfortunately, I got a headwind in the middle section, but I attacked. I'm disappointed, but I'm not upset,\" the 33-year-old told reporters. \"I came in there with pretty decent speed. I think the terrain just caught me a little bit. I thought I had the turn finished sooner than I did and I lost elevation. I'm happy that I hung on and still was able to finish the course.\"I've had a roller coaster the last eight years with so many injuries, but I'm here, I'm healthy. I have two more races left, so I hope those will go a little bit better.\"Vonn talking to the media after the raceVonn, who throughout the build up to these Games has vowed to win gold in memory of her late grandfather, looked skywards after crossing the finish line. She explained: \"He (my grandfather) was supposed to help me. I was like 'what happened, grandpa? Why did we not ski better?'\"I did the best I could. I'm happy with my performance. It might not be a medal, but I definitely gave it everything I had.\"READ: Vonn moved to tears in memory of late grandfatherREAD: Vonn set for 'full charge' at OlympicsMore delaysHigh winds on Saturday delayed the start of an event which had already been rescheduled from earlier in the week because of the weather.Three of the first four races in the Alpine program were postponed this week after winds of up to 72kph wreaked havoc with the schedule.Vonn still has a chance of winning an Olympic title at these Games, which she said were \"most likely to be her last.\"\"It just depends on my knee. I love ski racing. I want to keep racing forever. Unfortunately, my body is not the Terminator. I can't take as many beatings as I used to,\" she added. \"We'll see what happens, but I would say 99% sure this is my last Olympics.\"The four-time world champion, a super-G bronze medalist in 2010, will compete again on Wednesday in the downhill and victory would make her only the third American alpine skier to win three career Olympic medals.

I was just like, 'Oh screw it, I'm going to try it. At this point I have literally nothing to lose. I'll just go for it.\"  The 18-year-old was blunt when asked to assess his overall performance at the games. \"Honestly, I am human, I make mistakes. Unfortunately I had been having a really bad time. But I'm really happy with what I did here,\" he said.",

It was unclear whether he would ever walk again, let alone skate. \"My first thought was that I was paralyzed,\" he tells CNN. \"I was just thinking, 'okay, am I going to walk?' \"Once I could move, I thought 'what's my life going to be like from here?'\"His life, it turned out, would be pretty similar. The pinnacle of his career was still to come. Read MoreOn Thursday, 16 months after the collision, he played his first game representing Canada at the Winter Olympics, scoring two of his team's five goals in a win against Switzerland.  Wojtek Wolski celebrates scoring in Canada's first Olympic 2018 vs. SwitzerlandREAD: Chloe Kim -- America's 17-year-old sensationThe comebackHis recovery has been extraordinary. Wolski had suffered \"a fracture of the seventh and fourth cervical vertebrae, a bruise of the cervical spinal cord, brain concussion, bruises and abrasions of the face\" playing for the Russian team Metallurg Magnitogorsk in a match against Barys Astana in Kazakhstan.He moved from intensive care to the neurosurgery department, finally receiving successful surgery in January 2017.At this point, ice hockey and the Winter Olympics were far from his thoughts. \"At the beginning I was thinking of my kids,\" he says, \"just being able to play with them.\" Wolski has two children with his Canadian wife Jesse Jammers, aged three years and 10 months.In an Instagram post following the surgery, he thanked his wife and his \"strong and loving support system.\" He also joked about getting back on the ice, writing that he was more likely to be \"back on the golf course and tennis court since it'll be perfect time for summer.\"However, as soon as he realized he would have no lasting nerve damage, hockey crept back into mind. \"That was the next thought,\" he says, \"when can I get back? How quickly can I get back?\"By June, Wolski was practicing again, and he was playing regular season games by September. It was on January 11th, a year and a day after his surgery, that he was named in Canada's Olympic team. READ: Tonga's flag bearer achieves \"impossible dream\"Career breakFor Wolski, this marks the peak of his career. \"The Olympics is the culmination of everything I've ever done, it just seems like it makes it all worth it -- all the trials and tribulations,\" he says.Of these there have been many. Wolski played in the NHL for nine seasons with five different teams (Colorado Avalanche, New York Rangers, Phoenix Coyotes, Florida Panthers, Washington Capitals), racking up 99 goals and 267 assists. But during this period he began to struggle with depression. Wojtek Wolski playing for the New York Rangers in 2012\"There were times when I didn't want to play hockey, but there were other times that I didn't want to live anymore,\" he says. In 2013, Wolski left the NHL and headed for Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.The 31-year-old owes his powers of perseverance to his father, who brought the family from Poland to Canada as refugees when Wolski was just one year old. His father would tell him \"you never fail until you quit\" while he was growing up. \"That was definitely a message that replayed in my head when things got hard and I was looking for the easy way out,\" recalls Wolski.  Team Canada And he's not the only member of the Canadian team who's come back from the brink.Eric O'Dell underwent surgery in 2010 and spent months in recovery after a small hole was discovered in his heart.Few expected him to play at an elite level again, yet he took to the ice alongside Wolski.O'Dell was one beneficiary of the NHL's decision to not release its players for the Games, meaning Canada had to look far and wide for players.Like Wolski, O'Dell plays in Russia for HC Sochi.It means this year's Canada team has a different look to the one that clinched gold four years ago. But that doesn't phase Wolski, \"I think this is our time,\" he says. \"I think we have to prove to ourselves and to Canadians and the world that this is a stage that we can play on and that we can win gold.\"",

        "content": "Moscow (CNN)Russians have watched with horror this week as the details of the latest US school shooting, in Parkland, Florida, have emerged.President Vladimir Putin is among the world leaders who have offered condolences to the families who have lost their children.But there is also real concern in Russia that a problem previously seen as almost exclusively American is now spreading to its territory.In recent months, Russia itself has experienced a series of school attacks -- including one last September, in Ivanteevka, outside Moscow, and three in the space of a week last month.  According to state media, the teenaged perpetrators used air guns and knives, not semi-automatic weapons, and the victims suffered injuries, with no deaths reported.Read MoreBut Russian media reports were filled with speculation that at least some of the attacks were inspired by online groups focused on notorious school killings in the United States, particularly the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.A video screen grab shows a classroom in Sosnovy Bor where a boy attacked his teacher and schoolmates with an ax and tried to start a fire before his arrest on January 19.In one of the Russian attacks, on January 15, two teenage attackers armed with knives stabbed a dozen children and two teachers at a primary school in the Urals city of Perm. Four days later, a teenager armed with an ax and a homemade firebomb attacked a school in the village of Sosnovy Bor, outside the city of Ulan-Ude in the Republic of Buryatia, in eastern Siberia. Six students and a teacher were injured, according to state media.America leads the world -- in this horrific wayThere was also a stabbing that week at a school in Russia's Chelyabinsk region, in which one student was reported injured.In Ivanteevka, a teenager brought homemade explosives, an ax and air weapons to his school, according to state news agency Tass. He attacked a teacher with the weapons and set off the explosives. Three students were injured when they jumped out a window to escape.In the wake of the attacks last month, Russia's Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, or Roskomnadzor, clamped down on social-media groups believed to be manipulating young people's actions.A statement from the ministry said Russia's Vkontakte social network had deleted nine so-called Columbine communities, and that \"posts of a similar nature\" had also been removed from four other communities.It was believed these groups \"had illegal information capable of pushing minors to antisocial behavior, the result of which could be acts of a suicidal nature,\" the ministry said.Parents with children and police stand outside the school in Perm where a knife attack left a teacher and several students injured.Russian state media is often criticized for exaggerating, even gloating at, problems or discord in the West, as a way of deflecting from Russia's own troubles.   But the latest horrifying images emerging from the Florida school shooting speak for themselves. Putin, in a telegram to his US counterpart Donald Trump, sent his \"sincere sympathy and support to the families and friends of the deceased, as well as the wishes for a speedy recovery to all the victims,\" the Kremlin said.How Columbine changed the way police respond to mass shootingsTanya and Vyacheslav, a couple from Norilsk in central Russia who were visiting Moscow with their children, told CNN they were shocked and saddened by reports on the Florida shooting.\"It doesn't characterize the country but there are some teenagers who do this more often,\" said Tanya. \"We have also had some instances in our country but in America it happens more often. I don't know why. Maybe the children sit and play more computer games.\"She said Putin would strengthen security in schools if a similar situation arose in Russia.Vyacheslav urged increased gun control measures for the United States. \"They need to ban guns. Give out licenses under observation. There need to be checks and in a school a search of people. The most important thing is control,\" he said.He said Russia had already taken steps to safeguard students. \"These measures have already been taken in all schools, there is search and control, we don't have the free sale of weapons in shops -- it's all under license. There are medical and psychological checks.\"CNN's Emma Burrows, Laura Smith-Spark and Mary Ilyushina contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Munich (CNN)UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that a culture change is required to enable women across the world to work without fear of sexual harassment.In an exclusive interview with CNN, Guterres said that the allegations that have engulfed the British charity Oxfam served as a reminder of the \"serious problem that is everywhere.\"Guterres, whose own organization has faced criticism over abuse by peacekeeping forces, said \"everything possible\" must be done to change the culture that has allowed \"No form of sexual harassment... is acceptable,\" he told CNN.Oxfam's reputation has taken a battering after it was accused of attempting to cover up the behavior of some of its senior staff members deployed to Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake.Read More\"I think we need to be fully aware that this is a serious problem that is everywhere, in public administrations, in the private sector, in international organizations like the UN... in the civil society and in nongovernmental organizations,\" Guterres said.\"There is a central question. We still live in a male-dominated culture, in a male-dominated world, and so these things happen and people are afraid to come out, to speak up, to denounce. So, we need to do everything possible to change this culture.\"Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, spoke out over allegations of sexual harassment.The UN has faced its own abuse scandals. In 2016, there were 80 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by uniformed United Nations personnel and 65 allegations against civilian workers who support the peacekeeping missions, according to a report by Guterres published last year.Read: UN peacekeepers accused of raping civiliansAs a result of the report, Guterres unveiled recommendations from a task force attempting to eradicate sexual abuse by peacekeepers in the field.\"We have already appointed eight global victim advocates in the areas more dramatically impacted to make sure that there is support to the victims, for the victims to be able to come and denounce what has happened. Not to be afraid,\" Guterres told CNN Friday.In Oxfam's case, the aid workers -- including the Oxfam country director at the time, Roland van Hauwermeiren -- were accused of using prostitutes in a villa rented by the organization.Addressing the allegations, Van Hauwermeiren acknowledged his behavior was unacceptable.  \"I should have known better, I'm a man of flesh and blood,\" van Hauwermeiren told Belgian TV Thursday.\"Nobody is perfect, but I'm no pig. I don't feel good about the people who are told by perhaps less professional journalists that Oxfam is used to hold sex orgies with the money from good citizens, but that is absolutely... it is absolutely not correct.\" 'Urgent review'On Friday, Oxfam announced that an independent commission would carry out an \"urgent\" review into the allegations alongside a \"comprehensive action plan to stamp out abuse.\"Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima has vowed to ensure justice for survivors of abuse.In a statement, the charity's international executive director, Winnie Byanyima, said Oxfam is \"absolutely committed to ensuring justice for survivors of abuse.\" \"What happened in Haiti and afterward is a stain on Oxfam that will shame us for years, and rightly so,\" she said. \"From the bottom of my heart I am asking for forgiveness.\"Oxfam said the commission would be headed by leading women's rights experts.

        "content": "Story highlightsComb gives clues to development of newer runic alphabet\"We are seeing the birth of something major in Scandinavian history,\" says archaeologist (CNN)A 1,200-year-old comb, discovered in Denmark, is shedding light on the mysterious birth and development of the Viking alphabet. When a team of Danish archaeologists first discovered the fragments of a comb in December, they thought nothing of it. Combs are some of the most common archaeological remains from the Viking Age. They scooped it up in a pile of soil and sent it to the conservation lab, as is procedure. It was only when the conservationist called saying that there was something unusual about it, that they rushed back to the lab to inspect. The comb had several lines etched into it, spelling out a word in runes, the ancient Viking alphabet. The comb's runic inscriptionOn one side of the comb was written the word \"comb,\" and on the other side the verb \"to comb.\" It might not seem like a big deal, but archaeologists say the find is of great significance, giving clues to the spread of literacy during the Viking Age, and the link between writing and urbanization. Read: Mass grave may belong to Viking Great ArmyRead MoreAs one of the earliest examples of Viking runes, the comb provides evidence of the birth of the new runic alphabet that came into use around 800 AD. Previously, the Vikings used a more complicated alphabet known as the 24-character futhark. This was reformed in the 8th Century to include just 16 runes. The simplified script spread rapidly across the Viking world, and continued to be used for hundreds of years, long after the Viking heyday. \"We are seeing the birth of something major in Scandinavian history,\" says archaeologist and excavation leader S\u00f8ren Sindb\u00e6k, from Aarhus University, Denmark. \"It's a very rare discovery... We were a bit embarrassed that we hadn't even thought about cleaning it a little.\"Why did the Vikings write?The comb, discovered during excavations of Ribe -- an 8th Century settlement that can lay claim to the title of Denmark's oldest town -- dates to around 800 AD. It was found alongside a small plate made from bone or antler, with another short runic inscription. Archaeologists are still unsure of the meaning of the second inscription as it is incomplete, but suspect it could spell the Viking name, \"Tobi.\"A fragment of a plate with a yet undeciphered inscriptionWhat matters most for Sindb\u00e6k is that these artifacts show a variety in the usage of runes. There are only four examples of early runic inscriptions from Ribe -- including the two recent discoveries -- and all suggest a different purpose. \"While the comb shows some scribbling,\" says Sindb\u00e6k, \"the other inscription has very formal runes, that were clearly part of the decoration of the object.\"Early Britons had dark skin, 'Cheddar Man' research indicatesSindb\u00e6k suggests that the labelled comb could have been used for teaching, sharing, or experimenting with the skill of writing. Gareth Williams, a Viking specialist from the British Museum, agrees that this is possible. \"A lot of runic inscriptions on objects look like practice pieces,\" he says. \"It may just be that someone was practising and chose to use words inspired by the object itself.\"A sign of sophisticationThe finds demonstrate the spread of literacy. \"As more finds like this are discovered,\" says Williams, \"it becomes more likely that a significant proportion of the population in the Viking Age could read and write.\"\"In terms of popular perceptions of the Vikings today, that is quite surprising,\" he adds, \"but perhaps no more than the fact that Viking combs are extremely common, indicating that the Vikings liked to keep their hair neat and tidy.\"Archaeologists inspect the geological layers at the Ribe excavation siteThe location of the runes is also significant. Lisbeth Imer, rune expert from the National Museum of Denmark, who was invited to study the artifacts, says that though they may not display long messages, \"the fact that two messages have been found in close proximity to each other (and just a few meters away from an 8th century inscription discovered back in the 1970s) tells us that runes were very much used.\"The heart of the Viking EmpireIt may also confirm that the script was tied to Viking towns, says Sindb\u00e6k. This is an exciting prospect, he says, as it \"re-outlines an old pattern that we know as far back as Mesopotamia, that early writing and early cities seem to go together. It's the fact that becoming an urban community creates a need for sending and recording messages with an alphabet.\"Hidden tunnel could lead to Mayan 'entrance to the underworld'Ribe was the center of power in the Viking Age. \"Ribe kickstarted the sailing and trading business that made the Viking Age the Viking Age,\" says Sindb\u00e6k.Judith Jesch, a rune expert from Nottingham university, encourages caution with this theory. Runic writing exists outside of towns as well, and she warns that there could be bias in the evidence, as archaeologists excavate towns far more often than rural areas. However, Jesch acknowledges there is a pattern, particularly from the 9th-12th Century, of finding runic inscriptions in towns. Plus, \"Ribe is a place where we would expect to find new ideas, new impulses, new changes happening there before anywhere else,\" she says.",

performance as you ageAccording to data company Gracenote, the oldest athlete at PyeongChang 2018 is Canada's 51-year-old curler Cheryl Bernard, who is tipped to win a medal, while Germany's Claudia Pechstein will be 45 when she competes in the 5,000-meter speed skating. Meet Team USA's youngest and oldest Winter OlympiansBernard isn't the oldest competitor in Olympic history. That record belongs to Sweden's Oscar Swahn, who won three gold medals in Winter Olympic shooting events at the 1908 and 1912 Games. He was 64 when he won gold in 1912 and eight years later also competed in the 1920 Winter Olympics.According to sports scientist Craig Duncan, who works with the Australian national soccer team, the key to athletes compensating for the physiological consequences of aging is to focus on mental agility. \n\n\n\"Many athletes overcome physiological limitations in speed with increased 'speed of thought' and based on experience it will enhance a player's position particularly in team sports,\" Duncan, who has worked closely with the 38-year-old Australian soccer international Tim Cahill, told CNN Sport.Noting that sports like gymnastics, where enhanced flexibility are key, can be more suited to a younger person, Duncan says older athletes can adapt their body and maintain performance with the right training and diet.\"With sound training regimes and the variations in genetics incredible performances can still be completed,\" added Duncan.Young, agile and pressuredWhile younger athletes have the mechanical advantage of carrying less weight and benefit from increased flexibility, they may feel an increased amount of psychological pressure compared to their older peers. Four years ago only age restrictions stopped the young snowboarder Kim participating at the Games. And with the benefit of hindsight, she acknowledges the ruling was in place for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n\"I think I was a little bummed out then, but now that I look back at it, I think I'm kind of glad that I wasn't old enough to go last time,\" Kim reflects. \"It's too much stress for a 13-year-old, so I'm actually really happy that I wasn't able to go.\"But, equally, I was so lucky to still be able to go through the whole qualification process when I was 13. That experience really helped me this year, knowing ahead of time what it was going to be like, what the pressure was going to be like. I think that was very comforting for me.\"Figure skater Vincent Zhou, 17 has been winning international titles since the age of 10, but before it was announced he'd be representing Team USA, he publicly shared his feelings of self doubt to his Instagram followers.The oldest and youngest Olympic athletes\"My performance was dismal. It was not a representation of how I train or who I am. Smiling and waving while my heart is breaking is one of the hardest things I've ever done,\" Zhou said in an Instagram post.\"I can remember, fighting, being set back, conquering obstacles, and experiencing the ups and downs of striving to better myself every single day. I am capable of so much more. I am a fighter.\"",

        "content": "(CNN)London activists are borrowing from an Oscar-nominated movie to encourage authorities to take action in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 71 people last June and left hundreds of residents homeless. The blaze engulfed a residential tower block in North Kensington, west London. Police opened a criminal investigation amid concerns that flammable cladding used in a refurbishment of the tower may have contributed to the fire. But no arrests have been made.On Thursday, three massive posters emblazoned with the words \"71 DEAD,\" \"AND STILL NO ARRESTS?\" and \"HOW COME?\" were mounted on vans and driven around the streets of the British capital. The striking protest echoes a scene from the recent film, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\" in which a grieving mother portrayed by Frances McDormand puts similar messages on three billboards to shame local authorities for their inaction following the rape and murder of her daughter. The film is up for seven Oscars at the Academy Awards next month.The posters in London used similar language and the same color as the billboards in the movie. The vans traveled through the city before parking at the scene of the disaster in west London, where members of the community and survivors gathered. 3 Billboards Outside Grenfell, LondonListen to all our voices now; we demand #Justice4GrenfellPlease Retweet pic.twitter.com/nHWkrGDWNz\u2014 Justice 4 Grenfell (@officialJ4G) February 15, 2018\n\nRead MoreThe community group that organized the protest, Justice4Grenfell, also posted a statement on their website calling out officials for not doing more since the fire. \"8 months on from the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower, the issue is being ignored. 71 people died in the Grenfell Tower. And still no arrests. And still 297 flammable towers. And still hundreds of survivors are homeless. And still they are not represented on the inquiry. And still there is not justice,\" the statement read.\"These 3 billboards are here to keep this tragedy in the national conscience, to make our voices heard. And our voices call for change to a system that kills. And our voices demand justice for Grenfell,\" it continued. A government-ordered inquiry into the fire is ongoing and many of those who lost their homes remain in temporary accommodation.London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, has said the criminal investigation into the fire won't likely be concluded until 2019.According to a UK government report, of the 395 households affected by the fire, 300 were living in hotels, 75 were in apartments, nine were living with friends and family on a temporary basis, and 11 had found new permanent accommodations by the end of September.CNN's James Masters contributed to this report.",

        "content": "(CNN)Millions of people have watched the Rocky films, \"The Eye of the Tiger\" montages of Sylvester Stallone putting himself through weeks of brutal training.Hour upon hour of drinking raw eggs, early morning runs, sparring, hitting the heavy bag, one-armed press-ups, even chopping logs and hitting tractor tires with a sledgehammer.But that's Hollywood -- what's the life of professional fighter really like?Follow @cnnsport\n\nBoxer Chris Eubank Jr. is the IBO super middleweight world champion and he takes his training very seriously, especially with the biggest fight of his life just around the corner. On February 17, he will take on George Groves, another British world champion, who holds the WBA (Super) super-middleweight title. Read MoreNot only are there two belts on the line, there's also a place in the final of the World Boxing Super Series up for grabs as well.Longest training camp yetThe 28-year-old Eubank Jr., who is the son of former two-weight world champion Chris Eubank, is leaving nothing to chance and is putting himself through an 11-week training camp -- that's five weeks longer than he's ever done before.His training base is a no-frills boxing club right on the waterfront in the popular British seaside town of Brighton, just a few miles from where he was born.Although his father, and his long-time trainer Ronnie Davies, are a constant presence, they claim that Eubank Jr. largely trains himself and that they are just there to \"harness\" his skill and \"guide\" him. On a bitterly cold December day -- no sunshine or ice creams in sight and with rough seas smashing into the shoreline -- Eubank Jr. kindly allowed CNN's virtual reality cameras to film him hard at work. He talked us through his training regime and explained in detail what each specific exercise gives him when it's time to fight for real.In short, he gave us a fascinating insight into what it takes to become a modern-day warrior.Taping the handsProtecting his tools, September 2017.Before doing any exercise, Eubank Jr. sits down on a stool next to the ring and tapes up his hands. Usually a trainer would do this for a fighter but he insists on doing this himself, even on the night of his fights. It's a process that takes more than 10 minutes. He clearly takes this very seriously and wants to get it just the way he likes it.\"It protects your tools,\" said Eubank Jr., referring to his hands. \"Without taping, you are prone to injury and injuries can cause you problems in fights.\"It can cause you to not be able to train and your training is your work, and your work is your money so you have to protect your money, which is your hands.\"Shadow boxingFighting the man in the mirror, November 2014.It's still not time to put the gloves on for Eubank Jr., who has won all but one of his 27 professional fights -- he was beaten by fellow Brit Billie Joe Saunders on a split decision in 2014. He now heads over to the large wall mirror and begins to throw air shots and move around, as if facing an imaginary opponent. This is known as shadow boxing. Keeping a close eye on his reflection, he runs through his whole repertoire of punches -- left hooks, right hooks, uppercuts and more.     \"You're throwing the punches, you're warming up the muscles,\" explains Eubank Jr., who starts off slowly before building up to full speed.\"You're mentally preparing yourself to engage in combat, you're going to go into the ring and throw punches at another man so it's good to get into that rhythm.\"And it is a rhythm. Some guys don't really have a technique to it, they're just throwing punches. For me, I've found that if I get into a rhythm, it's actually quite fun.\"I do it to music so sometimes I'll try and shadow box to the beat of whatever song I'm listening to. It relaxes you and it gets your body prepared for what's to come in the gym session.\" His soundtrack of choice? Grime and hip hop.Exhaling when you punch\"You throw a punch, you breathe out.\" Training, November 2014.What immediately catches your attention is the sound that Eubank Jr. makes every time he throws a shot, something akin to a large wild cat attacking its prey.It's animalistic and it's intimidating but it also serves a far more basic need for the fighter in the ring.\"You have to breathe,\" said Eubank Jr., who is known for his supreme fitness and ability to sustain brutal onslaughts during his fights. \"If you're throwing punches or exerting energy but you're not breathing, you're holding your breath. That actually saps your strength, it saps your stamina. \"You throw a punch, you breathe out. It's kind of like you're reminding your body to breathe. You're taking the air out and you have to bring it back in. \"Without that, you tire way quicker because you're not getting the oxygen into your lungs. So by breathing out, it forces you to have to then breathe back in. It's a rhythm thing as well -- you're making the noises to the punches. \"Also, when you get hit in the stomach and you're holding too much breath, it can be much more painful. So if you get caught when there's less air in your stomach, it's actually a lot easier to handle than if you get hit with a full stomach of air.\"SparringSparring, with trainer Ronnie Davies looking on, November 2014.Now to what Eubank Jr. considers the single most important part of his training regime: sparring. That's where two fighters in the ring, usually wearing head guards, throw real punches at each other in back-to-back, three-minute rounds.When CNN went to visit, Eubank Jr. actually sparred against his younger brother, Sebastian, a heavier fighter who himself is looking to turn professional.Sparring can't fully simulate the intensity of \"fight night\" but it's the closest thing to it in training and the brothers certainly didn't hold back, with at least one bloody nose on show after four rounds.In October last year, Eubank Jr. questioned the decision taken by Northern Irish boxer Carl Frampton to reduce his number of sparring sessions and lower the risk of brain damage later in life.Boxing 101 - Hit & Don't Get Hit pic.twitter.com/kyryWdkmGE\u2014 Chris Eubank Jr (@ChrisEubankJr) December 18, 2017\n\nHe told CNN that he would never cut his sparring because it's something you need to go through \"to become a champion and better yourself as a warrior.\"And it's safe to say that his view has not changed since then. \"To be able to perform at a high level, to be able to do things that no other fighter can do, you have to practice it,\" said Eubank Jr.\"And the only way you can practice is by sparring, by fighting another man. You can hit the bags, the pads, and you can run and do your fitness and your weights as much as you want, but if you don't spar you just don't have that true experience, that true knowledge of how to beat a man in one-on-one combat. \"You need to go through the pain, you need to get hit, you need to truly know what it's like to get hurt and then to force yourself to recover. Nothing can do that for you except for sparring. \"I would say that you could cut out everything else in your training regime. If you just sparred, you would still be able to make it and be successful in boxing. You can't say that for any other training technique, so it's very important for physical preparation and just as important for the mental preparation.\"If you have an opponent you are getting ready to fight, you bring in guys with a similar style to him and then you're able to practice all the things that you're going to use in your game plan to beat your opponent. \"There's a very big difference between being fit and being fight fit. Sparring is the only way to get fight fit. It's a very important part of boxing and something that I do as regularly as possible.\" Hitting the pads and the heavy bag \"It's still a very crucial part of the training.\" Hitting the bag, October 2015.The panther-esque noises aren't over yet because Eubank JR. is now hitting the heavy bag and the pads with as much force as he can muster.\"Bag work, pad work, everything outside of sparring is for fitness, to get your body in peak physical condition to go into the ring and fight,\" said Eubank Jr., who knocked out Turkish boxer Avni Yildrim to set up the Super Series semifinal against Groves. \"You have to push yourself on those apparatus to get your body in the condition it needs to be in to perform when the lights go on. \"It's still a very crucial part of the training and a lot of mistakes that boxers make are because they don't push themselves to the limit on the bags, on the pads. They kind of just go through the motions because they're in the gym five days a week and it gets boring. Training in Brighton in September 2017, with Eubank Sr looking on.\"They kind of get into a rhythm of just saying, 'I'm just going to hit the bag five, six, seven rounds and that's my workout, I'm done for the day.' They go back home and they think 'I've been in the gym and I've done it, I've done the work.' But they actually haven't. \"The only way you can really train significantly to increase your power, strength, speed and stamina is to push yourself to the limit, even when you're on the bag.\"To be hitting that bag like you're hitting somebody who's trying to hit you back. That's what I do every day and that's why I guess I have the fitness and the success that I have in the sport.\"Skipping Jumping rope, September 2017.Some of the biggest names in boxing are some of the best skippers too -- Muhammad Ali, Floyd Mayweather Jr. to name only two -- and Eubank Jr. is also pretty handy when it comes to jumping rope.\"It's another fitness technique. It's hand-eye coordination,\" said Eubank Jr., who won the IBO super-middlweight belt in February 2017, when he stopped Australian Renold Quinlan in the 10th round.\"A lot of boxers are actually quite oafish so I guess the skipping gets their foot movement a bit prettier, a bit more nimble or a bit more fleet footed.\"And for the guys who are good on their feet already, it's a fitness technique. If you do it right -- the double jumping, the triple jumping, the crisscrossing -- it's all an exercise. \"I wouldn't say it's crucial to a boxer but I would say it's synonymous with boxing now because it's an old-school technique that boxers have been doing for hundreds of years that's just kind of stuck. It's fun. It's window dressing but it's fun.\" Sit ups and 'medicine ball slam'\"You are forcing your body to learn how to take heavy impact.\" Feeling the medicine ball, September 2017.It's already been an intense session but perhaps nothing is as hard to watch as Eubank Jr. working on his core with trainer Ronnie Davies.The 71-year-old Davies, who worked with Eubank Jr.'s father at the peak of his career in the 1990s, holds down the 28-year-old boxer's feet while he works through several sets of sit ups and then, with Eubank Jr. lying on his side, proceeds to slam a heavy medicine ball into his torso.\"Having a man stand over you and slam a heavy plastic ball into your stomach is mental and physical preparation,\" said Eubank Jr. who has never been stopped in a professional fight.\"You are forcing your body to learn how to take heavy impact, which is what you will experience in the ring. You will have a man who is punching you as hard as he can in your stomach to try and wind you, paralyze you, stop you from continuing the fight.\"You've got to push through that pain barrier. If you can't push through it here, you won't be able to do it in the fight. You learn how to mask that pain.\"It was painful but you didn't see it on my face -- that's a big part of boxing. It's showing no emotion when you're in that ring. You're going to get hit with shots that really hurt but you cannot let that man know that he's hurt you. \"I've had incidents in sparring where I've been hit with a body shot and I was paralyzed, I couldn't move, it took every breath out of me, I couldn't even move my feet. So he's hit me with the shot and he's looking at me, he's looking at me to see 'Did I hurt you'? Did I get you?' And I'm looking at him and I just smiled.\"And that smile made him back away, thank God, because if he had come forward, I'd have been finished. So a big part of boxing is that poker face: no emotion, you can't give anything away. That's a technique I use.\"RunningPebbles on Brighton Beach, where Eubank Jr. runsEubank Jr. had already been on a run before CNN caught up with him -- something he does daily to maintain his staying power in the ring.\"I do sprints on the tracks, I run along Brighton beach on the stones,\" he said.\"Seven miles, and that's really like 14 miles because every time you're running on the stones, the pebbles, you're sinking in. You have to push your feet back up, so going along that many miles on the stones is very tough and it builds the legs, it builds the stamina and that's a big part of boxing. \"A lot of people miss that. A lot of people focus on, 'Oh, he can knock everybody out, he's so quick.' Yes, speed and power are important but stamina, being able to continue and execute your game plan without getting tired, that's a huge part of boxing. \"And training like that helps you to achieve the fitness that you need to continue your attacks, your onslaughts, your defense, for 12 rounds.\"Living like a championThe world champion shows off his belt, September 2017.During his school days, Eubank Jr. excelled at rugby, swimming and athletics, before moving to the US to concentrate on his boxing. He admits he'd fallen in with the wrong crowd back in Britain but his time in Las Vegas helped him focus on his craft and -- although his father was initially against him following in his footsteps -- Eubank Jr. went on to win the Nevada State Golden Gloves and the Western Regional Golden Gloves, before turning professional in 2011. \"It's not about what you're doing in the months leading up to the fight,\" said Eubank Jr. \"It's what you've done since you were a kid, how you've trained your entire life as an amateur and a professional. \"You're not going to beat somebody because you trained really hard for a couple of weeks or a couple of months -- it's a lifestyle.\"You have to have been living boxing, living true to yourself in terms of the man you are, the food you eat, the people you hang out with, the mindset you have. All that prepares you to become a great fighter.\"Being in the gym every day, being on the roads every day for years and years and years, grafting -- that is the only way you become a true champion.\"'Baddest man on the planet'Chris Eubank Jr. in the ring with his dad, after his victory over Avni Yildirim in October 2017.The 51-year-old Chris Eubank Sr. was a showman in his heyday, and an eccentric, often pictured with a gentleman's monocle, cane or behind the wheel of his huge road truck. Although not as eccentric as his father, when it comes to Eubank Jr.'s eye-catching behavior in the ring, the apple has not fallen far from the tree.  He's perfected the Eubank stare, he stalks his opponents around the ring and, once he's finished them off, towers over them and peers out into the crowd -- ever the showman.Eubank knocks down Avni Yildirim, October 2017.\"I'm always confident -- you have to be,\" he said. \"You have to believe that you're the baddest man on the planet. You can't go in there with any doubt in your mind.\"He punches hard, he knocked the last guy he fought out, maybe he's going to hurt me ... you can't have any of that in your mind.\"You've just got to go in there and believe that you are going to win. It doesn't matter what he does, what he said, who he thinks he is, you're going to do what you've got to do to win. \"The big fightGeorge Groves and Eubank Jr. square off at a press conference, November 2017.Tickets for the Groves fight sold out in minutes, which means 21,000 fans will pack into the Manchester Arena on February 17 for what, on paper, promises to be the toughest test of Eubank Jr.'s career. Groves became a world champion in May 2017 and also has the experience of taking on the mighty Carl Froch -- the former WBC, WBA and IBF world champion -- in two huge blockbuster fights. They both ended in defeat for Groves but the rematch was in front of 80,000 people at London's Wembley Stadium so he knows what it's like to fight on the big stage.  \"George Groves is a solid opponent, a solid world champion, but he's not me,\" Eubanks Jr. told CNN. \"He can't deal with the fire that I'm going to bring to that ring on the night. I've sparred with him many times over the years, I know what he's capable of. I know his weaknesses, I know what he's strong at and you guys are going to see a new, an improved Chris Eubank Jr. \"This is going to be the longest training camp I've ever had for a fight -- 10 to 11 weeks, and most of the time I only ever train five, six weeks for a fight. Yeah, an 11-week training camp: you guys are in for a hell of a fight.\"",

And though it is unfortunate that after 20 years I am no longer able to advocate and defend through this specific framework, social and economic injustice is more globally prevalent than ever,\" she said in a statement Tuesday.\"I certainly will not let the abhorrent mistakes of a troubling organization stop me or anyone else from working with good people in this space to support a population of human beings around the world that needs our help.\"Oxfam whistleblower says charity and regulator failed to actFormer deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned Monday as the scandal continued to grow.Read MoreOxfam's leaders are accused of trying to cover up the behavior of some of its senior staff members deployed to Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Aid workers, including the Oxfam country director at the time, Roland van Hauwermeiren, were accused of turning a villa rented by the organization into a makeshift brothel, with prostitutes wearing only Oxfam T-shirts.Oxfam has apologized for the behavior of aid workers, but denies a coverup. Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said the charity is not where it needs to be. But she said it's \"much better\" than it was in 2011 and it will continue to rebuild.\"I know that Oxfam will recover because there are a few people who have abused the power that they had ... and abused the very people they were meant to protect. But the majority, the thousands of Oxfam staff around the world are saving lives,\" Byanyima told CNN's Hala Gorani. \"They are risking their lives every hour and this is good work that we will continue to do.\"Oxfam's sex scandal won't surprise anyone who has worked in a war zoneByanyima said abuse of power was a problem throughout humanitarian aid work and urged international groups to start sharing information. She said change would only come from a \"systemwide\" response, and pledged that Oxfam would \"lead our sector\" in instituting stronger accountability measures.\"I am deeply hurt at what happened to those women in Haiti and I feel for them, I want justice for them and we have sent our regional director to Haiti to explore and see what we need to do for justice to be done.\" In a statement Tuesday, Oxfam thanked Driver for her service and reiterated its commitment to accountability.\"Minnie Driver has been a devoted Oxfam supporter for many years, and we are grateful for her commitment to ending global poverty. Her decision to step down as an Oxfam ambassador saddens us deeply, but we also understand and respect her choice. \"As an organization, we are ashamed by the actions of some of our staff and are more committed now than ever to learn from our mistakes and ensure we uphold the highest levels of safeguarding standards in our work around the world.\"",

There was no gold medal to be won at the Gangneung Ice Arena on Wednesday, yet North Korean figure skaters Ryom Tae Ok, 19, and Kim Ju Sik 25, received the sort of attention usually bestowed on champions as they took to the ice for the pairs skating short program, reaching Thursday's final with aplomb.\n\n\n\n\nRyom and Kim are the only two of 22 North Korean athletes to have qualified for these Winter Olympics by merit, with their compatriots receiving special invitations following inter-governmental talks between the North and the South. While they are not expected to be on the podium, neither are they hopeless also-rans.Achieving a season's best 69.40 to qualify for the Thursday's final in 11th place, the North Koreans -- bronze medalists at last month's Four Continents Championships -- finished ahead of USA and Canada.

repressive states, the duo express themselves openly through their program. They smile, they are emotive, they perform to The Beatles' \"A Day in the Life.\"Naturally, there is intrigue. During Tuesday's practice session fans filled the lower section of the arena to watch the pair rehearse their spins and lifts and, for some South Koreans watching on Wednesday, it was an emotional day. \n\n\nSteve Ok, 30, from Seoul, told CNN Sport that he was \"touched\" by the performance. \"We never have a chance to see North Koreans so it's surprising and interesting to see them,\" he said. Jaepill Choi, 21, also from Seoul, was watching athletes from the North perform for the first time. \"Even though we're parted, we're family in history and, in our mind, we always try to congratulate the North Korean players and we want them to succeed at this Olympics,\" he told CNN Sport. \"We don't have any offense to North Korean civilians, we just have offense to the North Korean government and we try to cheer the North Korean athletes.\"Security was heightened for the event, with police surrounding the arena, while outside the perimeters four young men and women held flags of a unified Korean peninsula and a banner which, in Korean, read \"jump towards unification.\"North Korea's Ryom Tae Ok (L) and North Korea's Kim Ju Sik competed in the pair skating short program event.READ: Unified Korean ice hockey team proves that 'winning isn't everything'Red snowsuits and bobble hatsRyon and Kim, wearing black outfits with silver sequins, were welcomed to the ice by the North Korean cheerleading squad -- 229 are here to accompany the athletes -- enthusiastically waving PRK flags. There was no such fervor at this point from the rest of the audience in an arena peppered with empty seats. But that was soon to change. Dressed in matching red snowsuits and bobble hats, the all-female troupe, as transfixing as any Olympic performance at these Games, led the rallying cries for Ryom and Kim. Others soon followed.The decibels rose with each successful landing of an acrobatic jump. As the second verse of the well-known Beatles tune began, a song and a band that few North Koreans will have heard, the cheerleaders rhythmically applauded each twist and turn. By the routine's conclusion, almost everyone in the arena was clapping in unison. \n\n\n\n\nBefore the score had been announced, there was a standing ovation from the cheerleading squad, who were flanked by minders throughout, while flowers and cuddly mascots were thrown onto the rink as a thrilled Ryom -- nicknamed the \"Angel of Smiles\" in the South Korean press -- and Kim curtsied and bowed.When the leaderboard flashed on the big screen, showing the North Koreans, who have been training in Montreal for a year, initially in second place, there was even more reason to cheer. \"The cheering from the South Koreans and North Koreans together for us was very helpful,\" Kim told reporters. \"We could really feel the power and the energy of the Korean people.\"The crowd cheered as the pair ended each portion of their routine.Though the pair, 15th at last year's World Figure Skating Championships, did answer questions after their performance, they walked by members of the international press without stopping. There is no requirement for any athlete to speak to journalists as they pass through what is called the 'mixed zone\" and, having already answered questions, they may have been oblivious to the desire of the crowd wanting to interrogate them further. \"Though I'm Korean, it's my first time covering a North Korean sports team so it's fun,\" said Soyoung Park, a reporter for the Seoul-based newspaper The Joongang Daily, waiting among the media throng. \"It's the same as covering anyone else, but I have some trouble because they are not talking about anything.\"A Japanese journalist, Takafumi Yoshida of the Kyodo News, said the North Korean pair were the source of great interest in his country because of the current political situation.

On Tuesday, North Korean leader Kim Jung Un said it was important to further the \"warm climate of reconciliation and dialogue\" and praised South Korea for its \"very impressive\" and \"sincere\" efforts in hosting the North's high-level delegation during the opening few days of the Games. It has also been revealed that South Korea's government bankrolled the visiting North Koreans. With South Korean pair Kim Kyueun and Kam Alex Kang Chan failing to qualify for Thursday's long program after an error-strewn routine, a North Korean pair who have captivated and intrigued will give the North and South reason to unite once more for sporting reasons.",

        "content": "(CNN)As far as presidents go, Donald Trump swings a golf club pretty well, for a big man in his 70s. If not exactly dynamite off the tee, he is at least solid. And while his technique around the greens is quirky, he somehow makes it work.According to our esteemed experts, the US Commander-in-Chief matches up well against his predecessors, Barack Obama, George W Bush and John F. Kennedy. Follow @cnnsport\n\nCritics might say he ought to, given how much he plays -- the trumpgolfcount.com website projects that Trump will make 342 visits to golf clubs during this four-year presidency.Proponents might say it proves that practice makes perfect, or at least almost perfect.  \"Trump looks like he's played a lot of rounds, because he seems to know what he's doing,\" says Clive Tucker, coach at Mannings Heath Golf Club in West Sussex, who oversaw David Howell's rise through the world rankings and has also worked with former US Open champion Graeme McDowell, Open champion Darren Clarke and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood.  JUST WATCHEDWill Donald Trump's Turnberry be a success?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWill Donald Trump's Turnberry be a success? 03:54Read MoreREAD: What's it like to play golf with Trump?\"He's got a bit of a flat back-swing, but that might be deliberate. History is littered with players who had slightly 'off' back-swings, but they managed to re-route it and get the club in a good place coming down.\"That's what Trump manages to do, so while he might hit the odd ball left, he'll usually hit it well.\"Gary Smith, who has worked with former Masters champion Danny Willett and former US Open and reigning Olympic champion Justin Rose, agrees that Trump has a sound, solid action on the way down, and manages to make light of an unconventional takeaway and an abrupt end to his follow-through.\"His aim is good, he's got great alignment and looks reasonably flexible,\" says Smith. \"It also looks like his arms are hanging great, so one would assume his grip is fine. For someone of his age and size, it's a mighty good action.President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \nplayed a round together last year.READ: Australian tournament bridges the pay gap\"He does little wrong, although he does start his back-swing with his hips, which is not ideal -- you should start with the shoulders, and the hips will follow. Normally if you start with your hips, you lose height and posture, and the whole swing falls apart. \"His doesn't, he keeps good balance and head height. He's got a repetitive swing, because it's short and snappy. Although that means he loses a bit of distance, it also means he's more consistent. Smith observes that another facet of Trump's swing that the US president could try and improve on is his finish.\"There's one theme running through all the presidents' swings, which is that none of them complete the finish.\"Probably, once the ball's been hit, they just want to move on to the next shot. They don't want to waste time with a showy finish when the ball has already gone, they're very busy men.\"JUST WATCHEDPaul Casey: Golf's comeback kidReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPaul Casey: Golf's comeback kid 01:03Tucker and Smith analyzed Trump's opening shot at the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 2012, when he sauntered onto the tee and made a couple of cursory practice swings before drilling a drive down the middle, to the delight of the gallery. Even for a man who claims a handicap of 2.8, that takes cojones. And it is probably fair to say that Trump's golf game benefits from the kind of self-confidence which is sorely lacking in your average golfer, whose knees start knocking at the sight of a man and his dog looking on from a distance.Who can forget George W Bush, pulling up in a golf cart and launching into a diatribe against \"terrorist killers\" before proclaiming to the assembled press, \"Now watch this drive\"? Sure enough, it went straight down the middle.\"It looked like Trump enjoyed being watched, he wasn't bothered by it,\" says Tucker of the former \"Apprentice\" star. \"He had a swagger about him, which is what all good players have. \"Bush is also quite clearly a competent and confident golfer. His swing is compact, rhythmical and very stable. In fact, I'd say he was the best (although, it should be noted, most of Bush's footage was from when he was in his 50s).\" Photos: US 19-11 International teamUS president Donald Trump was on hand at the Liberty National Golf Club Sunday to present the Presidents Cup trophy to the US team.

His arms do most of the work, and that's where it goes wrong. For him to get better, he'd have to do something like Pilates. \"Flexibility adds range of movement, therefore length of swing, therefore club-head speed, therefore distance.\"\"Obama's swing is a bit agricultural at times and slightly schizophrenic,\" adds Tucker. \"His practice swings looked really good, and he looked decent with the driver, very stable and compact. But then I saw him hit some iron shots, and he was all over the place. \"At his best, he holds his height and shape and balance very well. At his worst, his head is moving up and down and he's collapsing, which is why he can't strike the ball consistently. \"Obama is either going to have a good day or a bad day, and not much in between.\"And what of JFK?Well, if it wasn't for osteoporosis of the lower back, which reportedly caused him such severe pain he had difficulty putting his shoes and socks on, he could have been the finest presidential golfer of them all.\"JFK competed for the Harvard golf team, so was obviously a good player,\" says Tucker. \"His movement and overall rhythm was very nice. He was long, smooth and very athletic. But if one bit of your body can't do something, another bit will have to take the strain. \"Your lower back takes three, four, five times your body weight during a golf swing, so his knees were having to move around to help support his mid-section. \"That's why he has that rubbery look, but it also shows how much natural coordination the guy must have had.\"JUST WATCHEDRyder Cup: Europe's journey back to victoryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRyder Cup: Europe's journey back to victory 22:26All in all, none of the presidents were, or are, likely to embarrass themselves on the course.

Dick Durbin inserted the hot-button political issue of immigration into the Winter Games when telling the story of Chloe Kim, the teen phenom who won a gold medal in the women's halfpipe.Speaking from the Senate floor -- next to a picture of Kim with her arms outstretched in joy while holding an American flag -- and later at a news conference, Durbin, a Democrat, talked about Kim's father, Jong Jin Kim, who came to California from Korea in 1982. Jong Jin Kim didn't have a college degree, spoke little English and had nothing but a Korean-English dictionary and $300 in his pocket.Chloe Kim\"He decided to go to school. He picked up a degree in engineering technology,\" Durbin said Tuesday. \"He decided to start a family. A nice little family. And a little girl, who had a special skill when it came to snowboarding. That girl was Chloe Kim, and she won a gold medal last night at the Olympics.\"\n\n\nThen Durbin went there, saying if the US had the kind of hard-line immigrations policies on the books that President Trump and his GOP allies want, Kim's family wouldn't have been allowed to come here.Read More\"It's a story of an immigrant family.

They include an end to family migration beyond spouses and minor children and the abolishing of the visa lottery.'Change the narrative'The Kim's family inspirational story doesn't just belong to them, Durbin notes.\"It's America's story too,\" he said. \"There are members of the Senate on the other side who don't buy this story. They think it's time to change this narrative, about America and its diversity and its origins and its roots.\"The Senate is debating immigration this week, but it's not going well, and none of the current proposals seemed to have garnered enough support to pass.",

        "content": "(CNN)Snowboarder Shaun White called past sexual harassment allegations levied against him \"gossip\" during a news conference Wednesday after his historic gold medal win at the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. The 31-year-old snowboarder has previously admitted to sending lewd text messages to Lena Zawaideh, the former drummer of his band Bad Things, in 2016 and the parties later reached an undisclosed settlement.White was asked at the news conference Wednesday whether Zawaideh's accusations could tarnish his legacy, White said,\"You know honestly I'm here to talk about the Olympics not gossip ... but I don't think so.\"\"I am who I am and I'm proud of who I am and my friends, you know, love me and vouch for me and I think that stands on its own,\" he added.Shaun White celebrates during the Snowboard Men's Halfpipe Final at Phoenix Snow Park on February 14, 2018.When asked for clarity and if he thought the allegations were gossip, White said he felt he had addressed the question.Read MoreWhite also apologized for letting an American flag touch the ground after his gold-medal winning performance, which angered some viewers on social media. The snowboarder was given the flag after his dramatic comeback to win the gold on his final run.\"I remember being handed the flag. I was trying to put my gloves on and hold the flag and the board,\" he said. \"Honestly, if there was anything, I definitely didn't mean any disrespect.\"\"I'm very proud to be part of team USA and be an American,\" he said.Earlier in the day, cemented his legacy as America's greatest snowboarder Wednesday by winning his third gold medal for the halfpipe in dramatic fashion.Gold wasn't guaranteed for White after he fell on his second attempt. After a tense wait for his final run, the American needed to beat Japan's Ayumu Hirano's impressive score of 95.25 to win. White tallied a 97.75 to take gold at the final moment, an incredible comeback. The 31-year-old snowboarder has been one of America's most famous athletes for years, but Wednesday's win was likely his sweetest.\"I'm sure you can tell by my reactions at the bottom of the pipe but this meant the world to me and my family and my team,\" White said at the news conference.\"To be a gold medalist again is just unreal.\" With the victory, White became the only man to take top honors three times in the Games' halfpipe competition, and in the process won the US' 100th Winter Olympic gold.Harassment allegationsLena Zawaideh of Bad Things performs onstage during day 3 of the Firefly Music Festival in Delaware, June 21, 2014.Zawaideh -- the former drummer in White's band \"Bad Things\" -- sued White in May 2016 for breach of contract and backpay, alleging that White failed to pay her for her work. She was the only woman in the band. An amended civil suit filed by Zawaideh's attorneys against White in August 2016 accuses the Olympian of sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior.According to court documents obtained by CNN, Zawaideh says White: Texted her pictures of naked men with erect penises and showed her sexually explicit videos, including one \"sexualizing human fecal matter.\" \"Stuck his hands down his pants, approached Zawaideh, and stuck his hands in her face trying to make her smell them.\"Demanded she \"wear sexually revealing clothes\" and cut her hair.After the suit was filed, White admitted to sending text messages with Zawaideh in a statement to the New York Daily News but accused her of using them to \"craft a bogus lawsuit.\"  White's statement did not specify what was in the texts.White's legal team filed a motion attempting to compel Zawaideh to submit to a mental health evaluation in February 2017, but the parties reached the settlement a couple of months later.Details of the allegations against White have been public for a number of months, but resurfaced again in media reports Tuesday and Wednesday as the snowboarder prepared for his Olympic run.So far White's reputation, athletic career and business dealings -- including sponsorships and clothing lines -- have not been affected. White designs clothes for Macy's and is sponsored by the snowboarding company Burton.He's arguable the most popular American boarder and skater since Tony Hawk. Since White turned pro at age 13, he has become one of the world's most decorated athletes, winning multiple gold medals at the Olympics and the X Games.",

        "content": "Pyeongchang, South Korea (CNN)One peninsula, two very different ways of life.Some of North Korea's delegation to the PyeongChang Olympics stepped into a very different world from the sheltered and tightly controlled version of reality they're accustomed to at home. It's not just new technology the North Koreans encountered on their three-day visit. It is the influx of everyone, from all corners of the globe. \"[The] atmosphere of freedom will be unfamiliar,\" says Seoul resident Yang Yong-soo, 62. \"They'll probably think it's a different dimension.\"CNN's Will Ripley has reported from North Korea 17 times and has seen just how different the realities are between the two countries.Read MorePublic art installation in Gangneung, South Korea.Art: The art in South Korea -- even simple advertisements -- is a stark departure from North Koreans' state-controlled exposure to any sort of creativity or culture. Rooms across North Korea feature prominent photos of the country's late leaders, portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Nearly all monuments and public art displays across the country feature their likenesses or are dedicated to the ruling Workers' Party of Korea.Foreigners: The North Korean delegates probably encountered many more people from different cultures and ethnicities on this trip than they ever had before.North Korea prides itself on being racially pure and homogenous. Inside the communist country, their exposure to non-North Koreans is tightly controlled. The government also prohibits North Koreans from coloring their hair any shade but their natural dark black or brown. Unusual hair colors like blue probably surprised them. Korean BBQ. Such meats are unaffordable luxuries for most North Koreans.Food: A stark contrast also exists in the wide variety of food available across Pyeongchang.Beef, chicken and pork are all unaffordable luxuries for most North Koreans, who have experienced repeated famine and food insecurity. \"I think they'll feel that what they see with their own eyes are much different from what they learned,\" says Yoo Hyun, 30, of Geoje, South Korea.Aboard South Korea's high-speed KTX train.Transportation: Before arriving at the Olympics, the North Korean delegation boarded the KTX, a high-speed train that travels nearly 190 miles per hour. It's not just the speed that is new for them -- their rail and bus network relies on aging, outdated infrastructure and technology. Trains and buses are older and slower than their counterparts in the south.Freedom of movement: Even people's movements within North Korea are state-controlled. Citizens must get travel permits to leave their home provinces to visit Pyongyang.Phones and internet: Cell phones, even smartphones, are not a rare sight in North Korea's capital, but South Korea's free and open internet is.  North Koreans in Pyeongchang are barred from accessing the internet.  The nation's strict censors would probably have found a lot of the content \"yellow,\" a North Korean term for inappropriate and subversive. Content critical of their country, their system and most importantly their leader, Kim Jong Un, would have set off immediate alarm bells.Television: The delegates probably got their first opportunity to see television that wasn't controlled by the state during their visit -- if they were allowed to watch TV unsupervised, which is unlikely. Although North Korea is cut off from the internet, it does have state-controlled intranet and television channels, although the content is monitored and censored. Smuggled media content, on thumb drives and DVDs, are rare luxuries in the country.The brightly lit streets of Gangneung, South Korea.Street lights: Flashing lights and neon signs dot the streets of Pyeongchang, a big departure from the often darkened streets in North Korea. Cars: There are significantly more cars on the streets of South Korea than the members of the delegation would ever see in the north, including brand new domestic models. In North Korea, many of the cars are older imports.Electricity: The few escalators and elevators across Pyongyang are often stalled by power outages.  Even with the influx of visitors for the Olympics, power has remained constant in Pyeongchang.\"I think they would have been surprised by facilities themselves,\" says Incheon resident Yang Yu-jin, 22.  \"They have come out after being confined, so I think for them it'd feel very free and new. They'll think it's like experiencing a new world.\"",

Forced to watch on at home, Adeagbo hung up her spikes and drew a line in the sand. It was time to lead a normal life and leave that Olympic dream behind. Or so she thought.I've learned that in life, as in skeleton, you have to take the hits and keep pushingA full decade later, in the icy cold of PyeongChang, Adeagbo will once again run for 30m before launching herself into the air.This time she will do so onto a brakeless 62-pound stainless steel sled with all of Nigeria behind her.Transferable skills Everything changed in 2016 when Adeagbo, then a Nike employee living in Johannesburg, heard about the exploits of the Nigerian bobsled team.

What she didn't know was women's bobsled is a two-person sport, meaning they already had their team, plus an alternate. However, through her correspondence she learned the Nigerian Bobsled and Skeleton Federation were holding general tryouts in Texas.Adeagbo flew from Johannesburg to Houston full of hope and took to her new sport immediately. Without a hint of ice in sight, she underwent a series of tests, including 45m sprints and standing long jumps.\"You need to be strong, powerful and fast,\" Adeagbo explains.\"I already had those tools from over 10 years of track and field background, and I was able to transfer those skills into a new sport, skeleton. \"I think that's really fast-tracked my learning.

But with 12 more teams to compete, they're not guaranteed a place in the finals. North Korea's Ryom Tae Ok (L) and North Korea's Kim Ju Sik competed in the pair skating short program event.Few athletes were under more scrutiny at the 2018 Winter Games. Ryom, 18, and Kim, 25, were the only athletes to compete under their country's flag; North Korea's hockey players are competing as part of a unified Korean team.The duo were supported by a huge squad of North Korean cheerleaders, who have traveled to Pyeongchang for the Olympics. The squad, dressed in matching red jackets and white hats, also loudly cheered on South Korean skating duo of Kim Kyueun and Alex Kam. Read MoreBut the cross-Peninsula support didn't help the South Koreans, who scored a disappointing 42.93 after Kim took a hard fall onto the ice. The score obviously hit them hard, with Kim on the verge of tears speaking to reporters after the performance. The crowd cheered as the pair ended each portion of their routine.The North Korean pair originally qualified for the Winter Olympics in September, but North Korea's National Olympic Committee (NOC) missed the deadline to register them for the Games. After a sudden and dramatic rapprochement between the two Koreas, however, the International Olympic Committee agreed to extend the deadline for North Korean participation.\"The IOC's mission is always to ensure the participation of all qualified athletes, beyond all political tensions and divisions,\" the IOC said in a statement. After their performance, the North Korean skaters smiled broadly and ignored question from reporters as they walked past the international press.

Norwegian skip Thomas Ulsrud started the trend during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver because he decided the black pants the team wore were too boring. He is also on the 2018 team that has brought us to a new curling pants peak. Absolute legend. Thomas Ulsrud, fashion icon. However, it is teammate Christoffer Svae that apparently mans the pants these days. \"This is because of Valentine's Day,\" Ulsrud said after the team's 6-4 loss to Japan. \"So [Svae]  who plays second on the team, he is the master of the pants. So I guess I have a big bag of pants this week. He always tells me it depends on his mood before the game. Pretty much whatever he gives me, I play in.\"Read More\"The team enjoys it, having these colorful pants,\" the Norway curling team's spokesman Lars Otto Bj\u00f8rnland told CNN in 2014 during the Sochi Games. \"People find it very exciting to see the team in these trousers.\"Eat your heart out, Johnny Weir! Bj\u00f8rnland  is correct. Watching curling is very stressful. We know everyone involved is trying hard and doing a great job but we're not sure how or why anything is happening. These pants bring us peace. More! Give us more pants!",

Any sort of picture would do.

She even tweeted before her final run that she hadn't finished her breakfast and was \"hangry.\"She performed three spins on the left side, becoming the first female to land consecutive 1080s in the halfpipe at the Olympics. Members of Kim's family whooped and hollered. Overcome with emotion, Kim's sister could not speak. American flags were raised towards the azure sky. It was spellbinding.

He would carry her from her bed to the car and drive from La Palma in California to Mammoth Mountain, five-and-a-half hours away. \n\n\n\"Everybody does hard work for their kid, but I thank my daughter because she achieved the result,\" he added. \"She's a good kid. I tell her to be humble, that this is from hard work, that you weren't born this way.\"Also watching on, amazed by the attention, was Kim's mum.

We definitely have fun with it,\" said Kim, explaining that her Twitter followers have doubled since the Games began. Countless questions were asked: what was she listening to before each run? Lady Gaga at first, for the last two runs she couldn't remember. What would she most like to eat? A burger and fries, or a pizza. \"I don't know what I'm saying right now, but I'm just really happy,\" she added. \"I'm definitely happy with how I was able to handle the pressure. When you work for something for so long and you go home with the best possible outcome is amazing.  \"Today I really did it for my family.\"Thousands on social media have already congratulated the teenager, while her first Twitter post on becoming Olympic champion has received over 25,000 likes.Her coronation complete, more fans will follow during what is expected to be a long reign.",

        "content": "(CNN)A whistleblower has accused the scandal-hit Oxfam charity and its UK regulator of failing to act when told that senior staff paid for prostitutes during the relief operation that followed the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake. Helen Evans, Oxfam's former global head of safeguarding, wrote on Twitter that Oxfam's top management and the UK's Charity Commission failed to act on accusations of sexual abuse on the Caribbean island and in the African nation of Chad.People walk by a collapsed church in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, following the devastating 2010 earthquake.She also said in a television interview Monday evening that she passed on evidence of women being coerced into sex in exchange for humanitarian aid, but no action was taken.In her Twitter statement, Evans, who is a local politician in Oxford, where the charity is based, said a report she compiled in 2014 found 10% of staff reported witnessing or experiencing sexual assault and 7% of staff in one country reporting rape or attempted rape.An hour before she was due to present the report to top management, she says she was told that while the allegations were serious, the charity's leadership felt there was nothing more it could do and the meeting was canceled.  Read MoreMoreover, the senior investigator sent by the charity to Haiti following allegations of misconduct \"misused drugs, defrauded Oxfam and was later imprisoned, inevitably impacting how well the investigation was handled,\" she wrote.My statement following tonight's interview with @cathynewman @Channel4News pic.twitter.com/uGJqpNfkFa\u2014 Councillor Helen Evans (@helentevans) February 12, 2018\n\nShe said she took concerns about inadequate checks being carried out on staff working with young children in Oxfam thrift stores to the Charity Commission but it failed to act. Oxfam says it regrets that it did not act on allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by staff raised by a former manager, \"much quicker and with more resources,\" the charity said on Tuesday.In an interview with CNN affiliate Channel Four News on Monday, Evans said she reported serious allegations in a single email she wrote to her line manager in February 2015. \"There was one of a woman being coerced to have sex in a humanitarian response by another aid worker,\" she said. Evans told of another case \"where a woman had been coerced to have sex in exchange for aid.\"She has since resigned from Oxfam.Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned Monday, saying she took full responsibility for the organization's failure to act. Lawrence was head of the program unit when the accused senior staff members were deployed to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake that killed between 200,000 and 300,000 people.The aid workers -- including the Oxfam country director at the time, Roland van Hauwermeiren -- were accused of turning a villa rented by the organization into a makeshift brothel, with prostitutes wearing only Oxfam T-shirts. Van Hauwermeiren resigned from Oxfam in 2011. He is also accused of paying for sex in Chad where he was Oxfam country director before going to Haiti. Van Hauwermeiren has not commented publicly since the news brooke on Friday. CNN's attempts to reach him have been unsuccessful.In the wake of the scandal, UK Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt promised a crackdown and announced the creation of a special unit and new obligations on charities. \"This unit will be wide-ranging and comprehensive in its remit, looking at safeguarding across UK and international charities, suppliers and the UN and multilateral organizations so that together we can make progress. This will look at how to guard against criminal and predatory individuals being re-employed by charities and abusing again, including the option of establishing a global register of development workers,\" she said. On Tuesday, the President of Haiti strongly condemned Oxfam over its handling of sex abuse allegations. In a Twitter post, Jovenel Moise called the actions an \"extremely serious violation of human dignity.\"\"There is nothing more outrageous and dishonest than a sexual predator who uses his position as part of the humanitarian response to a natural disaster to exploit needy people in their moment of greatest vulnerability,\" he said.The Charity Commission said in a statement it had \"engaged with Oxfam on a formal regulatory basis\" to address Evans' concerns when she contacted them in 2015. It said it also met with her again in 2017 \"and based on this we opened a formal regulatory compliance case with the charity which has been ongoing since that time.\"   The commission opened a statutory inquiry on Monday into how Oxfam handled the allegations of sexual abuse in Haiti in 2011.",

The flight disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Domodedovo Airport in the greater Moscow region Sunday and crashed southeast of the airport in Ramenskoye District. Read MoreOfficials said both of the plane's flight recorders had been recovered but have not given any details of what they have revealed or what the cause of the crash may be.Fragments of the plane were found scattered across snowy terrain.The Antonov An-148 was bound for the Russian city of Orsk near the border with Kazakhstan. There were 65 passengers and six crew onboard, included three children, aged 5, 13 and 17, state news agency RIA Novosti reported.Russian President Vladimir Putin gave \"deep condolences to all those who lost relatives and friends in this disaster,\" his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state media. Officials launch investigation Officials have launched a criminal investigation into the crash and all possible causes are being explored, said the Investigative Committee's Petrenko. Authorities have started questioning Saratov Airlines employees and the Domodedovo Airport workers who prepared the plane for flight.The crew did not report any problems before the plane crashed, according to RIA. Debris was found about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport on Sunday. The cockpit voice recorder was found Monday in \"satisfactory condition,\" an emergency representative said. The other \"black box\" -- the flight data recorder registering details such as speed and altitude -- was recovered on Sunday.The An-148 is a Ukrainian-designed regional jet that was first introduced in 2009. Russian state airline GTK Rossiya, the first carrier to operate the An-148, was sharply critical in 2010 of the model's reliability early on in its service, citing problems with major components like engines and electrical systems, according to Flightglobal.The jet that crashed Sunday was part of the batch of planes that GTK Rossiya had complained about several years ago, according to the 2010 Flightglobal report. There is no indication yet, however, whether the crash was caused by a technical error, human error or a combination of the two.

North Korean Cheerleaders in the stands. #PyeongChang2018 #NorthKorea #Olympics pic.twitter.com/MJWKRjQUff\u2014 Shosh Bedrosian (@sbedrosian9) February 11, 2018\n\nThe song was played at meetings of separated families from North and South Korea in 2010 and 2015.However, other chants were more simplistic in nature.This song (below) seems to be a series of \"la la las\" until the troupe shouts \"one, two, three, go!\" at the end.North Korea's cheerleaders are so mesmerizing!   They're so  in sync \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udfa4\ub180\ub78d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \ud765\ubd84\ud569\ub2c8\uae4c? \u314b\u314b\u314b\uadc0\uc5fd\ub2e4! \ud83e\udd17#WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/s3FarayX0W\u2014 Jo S\u00e9  (\uc870\uc153) (@JAGtv_) February 10, 2018\n\nAnother favorite was \"Whistle,\" which appears to be a popular North Korean pop song.Wait for it.... one of the stranger moments of the night... North Korean Cheerleaders holding masks as they sing \"Whistle\" one of North Korea's most popular songs. #Olympics2018 (Via @Kubik_Kamera) pic.twitter.com/BXACRt27nZ\u2014 Gadi Schwartz (@GadiNBC) February 10, 2018\n\nNorth Korea's cheerleaders are part of a 500-strong delegation attending the PyeongChang Games.South Korean president Moon Jae-in has spoken of using the Winter Olympics to make diplomatic inroads with the North and restore normalized communications, following months of high tensions on the peninsula.READ: Olympic Games preach a 'Games of peace'READ: From one-room home in Ghana to Winter OlympicsCharm offensiveHowever not everyone has been enamored with the attention given to the North Korean choir.US TV presenter Willie Geist tweeted: \"I can report South Koreans here in Pyeongchang are not as enthralled with Kim Yo Jong and the North Korean cheerleaders as it seems some media are back home,\" a reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister who attended the ice hockey match against Switzerland.\"Something about N.K. killing, starving, & imprisoning its people while threatening South Korea with nuclear annihilation,\" added Geist.North Korea remains one of the world's most authoritarian and repressive states.I can report South Koreans here in Pyeongchang are not as enthralled with Kim Yo Jong and the North Korean cheerleaders as it seems some media are back home.Something about N.K. killing, starving, & imprisoning its people while threatening South Korea with nuclear annihilation.\u2014 Willie Geist (@WillieGeist) February 11, 2018\n\nA 2014 UN report stated that the North Korean regime employs murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence, mass starvation and other abuses as tools to prop up the state and terrorize \"the population into submission.\" Other critics are concerned that by focusing on the quirks of the cheerleading squad, the brutality of the North Korean regime may be glossed over.In Seoul Sunday, hundreds of protesters gathered to vent their anger at what they called the \"Pyongyang Games,\" burning North Korean flags and pictures of the country's leader.Others, meanwhile, voiced their frustration at the portrayal of Kim Yo Jong, who also attended the Games' opening ceremony, in the Korean and international media.     \"She (Kim Yo Jong) is not charming, she is a dictator's sister,\" one protester who gave her name only as Laila, told CNN. \"She is not looking after North Korean people. They have people hungry in North Korea.\"  Photos: The moments of the 2018 Winter Olympics -- in drawingsRussia hockey sketchHide Caption 1 of 49 Photos: The moments of the 2018 Winter Olympics -- in

this month that the cheerleaders would likely be monitored wherever they go while in Pyeongchang.They would also be keenly aware of the consequences their family back home would face should they step out of line, she added.\n\n\nHan recalled that she was told not to talk to foreigners, to ignore journalists' questions and not to make eye contact when she went abroad.Instead, they were to take the opportunity to sing the praises of their homeland.\"We were educated that we would be sent to South Korea not only to cheerlead but also to boast about our leader,\" Han recalled. \"We were told that we should take the fight to the heart of our enemies.\"CNN's Sophie Jeong and Paula Hancocks contributed to this report.",
